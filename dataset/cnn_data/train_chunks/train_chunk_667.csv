A rare $4 coin made by the US in a bid to join the 19th century version of the European Union has sold for a staggering $2.5million (£1.6million). The 'Stella' was proposed by American finance chiefs in the hope it would enable the US to join the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), which was mostly made up of European countries. Today, only six of the coins are still in existence - making them some of the most rare and sought-after pieces in the world. Rare: Only six 'Stella' coins are still in existence - making them some of the most rare and sought-after pieces in the world. Above, the coiled hair variety of the $4 coin, designed by George Morgan . The LMU, which was launched in 1865, was a forerunner to the Euro. It included France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Greece, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Romania. At the time, most of the countries' currency was made from gold and silver, and the US was required to produce a coin of the same weight to join the pact. The 'Stella' contained the same amount of precious metal as the LMU's standard gold piece - the 20 Franc Napoleon coin, minted in France, Switzerland and other countries. Two varieties of the coin were made - one with flowing hair, designed by Charles Barber, and the other with coiled hair, designed by George Morgan. The flowing hair design was the most common variety. The coin's reverse star bore the inscriptions 'One Stella' and '400 Cents', while its rim displayed the words 'United States of America' and 'Four Dol'. Only 425 of the coins were made before the bid was finally scrapped by the US government two years later. Paul Song, director of rare coins and medals at Bonhams in Los Angeles, said he was 'delighted' at the sale of the $4 coin. He said: 'I am stunned and delighted. The sale proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that superb quality and great rarity are a magical mix.' The LMU was disbanded in 1927 after some countries made coins with inadequate amounts of . silver and gold - resulting in them being exchanged for coins from elsewhere that . had been minted correctly.","The rare 'Stella' coin has sold for $2.5million (£1.6million)

It looked like Prince Harry's hands were wandering as he chatted with a top charity official last night. The royal was at an event to promote MapAction, which helps co-ordinate relief efforts in disaster areas as he watched a team responding to a mock earthquake . He praised the 'extraordinary' volunteers of a humanitarian emergency response organisation as he was spirited to the heart of a devastating earthquake. But it appeared he was making a slightly suspicious gesture as he chatted to the organisation's chief executive Liz Hughes. Scroll down for video... Careful there Harry! The Prince made a suspect gesture as he chats to chief executive Liz Hughes (right) at a reception for MapAction at the Royal Society, London . Harry spoke of his pride at being patron of MapAction which helps co-ordinate relief efforts in disaster areas as he watched a team responding to a mock earthquake. The royal looked on intently as a small team of three MapAction volunteers battled to cope with the natural disaster inside a canvas field tent complete with satellite phones, first aid kits and dozens of maps. MapAction, which is based near High Wycombe, Bucks., produces maps highlighting not only the geography of an area but where need is greatest and the locations for vital humanitarian aid. The organisation has successfully deployed to more than 40 emergency missions since its service was launched over 10 years, helping millions of people affected by disaster. Speaking to potential MapAction donors and existing financial supporters and helpers at the Royal Society in London Harry said he had met volunteers. Patron: Prince Harry, centre, with Chief Executive, Liz Hughes, right, and Chairman of Trustees, Roy Wood, at a reception for MapAction at the Royal Society, in central London . He said: 'I was struck by their willingness to drop everything at a moment's notice - despite the fact I'd do that in my job anytime - and step into the heart of the crisis no matter where it is in the world, leaving loved ones behind.' He added: 'And to do this knowing that very few people will have any idea what contribution they have made. They are extraordinary people and this is an extraordinary organisation.' The mock earthquake was based on the organisation's efforts in Haiti whose capital Port-au-Prince was devastated by a natural disaster in 2010. Proud: Prince Harry has praised the 'extraordinary' volunteers of a humanitarian emergency response organisation . During the scenario Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey who was part of the MapAction team sent to Haiti, told the audience: 'We've got some text messages from people trapped in the rubble, we're putting the locations into the maps and sending out teams.' This was based on real events from Port-au-Prince as texts were used to track down survivors. MapAction has been working in Syria since December to map the needs of affected communities and co-ordinate humanitarian efforts to ensure those most in need receive help first.And last week two members of its team flew to the Sudan where weeks of heavy rains triggered flash floods in August. The Royal called MapAction 'Extraordinary people and this is an extraordinary organisation' Dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands have been affected by the disaster which hit the area around the capital Khartoum. Harry told his audience: 'The maxim 'who, what, why, when and where' is common to many organisations and across many different situations for a very reason. 'Without this information it's just not possible to make effective decisions. In the context of a natural disaster it is of course vital to make decisions quickly in order to save lives and protect those who may still be in danger. 'MapAction's ability to have experts on the ground within hours, collating this information in support of decision makers, has placed them at the very heart of international response efforts over the last 10 to 11 years.'","Royal made poor choice of hand gestures as he chatted to chief executive .

Two men have been arrested after allegedly using an application on their phone to mimic a police car. Michael Railly, 28, and Joshua Robert Sossamon were stopped in Oklahoma City by undercover officers on Wednesday. The policemen say they watched as the pair used an app on their mobile to impersonate a police car and tried pull over a motorcyclist. Michael Railly (left) is accused of using his phone to impersonate a police car, while his friend Joshua Sossamon says suggestions they were trying to pull over a motorcyclist are 'absurd' Railly, who was driving, was charged with impersonating a police vehicle, assault and battery of a police officer, driving under the influence of alcohol, speeding and having no state driver's license, according to reports on NewsOK. Speaking to Koco News, Sergeant Gary Knight, of Oklahoma City Police Department, said: 'In this day and age there are so many ways people can skirt the law, and there are so many things that cellphones are capable of now, that it really doesn't suprise me to see it.' While it is not illegal to own one of the many police siren apps, it is illegal to use them to impersonate a police car. Police say an app like this one was used. Though illegal to download, it is illegal to use one to imitate police . Oklahoma state law prohibits the use of red and blue lights at the front of a vehicle by anything other than law enforcement or wrecker services. However Sossamon, who was riding in the passenger seat, has defended their actions and accused the arresting officers of using excessive force. He said: 'I remember there being a motorcycle that was turning left in front of us. Apparently, he supposedly had the app on at that time. We weren't trying to pull anyone over. That's absurd.' 'They very forcefully pulled him from the car. Keep in . mind he is handcuffed. They threw him to the ground in front of me. 'They . hog-tied him, and then, because he was still being belligerent, they . sprayed him in the face while he was hog-tied, because he was still . speaking. 'They sprayed him in the face with Mace, and then threw him . back in the car.' The officers claim that Railly was thrashing about in the police car following his arrest when he kicked one of the policemen who asked him to calm down, before placing him in restraints.

A one-month-old piglet called Yoda miraculously avoided the slaughterhouse and has found a new home in an animal sanctuary in Canada. Yoda escaped his fate on the dinner plate when he fell off a truck that was taking him and other piglets to be readied for their eventual demise. The animal had suffered scrapes and bruises from the fall, but was in good overall physical health. Brenda Bronfman, the founder of Wishing Well Sanctuary in Bradford, Ontario, Yoda’s new home, said the pig was ‘emotionally traumatised’ from the experience. Lucky: Yoda the pig fell of a truck heading for the slaughterhouse and survived. Now he's living in an animal sanctuary in Ontario, Canada . New life: Yoda, not pictured, was being transported to the slaughterhouse with a truckload of other pigs but his fall saved his life . Second chance: Yoda did not end up at the slaughterhouse like his unfortunate fellow pigs . ‘Being in the truck with all the pigs that were on their way to a finishing barn, which is where they fatten them up prior to going to the slaughterhouse,’ Bronfman told ABC News. ‘He got very lucky by falling out, that's for sure,’ she said. People who were following the trailer that was carrying the pigs ‘saw the piglet sneak through a hole and fall off the trailer’, said Joyce Kemp, the Quebec provincial police spokeswoman. The CBC said police found the pig wandering on a highway on September 18. Bronfman said she first learned about the piglet when an animal control officer in Quebec sent her an email describing the animal's plight. Even though the sanctuary was full, Bronfman consulted with her board and several people pitched in to drive the pig from Quebec to Ontario. ‘We just couldn't let this little piglet either suffer or not find a home,’ she said. ‘After all that he'd been through, we wanted to make sure that he had a loving home.’ Lots of love: Brenda Bronfman, the founder of Wishing Well Sanctuary in Bradford, Ontario, says Yoda will be loved in his new home . The piglet has taken to his new surroundings and interacts well with his caregivers. ‘He's just adorable,' said Bronfman. ‘He'll fall asleep in your lap. He just loves to play and cuddle,’ she said. ‘He loves to give kisses, too, and he likes to get kisses on the tip of his snout.’ And the reason for his Star Wars-inspired name? ‘He seems to have wisdom and he's a little fighter. Plus, his ears kind of look a little Yoda-ish.’ Now about six weeks old, Yoda weighs 15 pounds, Bronfman said. But when he's fully grown, he'll be much bigger. ‘He's come all this way [and] he will be loved forever’.","Yoda the pig was on his way to get slaughtered when he fell off the truck .

The vegan strip club where Cory Booker's Twitter friend works has jumped on their new-found publicity by adding a new sandwich to their menu. Casa Diablo has added the veggie 'Booker Burger' to their menu of meat-free offerings, noting how they add extra mayo to the sandwich 'since he's the 'mayo'-r of Newark'. The newfound connection between Booker, who is running to fill New Jersey's empty Senate seat, and the unique strip club on the other side of the country in Portland, Oregon was revealed when Buzzfeed released the private conversation between the 44-year-old Democrat and a stripper. Raising her profile: Lynsie Lee (left) released a screen shot of the private exchanges she had with Newark Mayor Cory Booker (right) and now her strip club has named a sandwich in his honor . The woman, Lynsie Lee, sent the site a screen grab of their virtual flirtations on Wednesday and both parties have been downplaying their relationship as innocent. That hasn't stopped the strip club from seizing the opportunity to cash in on the publicity. The New York Post reports that the dinner special listed outside the club on Thursday read 'Booker Burger, with a side of Lynsie Lee thighs!' The vegan approach to adult entertainment means that the performers and patrons are asked not to wear fur, leather, or any animal products inside or on stage. The rest of their menu is similarly tongue-in-cheek as they sell 'drunk bread' which is described as 'whatever bread we have toasted into Garlic Bread because you're drunk & need cheap food'. Unique: Johnny Diablo Zukle is the owner of the vegan strip club where Lee works . Rules: Though Lee is not a vegan herself, the strip club takes an ethical stance against animal abuse . Johnny Diablo, the owner of the strip club, was not the only one who knew that business would be booming following the political publicity. 'If you come to see me at @CasaDiablo tonight, bring your wallets. I'm prime meat for the next couple of days! ;)' she wrote to her thousands of new Twitter followers. She has given a number of interviews since releasing the screen shot, each time defending the Newark mayor and admitting that she has a crush on him. ''I flirted with him publically, as I do with a lot of people,' Lee said about Booker. 'There was nothing secret or sexy about it,' she told The Associated Press, calling their exchange G-rated. Special sandwich: Diablo added the 'Booker Burger' Thursday night and noted that it had extra mayo since Booker is the 'mayo-R' of Newark . Lynsie Lee tweeted this screen shot of a private message with Booker after a woman tweeted that she and Booker, who is running for Senate, often privately message each other . Innocent: Lynsie Lee (pictured) says that her conversations with Booker were 'G-rated' The two started conversing online after they both appeared in a documentary about Twitter- the social media site that Booker has been using actively for much of his career to communicate with constituents and fans like Lee. She sent him a public message saying that the West Coast loved the New Jersey politician, and he responded in a private message, writing: 'and the East Coast love you and by the East Coast, I mean me.' 'Well now I'm blushing :),' she wrote. 'It’s only fair,' Booker responded. After dismissing the exchange during a press conference on Thursday, Booker said that the unusual food choices at the strip club is the real root of the public fascination over the story. 'I really think it's because the press corps is obsessed with vegan living,' he said.","The Portland, Oregon strip club is serving a veggie 'Booker burger' that has 'extra mayo since he's the 'mayo'-r of Newark'

Wolf says she received an anonymous email from someone early last spring, now believed to be Abrahams, claiming to have taken nude photographs of her using her own webcam. Now that footage of Abraham's arrest has circulated in the press Wolf, 19, feels that 'Its weird for me to be able to put a face to the person who did this to me,' she told Today anchor Savannah Guthrie. Scroll down for video . Airing the truth: Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf sat down with the Today Show to express her 'mixed emotions' surrounding the sextortion suspect's arrest . Abrahams, 19, attended High School with Wolf in California. Wolf told Guthrie that she 'never had . any interactions with him. I went to a very big high school but I knew . of him, I knew of his name, I saw him in the hallways.' She finds herself, 'relieved, glad that they were able to find who the person is, but on the other hand it was someone I went to high school with. He he is young, my age, and I just think it's sad that he chose to do this and has now put himself in this big dilemma.' Wolf, who was crowned Miss U.S.A. in . August after winning Miss California Teen, says that she was extorted by a hacker who threatened to go public with images unless she sent him more naked pictures, videos or logged in to Skype for five minutes and gave him a 'special performance' Abrahams is accused of cyber crimes and investigators who have been probing the teen since . March said more than a dozen other victims had been identified. According to the Los Angeles Times, . an FBI affidavit alleges Abrahams threatened to transform one victim's . 'dream of being a model... into (her being) a porn star' if she didn't . do what he said. It's not clear whether this was Wolf as the affidavit . does not name the victims.

Bail posted: Jared James Abrahams appears Thursday outside of Santa Ana, CA., court after posting $50,000 bail for his release - screen grab courtesy of NBC Los Angeles . Wolf says that she has 'mixed emotions' surrounding Abrahams's arrest. She says that she feels badly for him. 'I . don’t think he realized the consequences [to the things] that he's . done. He terrorized me and many other girls for so long.' Abrahams, who reportedly confessed to . FBI officials, has now been released on $50,000 bail and remains under . house arrest under the condition that he not use the Internet. His . arrest follows a raid of the Abrahams's home in June when FBI agents . seized computers, cell phones and hacking software, according to court . records. The newly crown Miss Teen USA came forward in August with new details of the shocking cyber ordeal. The college freshman said she was speaking out . against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach . other young women to be careful. 'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my . mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a . very terrifying moment.' Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.' 'You . would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this . guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.' These . were the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience . since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was . crowned. But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title. Sextortion: Wolf says the stalker used an anonymous email address and demanded sexual favors or else he'd release nude photos of her to the press . Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . 'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.' Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police. The FBI quickly took over the case. The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime. 'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.' Speaking to Today.com, . Wolf initially revealed the crime just after she beat 51 other young . women to take the Miss Teen USA title at a pageant in the . Bahamas. 'I was just a normal girl in high . school,' she said. Around five months ago, she was notified that someone had tried to log into her Facebook account from a different state. She then received an anonymous email from a stranger saying he had photographs of her in her room that were taken when her computer's webcam was hacked. Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . 'I wasn't aware that somebody was . watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera] . didn't even go on, so I had no idea.' She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'. She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked. 'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox. After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes. During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others. 'This next year I'm just so excited to be able to share my story . and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said. Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used. Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year. She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant in August after just two years of competing in contests.","Miss Teen USA sat down for a new Today Show interview on Friday to discuss her feeling surrounding the suspect's arrest .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 27 September 2013 . House Speaker John Boehner has been pushing a hard line on a stalemate in order to win a one-year delay on Obamacare, an aide to one of his colleagues told MailOnline exclusively . Republicans in the House of Representatives have been demanding a complete defunding of the Obamacare law in order to set up the White House for a one-year implementation delay and a 2014 electoral showdown, an aide to a senior Republican congressman has told MailOnline. The Senate passed its first major procedural hurdle with ease on Friday, with a 79-19 vote to end debate, in which more than half of Republicans joined with Democrats. Two more votes, both strictly along party lines, amended a House budget resolution to strip language defunding Obamacare, and then to approve the resolution itself. The GOP's political calculations are clear: Forcing Democrats to delay the Affordable Care Act's enforcement for 12 months would shift the current national anxieties about health insurance to this time next year – just weeks before the crucial 2014 congressional elections. 'Look,' said the House aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, 'you have to understand that we've been working for the delay from the beginning. There's no way the White House was going to agree to killing the funding, but if we led with a demand for a one-year ""time out,"" we couldn't have gotten that.' 'It's like every negotiation in business, in politics, in sports salary arbitration: You make an unreasonable demand because you really want something more reasonable.' 'This is what the conference meetings have really been about.' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called a 12:30 p.m. vote on an amendment to the House's budget resolution, stripping the language that killed funding for the president's national health insurance overhaul. Democrats easily passed their first a procedural hurdle, collecting 79 votes for a motion to close debate on the measure. They needed only 60. No negotiations: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney and President Obama have both said that they're unwilling to bend on Obamacare's funding, but the GOP is banking on a middle ground . U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (L) and Senator Chuck Schumer are raising fears about a government shutdown that wouldn't affect the military, social security, or other essential services . Now that the Senate resolution has officially passed, the House will have the ball in its court with precious few days left to act until the Oct. 1 beginning of the government's next fiscal year. That's when negotiations will start. White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer compared Republicans to mobsters and arsonists, insisting that holding the budget 'hostage' won't meet with success . House Speaker John Boehner told reporters after a Republican Conference meeting on Thursday that his chamber won't vote on the bill again if the Senate sends it back with the Obamacare funding restored. And, he said, a short-term spending resolution that takes the health care issue temporarily off the table also isn't in the cards. 'I do not see that happening,' Boehner said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor insisted, meanwhile, that Democrats should be willing to negotiation, and perhaps meet the GOP halfway. 'We call on the president to sit down with us – Harry Reid to sit down with us – and let’s resolve this problem,' he said. Republicans, said the Capitol Hill aide who spoke with MailOnline, will try to convince the Obama administration that a one-year delay is in everyone's interests since it would give the White House time to work out the kinks in Obamacare's implementation. But the GOP would also gain political leverage, denying Obama's team the change to fix those problems in time to demonstrate to a wary public before the 2014 midterm elections that all is well. Republicans' short-term leverage is the threat of a government shutdown if a budget deal isn't reached by midnight as Monday turns to Tuesday. But the White House has projected a defiant image, sending advisers out to insist that there will be no room for a bargain. Dan Pfeiffer, the White House . communications director, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday that the . administration is not in favor of 'negotiating with people with a bomb . strapped to their chest. We're not going to do that.' 'Republicans . are not asking for a negotiation,"" he said. 'It's a negotiation if I'm . trying to sell you my house, and we are debating the price of it. It's . not a negotiation if I show up at your house and say, ""Give me . everything inside or I'm going to burn it down.""' Sen. Harkin claimed that 'we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now, every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War' A tea party-led backlash against Obamacare's encroachment on freedom of choice in the health care marketplace has catapulted Obama's signature legislative achievement back into the headlines . Spokespersons for the White House and House Speaker John Boehner did not respond to requests for comment. But Obama hinted on Sept. 24 during a Democratic Party fundraiser in New York City that the 2014 elections are a critical piece of the puzzle for a White House that misses the monopoly it held in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives. Obama told party faithful that he is 'going to be working as hard as I can to make sure that we have a Congress that is able in my last two years as President to get as much done as we got done in our first two years.' Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin complained Friday morning on the Senate floor that tea party-linked Republicans have turned Congress into an unusually acrimonious bunch, blaming 'a small group of willful men and women who have a certain ideology.' 'Since they can't get their way, they're going to create this confusion and discourse,' he said, 'and hope that the public will be so mixed up in who is to blame for this, that they'll blame both sides.' 'It's very dangerous,' Harkin insisted. 'I believe ... we are at one of the most dangerous points in our history right now. Every bit as dangerous as the break-up of the Union before the Civil War.'","The Senate passed a 'cloture' motion and then approved a single amendment to a House budget resolution along strict party lines, fending off tea partiers who sought to defund Obamacare .
The House will now have a 'clean' funding bill to consider, hoping that it won't be the one kneeling on the football when the clock expires .
The government faces a partial shutdown Monday at midnight if Democrats and Republicans can't agree on a budget 'continuing resolution'

'The bone-chilling allegations in today’s indictment read like they were ripped from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel.' Hunter allegedly enlisted the services of a former German army sniper Dennis Gogel and fellow US veteran Timothy Vamvakias after searching through online resumes when he was offered the 'job' to kill the DEA agent. Hunter recruited several ex-soldiers in late 2012 and early . this year to be a security team for drug traffickers, said the indictment. According to the court papers, the DEA's sources promised Hunter at a March . meeting in an Asian country that his security team would be protecting . thousands of kilos of marijuana and would be seeing ""tons of cocaine and . millions of dollars."" Mr Bharara said the activities of Hunter could have been ripped straight from the pages of a Tom Clancy novel .

He . boasted that his men could handle both jobs, the prosecutor said, adding that . ""from there, it was off to the races."" The indictment said a DEA source posing as a drug trafficker in May proposed to the snipers that they kill a DEA agent and a boat captain providing information to U.S. law enforcement authorities, saying it was necessary because there was a ""leak"" within the narcotics trafficking organization. In an email exchange, Hunter responded: ""My guys will handle it. ... Are you talking about both the captain and agent or just the captain?"" according to the indictment. They ordered submachine guns, pistols, and sophisticated latex masks and shipped them to Africa in preparation for the hit. The arrests occurred in Phuket, but authorities say Hunter and his gang ranged all over Southeast Asia trafficking drugs . But the DEA intercepted Gogel and Vamvakias in Africa before organising the arrest of Hunter this week. Thai . police said the DEA contacted Thai authorities several months ago to . say that Hunter was believed to be hiding in Phuket, where he had rented . a house. Another former German sniper and a Polish counter-terror expert were also arrested this week and will be extradited to the US. Derek Maltz, special agent in charge of the DEA Special . Operations Division, said the snipers were caught by agents dedicated to . ""outwit them, outwork them, outsmart them and put them out of . business.""

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 19:34 EST, 26 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:14 EST, 27 September 2013 . It was a sordid affair by any measure of the imagination. Teresa Stone dreamed of running away with her pastor lover, armed with as much as $800,000 in life insurance payouts she imagined they would get after they killed her former Marine husband. Instead, Stone is serving eight years in prison for conspiring to murder Randy Stone, the father of her two children - and the man she called 'Brother Love' is serving a life sentence for shooting his best friend with his own gun at his office in Independence, Missouri. Betrayal: Teresa Stone conspired to kill her husband of 19-years, Randy Stone (right) after she dreamed of running away with her pastor lover, who was Randy's best friend and confidant . A new investigation by ABC's 20/20 has revealed the sheer levels of treachery and betrayal that Stone and Pastor David Love went to in order to not only murder her husband of 19-years, but also to try and cover their involvement up. 'Her lover was her hit man,' said Tammy Dickinson, assistant Jackson in the aftermath of her sentence in June last year. 'She wanted a perfect life with David Love, no matter the cost.' Leaving her children Michael and Miranda orphaned by her incarceration, the Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Marco Roldan issued the most severe sentence he could. Murderer: David Love (left) killed his best friend Randy Stone with his friends own gun and even gave the eulogy at his funeral in front of his lover Teresa Stone . He noted that Stone schemed with New Hope Baptist Church minister David Love to commit the March 31st, 2010 shooting of Randy Stone, gave him acces to her husband's gun collection, thought she would get his life insurance and then - horrifically - allowed Love to preside over her husband's funeral. The court heard that Stone had allegedly fallen pregnant, despite the fact that her devoted husband had undergone a vasectomy years before. And in shocking evidence presented during the trial of David Love, the jury heard how killing Randy Stone was only the first part of the jigsaw and that Love wanted to murder his wife too. Randy Stone was a religious man, and owned an insurance business along with his wife of nearly 20-years, Teresa. They had been childhood sweethearts, but lost touch when Randy joined the marines only to marry when he returned from his service. On the last day of March in 2010, Teresa called 911 to report that Randy, 42, had been shot and killed in his office. Investigators discovered no sign of a struggle and $100 was on his deak. Childhood sweethearts: Teresa and Randy Stone had been married for 20 years when he was allegedly shot dead by David Love in March last year . They came to the conclusion that this was not a robbey gone wrong, but a murder. At Randy' funeral hundreds of people came to show their respects to the popular pillar of the community and listened to David Love give his eulogy. 'We weep not just because of the separation of our loved one but because of the questions that death brings,' Love can be heard saying during a police recording of his eulogy for Randy. 'Questions like why, why him? Why now?' Indeed, police were at the funeral because they suspected that the killer knew Randy and would be in attendance. It was during this initial investigation that police discovered the vital clue which would unravel the tightly constructed alibis that Love and Stone had created for themselves. 'One of our people went through … a trash canister next to Teresa Stone's office desk, and there was ... a one-page letter that had been torn up in multiple pieces,' Detective Keith Rosewaren told 20/20. The letter was pieced together as a happy birthday or love letter and contained the phrase, 'Happy Birthday Love. I am not in control of things yet but when we are fully together your birthday will always be exciting.' Teresa Stone, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy to commit murder in the March 2010 shooting death of Randy Stone of Independence. Stone entered the plea with the understanding that her maximum sentence would be 8 years . The letter was not in Randy Stone's handwriting and they brought Teresa in for questioning but she provided them with a concrete alibi complete with exact times and receipts from the Sonic drive-thru restaurant she went to. 'No one who wasn't preparing for that, would be able to recite their whereabouts down to the minute… the way Teresa Stone did,' Molly Hastings, David Love's attorney told 20/20. However, when detectives asked Teresa about the torn up note they found in her trashcan, she didn't have an answer. Police left Teresa alone in the interrogation room, where their camera recorded her saying, 'Oh great. I forgot about that.' This sparked investigators into action and it was revealed that Teresa Stone had in fact been involved in a 10-year affair with Love. In evidence presented at their trials, it was shown that in emails from January 2010, Stone and Love were talking of marriage. And it was claimed that in February, Love bought her a ring. It was around this time that they began to plot the deaths of their respective husband and wife and detective Keith Rosewarren told the court that after Love shot Randy Stone he was going to kill his wife by breaking her neck and staging a car accident to disguise her death. Sad: Randy Stone was the childhood sweetheart of Teresa Stone and was married to her for 19 years and had two children . In addition to the letter, investigators had found a .40 caliber shell casing which they later matched to an eastern Jackson County farm where Stone liked to practice shooting. This led them to conclude that he had been killed with his own firearm. A friend of Randy's, Robert Davis told investigators that he remembered Teresa coming to visit him the night of her husband's death. She appeared calm and collected and only wanted to know about how to collect her husband's life insurance policy. Davis found it odd: 'It wasn't even 24 hours after Randy had been killed,' he said. Police came to the conclusion that Teresa Stone and David Love were having an affair and wanted to kill Randy to collect his life insurance. Little did they know that Stone had left all his money to his two children in his will. However, detectives pressed Stone on the affair they believed she was having with Love. 'Yes we had sex,' she admitted and caved, telling police that her 'Brother Love' had shot her husband. Love was arrested, but refused to admit he killed his best friend. However, Teresa Stone told police that Love, ' walked in the office and he just aimed and he didn't look'. In November, 2011, Love took a plea deal for second degree murder. He is currently serving a life sentence and will only be eligible for parole in 2036. Teresa, was indicted for conspiracy to commit murder, and also took a plea deal to have charges reduced, but had to acknowledge her role in the crime. She was sentenced to eight years in prison.","Teresa Stone, 40, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder .

Three days after claiming she was down to her last £200, it was revealed today that former Apprentice winner Stella English has a property portfolio worth £1million and pays a firm up to £1,000 a week to manage her public relations. The mother-of-two this week said she was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages. Miss English, 34, said just three years after she found fame on the BBC1 show, she could lose one of her homes and her marriage had collapsed. Scroll down for video . Former Apprentice winner Stella English said she had fallen into poverty at a tribunal this week. It has now been reported she spends up to £4,000 a month on PR . It has now been reported she pays PR firm Big Talent Group up to £4,000 a month and owns two flats and a house in South London worth £1million, according to The Mirror. The paper reported Land Registry deeds revealed Miss English bought the first flat in 2005 for £250,000 and the second for £245,000 in 2007. Both were expected to be worth more now. Senior talent agent Terry Mills, of Big Talent Group, declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today. Lord Sugar had been seeking to recover £35,000 after Miss English lost her constructive dismissal case against him earlier this year. Miss English wept earlier this week when an East London Tribunal Service panel ruled that she should not have to repay any of the money. At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham. Miss English said she had fallen into poverty and was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages . Recently, she claimed she was making . double that amount from new business ventures, including a fashion label . and an events company. But at the hearing this week it emerged that the mother of two has not worked since July and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance. She said that she worked at Citigroup until July, earning £500 a day, but her contract with the banking giant had ended. She is also facing the prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case. Miss English told the tribunal that she now only has around £200 in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for her son. At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham . ‘I cannot afford to feed my kids let alone pay the mortgage – that doesn’t even matter any more,’ she said. ‘It is my son’s birthday today but I can’t afford to buy him anything because everything we have goes on trying to survive. ‘A couple of weeks ago I made an application for housing benefit and there is an interview set up. I have no choice. 'Unless I find a contract I will not be able to support my family any more, I am losing close to 3k a month.’ Lawyers for 66-year-old Lord Sugar insisted Miss English brought the original legal action against him simply because she was ‘bored’ with her day job and missed the glamour of appearing on television. But tribunal judge George Foxwell rejected his application to recover some of his costs, saying that Miss English truly believed she had a case.","Stella English said she had fallen into poverty at tribunal this week .

Christie was asked about the comments that the younger McCain made about him in a recent CNN interview and he brushed them away, saying that they meant nothing to him. 'People I have respect for, who critique me, I respond to... but I'm not going to respond to somebody just because of their last name,' he said during a radio interview.

'If John McCain wants to say something to me, happy to respond to something John McCain says. Meghan McCain has no standing to be critiquing me, other than as a citizen, and as a citizen since she doesn't live in New Jersey, I'm not responding to her critique,' Christie said to NJ101.5. 'It's so ridiculous and sophomoric that I have no response to Meghan McCain.' She was interviewed by Piers Morgan on Tuesday and weighed in on the prospective field of Republican presidential candidates for 2016. Famous name: Meghan was a regular on the 2008 campaign trail with her father when he was running for president . Too close for comfort: McCain said that he spoke about himself too much in the National Convention speech, while others have had problems with his closeness to Democrats like Cory Booker (seen here together on Wednesday) 'I used to love Chris Christie, I'm kind of done with Chris Christie right now,' the 28-year-old said. Her biggest point of concern appears to be his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention where he was criticized for failing to talk at length about then-candidate Mitt Romney. '(Christie) just talked about himself the entire time and I think politicians obviously there's some level of self-promotion that you have to do, but I would like the next leader of the Republican Party and the next nominee to maybe be a little more interested in helping the country than just their platform,' she said during the CNN interview. She said that she was talking about the frontrunners with her father's former campaign manager during his recent 77th birthday party and the unidentified aide suggested she support Jeb Bush, the brother of the younger President Bush and the former governor of Florida.

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 09:49 EST, 27 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:21 EST, 27 September 2013 . Trial: Prolific burglar Carl Anderson, 50, who has been jailed for 12 years at Birmingham Crown Court . A prolific burglar who used his car as a weapon to slam a police officer into a lamppost in a desperate attempt to escape has been jailed for 12 years. Carl Anderson, 50, reversed his car across a road at up to 35mph, engine screaming and tyres screeching, as Pc Peter McGinn clung to the driver’s side door trying to grab the keys. Judge Melbourne Inman QC, sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, told Anderson: ‘You deliberately reversed the car at speed such that the open door was smashed against a lamppost with such force it broke the hinges and folded the door back against the car. ‘Between that door and the lamppost was Pc McGinn.’ Anderson, who had previously admitted grievous bodily harm with intent to wound, dangerous driving, driving without insurance and burglary also pleaded guilty to driving while being disqualified as he was banned from the wheel at the time of the offence. His victim Pc McGinn, who attended court, was left with a shattered left leg, under-going lengthy surgery to pin and repair his broken bones following the smash. He has been left in constant agony and needed crutches to get to today’s hearing. Robert Price, prosecuting, said the incident happened after Anderson had been spotted in the back garden of a house in Erdington in the city on the afternoon of Friday, June 7, breaking in to a shed. The police were called and officers in a marked police car spotted Anderson getting in a car in nearby Compton Road a short while after. He said: ‘Pc McGinn immediately jumped out of the police car, and opened the driver’s door shouting to Mr Anderson: ‘police, get out now’.’ However, Anderson responded by turning the keys in the ignition, despite a struggle from Pc McGinn, and stamped ‘heavily on the accelerator’. Witnesses, including other officers who had arrived on the scene, described the car’s engine ‘screaming’ and its tyres ‘screeching’ as it ‘arced across the road towards a lamppost’ said Mr Price. As the Honda Stream shot across the road towards the lamppost, 44-year-old Pc McGinn clung with one hand to Anderson’s shoulder, desperately trying to run in time with the car’s motion ‘while struggling to stop the vehicle’. Desperate: Still image of Carl Anderson driving a blue Honda Stream trying to make his getaway from police both on foot and in a van in Erdington . Getaway: After turning round the car Anderson speeds off back the way he came . Injured: PC Pete McGinn (centre), who was crushed by the car of Carl Anderson, leaves Birmingham Crown Court . He described Anderson looking ‘steely and determined’ as he accelerated. However, despite the officer’s efforts the car slammed into the post with such force another policeman watching the unfolding incident believed his colleague had been killed. Pc McGinn’s left leg took the brunt of the impact and was crushed - a moment he described as causing ‘immediate and excruciating pain’ according to Mr Price. As he lay injured, Anderson drove off up the street, forcing another police officer to jump aside, then dodged a riot van which attempted to ram his car in order to stop his escape. In nearby Minstead Road, another patrol car had to swerve away ‘to avoid a head-on collision’ Mr Price said. Anderson later abandoned his damaged car and got away on foot, but was later traced from evidence left at the scene to his home and arrested. He refused to co-operate with police or be formally interviewed following detention. Mr Price said Anderson had ‘used his car as a weapon’ and ‘deliberately targeted his victim’. In mitigation, Sharon Bailey said her client had gone out to steal that day because ‘he needed money because his gas and electric had run out’. On duty: PC McGinn was responding to reports of a break-in when he challenged Anderson . Although her client had a ‘lengthy record of offending’ he had never previously committed a crime of this nature she said, and when confronted with what had happened that day he simply ‘panicked’. Ms Bailey said, at the time, Anderson was voluntarily co-operating with the police’s offender management team, which works with prolific offenders at high risk of re-offending to try to keep them out of trouble. ‘He had agreed to be tagged and had been provided with a mobile phone to be able to keep in touch. ‘He had also been driven around by police, so he could point out where he had carried out offences which pre-dated this incident,’ she said. As Ms Bailey presented her mitigation, Anderson sat in the dock wearing a grey shirt and dabbed tears from his eyes with tissue. Pc McGinn, in an impact statement read to the court, said his life had been shattered by the incident. The crash has placed a heavy burden on his wife, who works full-time and also helps care for their disabled daughter, and he is unable to wash or dress unaided. Pc McGinn said the long-term impact on his health could not be predicted but he had suffered nerve and tendon damage, and had only 50% movement in his left knee, with further surgery likely. He has been taking blood-thinning medication to clear potentially life-threatening clots from forming while there is an increased risk of arthritis developing. Despite this, the officer said it was his wish to return to the force ‘which he loves’ and where he has served 11 years. Even with treatment and physiotherapy, he said recovery could take up to two years. Judge Inman, passing sentence, told Anderson: ‘The reality, of course, is that the genesis of all of that happened on that day was because you were out doing what you do - burgling people. ‘It is plain you used your vehicle as a weapon, quite deliberately, and caused very serious injury. ‘You were driving while banned, having previously been convicted of driving dangerously before, and in addition there is the aggravating factor of Pc McGinn’s injuries.’ He sentenced Anderson to 12 years in jail for GBH, and further imposed concurrent sentences of two years for burglary, 18 months for dangerous driving and four months for driving while disqualified. Anderson was also banned from driving for a further nine years, while there was no separate penalty for driving without insurance. The judge took 12 other offences - nine of house burglary and three shed burglaries - into consideration.","Carl Anderson, 50, reversed his car across the road at up to 35mph as Pc Peter McGuinn clung on .

A mystery graffiti artist has been making 'No Entry' signs a little more accessible - by adding their own flourishes to the plain red and white design. In St Austell, Cornwall, and in London, the silhouette of a man has been painted on in a series of comedy poses - and brightening up the view for passers-by. In one picture, the man has his hands and head put through holes in the white bar, as if he were in the stocks. Laughing stocks: The silhouette of a man being pilloried was painted onto this 'No Entry' sign along Battersea Bridge Road in south west London . In another, the man cuts the white bar in half with a saw like a carpenter sawing a plank of wood. A third shows the silhouette of a man carrying the bar under his arm as he walks along the roundel of the sign. And yet another example takes a romantic turn, as the stick man hugs the white bar - complete with little red hearts to match the red background. No one has any idea as to the identity of the artist, or why he might have made the additions to the signs. The artist known as Banksy is the best-known 'underground' graffiti artist, whose works can be found in London, Bristol and across the world - and like the 'No Entry' artist, his real identity is still unconfirmed. Many stealth graffiti artists often take their inspiration from 'Blek le Rat' - real name Xavier Prou - who began stenciling images including rats and ballerinas on the walls of Paris in the 1980s, and who is credited as being one of the first graffiti artists to be recognised as more than simply a vandal. Cutting edge: Another sign on Battersea Bridge Road shows the black stick man sawing the white stop bar in half . Heavy lifting: A silhouette of a man in St Agnes in Cornwall lugs the stop bar across the red background of the sign in this artistic piece of vandalism . Graffiti 'art' is still a subject of controversy. In 2009, a Banksy work parodying the Royal Family was partially removed from a wall in Hackney, east London, after the council served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the property owner. But there have as yet been no suggestions that these new installations will be removed. And while the stop signs are nowhere near as widespread or as highly regarded as Banksy and le Rat's creations, passers-by who have spotted them admit they have given them a reason to smile. One . Cornish local said: 'It's highly amusing. Those sort of signs are . things you see dozens of times a day, and, to be honest, they're pretty . boring to look at.' The silhouette signs have received rave reviews on Twitter. Shaun Byrne wrote: 'Best sign art ever.' Robert Wallace tweeted: 'Very cool designer - No-Entry sign in St Agnes.' Stop signs are red...

Child's play: Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond holds up a child's drawing on a visit to a childcare centre in Edinburgh, with deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon looking on . Blow: A survey to mark a year to go until the independence referendum shows just 27 per cent of people back First Minister Alex Salmond's bid for Scotland to leave the UK . As the SNP's arguments for the break-up of Britain crumble, only 27 per cent of Scots now believe Scotland should go it alone. And amid growing concerns about the impact of a Yes vote on jobs, pensions and trade, a massive 59 per cent are planning to vote No on September 18, 2014. Respected pollsters Progressive Scottish Opinion - who correctly predicted an SNP majority in the 2011 Holyrood election - recorded the largest gap between the two camps for months. The survey suggests Mr Salmond is heading for a crushing defeat even if he wins over all undecided voters. Mr Bell, who quit as the head of Mr Salmond's policy unit in July, said: 'The campaigns to date have been a tedious parade of union jacks versus saltires, of pop identity about caring Scots versus heartless Tories.' Writing in the Guardian he added: 'What is really being asked is how do citizens and the state organise for the future in a sustainable way. 'At its best, the nationalist movement knows this, and oﬀ ers a critique of what democracy and the state of the United Kingdom can achieve. At its worst, it succumbs to the temptation to focus on old songs and tired policies. In this, Alex Salmond is wrong.' As the countdown began for the last year until voting takes place both sides sought to set out their key arguments. Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor fronting the Better Together campaign against independence, said: 'There are three powerful reasons for being part of the UK. 'One is economic: the opportunities and security that comes from being part of a larger country. 'The second is we’ve got influence in the European Union – it’s the large countries that call the shots, not the small countries. 'And thirdly of course there’s something greater in this in some ways - I’m Scottish and I’m British. I’m proud to be both and I don’t see why anyone should make me choose between one and the other.' But Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister, said the referendum was a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to back independence. She told BBC Radio 4: 'My argument is simple: it’s better to take decisions about Scotland here in Scotland. 'We’ve demonstrated that principle over the past 14 years with the Scottish parliament, we’ve taken better decisions when we’ve had the ability to do so on health and education; we should also take that decision-making power over the economy and welfare as well.' In other findings, the poll found: . About four million people aged 16 or over will be able to vote in the referendum, including all British and EU citizens living in Scotland. It will cost taxpayers around £14million and the ballot papers will be counted by hand on the night of the referendum. Polls have put the No campaign in the lead for months. A YouGov poll last October recorded support for independence at 29 per cent, the same level recorded in another poll by the company in August. Support for the Union increased from 55 per cent to 59 over the same period. The Progressive Scottish Opinion poll, drawn using data from YouGov panel members in Scotland, quizzed 1,051 adults between last Friday and Monday. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore said: 'This is an absolutely defining moment and a once-in-a-lifetime choice. 'That's . why I hope people will think carefully as they prepare for the vote. I . firmly believe that Scotland will be stronger, more secure and more . prosperous if we remain as part of the UK.' But . Mr Salmond said: 'The vote next year will be the opportunity of a . lifetime for many people in Scotland, as we get the chance to choose our . country's future. Scotland . can more than afford to be a successful independent country. We have . enormous advantages in terms of our human and natural resources, but we . need the political and economic tools to help create a wealthier and . fairer society.' Battle: Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted Scotland could go it aloneAlastair Darling said he should not be forced to choose between being Scottish and British . Date: About four million people aged 16 or over will be able to vote in the referendum next year . They were asked the question that will be on next year's ballot paper - 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' - and no additional questions that could sway the vote were asked. The results show backing for independence fell two percentage points since August, while support for the Union held firm. Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, Scotland's leading elections expert, said: 'It's not clear if the Yes side have made much progress in the past 12 months. 'Alex Salmond has got a very substantial challenge on his hands if he wants to win a majority. 'There has never been a time when a series of polls have shown a majority for independence and the Yes side has to create a majority that has never existed.' The poll found support for independence among men at 30 per cent and only 24 per cent among women - who are traditionally more sceptical about separation. That is down from 35 per cent among men since the last YouGov poll in August, but shows a onepoint increase for the Yes campaign among women. Backing for separation among 18-to-24-year-olds is at 24 per cent, while Scots aged 35-to-44 are least in favour of independence (22 per cent), and those aged 45-to-54 are most supportive (35 per cent). Deal: David Cameron and Alex Salmond signed referendum agreement in St Andrew's House, Edinburgh in October 2012 . The proportion of respondents in the Highlands and Islands planning to vote Yes is 23 per cent, rising to 35 per cent in Glasgow. Better Together director Blair McDougall said: 'With a year to go, we take nothing for granted. 'However, it seems clear that increasing numbers of Scots believe that Alex Salmond is putting the success of devolution at risk with his campaign for independence. The credit for this strong showing goes to the thousands of activists who have been in every community across Scotland, talking to undecided voters about how we have the best of both worlds with a Scottish parliament backed by the strength of the United Kingdom.' But Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins claimed 'momentum' is with the separatist campaign. Commenting on recent polls, he said: 'At this stage, those figures are very encouraging and show clearly that more and more people are either moving to Yes or are beginning to think about Yes. 'When people consider the consequences of a No vote, support for Yes increases. These polls accurately reflect what we are finding ourselves.' The poll also asked people how they would vote if a Holyrood election was held tomorrow. In a turnaround from recent surveys, 31 per cent said they would vote Labour and 25 per cent SNP.

Police are probing a borehole in a cemetery containing the remains of murdered concentration camp victims which they believe was dug by Nazi treasure hunters searching for the fabled Amber Room of the tsars. Ever since a book called 'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich was released two years ago the search for the fabled treasure has lured legions of hunters to the scene of old mine workings in eastern Germany seeking the fortune estimated at over 150 million pounds. Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau in east Germany. Missing treasure: Fortune seekers are rasing the woods of east Germany in the hunt for the Amber Room, seen here recreated in 2003, widely regarded as the world's most important missing art treasure . But now a borehole has been discovered in the village of Bad Schlema in Saxony which mayor Jens Mueller says is a dig too far. ‘This is a place of rest for 42 victims of the Nazis,’ he said.  ’It is too much.  It is the work of the treasure hunters.’ Ulbrich goes into detail in his book about old silver, cobalt and uranium mine workings that, at nearly 6,000 feet underground, were the deepest in Germany with some shafts and galleries dating back to the middle ages. Eyewitness reports from the time speak of a special S.S. commando unit turning up at the wood early in 1945, sealing it off and dumping a secret cargo in it.  With German shattered and its transportation infrastructure in ruins, believers say it must have been a singularly important cargo they hid there. Treasure hunter's bible: The Puzzle of Poppen Wood by Mario Ulbrich has guided fortune seekers to the east German woods . Searchers have found rotting wooden storage crates from WW2 in the woods but none have discovered the entrance to the cave system where the treasure allegedly lies. Crafted entirely out of amber, gold and precious stones, the Amber Room, made of numerous panels, was a masterpiece of baroque art and widely regarded as the world's most important missing art treasure. When its 565 candles were lit it was said to 'glow a fiery gold'.  It was presented to Peter the Great in 1716 by the King of Prussia and, later, Catherine the Great commissioned a new generation of craftsmen to embellish the room. She had moved it from the Winter Palace in St Petersburg to her new summer abode in Tsarskoye Selo, outside the city. The room was seized by marauding Nazi troops during their onslaught on Russia in 1941.  Prussian count Sommes Laubach, the Germans' 'art protection officer' and holder of a degree in art history, supervised the room's transport to Koenigsberg Castle in what was then East Prussia. In January 1945, after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city, the room was lost, many believing it was burned to pieces in the fighting. Koenigsberg became the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and ever since the Amber Room has become the new El Dorado for those who choose to believe it survived; a quest that enthralled the wealthy and the poor alike. The Maigret author Georges Simenon founded the Amber Room Club to track it down once and for all. Everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work. The German official in charge of the amber shipment said the crates were in a castle that burned down in an air raid.Others think the room sank to the bottom of the Baltic Sea in a torpedoed steamer used by the Nazis, or that it was hacked up by Red Army troops and sent home like sticks of rock as souvenirs of their conquest. A 2010 dig by a Russian treasure hunter in Kaliningrad failed to turn it up.  Now all eyes are on the wood in eastern Germany that has become the new magnet for those who never stop dreaming of gold.","Fortune seekers believe do have dug into holocaust victims' grave .

Resignation: A4e hit the headlines last year when it emerged that firm's founder Emma Harrison paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011 . Nine former staff at controversial welfare-to-work firm A4e were charged with fraud last night over offences relating to taxpayer-funded employment schemes. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said six women and three men had been charged with a total of 60 offences, including conspiracy to defraud, multiple counts of forgery, and making and possessing articles for use in fraud. All nine worked for A4e, which is paid more than £200million a year by the Government, mostly to deliver welfare-to-work and training programmes. The firm is a prime contractor on the Government's flagship £5billion Work Programme employment scheme. The nine people charged include one contract manager, seven recruiters and an administrator. They are alleged to have wrongly claimed payments for people who were not their clients and for finding jobs for people who were in fact still unemployed. They will appear before Slough magistrates’ court next month. The charges follow a high-profile investigation by Thames Valley Police’s economic crime unit. Those charged worked at three A4e offices across the south east of England. The charges relate to the ‘Inspire to Aspire’ scheme which is designed to deliver ‘motivation and training’ and help people find a job. Sue Patten, head of fraud at the CPS, said: ‘It is alleged that they forged documentation to support fraudulent claims to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for reward payments which, under the terms of the contract, were paid out when the scheme successfully placed individuals in employment. Ex-staff: A4e is a prime contractor on the Government's £5billion Work Programme employment scheme . ‘It is alleged that many of the reward payments related either to people who never attended A4e or to clients whom A4e had not successfully placed in employment. ‘The contract was to deliver motivation and training and to assist people to find employment.’ Fury: How the Daily Mail reported the £8.6million dividend story on its front page in February 2012 . The charges cover the four-year period February 2009 to February this year. When the police investigation first became public in March last year, both A4e and the DWP insisted that all the allegations related to historic welfare-to-work programmes. A4e hit the headlines last year when it emerged that firm’s founder Emma Harrison paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011. Following a public outcry, Mrs Harrison resigned as the Prime Minister’s ‘back-to-work’ tsar and also quit as chairman of A4e, in which she retains an 85 per cent shareholding. In a separate development yesterday the DWP said A4e would receive 5 per cent fewer clients on the Work Programme in the East Midlands, South Yorkshire and Merseyside as a penalty for poor performance. In a statement last night A4e said it would not tolerate fraud and was co-operating fully with the police investigation. The company said: ‘The incidents all relate to old paper-based contracts which used systems that have since been replaced.’ A4e’s chief executive Andrew Dutton said: ‘There is no place for dishonesty or wrongdoing at A4e, which is the most rigorously audited company in its sector.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Six women and three men charged with a total of 60 offences, CPS says .

Google has sent its Street View trike around the Large Hadron Collider and added it to the online service. The search giant spent two weeks riding a special trike fitted with 360 degree cameras around the huge experiment to capture it. Members of the public can now marvel at the sheer enormity of ATLAS as well as other giant machines at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva. Members of the public can take in the 7000-tonne ATLAS detector, which is probing for fundamental particles including the Higgs Boson, using Google Street View . This view is of ALICE, a heavy-ion detector on the Large Hadron Collider ring that's designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities, where a phase of matter called quark-gluon plasma forms . The Science Museum in London is opening an exhibition this November to show the work of some 10,000 people across the globe to uncover the building blocks of the universe at the LHC . The museum will use theatre and video as well as real artefacts from CERN to recreate the famous laboratory. It promises to take visitors behind the scenes to witness the discovery of the Higgs boson and explore the 27km collider. ‘We’re delighted that CERN opened its doors to Google Maps Street View allowing anyone, anywhere in the world to take a peek into its laboratories, control centers and its myriad underground tunnels housing cutting-edge experiments,’ said Pascale Milite of Google. CERN is the world's largest particle . physics laboratory where some of the world’s best physicists and . engineers use advanced particle accelerators to help solve age old . questions about the universe like what it's made of and how it started. Google has already sent its trikes, cars and backpacks everywhere from the Antarctic to the Grand Canyon. It says the latest addition to Street View could even help scientists plan future experiments. This is a view of the Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, which will shed light on why we live in a universe that appears to be composed almost entirely of matter, but no antimatter. It was set up to explore what happened after the Big Bang . The 27-km LHC tunnel holding the circumference accelerator ring of superconducting magnets, is pictured. Its job is to increase the energy of particles that will be smashed at detectors around the ring . ‘Street View also lets scientists working on the experiments, who may be on the other side of the world, explore the equipment they're using.’ The Google team were able to capture the main experiments running at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory based in the suburbs of Geneva. ‘A team from Google, working with CERN personnel, took images across all of CERN’s sites using, among other things, a bike-mounted camera system known as the “Street View Trike”. ATLAS (pictured) is a particle physics experiment that is searching for new discoveries in the head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. It aims to learn about forces that shaped our Universe since and that will determine its fate, including the dimensions of space and evidence of dark matter . A year ago, the world's largest particle collider identified what is believed to be the Higgs boson. But the experiment is now on a break as work is pushing ahead to give the vast machines an upgrade. The 27km circular lab went offline in February for an 18-month overhaul. When experiments resume in 2015, scientists at CERN will use its enhanced power to probe dark matter, dark energy and super symmetry. They also explored parts of the Large Hadron Collider tunnel and four experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb,’ said Dan Noyes of CERN. Six-sided panoramic images were taken every three metres and four experiments were photographed, as well as 1200 metres of the LHC tunnel. The entire project generated 6,000 points that were coordinated with GPS locations to create a virtual tour of the laboratory. The project is ongoing and will expand and offer views of more of CERN experiments, Noyes said. This view is of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider that's designed to investigate a wide range of physics, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions and particles that could make up dark matter . CMS is 25 metres long, 15 metres in diameter, and weighs about 12,500 tons. Approximately 3,800 people from 42 countries built and now operate the detector. In July 2012, along with ATLAS, CMS discovered a boson, which is very similar to the Standard Model Higgs Particle .","Google spent two weeks riding a special trike fitted with 360 degree cameras around CERN .

Paul Gascoigne has said he has been 'bled dry' by hackers who took £50,000 from his bank account . Former England star Paul Gascoigne has been 'bled dry' by hackers who took £50,000 from his bank account. Gascoigne, 46, who has been battling alcoholism for years, has said the thieves made 23 withdrawals in the space of just two days, it has been reported. Speaking outside his Bournemouth home, the former Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur and Lazio star claimed he knew who was responsible before admitting he did not understand how it had happened. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'I know who did it. I know how it f****** happened, there were 23 hits in f****** two days. It was quite a lot of money. 'It wasn't that much. F*** knows. I don't know. Website, internet, I've not got a clue.' Gascoigne, once believed to be worth £14 million, reportedly said between £9,000 and £50,000 had been stolen. In a documentary aired by ITV this week he described the pain of knowing he might start drinking again even though he recognises it might kill him. Widely regarded as one of the most talented footballers of his generation, Gascoigne told film-makers he had been 'lucky twice' after almost dying from drink. He said: 'I hope I don't die through it. Because I won't get any sympathy... because well he was warned. At least I know if I did pass away through it I wouldn't be in this pain all the time.' Last week it was reported Gascoigne spent £4,000 in just a few hours during a drunken betting spree. Witnesses said they saw the troubled England legend dropping bundles of £20 notes at a bookmakers following a two-day drinking bender. Staff at the Coral shop in Boscombe, near his Bournemouth flat, eventually had him ejected, according to reports. An onlooker told the Daily Star Sunday Gascoigne was 'swaying' and a worker behind the counter said he has spent thousands.

Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for many years and was sent to rehab in America in February. The £100,000 stay was organised and paid for by his host of famous friends including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani. The move came following a charity appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Members of the public who want a stake in the postal service must buy shares worth at least £750, and have until October 8 to register their interest. Shares in Royal Mail will be sold to the public next month, before staff can vote on strike action . Under government plans published yesterday, shares are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on October 11, a week before the end of a ballot of workers over a possible strike. The Communication Workers’ Union, which is opposed to the privatisation, is threatening industrial action over pay. Royal Mail warned yesterday: ‘Potential investors should assume that national strike action and other forms of industrial action will take place across the whole of the group’s activities during the period immediately after, and may take place during, the offer period.’ The earliest a strike could take place is October 23. Shares will cost from 260p to 330p, although the exact price will not be known until nearer the time. The Government is selling up to 70 per cent of its stake in the group, which could raise as much as £2billion for the Treasury. Financial institutions such as pension funds began ordering shares yesterday. Demand was so high that the offer was heavily oversubscribed, suggesting that the share price will be at the higher end of the scale.

Members of the public can collect order forms from the Post Office or download them online. Royal Mail yesterday published its prospectus, which sets out all the details of the company. It revealed that a host of banks advising the Government, led by Goldman Sachs and UBS, will receive more than £50million in fees for working on the deal. This summer, the Royal Mail’s Canadian chief executive, Moya Greene, was criticised for accepting a £250,000 payment from the firm to buy a home in one of London’s plushest districts. She was forced to pay it back after Business Secretary Vince Cable intervened. Last year the group made profits of £324million after handling 17.4billion letters and 1.4billion parcels. It expects the volume of letters sent to drop by up to 6 per cent a year, while the number of parcels it collects is expected to rise by 5.5 per cent. Under government plans, shares are expected to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on October 11, a week before the end of a ballot of workers over a possible strike . Posties visit 75 per cent of the UK’s addresses every day, it is estimated. Miss Green said: ‘Royal Mail has a unique place in the UK and that will not change. ‘We will now be better able to compete in what is a fast-changing and intensely competitive market.’ Mr Cable said: ‘Today is an important day in the life of the Royal Mail. We have already committed to give eligible Royal Mail staff a real stake by giving them 10 per cent of company shares free. ‘Now the sale of government shares will give others a chance to have a real stake in this important company.’ However, critics claim most people are against the sale. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has vowed to reverse the move, and Labour last week voted to re-nationalise the group if it wins the election. Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna said: ‘This is in the face of huge opposition from the public and Royal Mail’s employees and a real concern about what the sale will mean for customers and communities.’ ALEX BRUMMER's Analysis . Consumers seeking a flutter on the £3.3billion Royal Mail share offer will have to get their skates on. Applications for a stake in Britain’s emblematic letter and parcel delivery service must be in by October 8, a remarkably narrow selling window. The Government wants to make the shares as attractive as possible by offering a generous dividend of between 6.1 per cent and 7.7 per cent. At a time when bank deposit accounts pay virtually no interest and the return on ten-year government stocks, or gilts, is just 2.71 per cent, that is a tempting return. This is especially so because the company is promising a ‘progressive’ dividend policy. This means it should continue to rise at least at the rate of inflation in future years. Generally speaking, people who took up privatisation shares in the past have done remarkably well, with British Gas the outstanding performer, climbing 795 per cent since the Thatcher government sold it off in 1986. But like any share offering, the Royal Mail retail sale will not be for the faint-hearted. Like any share offering, the Royal Mail retail sale will not be for the faint-hearted . Anyone picking up a share offer pack will be greeted with an alarming list of risks, from the need to invest in its IT systems to the possibility that it could be affected by the vote on Scottish independence. By far the biggest threats, however, come from the unions and the possible return of a Labour government in 2015, which could try to take the Royal Mail back into public ownership or impose price controls. There may be a strike soon after Royal Mail reaches the markets, despite the fact that 10 per cent of the shares are reserved as freebies for the 150,000-plus posties. In addition, it recently made one of the most generous three-year pay deals – at 8.6 per cent – for any industrial group. The key to the Royal Mail’s success will likely be its parcels service, which is highly profitable. As a ‘royal’ chartered enterprise, it pays no VAT in Britain – although rivals are taking it to court over this issue. Its main commercial challenge is the requirement to run a ‘universal postal service’, which could be a costly anvil around its neck. But the biggest threat is that the Royal Mail is snapped up by foreign buyers. That would be a tragedy for an organisation that traces its origins back to 1516 and is part of the fabric of the nation.","The sale could raise as much as £2billion for the Treasury .

David Cameron and Nick Clegg have begun secret talks about a second coalition after the next election, a new book claimed last night. The two men are said to have discussed the idea ‘from time to time’ over the past year, amid mounting speculation that the 2015 election could result in another hung parliament. Mr Clegg is said to have told Mr Cameron privately that he would be reluctant to go into government with Labour leader Ed Miliband – despite claiming in public that he would be happy to negotiate with whoever has the most MPs after the election. Second term? David Cameron and Nick Clegg are said to have discussed setting up another Coalition . The claims, which were denied by Downing Street last night, are made in a new book by journalist Matthew d’Ancona, who has enjoyed privileged access to the Conservative leadership before and after the last election. The revelation that Mr Cameron is considering a second coalition will infuriate many of his MPs, who believe the Lib Dems have neutered the Government and frustrated tough action on welfare, immigration and tax. Many MPs – and some ministers – would rather see the Conservatives try to operate as a minority government if they fall short of an overall majority in 2015. The Prime Minister is said to have told Mr Clegg that, unlike in 2010, he would need the active consent of his party before a second deal could be signed off. Outcast: The news that the two rival parties are discussing another Coalition will be a bitter blow to Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband . Mr d’Ancona writes: ‘From time to time, he (Mr Cameron) would raise the question of a second coalition with Clegg. “If we did it again,” he mused to the Deputy Prime Minister, “I’d have to seek collective permission”.’ No 10 flatly rejected Mr d’Ancona’s claim that talks on a second coalition were under way. A spokesman said: ‘There are not, nor have there been any plans or talks to form a new coalition post-2015. The Prime Minister is entirely focused on running the country.’ Nevertheless, Mr Cameron is likely to be confronted over the claims at the Conservative Party conference. The book also claims that Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s mercurial strategy chief, walked out after concluding that he was a ‘reactive, not transformative Prime Minister’.","Clegg has told Cameron that he would be 'reluctant' to join forces with Labour and Ed Miliband .

"By . Amanda Platell . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:15 EST, 26 September 2013 . Last week, I met up with an old boyfriend. We've both moved on and there's as much spark left between us as a soggy box of matches. But you never want a former lover walking away thinking: 'She's let herself go.' You want them to leave thinking: 'Why did I ever let her go?' So I wore my new Amanda Wakeley dress, which is fitted and discreetly sexy. I blow-dried my hair, slipped on a pair of shoes and off I went. Standing tall: Amanda loves her high heels, left, and felt less attractive in her flats . I had arrived early at our chosen restaurant, so was seated when he arrived. 'You look gorgeous,' he said. Then, as I stood up to kiss him, the cad didn't even attempt to conceal the shock in his eyes. 'Christ, you've got shorter,' he said. Recovering quickly, he added: 'But putting on a few pounds really suits you.' Oh, the shame. When we were together, he thought I was lovely. Now he looked at me as though I was Frodo's mum: a short, portly hobbit with weird feet. And that’s exactly how I felt. I hadn't gained weight, or lost height; I'd simply ditched my usual skycraper heels for flat shoes. And all in the name of fashion. Me, the queen of vertiginous Jimmy Choos, the woman who has been known to moan 'Manolo' in her sleep, had decided to give up her high heels for a week. No allure: Even though some of the flats were glitzy, Amanda still felt unglamorous . Flats are having a style moment. At the recent London fashion shows, the joke doing the rounds was that all the editors were three inches shorter than usual, because they'd eschewed their usual high heels for flatties. Crystal-coated pumps, biker boots, buckled 'monk' shoes... there was only one thing all the new styles had in common: they were totally flat. I thought they looked OK-ish until I got . to my local pub for a roast lunch and a friend came over. He whispered . in my ear: 'Amanda, you forgot to take your slippers off' Now, I don't like the idea of flat shoes - I've worn high heels all my life, and am labouring under the misapprehension that I'm an Amazonian lovely pushing 6ft, instead of a rather ordinary 5ft 6¾in - but nor do I like the idea of looking terminally unfashionable. And on the day I met my ex-boyfriend, I had comforted myself with the fact that the heel-less shoes I was wearing were Jimmy Choos (who knew he also did flatties?), with a price tag of £265. The label is glamorous and chic, and I hoped what the pumps lacked in height they would make up for in super-fashionable glitz. But I have never felt less glamorous in my life. I wore the shoes on and off for a few days, trying to get used to the odd sensation of walking flat-footed like a duck - and looking like one, too. I swear they were as painful as my six-inch heels, rubbing the back of my ankles as I walked, squeezing my toes like a vice. And for what? To look dumpy. Get shorty: On one occasion she was asked if she was wearing her slippers to the pub while on another, she felt like a hobbit . Like many women, I've always worried about my weight. Even when I lost two stone after my last break-up, I still thought I was podgy. I'm a size 12, but the only times in my life I feel slim-ish are when I am wearing vertiginous heels. It's well known that heels elongate the leg, make you walk in a more upright, deliberate, saucy way, and give you confidence. Pathetic, but true. That's why women buy them. Yet while I've been wedded to my six-inch heels for most of my 55 years on this earth, as a shoe lover I have to admit to a frisson of excitement when 15 pairs of flats arrived at my home last week, courtesy of the Mail's fashion team, who'd very generously gathered a collection for me to try. Well, who wouldn't be excited about unwrapping all those shoes? I inspected each pair - snakeskin and suede, bejeweled, brogues, glittery, gaudy, High Street and designer - and lined them up by the front door so each day I could choose another pair. They felt a little like aliens invading my home, but I was prepared to give them a try. Lacking sex appeal: The shoe fanatic said she'll only keep the flats for meeting up with the girls . For Sunday lunch, I teamed £149 black paisley velvet slippers from Pretty Ballerinas with skinny black trousers, a long black top and short suede jacket. Normally I'd wear this outfit with my Ash wedge-heeled trainers. Yes, I even have heels with my trainers. They give a girl a lift. I thought they looked OK-ish until I got to my local pub for a roast lunch and a friend came over. He whispered in my ear: 'Amanda, you forgot to take your slippers off.' The ignominy, the shame. A slut who leaves home in her slippers! Move over, Vicky Pollard. I was too embarrassed to put him right. I had imagined that my new flats would give me freedom to walk more - and they did, but not the long distances I'd imagined. The problem with them is that they're so flat, they give your feet no support. Men's shoes have a heel. Even trainers go up at the back. But walking so flat-footed is quite uncomfortable, as well as ungainly. Even in my best frocks I felt frumpy. On the plus side, I did discover that my taxi bill fell, especially for the short distances you can't even contemplate in high heels. C'est chic: Only France's former First Lady Carla Bruni can pull off wearing flats . One day, attempting London casual-cool, I put on opaque tights, a cute, clingy lace dress I'd bought from French Connection and my newly-acquired Russell & Bromley black leather 'Monk Shoes'. They're like loafers, but with a side-fastening strap across the top. The reflection looking back at me in the mirror wasn't half-bad, and I left my house feeling young and hip. The male friend I was having a drink with said I looked like a Bond girl. I blushed and modestly inquired which one, secretly hoping it would be Ursula Andress. 'Rosa Klebb,' he replied, in mock horror. 'It looks like you could kill a man with one blow in those.' Ms Klebb, of course, is the ugly Russian assassin whose deadly weapon is a poisoned knife concealed in her clumpy brogues. High heels make a woman's body slimmer, . her legs longer, her head held higher. That's why we love them - and why . men love them right back . I was starting to see a pattern here. While women might love the comfort and stylish insouciance of flat shoes, men hate them. They're just not sexy. There was never a pair of 'kiss me quick' or 'fancy me' flat shoes. They don't exist. For a work lunch at a London restaurant on Monday, I teamed a navy frock (which I'd normally wear with my black suede LK Bennett stilettos) with Russell & Bromley's navy blue suede flats. They had cute tassles on them, weren't too pointy and had a tiny bejeweled heel. They were 'power flats' and they reminded me of Carla Bruni, one of the few women in the world who can carry off flats with even a hint of glamour. One of my girl friends did say she loved my new flat-shoed look when we met for dinner on Tuesday evening. I'd teamed grey zebra-print flats with capri trousers and a white belted top. I felt like I was channelling Katharine Hepburn, who managed to make mannish trousers and flat shoes look undeniably sexy. My friend certainly gushed about how stylish I looked, too - but then she is a flat shoe fanatic, who is always poking fun at my heels and reminding me how bad they are for my back, not to mention my bunions. And after a week away from my heels - and the backache and aching feet which come with them - I'm prepared to concede that there is a place in my life for this season's stylish flatties. Out of the 14 pairs of shoes I've worn the past week, there are three I'd like to own: the black velvet ones my friend thought were slippers, the zebra-print pair, and some maroon brogues which I thought looked quite good with trousers, if a little Annie Hall. Flats, whether they be jewelled, tassled or doing the fandango, will not become my staple footwear unless I break an ankle again. (Last year, I took a nasty tumble courtesy of my kitten, and spent a good few weeks separated from my Jimmy Choos.) But this is not because I don't adore some of the latest modern styles: it's because flatties make you a fattie. High heels make a woman's body slimmer, her legs longer, her head held higher. That's why we love them - and why men love them right back. So, I'll keep my flats and I will wear them - but only when I'm out with the girls.","To fit in with the latest trend, Amanda tried giving up her heels for a week .

The telecoms giant’s ten million customers will see their monthly packages increase by up to 6.5 per cent from January 4. ‘Every customer will be affected by this,’ admitted a company spokesman. Penalty fees for leaving a  contract early are due to rise by as much as 30 per cent, and even the charge for dialling the Speaking Clock will go up by 6.3 per cent. Standard line rental, which is paid on top of any phone or broadband package, will rise by 3.5 per cent from £15.45 to £15.99 a month. The annual inflation rate is 2.7 per cent at present. The company has boasted that its new sports service will be free for anyone already getting their internet connection through BT. It claims a million people have already signed up to the service. But all BT customers will end up financing the project through the price rises – even though the channels are free to some users of BT’s arch-rival Virgin. BT has splashed large sums on its ambitious scheme to rival Sky in offering top-flight football and other sports. As well as paying £1billion for the rights to show a host of Premier League football games and rugby matches over the next three years, the company is thought to have spent tens of millions of pounds on a new  studio and a host of pundits.

A nurse has admitted handing a distressed psychiatric patient a razor which she then used to harm herself with. Katherine Quinn was working on the Trinity Ward in Antelope House, Southampton, when she handed the woman a blade, a hearing was told. The patient had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and had a history of self harm. Quinn, who was working the night shift, reported her actions to the day staff the next morning. Jennifer Searles, who was Quinn’s line manager at the time, said: ‘She told me that she read the care plan twice and could not see what to do if she (the patient) became distressed. ‘She was aware of policies within other trusts which allowed staff to give razors to patients in order for them to self harm. ‘She told me that she was trying to turn a negative situation into a positive one. She told me that she was trying to do her best for the patient at the time.’ Miss Searles told the panel that Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust did not allow patients to be handed harmful instruments. ‘Katherine should at no point have given patient A a razor blade. It is not acceptable on the ward to provide materials for a patient to self harm,’ she said. ‘It is emphasised in all staff training on the ward that you do not give aid to a patient to self harm.’ During a meeting with Miss Searles, Quinn also admitted that she had forgotten to complete an incident form for patient A 'because she was busy with another patient and was getting a lift home following the shift.' Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Antelope House (pictured), says it does not allow harmful instruments to be given to patients . Miss Searles added: ‘She told me that she intended to complete the form the following day.’ Quinn admits providing inappropriate care to patient A, failing to follow the care plan, providing a razor blade to the patient, failing to check the self harm wound and failing to seek appropriate advice for patient A. If the panel find that her fitness to practice is impaired, she could be struck off the register.

The great British countryside is preparing a breathtaking display which could make autumn one of the most glorious in living memory. Experts are predicting a riot of leaf colours, wild fruits and nuts thanks to a fortuitous combination of weather conditions which have primed Mother Nature to put on a show like no other. A colourful taste of things to come: The Tu Hwnt I'r Bont Tearoom in North Wales this week . Colourful: Experts are predicting a 'riot' of colour this autumn after a wet spring and warm summer has provided the perfect conditions .

The Obama administration has found over $100 million in grant money to help bankrupt Detroit hire more police and firefighters, and clear out blighted neighborhoods. But considering the Motor City is at least $18 billion in debt, it will take a far larger infusion of cash or historic deals with bond holders, insurance companies and other creditors to correct the problem. Four high-ranking White House officials will discuss federal efforts and other opportunities today during a closed-door meeting at Wayne State University with Gov. Rick Snyder, state-appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr, Mayor Dave Bing and community and business leaders. A row of abandoned houses in Detroit shows the destitute city amidst its financial woes, as the U.S. government finds $100 million in grants to give to Motor City . The federal money being directed Detroit's way by the U.S. government will be augmented with about $200 million more in resources from foundations and Detroit businesses, but it falls far short of the wider bailout some in the city had sought. 'Something is better than nothing,' said Bridgette Shephard, 47, a social worker who lives in Detroit. 'A bailout would have been better, but if we can sustain some of our needs with grants that would be a start. Let's take it. Whatever kind of money it is to benefit the city, I'm all for it.' Gene Sperling, chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, said the administration scrounged through the federal budget and found untapped money that 'either had not flowed or had not gotten out or not directed to the top priorities for Detroit.' Sperling and three other top Obama aides, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, will meet with state and local officials Friday. Detroit is still around $18 billion in debt, despite the government funding (a Detroit man runs along a street of abandoned houses) The Obama administration repeatedly had signaled it would not offer a massive federal bailout like the one credited with helping rescue Chrysler and General Motors. 'There is not going to be a bailout,' Democratic U.S. Sen. Carl Levin told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 'We have enough problems with the federal deficit. We need to be creative and look at existing programs. There are still some funds there.' The funding announced by Sperling will include $65 million in Community Development Block Grants for blight eradication, $25 million in a public-private collaboration for commercial building demolition and nearly $11 million in funds to ensure working families can live in safe neighborhoods. Holder will announce $3 million that, in part, will be used to hire new police officers. About $25 million also will be expedited to Detroit to hire about 140 firefighters and buy new gear. 'It wasn't enough to try and free the resources,' Sperling said. 'We had to make sure they are well-used and targeted.' The Obama administration has found millions of dollars in grant money to help the bankrupt city (President Obama pictured speaking in the White House today) In addition, Orr, the city's emergency manager, has told the city's two municipal retirement systems he wants to freeze Detroit's pension plans and move to a 401(k)-style system. The gathering today follows a series of meetings with the White House to plot ways to pull Detroit from a fiscal pit that this summer made it the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy protection. Detroit has had a poor record in making sure grant money is used properly and even spent at all. In 2011, Mayor Dave Bing fired the director of the city's Human Services Department after an internal investigation revealed $200,000 intended for poor residents was spent on office furniture for staff members. The following year, his office had to scramble to use about $20 million in grants that had been left sitting for demolitions of thousands of vacant houses. The city's Police Department also allowed a $400,000 grant to lapse for a new armored vehicle. The grant troubles have rankled Orr, the emergency manager Gov. Rick Snyder appointed to lead the city out of its financial mess. Orr has said Detroit is so poor that . it can't afford to lose out on any resources. In July, he made Detroit . the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy protection. Grants only can pay for things the city otherwise couldn't afford. Several . businesses even pitched in $8 million earlier this year to help pay for . a new fleet of emergency vehicles, including 23 EMS units and 100 . police cars, to boost public safety and reduce response times. Police Chief James Craig said Thursday he was in Washington a few weeks ago in search of federal resources for his department. 'Our work together is critical in achieving our goals of making Detroit a safe city and providing the necessary resources in raising the morale of our most valuable asset, our people,' Craig said. The Obama administration is trying to show its support without trying to send any message about a bailout, said Peter Henning, a Wayne State Law School professor. Officials, especially those from HUD and Transportation, can commit funds for infrastructure projects, while Holder can chip in resources for fight Detroit's high violent crime rate, Henning said. 'So these are back door ways to provide federal funding and support without having to seek a bailout, which would be dead on arrival from both parties,' he said. 'The goal is to strengthen Detroit, but only indirectly. This is at best a muted commitment because what Detroit really needs is dollars and not just support that might be beneficial in three to five years. But any hope of that is a pipe dream.'","$65 million will go to Community Development Block Grants for blight eradication .

A video of a group of Brazilian soldiers doing a striptease dance with guns could end up with them being stripped of their ranks by their commanding officers. The soldiers, said to be from the Amazonas military base in Manaus, are filmed by a colleague dancing to a popular 90s song 'Rhythm is a Dancer' by German band 'Snap!' The images posted on the internet this week and shown on Amazonas TV, capture four squaddies, in uniform, giving it their all with some mean dance moves that would look good on any nightclub dance floor. Caught on tape: A group of Brazilian soldiers were filmed in their barracks, dancing and stripping down to their waists while brandishing their guns in their . The only problem is they’ve chosen to display their skills in military barracks and to wave guns around as part of their raunchy routine. The soldiers’ exuberant performances haven’t gone down well with their senior officers. According to the Amazon Military Command communications office, the army intelligence service has launched an investigation into a ‘possible case of disrespect and misconduct on the part of some soldiers of the corporation’. Senior officers are said to have instructed investigators to find out where the film was made, who recorded it and who the military dancing stars are. One solder, who is half-naked, gyrates enthusiastically like an expert male stripper in front of the camera. He then climbs on to the top of a bunk bed to add emphasis to his sexy moves.

Military moves: The soldiers' video got them into trouble as they are seen holding their weapons during their semi-dressed dance routine . His colleague, who has been winding to the rhythm around the room, grabs his Imbel MD97 standard issue army assault rifle and dances with the instrument held aloft. At first he points the weapon to the ceiling, then he levels it at the camera. But soon he can’t resist aiming it at his colleagues’ behind as the topless soldier, who has straddled the top bunk, thrusts his body suggestively back and forth. Moments later in the video, the same shirtless soldier picks up another gun and waves it around. The ‘Rhythm is a Dancer’ single, released in 1992, became a huge hit on Rede Globo TV when it was used as a soundtrack during male striptease scenes in a highly successful Brazilian soap opera ‘Body and Soul’. Most Brazilians who watched the ‘novela’  - as the programmes are called in Brazil, associate Snap’s song with male strippers.

The footage of the military dancers shows them performing striptease moves, with one soldier pulling down his trousers to expose his buttocks to the camera and another making an attempt to unbutton his shirt seductively. The squaddies star in a sort of 'battle ' dance with the person, recording the images, announcing the names of everyone who enters the 'game'.  The names given to the soldiers are: ' Henry ', ' Baldy ' and ' Cheap Crazy '. The cameraman is heard also alluding to a nightclub located in Manaus city centre. The dancers are interrupted for a few minutes by a soldier who is filmed at the door of the barracks. It appears he has come to carry out an inspection, but he starts laughing and decides to leave the troops to their antics. A spokesperson for the CMA said that they are investigating the images to identify which military unit shot the scenes and who is involved. The spokesperson added: ‘If it is confirmed that the event happened on the spot and they were in service and have exposed the military to ridicule, the soldiers will be warned or even expelled from the army.’","Brazilian soldiers filmed stripping to 90s track Rythm is a Dancer .

Professor Steve Field said he wouldn't hesitate in to close down practices that weren't providing proper care . GP surgeries should open seven days a week to help patients holding down full-time jobs, the new care watchdog says. Setting out a tough regime of checks on doctors’ surgeries, Steve Field warned those that provide poor care could face big fines and even closure. Professor Field, who is chief inspector of primary care, said that lazy medics who do not stay open for long enough risk being punished. He said: ‘I will not hesitate at all to order the closure of GP practices that we find to be unsafe, or providing poor access, or which do not care for patients properly or treat them with dignity.’ While acknowledging the high standard of care provided by most GPs, he said surgeries should provide care seven days a week and described opening hours as ‘patchy’. Ahead of the introduction of a ratings system for GP surgeries, Professor Field said one in ten surgeries will need to make significant improvements. He told the Guardian newspaper: ‘While we’ve got some of the best general practices in the world, it’s let down by a small percentage of practices which aren’t providing appropriate access or quality of care.’ Speaking about the need for longer opening hours, he added: ‘Access should be brilliant, but currently it’s patchy. ‘A lot of patients are dissatisfied with current access and think it’s inadequate. It seems to be a huge source of frustration. ‘We should move to seven-day services in general practice, where patients should be able to access a GP for advice at the weekend.’ Professor Field, who works as a GP in Birmingham, said that patients holding down nine-to-five jobs struggled to make appointments. Pointing to the rising numbers of surgeries offering appointments later in the evenings and at weekends, he said such working practices should be commonplace. He said the need for longer opening hours will be a key assessment criterion for his inspectors.His priority upon taking on the role will be the provision of substandard out-of-hours care, often provided by private contractors such as Serco. He said: ‘Out-of-hours care has been a concern of mine for years.’ But his plans were immediately met with scepticism by Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners. ‘I would love there to be seven days a week access to GPs,’ she said. ‘But that’s not possible when we need 10,000 more GPs to cope with our growing workload, and when GPs are getting their smallest share of the NHS budget for a decade. Professor Field listed out-of-hours care as one of his biggest concerns saying patients seem to be 'frustrated' with the current opening hours of GP's surgeries . 'We need those in power and authority to understand that and not constantly berate GPs and get the stick out.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt echoed Professor Field’s message, saying GP salaries could be slashed if they fail to look after the elderly. He was speaking as new GP contracts are being drawn up, suggesting that he has ‘no problem paying GPs well’ if they give good care. ‘We need to change the model for reactive primary care to proactive primary care and that’s rediscovering the idea of family doctoring, and the idea of a GP who keeps tabs on people whether or not they’re ill,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘We need to be much more ambitious about how people access the system in ways that cost the system a lot less. ‘We’re trapped in a mentality where the heart of primary care provision is a ten-minute GP appointment when actually if you look at what happens in the US, they find that if you allow people to ask questions by email it is cheaper and quicker.’ Professor Field is a former chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners.","Professor Steve Field said he 'would not hesitate' to close down inadequate GP surgeries .

David Cameron has today revealed that his most senior ministers will not be moved in the Government reshuffle expected early next month. In a highly unusual move Mr Cameron said George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith will all be singled out for praise when he makes his keynote speech to the Conservative Party conference next week. In an interview with regional newspapers, Mr Cameron said: ‘I will be referring strongly to the great team that I have got. ‘You have seen the key figures have been in place, know their departments well and are really delivering - whether that is welfare, education, the Home Secretary, the economy, Foreign Secretary. ‘I have a really strong team, and I will have the opportunity to emphasise that.’ Mr Cameron’s comments effectively guarantee the five senior ministers their jobs in the long-delayed reshuffle, which could come at the end of next week. Instead, the Prime Minister is expected to focus on moving talented female ministers into more senior positions with a view to promoting them into the Cabinet ahead of the General Election. Education minister Elizabeth Truss, welfare minister Esther McVey and junior whip Nicky Morgan are all tipped for promotion to bigger jobs. Home Secretary Theresa May and Chancellor George Osborne will be staying put after the prime minister praised them for knowing their departments well and delivering good results . The Prime Minister is under pressure from some senior Tories to ease out some veteran Tories to ease out some veteran ministers, including Chief Whip Sir George Young and Commons Leader Andrew Lansley, to free up room at the top. Sir George faced criticism last month after overseeing a Commons defeat on Syria in which 10 members of the Government failed to vote. Mr Cameron has faced criticism for his failure to promote women in the past, amid claims he left two female Cabinet ministers in tears when he sacked them in last September’s reshuffle. In 2009 he promised that at the end of his first term as Prime Minister he wanted a third of all of his ministers to be female. But the Cabinet still has only four female members. Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove . Iain Duncan Smith, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions . British Foreign Secretary William Hague . Mr Cameron is also under pressure to find jobs for talented backbenchers from the 2010 intake, such as Nadhim Zahawi and Gavin Barwell. The reshuffle was originally due to take place before the summer but has been delayed a number of times. The programme for next week’s Conservative Party conference in Manchester does not list any ministers by name, referring instead to their job titles. Ed Miliband is expected to match Mr Cameron with his own, wider reshuffle in the coming days. The Labour leader, who did not refer by name to any of his Shadow Cabinet colleagues in his own conference speech last week, will also use his shake-up to promote more women. Treasury chief secretary Rachel Reeves, shadow health minister Liz Kendall and backbencher Stella Creasy are all expected to get big promotions. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg and Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne are among those tipped for the sack. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is also likely to be moved to a new role after he was targeted by the Tories over his record as health secretary under Gordon Brown.","George Osborne, William Hague, Theresa May, Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith will all be singled out for praise .

An illegal immigrant who attacked a ballet dancer, broke his neck and left him lying in the street has had his sentence increased by the Court of Appeal after being declared 'ruthless, callous and a danger to the public'. Mohammed Ali Mohamoed, now 28, was originally jailed for a total of 13 years for assaulting Jack Widdowson on a disused canal towpath in Cardiff. But three appeal judges have unanimously ruled the sentence was inadequate because the trial judge wrongly thought Mohamoed, of Splott, Cardiff, would be automatically deported on completing his sentence. Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson pictured here outside Cardiff Crown Court (left) and (right) his attacker Mohammed Ali Mohamoed . Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting with Mr Justice Spencer and Mr Justice Stewart, ruled there was no such thing as automatic deportation - and Mohamoed could spend years resisting removal from the UK on the grounds that it would infringe his human rights. The judge quashed the 13-year term imposed at Cardiff Crown Court last June and substituted an extended sentence to meet the danger Mohamoed could pose to the public if released from prison but not immediately deported. The judge said: 'In our view, so targeted, so ruthless and so callous were the circumstances of this offence that this man quite plainly is a danger to the public.' The appeal court allowed a challenge by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC to the adequacy of the original sentence imposed by Mr Justice Wyn Williams and replaced it with an extended sentence of 18 years, composed of an immediate custodial term of 13 years, plus an additional five years on licence. Horror: Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson pictured here in hospital after the attack . The overall sentence means that, whenever he is released from prison, Mohamoed will remain under supervision for the full 18-year period, or until he is deported. Mohamoed was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Mr Widdowson, then aged 19 and from Somerset, on November 5 2011. Mr Widdowson, who was an apprentice dancer at the Bern Ballet Company in Switzerland, suffered neck injuries so serious that it was at first thought he would be left paralysed and unable to dance again. But eight months after the attack he had returned to dancing in what his family called a 'miracle' recovery. His father Dr Julian Widdowson said his 'incredible flexibility' may have saved his life. Mr Widdowson’s mobile phone had been stolen and he had been left for dead on the outskirts of Cardiff city centre near East Tyndall Street at 00.45. Attacked: Pictured here is Jack in a ballet performance days before the attack that left him with a broken neck . Talent: Mr Widdowson was one of the youngest apprentices to be taken on by the Swiss company Bern Ballet . He had been visiting his brother who was studying at Cardiff University. Mr Widdowson’s parents have set up a charity called the Dance Again Foundation, which helps other injured dancers access the right support and treatment. At his trial, Mohamoed admitted stealing Mr Widdowson’s phone but claimed someone else must have hurt him. Lord Justice Pitchford said he was smuggled into the UK in June 2008 in the back of a lorry. His asylum claim was unsuccessful, but he illegally remained in the country, living in Cardiff. At first he claimed to have been born in the Palestinian territories, but now says he is of Egyptian origin. The Attorney General welcomed the ruling, saying: 'This terrible attack on a promising young ballet dancer could easily have ended his career. 'Mohammed Ali Mohamoed used brutal violence on his victim and left him severely injured and in a paralysed condition on a towpath in Cardiff. 'I am pleased that the Court of Appeal found Mohammed Mohamoed a dangerous offender and increased his term to an extended sentence of 18 years.'","Mohammed Ali Mohamoed, now 28, was originally jailed for 13 years .

After their longed-for baby was stillborn, Leah and James Mitchell found comfort placing teddy bears on her churchyard grave. But even that harmless way of easing their grief has brought them more upset – with the church vicar telling them the toys could offend other mourners and ordering  them to be removed. Now the couple, who married at the same church last year, say they are considering exhuming their daughter Amelia and having her buried elsewhere. James and Leah Mitchell have made a shrine to their stillborn daughter, Amelia after they were asked to remove tribute from their daughter's grave . Amelia's grave with the teddies James and Leah Mitchell were asked to remove because they might offend other mourners . Last night Mrs Mitchell, 27, a nursery nurse from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said they were shocked when Reverend John Hamilton rang them when they were on holiday ordering them to move the toys. She said: ‘We couldn’t believe a vicar could be so cruel. We were in the Lake District and it meant a five-hour journey back. ‘But he said he had a funeral the next day and people would be upset if they saw them.’ Mrs Mitchell and her husband, James, 29, tried for five years to have a child. The couple say they are considering exhuming their daughter Amelia and having her buried elsewhere . The Mitchells said they were shocked when Reverend John Hamilton rang them when they were on holiday ordering them to move the toys . But the 20-week scan revealed Amelia had Edwards Syndrome which meant she had multiple disabilities and would be unlikely to be born alive. Despite being offered a termination, Mrs Mitchell went ahead with the pregnancy and Amelia died shortly before she was born, at 35 weeks, on New Year’s Eve. Mrs Mitchell said: ‘On Valentine’s Day we placed a big heart on the grave and at Easter we decorated it with bunnies. 'Even though she’d died I wanted to care for her as a mum. We’ve since found out the church has rules forbidding having “toys” on the grave. ‘We used to visit three times a week, but now we only visit Amelia’s grave once a week.’ Mr Hamilton, of St Andrew’s Church in Sherborne St John, Hampshire, said: ‘What Leah and James have gone through is an absolute tragedy. ‘We want to do all we can to help the family grieve for the terrible loss of Amelia, but we must also  be mindful of the environment of the churchyard for all those who come to visit their loved ones  buried here. ‘We are hopeful that we will be able to come to a solution.’","A 20-week scan revealed Leah and James' baby had Edwards Syndrome which meant she had multiple disabilities and would unlikely survive .

Social workers and medics knew nothing about the young boy discovered starved and mummified in his cot because his mother failed to co-operate with services, a court heard today. Hamzah Khan, whose severely malnourished and skeletal remains were only discovered almost two years after he died in squalor at his mother's filthy home had never been seen by a GP after his birth. And there were no medical records on him from the age of two weeks old until he died aged four and a half, Bradford Crown Court heard. Amanda Hutton's 4-year-old son Hamzah Khan was found dead at her home in Bradford . His body was still dressed in a baby-gro, intended for a baby aged six to nine months, when neighbours called police in September 2011, . But by then it was too late and he had died 21 months earlier, on December 15 2009, his body lying in the cot ever since. His mother Amanda Hutton, who drank heavily and suffered domestic violence from her husband Aftab Khan, consistently failed to keep doctors appointments, failed to get him immunised and slammed the door in the face of repeated calls from health visitors, the court heard. Aftab Khan arriving at Bradford Crown Court where Hutton is charged with the manslaughter of their son, Hamzah Khan . Hutton, 43, from Bradford, denies the manslaughter of her son by gross negligence by allowing him to starve and failing to get medical assistance. Dr Kathryn Ward, a paediatrician at . Airedale NHS Trust in Yorkshire, told the jury medical records showed . after Hamzah was born in June 2007, he was only ever seen once by a . midwife and once by a social worker, in November 2006, three years . before he died, when he appeared 'well cared for and well dressed'. 'From two weeks of age, we know nothing about this child,' Dr Ward told the jury. 'His personal development, behaviour, his personality or general health. It’s a blank page. 'The picture of non-engagement and failure to respond to professionals from a variety of areas is a matter of great concern.' The court heard police had been repeatedly called to Hutton's home, starting in May 1996, to rows and fights with her husband. After Hamzah was born and deemed fit and healthy, health visitors repeatedly called but failed to get into the house. On . one occasion the health visitor saw curtains moving inside, but no one . answered the door and on another occasion the door was opened but . Hutton, wearing just a towel, 'was perceived to be hostile, said she was . busy and slammed the door'. When . Hutton failed to register the child’s birth she was visited by the . registrar and was seen to have a 'puffed up' eye injury and smelt of . alcohol. Dr Ward said 'multi-agency' meetings were called about the situation, involving police, council and health authorities. Paediatrician Kathryn Ward said 'multi-agency' meetings were called about Hutton and her son, involving police, council and health authorities . But by October 2009 after repeated failed appointments, Hutton's GP surgery removed mother and child from the patients list - as is normal practice. 'It’s something being addressed locally because it means children sink further beneath the radar,' Dr Ward added. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked the witness: 'Do you have any view on the history of non-engagement by Amanda Hutton?' Dr Ward said: 'The picture is one of gross negligence and non-engagement with professionals. 'We have the history of domestic . violence. All of which suggests things were not well, limited contact . with the mother suggests she was feeling low since the birth and had . taken to using alcohol as a prop. After Hamzah was born and deemed healthy, health visitors repeatedly called but failed to get into the house, the jury was told . 'The picture provides evidence of neglect of the child’s health and emotional needs.' Earlier the court heard Hutton did nothing to alert the emergency services about her son’s plight and even ordered pizza within hours of his death. He was only found after police community support officer Jodie Worsley went to the house on a number of occasions due to concerns raised by neighbours. The court heard how there was a terrible smell coming from the terraced house and, when Hutton eventually opened the door, there were flies buzzing around her. Police went into the property and 'what they discovered disturbed even hardened officers, Mr Greaney said. In police interviews Hutton said her son had become particularly unwell on December 14, 2009 and died the next day. She told police that things deteriorated after her son’s death and she began to drink a bottle of vodka a day. Her house contained a huge amount of rubbish, rotting matter, faeces and empty bottles and smell 'almost beyond description,' the jury has heard.

'Upset': Dr Al Sattar, whose family were killed in a house fire, said his Muslim faith had been tested by the deaths of his family . A father whose wife and three children were killed in an arson attack yesterday said it was ‘God’s plan’ for them all to die. Brain surgeon Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar said his devout  Muslim faith had ‘been tested’, but he was able to draw comfort from the belief that his family are now ‘in paradise’. His wife Shehnila, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and  15-year-old Jamil were killed when arsonists torched their home in Leicester when Mr Sattar was working away in Dublin. It is feared the family was mistakenly targeted in a revenge attack after the death of a man in the city centre the night before. Leicestershire Police have charged an 18-year-old man with murder over the fire. Further arrests have also been made in connection with the blaze. Yesterday, Mr Sattar said he is upset that he has still not been able to bury his loved ones two weeks after the tragedy. A second post-mortem examination on the bodies has been delayed until at least October 8. Mr Sattar, 52, whose religion encourages burial within 24 hours of death, said: ‘I am not angry but I am upset because I feel the post-mortem has been delayed. ‘I am happy because I know my family are in paradise.’ He said the last two weeks had been ‘extremely difficult’ for him, but added his faith in Islam had given him ‘strength’. ‘It was God’s plan to take the life,’ he said. ‘As a neurosurgeon I know we deal with life and death every day – so it was in my mind, something which is beyond your control.’ Devastated: Dr Al Sattar lost his sons Bilal Taufiq Sattar (left)  and Jamal (right) and their mother Shehnila in the Leicester house fire .

Revolution: New treatment is effective within five minutes, compared to current 90-minute drug . A new injection for breast cancer patients could dramatically cut the time they spend in hospital and save the NHS millions, say experts. Sufferers are currently given regular infusions of the drug Herceptin via a drip – an ordeal lasting between 30 and 90 minutes – for just over a year in most cases. But the jab delivers the substance in only five minutes. NHS England has approved the speedier method for widespread use from today, which not only frees up time for patients but will increase capacity in hospital chemotherapy suites. Patients require an average of 18 Herceptin doses – one every three weeks – meaning the jab could spare them up to 25 hours in hospital over the course of their treatment. Herceptin was the first targeted drug for breast cancer. It was designed for women with HER2-positive tumours, one of the most aggressive forms of the disease, affecting around one quarter of the 44,000 British women diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Before the health service rationing body allowed widespread use in 2006, there were high-profile battles by patients to win NHS funding for the drug. The then health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, ordered a fast-track approval process for Herceptin, which led to  it being used up to three years earlier than scheduled. The new jab heralds another revolution in treatment, say experts, with trial data suggesting it works as well as, or even marginally better than, the time-consuming infusions. A trial of almost 600 women living with the early stages of HER2-positive breast cancer compared standard infusion with a five-minute injection into the fatty layer of tissue under the skin. The tumour was completely eliminated in 45 per cent of women who received the injectable form, compared to 41 per cent of women who had the infusion. The quicker way of delivering Herceptin was authorised for use in the UK by the European Medicines Agency. It has been endorsed by NHS England, the national commissioning body for treatments, which clears the way for hospitals to adopt it. Scotland and Wales are likely to make similar decisions. As well as shortening each hospital visit, the jab means the invasive tube, or cannula, used during infusions would no longer need to be inserted every three weeks. Quality of life improved: Current treatment is gruelling and vigorous. The new jab is hailed as a revolution . A study found nine out of ten patients preferred the injected version of Herceptin versus the intravenous method. In addition to the advantages to patients, the NHS could profit from savings valued at more than £20million, says manufacturer Roche. Although the drug costs the same in both forms – £1,200 for each treatment – savings are made in nurses’ time spent preparing and administering the drug for intravenous use. Pearl Lowe, 43, fashion designer and her model daughter Daisy Lowe, 24, are among hundreds of celebrities trying to raise money to further research for breast cancer treatment . Professor Lesley Fallowfield, of the University of Sussex, said: ‘Time is precious to women with breast cancer, far too precious to be waiting around in busy chemotherapy centres. ‘If subcutaneous delivery of Herceptin were to replace intravenous administration in the NHS then patients would spend less time in hospital and more time getting on with their lives. If this method is adopted in the NHS then the quality of life of women with HER2-positive breast cancer could be dramatically improved.’ Dr Mark Verrill, consultant medical oncologist, at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, said the jab might eventually be adapted for use by women at home. He said the existing infusion treatment is ‘quite invasive’, adding: ‘We can now give Herceptin by a five-minute subcutaneous injection – it’s much quicker and simpler … As well as the advantage for patients, subcutaneous Herceptin frees capacity on busy chemotherapy day units. ‘It lends itself to administration in the community, resonating with the … drive for treatment closer to home.’ Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘This is a good example of how research can make improvements to patients’ quality of life as well saving considerable time and money for the NHS.’ Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast Cancer Campaign said the injection had ‘the convenience of patients in mind’ and would ‘save them considerable treatment time’.","Current treatment, injecting Herceptin via a drip, takes up to 90 minutes per session for about a year .

Air pollution is said to account for 2.1 million premature deaths worldwide, according to new research, and mortality rates can vary widely between certain countries. To highlight the risk, Nasa's Earth Observatory has used these numbers to create an air pollution map that shows, at a glance, how levels of a type of pollution called fine particulate matter differ across the globe. It compares data compiled on 1 January 1850 to levels recorded on 1 January 2000 and shows the average number of deaths per 1,000 square kilometres, per year. This map uses air pollution data gathered by the University of North Carolina. Dark brown areas have more premature deaths than light brown areas. The areas shown in blue represent countries where air quality has improved in relation to data previously held about pollution from the 1850s . Fine particulate matter is made up of particles, such as dust and soot, that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Because of this size, the particles are scientifically referred to as particulate matter 2.5, or PM2.5. They cause health problems because they are small enough to enter a person's lungs through the respiratory system. PM2.5 is released from car exhausts, for example, as well as other industrial, domestic and natural sources. The data was collected by researcher Jason West, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at the . University of North Carolina. In a study published in the journal Environmental . Research letters, West estimated that around 2.1 million deaths a year are linked to levels of fine particulate matter (FMP).

'Blue areas have experienced an improvement in air quality relative to 1850 and a decline in premature deaths.' 'Fine particulate matter takes an especially large toll in eastern China, northern India, and Europe - all areas where urbanisation has added considerable quantities of PM2.5 to the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution.' It continued that areas, such as the southeastern states of the U.S., saw levels of PM2.5 drop to levels seen before the development of industry. 'The decrease in PM2.5 is likely related to a decline in local biomass burning that has occurred over the last 160 years,' explained the post. Nasa's Earth Observatory claims that toxic pollution can linger in the air for 'days or even weeks' and increases the number of people admitted to hospitals with breathing or heart problems.","Nasa used global pollution data compiled by North Carolina University .

A jury in eastern Oklahoma has convicted a 27-year-old man of shooting dead his pregnant girlfriend and her unborn baby after she refused to get an abortion. The jury deliberated almost seven hours Thursday before convicting Christopher Kenyon Simpson, of Spiro, in the death of 20-year-old Ka'loni Flynn, of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The jurors recommended the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Simpson is scheduled to be sentenced November 8. Calous crime: Christopher Simpson (left) has been found guilty of gunning down his 20-year-old girlfriend, Ka'loni Flynn (right) and causing the death of her unborn baby . Prosecutors allege that Simpson, who has at least one child from a past relationship, shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another baby to support. A DNA expert testified that the 27-year-old fathered the 12-week-old fetus. ‘I'm glad it's over. I'm glad we got the verdict we got,’ said Flynn's father, Herbert Flynn. ‘She deserved it.’ During closing arguments, Crawford County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jacob Howell showed a photograph of Flynn's body in the driver's seat of car, with bullet wounds to her temple and forehead. Some audience members gasped loudly in shock. ‘We know that's how we got here,’ Howell said, indicating the photo. Prosecutors acknowledged that the case against Simpson was complicated and mostly circumstantial. Crime scene: Flynn was found dead in her parked car in LaFlore County on Easter Sunday last year . ‘I hope we showed you this was investigated thoroughly, and that every possible suspect was investigated and excluded except one,’ Howell said. Simpson's attorney, Warren Gotcher, argued that no witnesses could place Simpson at the crime scene and that his client was innocent. But prosecutor Anthony Evans said Simpson was trying to deflect blame because ‘the defendant has the spotlight on him, and it's hot, and he needs to get it off him. So what does he do? He pushes it over here. Desperate men do desperate things.’ Tragic loss: Flynn's parents say the 20-year-old aspiring nurse was excited about having a baby and did not believe in abortion . Flynn was discovered shot dead execution-style in her parked car on McGinnis Lane in LeFlore County at around 3am on April 9. In late June, police arrested Flynn's boyfriend, Christopher Simpson, on murder charges. According to a police affidavit, the couple had been dating for about three months when the 20-year-old found out she was pregnant. Simpson reportedly became angry when he learned that he was going to be a father again, but according to Flynn's dad, his daughter refused to end the pregnancy because she did not believe in abortion. Herbert Flynn Jr told the station 5News after Simpson's arrest that on the night of his daughter's murder, she was planning to meet with her boyfriend to ask for help in applying for government assistance. Around the time of the shooting, Simpson was late on child support payments for his 7-year-old daughter, and according to a local sheriff, he had made statements to his friends that he did not want another child. After Flynn's death, a witness told police that Simpson bragged to him that his girlfriend’s killing will never be solved because it was 'too clean' and 'the perfect murder.' The 20-year-old woman, who aspired to be a nurse, allegedly told a friend a short time before the slaying that Simpson had threatened to end the pregnancy for her if she refused to abort the baby.","Oklahoma jury recommended maximum sentence of life in prison for  Christopher Simpson, 27 .

Christopher Leggatt died of a heart attack after suffering a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is believed he would have survived if he had been able to have surgery quickly . A grieving daughter has accused the NHS of running a Monday to Friday service, blaming the death of her sport-loving father on Britain’s ‘healthcare lottery’. Christopher Leggatt, 65, died as he was being transferred between hospitals as there were no surgeons available at the first because it was a weekend. The father-of-four collapsed with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm as he refereed a football match - and had a 70 per cent chance of surviving a routine operation on it. But he suffered a heart attack in the ambulance taking him from Bradford Royal Infirmary to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. Paramedics managed to revive him but his heart stopped again before he could be operated on. His death was recorded at 6.15pm - two hours after he first arrived at Bradford Royal Infirmary. An inquest was triggered when his daughter Andrea, 43, lodged a formal complaint. After the case she said: ‘I don’t want my father to be another statistic. ‘I hope what has happened highlights the fact that the NHS as it stands is a Monday to Friday service. ‘If my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different. ‘If he had been operated on straight . away he would have most likely survived the operation but there were no . surgeons working at the hospital in Bradford that weekend. ‘He was taken to Bradford because it was the nearest hospital but they didn’t have the means to treat him. ‘At the time it was a real shock but I . am not angry with the hospitals or the staff involved with what . happened. It’s the system which needs to change. ‘The . healthcare service should not be part-time. I’m aware that the . Government needs to make cuts to save money but this should not be at . the expense of patients.’ She added: ‘Being angry and placing blame doesn’t bring my father back but I hope something good can come out of his death. ‘I hope that what happened might bring change to the system so another family doesn’t have to suffer like ours has. ‘It has completely destroyed our family and it was something that could have easily been avoided.’ When he collapsed, Mr Leggatt was rushed to Bradford Royal Infirmary. He was diagnosed quickly but the hospital did not have a surgeon on site as it was the weekend so he had to be transferred to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary. He died en route . Andrea, a company director, said despite sending a letter of complaint to the hospital, she has never received a response. She . said: ‘At the inquest I learnt that if there had been someone there to . operate, there was a 70 per cent chance he would have lived. ‘The operation is really simple and only takes around 40 minutes but it was the delay which killed him. ‘To treat a ruptured abdominal aortic . aneurysm it is like mending a pipe and the vast majority  of people . make a full recovery from it.’ The . inquest in Bradford last week heard that Mr Leggatt, a ‘well and active . man’ from Pool-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire, had been diagnosed within . 20 minutes of arriving at Bradford Royal Infirmary. Paul . Needham, a surgical registrar with the Bradford Teaching Hospitals . Trust at the time, said the transfer represented his best chance. He said: ‘Our vascular surgical cover that day was provided by Huddersfield. ‘Our view was that a blue-light ambulance transfer would be more rapid than having a surgeon driving across [to Bradford].” Consultant . vascular surgeon at Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, Anver . Mahomed, told the inquest that the two hospitals took turns to provide . acute care cover as part of a formal network arrangement. Mr Leggatt's daughter, Andrea, said: 'I hope what has happened highlights the fact that the NHS as it stands is a Monday to Friday service. If my father had collapsed on a weekday then the outcome would have been very different' Assistant Coroner Dominic Bell said: ‘I am satisfied the decision to transfer the patient, though clearly associated with some risk, was appropriate. ‘The original assumption that this death was from natural causes must still stand.’ But he also asked the Bradford Trust to examine and consider adopting the arrangements some other regions have where paramedics can, based on their diagnosis, take patients to the most appropriate, rather than nearest, hospital. He concluded: ‘The family will inevitably find it distressing to know that if the vascular surgery team had been at Bradford Mr Leggatt would have expected earlier surgery and, on the balance of probabilities, would have survived. ‘That, however, is not an issue that can appropriately be addressed by the individuals in this room.’ Mr Leggatt left a widow, Sue, and his daughter said his death had had a devastating impact on the whole family. She added: ‘My father was a very charitable man who would do anything for anyone. He was very family orientated and was very involved in community life. ‘He had worked for Leeds City Council for most of his life and he didn’t deserve this kind of treatment. ‘I hope that people in power will take note of this and make the NHS a 24/7 service. ‘I know the economy is in a bad way at the moment but savings should be made from elsewhere.’ Andrea said she now plans to contact Government ministers directly.","Christopher Leggatt, 65, collapsed with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm .

For many mothers-to-be and bashful husbands, they have been a ritual of pregnancy for decades and regarded as a source of invaluable skills. But the digital age and pressure of time is consigning antenatal classes to online tutorials. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out but critics are disappointed that the classes are being 'abandoned'. Parenting charity NCT said the move online will put parents at a disadvantage but York Hospital insists the virtual classes will allow expectant mothers to access important information. A hospital is to become the first in the country to replace antenatal lessons . with 'virtual classes' to be watched online. A drop in women going to classes - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to the decision . All of the same information will be available online with virtual classes filmed at the maternity suite at York Hospital showing its staff and labour rooms. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing, the early stages of labour, and explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief as well as breast feeding and what can be expected after birth. Midwife Sue Jackson said the films will familiarise the majority of women who are not going to classes with the staff and facilities. She said: 'It should open up the information available to women much more effectively than what we have at the moment. We have to make sure the service is appropriate and is being accessed appropriately.' York Hospital said antenatal classes will still be held for teenage mothers and women giving birth to more than one baby. The filmed classes will include learning about relaxation and breathing and the early stages of labour. They will also include an explanation of what happens in labour and information about pain relief, breast feeding and what can be expected after the birth . Women will continue to see a midwife who will answer any questions and give guidance. But the parenting charity NCT has said it is disappointed antenatal classes were being 'abandoned altogether'. Belinda Phipps, chief executive, said: 'There is currently no evidence to show that online courses are as good as traditional antenatal courses. 'Replacing the courses with an online-only system could put parents at a disadvantage. 'Antenatal education is not just about the transfer of information, but also the support you get from the parents that you meet.' York Hospital said other relevant information to mums will also be available on the site, including information about healthy eating and frequently asked questions.","A drop in women going to classes at York Hospital - currently attended by less than 25 per cent of mothers - has led to a decision to phase them out .

A leading figure in the art world asked friends to post a poignant blog entry explaining why she had chosen to end her own life after suffering from multiple sclerosis for almost a decade. Frances Medley, a former chief executive of the Arts Council of Wales, wrote the post, entitled A Sophisticated Sign Off, in the days before her death at the age of 44 on September 18. The emotional post, published on Ms Medley's Victorious Endeavours blog, read: 'The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain. 'I decided to end my life in a manner and at a time of my choosing. Ms Medley added: 'I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.' In the blog, Ms Medley describes how MS saw her decline from being a 'higher rate taxpayer responsible for running a public body' to not earning enough money to be eligible to pay any tax. She was diagnosed with the degenerative condition in 2005. She wrote: 'The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me. 'Without the financial support of my immediate family, I would have had to seek the support of the State. 'Whilst of course I was entitled to resort to this I found the prospect humiliating. 'Pride is a terrible thing, a real burden at times of need.' In the post, Ms Medley speaks of having 'peaked early on in life'.

A great-grandmother died in agony after staff at her care home failed to notice how much pain she was in. Margaret Hall, 78, was left screaming in pain and dying in the lounge of Eastbank Care Home in Glasgow without any pain relief. Bupa, the company that runs the home, has now apologised to the dementia sufferer’s family. Margaret Hall, 78, died in agony at Eastbank Care Home in Glasgow. She was left without any pain relief in the home's lounge because staff failed to notice she was dying . Once her condition was discovered, the home was unable to give her any drugs as the medication she needed was not kept on site because of ‘cost and wastage’, the Daily Record reports. On a previous occasion, staff at the home had also left Mrs Hall lying in a cold bath as they forgot she was there. He daughter, Elizabeth Peebles, 53, told the Daily Record: ‘We are just distraught over what mum went through. She went through hell.’ Mrs Hall, who left behind her husband, Eric Hall, 75, moved into the care home in 2009 when her dementia meant her family was no longer able to care for her. Her family say they repeatedly thought of calling the Care Commission but that they were worried about Mrs Hall being at the home while an investigation was under way. Ms Peebles explained that she wanted to complain but that there was nowhere else for her to go. She was found crying out in pain by her daughter, Elizabeth Peebles, 53. Ms Peebles asked for her mother to be given pain relief but was told the medication was not kept on site . She says she even considered putting an extra bed in her living room but that she could not afford not to work. Ms Peebles added that she once went to visit her mother and found her lying shivering in a freezing cold bath. She says that she had to help her mother out of the bath before warming her up with a hair dryer. Ms Peebles explained that on the day her mother died, she found her in a lounge packed full of people and clearly in terrible pain. She told the Daily Record: ‘I could instantly see the deathly colour of her. She was holding my hand really tightly, roaring with pain and clutching her chest. You could hear the crackle in her chest.’ Ms Peebles demanded to know why her mother had not been given any pain relief earlier but was told that the necessary medication was not kept at the home because of the cost. Mrs Hall died shortly after her daughter arrived and just before the medication she needed was delivered to the home. After Mrs Hall’s death, her family lodged five complaints with the care home. They say that she was given no pain relief when she was dying, that no end-of-life drugs were ordered for her, that she was left in the lounge when she was dying, that she was not given proper care for a mouth infection and that she was left in a cold bath. Bupa has written to the family and admitted fault in all five incidents. On another occasion, Ms Peebles found Mrs Hall lying shivering in a freezing cold bath because staff had forgotten she was there. Bupa has now apologised to Mrs Hall's family . Vivienne Birch, Director of Partnerships, Bupa Care Services said: ‘The care we provided to Mrs Hall did not meet the usual high standards we provide, and again we would like to send our apologies and condolences to her family. 'A thorough investigation revealed that there were concerns raised with regards to Mrs Hall’s general care including her pain relief, end of life care and oral care. 'As a result, the care home has taken action to ensure that all our residents’ needs are met at all times. For example, our staff have since received further training and supervision in end of life care. 'The health and well being of our residents remains our absolute priority.'","Margaret Hall was left without any pain relief and in a public part of the building when she was dying at Bupa's Eastbank Care Home in Glasgow .

A young boy suffers from a rare medical condition which his parents say makes him burst into tears every time he hears stirring music. Louis Mushrow, nine, has a genetic disorder which causes him to well up if he hears a love song. The schoolboy cries floods of tears whenever he listens to moving classical music or an emotional pop ballad. Louis Mushrow, nine, has Smith-Magenis Syndrome - a rare genetic disorder caused by an abnormality in chromosome 17. His parents say the condition means he cries every time he hears stirring music . Louis’ parents say he breaks down if soulful tunes come on the radio and if he hears them being played in a shop. But Louis isn’t sad - the melodies trigger just the part of the brain which controls the emotions which cause him to sob uncontrollably. His mother Lisa, 40, said: ‘Certain music always makes him cry, especially classical music or pop songs about love. ‘People sometimes think he’s crying because he’s upset. ‘We found out it’s because certain music releases all these emotions in his brain. ‘We can’t really explain it - it’s just the way his brain is wired up.’ Louis (pictured with his mother, Lisa) cries floods of tears whenever he listens to moving classical music or an emotional pop ballad . Mrs Mushrow said: 'Certain music always makes him cry, especially classical music or pop songs about love. People sometimes think he's crying because he's upset. We found out it's because certain music releases all these emotions in his brain' Louis, born six weeks premature, was diagnosed with Smith-Magenis Syndrome which affects only one in every 25,000 people. His family, who live in Hawarden, North Wales, only realised the impact music has on him when he started crying during the Welsh national anthem. They want to raise awareness of the condition which was only discovered in the 1980s. Mother-of-three Mrs Mushrow added: ’Louis is a lovely boy but we have had some nasty comments from people. Louis (pictured with his father, Martin, brother, Adam, and sister, Hannah) was born six weeks early and was diagnosed with SMS when he was nine-weeks-old . ‘Once when we were in a shopping centre he was on the floor screaming when a gentleman said to us: “Sort your son out”. ‘I can only go to the supermarket for a few things at a time as he can’t cope with too much at once. ‘You get dirty looks and people tell you to control your child. But Louis can’t help it. ‘People don’t understand because he doesn’t look like he has special needs. People look at us and think we’re bad parents. ‘That’s why I want to raise awareness about it - there could be other parents who might not be aware their child has the syndrome. Mr and Mrs Mushrow are trying to raise awareness of SMS because they feel Louis' future will be easier if people understand his condition . ‘We were lucky that Louis had the genetic tests at nine-weeks-old and that meant we’ve been able to get specialist help for him.’ Smith-Magenis Syndrome is a genetic disability caused by an abnormality of chromosome 17. The main features of the syndrome include mild to moderate intellectual disability, disturbed sleep patterns and behavioural problems. These behaviour problems can be exhibited in a variety of ways, including frequent temper tantrums, impulsivity, anxiety, distractibility, aggression and self-hitting and self-biting. There is no cure for Louis' condition but his family hope with more research and continued education he will be able to finish school . SMS is typically not inherited and people with the condition most often have no history of the condition in their family. Mrs Mushrow, and her husband Martin, 41, recently took part in a country-wide fundraiser for the Jeans for Genes charity that raises money for children with genetic disorders. The couple have two other children Adam, 14 and Hannah, three, who are not affected by the condition. There is no cure for Louis’ condition but his family hope with more research and continued education he will be able to finish school. Mrs Mushrow said: ‘I hope that he’ll go on to college one day. I just want him to be safe and happy.’ Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. The major features of this condition include mild to moderate learning disabilities, distinctive facial features, sleep disturbances, and behavioral problems. Individuals with Smith-Magenis Syndrome also have a short flat head, prominent forehead, broad square face, deep-set eyes, underdeveloped midface, broad nasal bridge, short nose, tented upper lip, and a chin that is small in infancy and becomes relatively prominent with age. These facial differences can be subtle in early childhood, but they usually become more distinctive in later childhood and adulthood. During infancy these children often have feeding problems, failure to thrive, weak muscle tone, prolonged napping and lethargy. Later in childhood and adulthood they can develop disturbed sleep patterns (difficulty falling asleep, regular waking throughout the night and sleepiness in the day), as well as behavioural problems. These behaviour problems can be displayed in a variety of ways, including frequent temper tantrums, impulsivity, anxiety, aggression and self-injurious behaviours including self-hitting, self-biting, and skin picking. Smith-Magenis Syndrome affects an estimated one in 25,000 individuals. The syndrome is caused by an abnormality in the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 and is sometimes called the 17p- syndrome.

His mother, Natasha, had expressed concerns about his reluctance to feel and his abnormal crying . A woman claims midwives treated her as an ‘anxious new mum’ just hours before her newborn son died in hospital. Jared McDowall died at St Michael’s Hospital in Bristol on January 17 last year, two days after he was born by emergency Caesarean section. Avon Coroner’s Court heard his mother, Natasha, mentioned to hospital staff that her son was reluctant to feed and was crying unusually. Mrs McDowall, of Longwell Green, Bristol, said she was ‘sick with worry’ over her son’s condition, but midwives simply dismissed her concerns as ‘paranoia’. Just hours later, Mrs McDowall discovered her son, who weighed six pounds, floppy and lifeless in his cot. Resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at 2.45am. An inquest into Jared’s death heard a root cause analysis investigation (RCA) found four failures in his care, including failures to recognise poor feeding and unusual crying. The hearing was told it was not possible to ascertain an exact cause of death, but Jared could have suffered from hypoglycaemia - low blood sugar - which may have triggered his loss of consciousness. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin, who reached a narrative conclusion, is writing a report referencing ways to improve care at St Michael’s Hospital raised during the inquest. ‘It is of note that the recorded observations were generally normal and staff did not have concerns about Jared’s progress,’ she said. ‘The parents did have concerns about his feeding and his crying and raised these with staff. ‘The staff said his level of feeding was typical for normal babies and not of concern to them. ‘In . relation to his crying, they did not believe it caused any concern and . were reassured when his observations came back as normal.’ Ms . Voisin said she considered reaching a conclusion of neglect but heard . no evidence of ‘gross failures’ in Jared’s care by hospital staff. She . will now write a report to the hospital following comments by Dr David . Harding, who made a number of recommendations to the inquest. These included a graph showing birth . weight and gestation, better synthesis between doctors and midwives and . education packs for hypoglycaemia. Natasha and Shaun McDowall say they were treated like 'anxious new parents' when they expressed their concerns about Jared to midwives . The inquest was told Jared was born weighing 2.7kg - 200g under the ‘low birth weight’ of 2.5kg - by Caesarean section at St Michael’s Hospital at 2.57am on January 15 2012. He appeared to be doing well for the first 24 hours, but the following morning, Mrs McDowall noticed he was crying in a ‘jerky way’ and was reluctant to feed. Mrs McDowall told the inquest she reported her concerns to midwife Natasha Bridge but was made to feel like an ‘anxious new mum’ and was reassured that her son was fine. ‘I was sick with worry and felt I was being treated as a paranoid mother,’ she said. ‘At the time I felt I was being brushed off.’ Both Jared and Mrs McDowall were examined through the day but all observations returned as normal, with a second midwife also reassuring the family. But in the early hours of the . following morning, Mrs McDowall discovered Jared ‘floppy and lifeless’ in his cot and rushed him to the midwife station for help. ‘I repeated that he was ill all day and none of them had listened to me,’ she said. ‘The alarm sounded and a lot of medical staff came rushing to Jared’s aid.’ An inquest into Jared's death heard that the cause of his death could not be formally established but that he could have had low blood sugar. Mr and Mrs McDowall are pictured arriving at the inquest . Resuscitation efforts did not succeed and Jared was pronounced dead at 2.45am. Pathologist Dr Craig Platt said post-mortem tests showed Jared had high insulin levels but could not ascertain his glucose levels before resuscitation, meaning it was impossible to say whether he was hypoglycaemic. He said the cause of death was ‘unexpected death of a neonate’ but that Jared’s raised insulin levels, low birth weight, a pulmonary haemorrhage and abnormalities in his pancreas - which could suggest a problem regulating insulin levels - should also be recorded. Mrs McDowall told the inquest: ‘I feel completely let down by the medical professionals at St Michael’s Hospital, particularly the midwifery team who failed to listen to my concerns.’ Midwife Natasha Bridge, who qualified six months earlier, said there were ‘no warning triggers’ to refer Jared to a different ward or care team. Experienced colleagues agreed with her observations and said Jared appeared healthy, with his feeding chart similar to other newborns. But Jared had four feeds in a 24 hour . period - one breast feed and three 10ml servings of formula - two fewer . than recommended, the inquest was told. Staff also considered his cry to be ‘unusual’ but not ‘abnormal’, which would have been noted on medical charts. Mrs McDowall told the inquest: 'I feel completely let down by the medical professionals at St Michael's Hospital (pictured), particularly the midwifery team who failed to listen to my concerns' Sarah Windfeld, head of midwifery at the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, said charts now featured ‘unusual crying’ as a result of Jared’s death. Observations had also been increased, there was more supervision, extra training and support had been offered to staff and clearer ways to escalate concerns introduced, she added. Speaking after the inquest, Jared’s parents Natasha, 37, who works in HR, and Shaun, 43, an IT consultant, said they had suffered with depression after his death. Mrs McDowall said: ‘We were absolutely disgusted at the care Jared and I were given and it has been very hard to relive the events during the inquest. ‘Shaun and I knew something was seriously wrong with Jared and I was becoming more and more concerned because he wouldn’t feed, but the midwives made me feel like I was overreacting and that I was wasting their time. Jared was born by emergency Caesarean section at St Michael's Hospital at 2.57am on January 15 2012. He weighed just 6lbs (picture is posed by models) ‘Jared was our first baby and we were so excited to bring him back to our family home but we never got chance to do this. His death still affects us every day and I’m not sure we’ll ever come to terms with it. ‘To be honest, what happened made us lose all faith in maternity services and we were terrified the same thing would happen again if I became pregnant. ‘We just hope that Jared’s death was not in vain and that improvements are made in observational charts and training to ensure no other family has to go through the same ordeal. ‘Nothing can bring Jared back but seeing improvements in maternity services might help us to begin the process of accepting what happened.’ Mr and Mrs McDowall have instructed medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate Jared’s death. Julie Lewis, a partner at Irwin Mitchell’s Bristol office, who represents the family, said: ‘We will now continue to work on behalf of Natasha and Shaun in liaising with the Trust to secure an admission of responsibility which we hope will help them to begin to come to terms with what happened and begin to rebuild their lives.’","Jared McDowall was born at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol .

They had to judge when each was ready by their own personal signals. Kabuki would excrete. King's father, Maku, would become violently aggressive. The zoo had to wait over a year for the highly-anticipated birth as rhino pregnancies last for 16 months. Finally, on August 26, King arrived, and on Tuesday he made his public debut. Named after King Harris, a longtime Lincoln Park Zoo supporter and member of the Board of Trustees, the baby has a lot to live up to. But the zookeepers said he will have no trouble with that - within minutes of his first public appearance he was adventurously roaming around the yard, sniffing out new scents. Critical: WWF have issued severe warnings worldwide to protect the unique species since European settlers went on a poaching spree . The black rhinoceros - or hook-lipped rhino - hails from Cameroon, Kenya and South Africa. Critically endangered, they have a distinctive curved upper lip that poachers target. Their road to obliteration started when European settlers caught sight of their distinctive feature and rushed to bring them back home. By the 1960s they had disappeared from most countries, including Angola, Botswana, Chad, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, Sudan, and Zambia - with just 70,000 still alive. Nonetheless, a poaching epidemic started in 1970. Almost every one living outside zoos and national parks was killed for trade. Within 10 years, their population had decreased by 90 per cent. Experts declared there to be just 2,475 alive in 1993, but a population surge in South Africa and Namibia balanced the figures years later. There were just 4,880 of them in February this year. They typically have two horns - the longest is usually 50cm-long - and live to around 50 years old. Black rhinos are solitary characters, although males often form groups of 12 where possible. Mothers and daughters stay together for years.","Three-week-old King, an eastern black rhino, weighed 60lb at birth .

Are you a Geordie girl with a penchant for clutch bags or a Londoner toting a gargantuan piece of designer arm candy? If so, you're inadvertently telling people where you come from, according to a new study which revealed that your choice of bag corresponds with your postcode. According to the research, more than 60 per cent of northern fashion followers 'glam it up' throughout the day and into the evening, while for southerners, bigger is always better. Southerners such as Victoria Beckham prefer big bags while Cheryl Cole inspired northerners prefer clutches . Three out of four London ladies choose oversized tote bags, perhaps inspired by the likes of style guru Victoria Beckham, who is regularly pictured with Hermes Birkins and Louis Vuitton over-sized Speedys. Debenhams, which conducted the research, put the trend down to women who live in London working longer hours, many without access to a car therefore needing an extra-large handbag. Natelle Baddeley, head of accessories at Debenhams, said: 'We are noticing a new trend among Londoners known as the ""24 hour"" handbag. 'Size is everything so it's the bigger the better. Northerners are all about the sexy clutch bag, channelling their inner Cheryl Cole and packing all their essentials into a small bag that can take them from desk to dance floor.' Meanwhile women in the Midlands are more practical with 72 per cent of them investing in a long lasting, mid-sized handbag that works for every occasion - much like local girl Cat Deeley. The handbag map of the UK: Northern Ireland likes hobo bags while the Midlands are all for mid-sized totes . Practical: Scottish women love a stylish satchel while their Cambrian cousins prefer a sporty rucksack . Safety-savvy Scots opt for a crossbody bag - a female version of the wallet chain - which allows them to carry no more than a credit card and a lip gloss. Women in Ireland have been buying 'fuss free shoulder bags' which are perfect for busy first-time mums such as The Saturdays singer Una Healy. Debenhams say the shoulder bag is a more compact version of the '24 hour Londoners' choice, acting as a bottomless pit stashed full of almost every essential. Welsh women cut the fittest figures with two-thirds (68 per cent) leaning towards sport bags and backpacks like marathon loving local Katherine Jenkins. Professor Karen Pine, of the University of Hertfordshire, said: 'In recent times the handbag seems to have become the ultimate statement piece for women. 'Ladies are signalling their status, and many do that via the handbag they choose. This research also demonstrates how the bag we carry, like the clothes we wear, reflects our personality. 'The handbag has become an integral part of a woman's wardrobe and a significant part of her identity. 'The contents of her bag are highly personal and the style of bag is a shorthand way of saying, ""This is who I am"", whether that's career woman, sporty or practical type.' SCOTLAND .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 18:12 EST, 21 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:01 EST, 21 July 2013 . Ted Cruz, the ultra-conservative Freshman senator from Texas, joined other prominent Republicans in Iowa this weekend leading many to speculate that he is looking at a run for president in 2016. Iowa is the first state to hold primary elections, which makes it a popular stop for prospective runners to familiarize themselves with the locals. In an interview with ABC News, Cruz dodged the 2016 question. Potential candidate: U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was in Iowa this weekend for a Republican Party fundraiser, and his presence may indicate that he's eyeing a presidential run in 2016 . 'I'm not focused on the politics...the last office I was elected to was student council. So this has been a bit of a whirlwind,' Cruz said. But many are questioning whether the staunch conservative is even eligible for the office, since Cruz was born in Canada. The U.S. constitution states that only 'natural born citizens' are eligible to occupy the office of president - a term that the constitution does not define. Though he was born on foreign soil, both of his parents were U.S. citizens which would have automatically made him a citizen as well. And though he walked around the presidential run question, he did seem confident in his eligibility. 'My mother was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She was a U.S. citizen, so I'm a U.S. citizen,' he said. Cruz said he would not engage in a legal debate about his citizenship. 'The facts are clear,' Cruz said. 'I can tell you where I was born and who my parents were. And then as a legal matter, others can worry about that.' There has been debate over whether children of American parents born outside of the country are officially natural born citizens. For example, Arizona Senator John McCain faced similar questions about his eligibility for the office of president since he was born on a naval base in the Panama Canal Zone. Since McCain was taken seriously as a candidate in 2008, Cruz's Canadian birth might not be an issue. But his foreign birth, and the fact that his father emigrated from Cuba, are interesting in the perspective of Cruz's opposition to immigration reform. The American Dream: Cruz with his Cuban emigre father Rafael . Cruz has been an outspoken critic of the immigration bill currently going through Congress, especially the fact that it opens up a pathway to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S. The bill is being pushed by Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio - another early contender for the Republican nomination. 'I think a path to citizenship for those who are here illegally is profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules,' Cruz said. Cruz has only been in the Senate for six months, drawing comparisons to President Obama who was only a freshman Senator when he was considered in 2004 as a possible contender for the 2008 elections. In his brief career as a senator, Cruz has become a controversial figure in congress - alienating senators in both parties for his confrontational style. Cruz is an opponent to abortion and a supporter of the second-amendment right to bear arms. He believes that President Obama used the school shooting in Sandy Hook as an 'excuse' to push an anti-gun agenda. Conservative to the core: Cruz is unapologetically conservative. He's pro-life and a supporter of the second amendment right to bear arms . He believes the reason Obama was elected in 2008 was because Republicans had lost their way and weren't standing by their principles. In order to win the White House in 2016, Cruz believes the party needs a candidate who is fiercely conservative. 'If you look at the last 40 years, a consistent pattern emerges. Anytime Republicans nominate a candidate for president who runs as a strong conservative, we win.  And when we nominate a moderate who doesn't run as a conservative, we lose.'","The new senator joined other prominent Republicans in Iowa this weekend for a fundraiser .
Cruz was born to American citizens in Canada, where they were working for an oil company at the time ."

Stefano Ampollini, a 56-year-old Italian, conned a casino out of £60,000 pounds in one night using cards marked in infrared. File picture . A poker player was sentenced to two years in prison yesterday after using infra-red contact lenses and cards marked with invisible ink to win games. The high-tech scam saw Stefano Ampollini, a 56-year-old Italian nicknamed ‘Parmesan’, rake in up to £60,000 pounds in one night at an upmarket casino in Cannes, on the French Riviera. Describing himself as a ‘player and cheat with an international reputation’, Ampollini told a criminal court in nearby Grasse that he was proud of his ‘work’. He used insiders at ‘Les Princes’ casino to mark cards with the invisible ink, and could then ‘read’ them using the contact lenses, which he bought in China for around £1,800. Ampollini always sat opposite another accomplice, another Italian codenamed ‘The Israeli’, who sniffed or snorted to signal what cards Ampollini should choose. The complicated scam enabled Ampollini to ‘control the game’ without being caught, he said. Marc Concas, barrister for the owners of the casino, said: ‘Security found his behaviour rather strange as he won very easily and, above all, because he folded twice when he had an excellent hand, suggesting he knew the croupier’s cards.’ It was at this point that police were called, and detectives launched an immediate investigation along with casino staff. Telephone intercepts proved staff had handed cards over to the Italians, who had marked them with invisible ink. They were then placed under cellophane and returned to a casino cupboard, ready to be used during games. The casino where Ampollini employed his scam. He used insiders there to mark cards with the invisible ink . 'Parmesan' was aided in his criminal endeavours by an accomplice known as 'The Israeli'. File picture .

'As far as me and Diana and the tango dance that we had, I always say she just wanted some of my deliciousness,' Augustus joked to reporters. 'I was just trying to make sweet love. That's about it,' Taurasi told reporters during a post game press conference. Minnesota won 85-65. Taurasi commented on the opposition's win by saying, 'they took care of home court.' The outward display of affection left fans wondering if the kiss was just a joke or if it meant something more. The two players are not strangers. According to announcers, the two have been playing against one another since they were teenagers. Taurasi and Seimone were also not always on opposite teams. The two were teammates on the gold medal-winning US Olympic team in London. The sexual orientation of Taurasi is unknown, but in an interview with WNBA.com after being asked by a fan whether or not she had a boyfriend she said, 'I do NOT have a boyfriend, but I am looking for someone who is rich, is about 6-8 and drives a BMW 745 li.' When asked if she has a celebrity crush, Taurasi answered, 'Yes, WNBA President Donna Orender.'

A 14-year-old rape victim was allegedly forced to strip at a police station to prove she was sexually assaulted. It is alleged that when the teen arrived at the station in the Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, she was asked to remove her clothes in front of a male police officer. According to the Times of India, the teen said she was ordered to do so to convince him that her allegations of rape were genuine and not false. Accusation: A police officer, pictured, allegedly asked a rape victim to removed her clothes to prove her claim was true when she reported the crime . The incident happened on Saturday when the teenager attended the police station with her parents to report that she had been raped by a local resident. When the victim's father failed to pay a 50,000 rupee fee demanded by police on duty, officers refused to process her report. The girl was then told to strip, it is claimed. Following the family's complaint this week, the alleged rapist has reportedly been arrested. The police officer accused of forcing the girl to strip is said to now be under investigation. Rape and sexual assault remain a serious problem in the region. According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, one woman is believed to be raped every 20 minutes in the country.

Fruit coolers and frappucinos might sound healthy but it seems they aren't quite as good for you as they claim, after new research revealed that both have more sugar than a Krispy Kreme doughnut. An analysis of some of the most sugary products sold in Britain found that a large red berry 'fruit cooler' from Costa Coffee contains 97.1g of sugar, the equivalent to 24 teaspoons. By contrast, a Krispy Kreme original glazed doughnut contains just 7g of sugar - more than 13 times less than the Costa drink. Problem: Hidden sugar in so called 'healthy' foods and drinks is becoming an increasingly weighty issue . The extreme example comes as a new report brands Britain 'the fattest country in Europe' - raising concern about the threat to health from excessive sugar consumption. Around one in four British people are classified as obese, according to the report by investment bank Credit Suisse. The report estimates that obesity and related diseases cost the worldwide healthcare system £372 billion a year. Eight out of 10 doctors in a global survey considered that sugar consumption was linked to the development of obesity and type II diabetes. The recommended maximum daily consumption of added and intrinsic sugars is 90g for a woman and 120g for a man. However, the Credit Suisse report points out that it can be difficult to restrict consumption because some popular daily staples - from Starbucks drinks to muffins - can contain more sugar than several doughnuts. Too sweet: Costa Coffee's fruit cooler (not pictured) has 13 times more sugar than a Krispy Kreme doughnut . Calorific: Although their frappucino has more sugar than a doughnut, Starbucks say they do enough . Epidemic: Currently, 62 per cent of the British population is overweight according to NHS figures . A sample of products revealed that Costa's fruit cooler contains more sugar than a woman's recommended daily allowance. One of the reasons for the large quantities of sugar in drinks sold in coffee chains is the big cup sizes.A large drink in Costa Coffee, known as a Massimo, contains 610ml of liquid - more than a pint. A large Starbucks coffee frappuccino (590ml), without whipped cream, contains 61.6g of sugar, equivalent to that found in more than 20 original McVitie's digestive biscuits. A bowl of Crunchy Nut cornflakes with milk (17g of sugar) and a Burger King Whopper (11g of sugar) each contain more sugar than a Krispy Kreme glazed doughnut. Jack Winkler, an academic and campaigner against excessive sugar in the diet, said: 'We have got used to these highly sweetened foods because they sell so well, but this needs to be changed. We are eating too much sugar and we are paying the price.' He said some firms, including Heinz and Kellogg, had reformulated foods but further action was required. He said artificial sweeteners were already widely used in soft drinks, and the food industry should consider using them in other products. There is controversy over the link between the consumption of sugar and serious ailments, such as heart disease and diabetes. The sugar industry says there is no evidence of any proven link, but some doctors consider the risk to health has been underestimated for years. Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and writer, said: 'Added sugar has no nutritional value and we don't need it. 'The evidence suggests that fat is not as harmful as we once believed and there is mounting evidence that sugar is a threat to health.' A report published earlier this year found that sugar consumption was associated with diabetes II. Another, by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, called for a 20 per cent increase in the cost of sugary drinks and fewer fast food outlets near schools. A spokesman for Starbucks said: 'Starbucks was one of the first high street retailers to display calorie content on our menu boards and we provide customers with a choice of lighter options.' A spokesman for Costa Coffee said: 'Costa takes the nutritional balance of all its food and drink very seriously. 'We have increased the quality of information available and have carried out a lot of work to find ways to reduce fat, calories and sugar levels.'","Costa Coffee's 'fruit cooler' was the most sugary with 97.1g per portion .

The rate of Americans picking up and moving each year is near a record low despite indications last year that the recession-era trend might be improving. Census data showed an improvement last year in people moving from one house to another. The important indicator of economic strength saw record highs during the boom years and the improvement was cause for optimism in the country’s besieged housing sector. But the bump now appears to have been short-lived as 2013 data sinks back to near 2011’s lows. Downward trend: Americans move far less than they did in the years leading up to and during the housing bubble and the trend is improving only sluggishly . According to data assembled by Trulia, post-housing bubble lows came in 2011 when 11.6 percent of Americans picked up and moved. Back during the 1950s and 1960s—as families moved en masse to booming cities in California and elsewhere in the West—the rate hovered around 20 percent each year. Leading up to and during the housing bubble of the early 2000s, that number had surged back to around 17 percent each year. But in 2013, that number was a meager 11.7 percent. Higher than 2011 stats, though not by much. Golden years: In the 1950s and 1960s, some 20 percent of Americans moved each year, but those rates no longer break 12 percent . Improvement? Moving for all reasons is down from pre-housing bubble numbers, while moving for a job is slightly up from the 2010-2011 data . Data from 2012 indicated a rise with 12 percent of people moving, making 2013’s poor showing all the more depressing for Americans hopeful for an accelerating economic recovery. Though, the data has not been all bad in 2013. While short-distance, intra-county moves are at an all-time low of 7.5 percent this year, longer distance moves are slightly up from 2011 and 2010. However, the explanation for this could be disheartening. While short-distance moves are for people looking for new or better homes—a leading force behind the American economy—longer-distance moves across counties and states tend to be more for those in search of work. While this suggests that the job market is picking up ahead of the housing market, both indicate a sluggish recovery. The rates of longer-distance moves, while improved from 2010-2011, are still far lower than pre-housing bubble levels. Recovery? A 2011 map shows state-to-state moves, a trend that indicates moves for better jobs. Moves for better housing are at all-time lows, which indicates a continued sluggish housing recovery .","In the 1950s and 1960s, 20 percent of Americans moved each year -- in 2013, only 11.7 percent moved ."

United Nations weapons inspectors are . investigating reports that three further chemical weapons attacks were . carried out in Syria after the 21 August Damascus incident, which . sparked threats of international military strikes. A UN statement said that a total of . seven alleged incidents of chemical weapons use were under . investigation, and that an inspection team currently in the country was . meant to wrap up its investigation on Monday. Attacks are alleged to have included chemical agents in . Khan al-Assal on March 19, Sheikh Maqsoud on April 13, Saraqeb on April . 29, Ghouta on August 21, Bahhariyeh on August 22, Jobar on August 24, . and Ashrafiah Sahnaya on August 25. More chemical attacks: A convoy of vehicles carrying UN inspectors crosses into Lebanon from Syria. They are investigating allegations that there were further Chemical weapons attacks in the war-torn region in late August . The revelation of further chemical . attacks comes on the day that the UN was set to discuss a disarmament . plan for the war-torn country, which could see a full inspection . programme of Syria's chemical arsenal begin by Tuesday. After the US and Russia agreed to the . text of a draft agreement for the disarmament of the country, the . executive council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical . Weapons (OPCW) are to discuss an inspection programme tonight. Chemical weapons watchdog will discuss Friday a disarmament plan for Syria that calls for inspections of the civil war-torn country's chemical arsenal to begin by Tuesday. US-led inspections: Secretary of State John Kerry, who inadvertently initiated the plan to relieve Syria of its chemical weapons, and Ahmed Asi Al-Jerba, president of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, at the UN yesterday . The OPCW has authorised inspectors to look at 'any other site identified by a State Party as having been involved in the Syrian chemical weapons programme, unless deemed unwarranted by the Director-General'. That goes beyond usual practice, as the organisation has only previously inspected sites that have been declared by UN member states. It further lays out the target of destroying all of Syria's chemical weapons and equipment by 'the first half of 2014'. The disarmament plan represents a significant breakthrough and rare unity between Russia, which has supported Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, and the US. Fighting continues: A fighter in the Free Syrian Army fires from a defensive position in Aleppo's Sheikh Saeed neighbourhood, where conventional fighting is continuing with government forces . A celebration before battle: Syrian rebels clap and dance in a household ahead of returning to the battlefront around Aleppo International Airport . According to the plan, Damascus must provide more detailed information on its arsenal within a week of the decision being approved. Syria must provide: the name and quantity of all chemicals in its weapons stockpile; the type of and quantity of munitions that can be used to fire chemical weapons; the location of the weapons, storage facilities and production facilities; and the destruction of all chemical weapons production and mixing or filling equipment. The decision calls on Syria to 'co-operate fully with all aspects of the implementation of this decision, including providing the OPCW personnel with the immediate and unfettered right to inspect any and all sites in the Syrian Arab Republic.' Airstrike: Smoke rises from the ruins of buildings in Homs, which are still the setting of fierce fighting between rebels and forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad . Struggling to carry on: Residents of Syria's eastern town of Deir Ezzor walk past the debris of a building reportedly hit by a missile yesterday . The recent flurry of diplomatic activity was triggered by the August 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds of civilians in a Damascus suburb, and President Barack Obama's subsequent threat to use military force. When US Secretary of State John Kerry said Syria could avert US military action by turning over 'every single bit of his chemical weapons' to international control within a week, Russia quickly agreed. Mr Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signed an agreement in Geneva on September 13 to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control for later destruction, and the Syrian government accepted and quickly signed up to Chemical Weapons Convention. Syrian activists say a car bomb near a mosque in a town north of Damascus has killed at least 30 people. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group that monitors the crisis, says the explosion struck as worshippers at the al-Sahel mosque in Rankous were leaving after Friday prayers. Observatory’s director Rami Abdul-Rahman says dozens of people were also wounded in the bombing.","Inspectors sifting through evidence for seven alleged chemical attacks .

An ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently. The UltraBike unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side, via vibrating buttons beneath each thumb. The device, which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of any bike, was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur Paul Clark. Independence: Visually impaired cyclists line up . to use the Ultrabike, which uses ultrasound sensors to give . the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each . side via vibrating handlebar buttons . It uses the same obstacle detection capability in the award winning UltraCane, an electronic mobility aid that is used by people with sight loss all over the world. The UltraCane mimics the echolocation abilities of bats and was featured on the BBC documentary series Miracles of Nature, fronted by Richard Hammond in 2012. The programme makers approached Dr Clark’s company Comms Design, to adapt the UltraCane technology for use on a bicycle that could be tested with a blind rider. Mastermind: Dr Paul Clark, the inventor behind the Ultrabike, poses with his Ultracane device, which uses the same fundamental technology . Dan Smith, who had been a keen cyclist before losing his sight, was shown on the programme steering a straight course through a heavily wooded cycle path using the first UltraBike. Since the programme, Sound Foresight Technology has made the kits more widely available, to give groups of visually impaired riders the opportunity to try an UltraBike, most notably at a world first event run by Life Cycle UK in Bristol, on a specially constructed cycle track. Dr Clark commented: 'The UltraBike is not suitable for visually impaired road cyclists because road drivers assume a cyclist can see, so this is clearly too hazardous. 'It is designed for use in a supervised and controlled environment and has great potential for use in sport and velodrome settings in particular. We are now looking at specific enhancements to the technology for this purpose.' Sound Foresight Technology is currently working with sports organisations around the country to run UltraBike events. The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow have both already shown an interest. Anyone else can go and see the device for themselves at London’s Science Museum, where it is part of a new exhibition highlighting innovative engineering that transforms lives.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said they had made the 'very personal' decision to have their son, Prince George, christened in the chapel where Prince William's mother's body lay before she was buried. In a break with Royal tradition, the couple have chosen to hold an ‘intimate’ ceremony at the Chapel Royal of St James's Palace - where the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, lay before the altar for a week before her burial in 1997 so her family could pay their last respects. Only closest family and friends will be present at the christening, which will take place on October 23,  conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. Christening: Prince George was born on July 22 and is third in line to the throne . The couple chose the venue over the Music Room at Buckingham Palace - where Prince William, Prince Charles, Prince Andrew and Princess Anne were all baptised - and the private chapel of the royal residence, where the Queen herself was christened. It is understood that William and Kate favoured the Holbein-decorated . Chapel Royal because it is, in the words of one royal aide, ‘an . historic, quite intimate chapel.’ ‘It is something they have been thinking about for some time and they just very much liked personally,’ they said. In . a statement last night, Kensington Palace said: ‘Their Royal Highnesses . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce the . christening of Prince George will take place on Wednesday, 23rd October . at The Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace.’ The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was looking forward to welcoming Prince George into the 'family of the church' in a statement released today . The . couple have long made clear they aren’t sticklers for royal convention: . whether it be William ripping up the suggested 700-strong guest for his . wedding because he ‘hardly knew anyone on it’ or their decision to . release a family snapshot of George taken by Kate’s father, Michael . Middleton, instead of a formal portrait following his birth on July 22. And the couple have other personal links to St James’s Palace, where until recently their Household was based. And . in April 2011, Kate chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the . Church of England before her marriage to Prince William. The last official royal christening to take place at St James’s Palace was that of Princess Beatrice in December 1988. It . is likely that the Prince George will be christened in a replica . Honiton lace gown of that worn by Queen Victoria's eldest daughter in . 1841. The original intricate . lace and satin christening robe was specially crafted for Victoria, the . Princess Royal, and used by generation after generation of royal . infants including William himself. Prince Edward’s daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, was the last royal baby to wear the delicate ensemble in 2004. The Queen then commissioned an identical handmade copy so the 172-year historic outfit could be carefully preserved. It was made by the Queen's dresser Angela Kelly and her team of dressmakers at Buckingham Palace. Tearing up the rule book: The couple have long made clear they aren't sticklers for royal convention . The . Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will attend next month’s christening along . with the Prince of Wales, a grandfather for the first time, and the . Duchess of Cornwall. Kate's . family - parents Carole and Michael Middleton – will also be invited . along with the godparents, who have not yet been publicly named. In . line with royal tradition, George is likely to have six god-parents and . among the names in the frame are William’s best friend Thomas Van . Straubenzee, his former private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton and . ex-nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Several of Kate’s friends are also in the running, along with her sister, Pippa, and brother James. The . christening will also allow a truly historic family photo to be taken – . and released to the public - no doubt delighting the 87-year-old Queen. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will attend next month's christening of the third in line . For the first time in more . than a century, three heirs to the throne are alive: Prince Charles, . 64, Prince William, 31 and new-born George. The . last occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria . was photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great . grandson Edward VIII. The . existence of a Chapel Royal itself dates back many centuries and, . originally, was not a building but an establishment: a body of priests . and singers to serve the spiritual needs of the Sovereign. During . Tudor times the Chapel would follow the Sovereign around the country to . whichever Palace or great house was in favour at the time. Since Whitehall Palace burned down in the late 17th century the Chapel Royal has been based exclusively at St James's Palace. The . actual building was originally constructed by Henry VIII and decorated . by Hans Holbein in honour of the king's fourth marriage to Anne of . Cleves. Mary I's heart is . buried beneath the choir-stalls and it was where Elizabeth I said her . prayers for the defence of the realm against the threat of the Spanish . Armada in 1588. At the end . of the Civil War, Charles I also received the Sacrament of Holy . Communion in the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace before his execution . in Whitehall in 1649. Three special coins will be made to mark the Prince George's christening, the Royal Mint has announced. A gold kilo coin, a silver £5 coin and a 'more affordable' £5 coin have been approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen and the Chancellor. Birthday money: This £5 coin was previously issued by the Royal Mint to mark the birth of the Royal baby . This will be the first time that new coins have been produced in the UK to mark the christening of a member of the Royal Family. Details of the prices and how many will be created have yet to be announced. Shane Bissett, of The Royal Mint, said: 'The Royal Mint has celebrated moments of national significance for over 1,000 years and it was felt appropriate to produce the first-ever set of Royal christening coins to mark the christening of our future king. 'As a British institution, The Royal Mint has played a central role creating works of art as official commemorations of landmarks in the history of the Royal Family for hundreds of years. These coins will be a fitting addition to that long tradition.' A £5 silver proof coin has already been issued to mark the birth of the future heir to the throne and other commonwealth countries including Canada and New Zealand have also issued coins to commemorate the birth. The £5 Royal Birth coin was priced at £80 from the Royal Mint, and is currently sold out. Queen .

'People would come in on bicycles -- wearing all of the clothes they had, coming in with $2, $3 max,' he told NBC2. 'I wasn't actually stealing.

Charged: Michael Lander, 40, will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008 . A woman whose husband allegedly convinced her to adopt a 12-year-old . girl he is accused of sexually assaulting blames . herself for the abuse. Former elementary school teacher Michael Lander will face court next month charged with lewd and lascivious battery of his student whom he brought to live with his family in 2008. Michael's devastated wife Jennifer Lander said the alleged abuse has ruptured her family and that she constantly goes 'back and forth over how naive' she was to 'allow things to happen'. 'I can't imagine what the girl is going through. My intentions were to give the girl a stable family life and the entire thing completely backfired on me,' she told Tampa Bay Times. 'If i could change anything, I would change the amount of hurt, pain and anguish that has gone on in my family. If i could take it away from my children alone, I would take it away in a heartbeat.' The Land O'Lakes, Florida, family's tragic story began in 2008 when Michael began sharing horrific stories about his fifth-grade student at Schrader Elementary with Jennifer. Michael allegedly said the 12-year-old girl's mother was a drug-addicted stripper who had home schooled her. The girl was same age as his stepdaughter - Jennifer's daughter - Autumn Boisvert. Over time, the stories worsened. Michael said the girl's mother was on the brink of abandoning her, and suggested the couple look after the girl. He said it was her only chance and they owed it to her. Even though money was tight - the couple already had two children with a third on the way - Jennifer agreed and the couple signed the temporary custody paperwork in March 2008. The girl shared a room with Autumn, who embraced her. 'We were best friends, seriously,' Autumn, now 19, said. 'I kind of showed her how not to be so grown up. She wore lots of makeup...skimpy clothes.' Devastated: Jennifer Lander claims her husband Michael was controlling. 'I've gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' she said . Tragic: Jennifer Lander, pictured hugging her son, claims she found thigh-high stockings in her husband's bag after he returned from a trip with the girl. She called police but Michael said the girl wore the stockings because she was a cutter . However, life deteriorated for Jennifer. The principal at Michael's school filed a letter of reprimand on March 10 detailing concerns about Michael's behavior toward the girl. Even before the couple had taken in the . girl, the principal had claimed she 'seemed unusually enamored' with Michael. Staff members also allegedly saw her run her finger down his arm and whisper in his ear. Michael resigned four days later, telling Jennifer he quit . because a vindictive assistant principal wanted him fired. Soon after, Michael planned a trip to South Carolina to search for a new teaching job and said he would take Autumn and the girl. Autumn pulled out at the last minute. When Michael and the girl returned from the trip, Jennifer allegedly discovered thigh high stockings in his bag and called police. Police left after Michael allegedly convinced them and his wife the girl wore stockings to cover self-inflicted cuts. Jennifer believed him. Early days: Michael and Jennifer Lander met in their early 20s, and Michael embraced his new love's five-month-old daughter, Autumn . In May, Jennifer found 'barely legal' porn on Michael's computer and, in a rage, smashed a lasagne tray on the floor. The girl told her mother about the outburst, who then moved her back home. That's when Michael allegedly confided in Autumn, then 13, about his illegal behavior. 'My dad asked me if we could talk about something serious and he brings me into my room, he sits on the corner of my bed, and I just kind of stand in the doorway. And he said, 'Do you think it's OK for two people to love each other despite age?' Autumn said. The situation worsened over time - but Jennifer claimed she was under Michael's spell and believed his many lies. Tampa Bay Times  reported Jennifer intercepted a phone call between Michael, who had picked up tutoring work, and the girl. She claimed she heard her husband tell the girl they needed to 'get some tutoring done'. The girl said: 'Yeah, then we can play.' When Jennifer interrupted, asking what they would play, the startled girl responded: 'Like, Monopoly'. Jennifer ripped the phone out of the wall, and Michael accused her of overreacting. She agreed she was. 'I want people to understand that there's more than one victim. I've  gone back and forth where I've blamed myself for being naive for allowing things to happen,' Jennifer said. 'But it's amazing how much control a person can have over your emotions and thoughts and feelings. For some reason, it feels like he has my soul. 'That doesn't mean I want to spend the rest of my life with him, but he has a part of me that I can't get back. I live in such a nice community, and I live in such a pretty house with really pretty things inside.' Jennifer said Michael's attitude slowly improved when their son was born. Heartbroken: Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims her stepfather has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison . Confidante: Autumn said she was just 13 when her stepfather told her about his 'relationship' with his young student who was living with them . But on the day of his son's birth, Michael allegedly picked up the girl and took her home to watch movies with his children. The next morning, Autumn allegedly saw the girl come out of her stepdad's bedroom, according to Tampa Bay Times. 'She told me she wants me to be her first,' Autumn recalled her stepdad telling her. 'I told her no.' Just a few weeks later, the girl's mother called Jennifer saying she'd found sexually explicit emails. When Jennifer confronted Michael, he fell to his knees saying it was blackmail and the girl's mother wanted money. Jennifer said Michael convinced her that the girl might have put something incriminating on his computer. They smashed it to pieces, and spent the night driving around town, throwing the broken bits out of the window. As months passed, Jennifer became increasingly suspicious of her husband. She confronted Michael on New Year's Eve 2008 - he said the girl had grabbed his crotch once in their kitchen, and it 'partially aroused' him. It made Jennifer vomit. However she stood by her man. But their lives turn another horrible turn. Hurting: Jennifer Lander has filed divorce from her husband but says he has a piece of her soul . Broke, the couple started stealing and selling appliances to make money after Michael quit teaching. The thefts continued until 2010 when they were caught by Hernando deputies. Michael, now 40, took a seven-year plea to protect his wife. She got probation. That's when Autumn revealed her stepfather's disturbing history. The girl went to police. Autumn, who said her 'heart hurts', claims Michael has sent her more than a hundred letters from prison. One said: 'Autumn, sometimes we think we know more than we do. Sometimes we voice what we think we know, but don't. Sometimes we're toughest on those we love most,' he wrote. 'Sometimes we regret what we might say or what actions we take. Sometimes we are lucky. Always we miss those that we love when we are not in their company. Always do we try to protect our children from dangers seen or ever imagined.' Jennifer has filed for divorce but has not yet had him served. Michael's trial begins on October 1. He is charged with four sex crimes and could spend life behind bars.","Former teacher Michael Lander is accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old student .

The girlfriend of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez has been indicted on a perjury charge in connection with the killing of his friend, bringing the number of people facing charges in the case to five. A grand jury indicted Shayanna Jenkins, 24, on a single count in relation to the investigation into the June 17 killing of Odin Lloyd, Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter said. It wasn't clear what led to the charge. Lloyd, a 27-year-old semiprofessional football player from Boston, was found shot to death in an industrial park in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, near Hernandez's home, where Jenkins also lives. Lloyd had been dating Jenkins' sister. Charged: A grand jury indicted Shayanna Jenkins, 24, on a single count in relation to the investigation into the June 17 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was shot dead near Hernandez's home . Denial: Former NFL New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, pictured in court, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the shooting death of Odin Lloyd . In court: Hernandez talks to his lawyer Michael Fee in court as he pleads not guilty to six charges . Jenkins was not arrested and will be ordered to appear in court for an arraignment, the prosecutor's office said. She and Hernandez have a young child together. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and weapons charges in Lloyd's death and is being held without bail. His attorneys have said the state won't be able to prove its case during a jury trial and that Hernandez will be exonerated. Victim: Footballer Odin Lloyd, 27, was found shot dead near to Hernandez's home on June 17 . Prosecutors say Hernandez killed Lloyd because he was upset with him for talking to some people at a nightclub with whom he had had problems. In addition to Hernandez and his girlfriend, three others face charges in the case. Hernandez associate Ernest Wallace has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact. Another associate of Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz, also was indicted on the same charge, Sutter said Friday. Ortiz's attorney, John Connors, said on Friday that the indictment wasn't unexpected. He said Ortiz will plead not guilty to the new charge and that he will make an argument for bail but had no further comment. A hearing on the gun charge that was scheduled for Friday was canceled. Given the indictment, Ortiz's case now shifts to superior court in Fall River. His arraignment there has not been scheduled. Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, also was indicted on a new charge of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact, Sutter said. Prosecutors say that in the days after the killing, she drove with Wallace from her home in Bristol, Connecticut, where Wallace had lived at times, to Georgia, where her car broke down, and that she then bought him a bus ticket to Florida, where his family lives. Singleton had been indicted earlier on a charge of criminal contempt after allegedly refusing to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence in the case. Prosecutors say they offered her immunity. Heartbroken: Odin Lloyd's mother sobbed in court earlier this month as she came face-to-face with her son's alleged killer . Tears: Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins (center), is pictured with his emotional mother in court earlier this month . Lloyd's girlfriend Shaneah  Jenkins recently told NECN that she's . tired of the focus on Hernandez. Jenkins' sister is engaged to Hernandez. 'Every . time there’s a story out it's always about the alleged murder and it's . not about the tragedy that happened to Odin,' she said. 'The loss that . all of us have taken and the fact that he is a human and his life was . taken.' Prosecutors claim that Hernandez . orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to . people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. It . has also been suggested that he killed Lloyd because he knew about . Hernandez's involvement in a 2012 double homicide. Hernandez has never . been charged in that case. Hernandez and two other men, Ernest . Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, allegedly picked Lloyd up at his home in . Dorchester on June 17 and drove to the industrial park. His body was . found by a jogger later that day. Hernandez, . who was dropped by the Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, . could face life in prison without parole if convicted. Shortly . before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text . messages. He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the . car in Boston.

A long-haul truck driver and practicing Sikh was allegedly called a 'depraved terrorist' by police and threatened with jail by a judge for wearing a 'rag' on his head after being pulled over in Mississippi. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed two complaints of harassment over the case, in which Jagjeet Singh, 49, was arrested for refusing to turn over his kirpan, a three-inch ceremonial dagger that all Sikh men are required to carry as part of their faith. The blade is typically sewn into the waistband and rarely, if ever, brandished in public. Truck driver Jagjeet Singh, a devotee of the Sikh faith, was arrested in Mississippi for refusing to surrender his Kirpan (right), which local police claimed was an illegal weapon and allegedly called him a 'terrorist'. Sikh men are expected to carry a Kirpan - a small sword usually worn on the waistband - at all times, much as a Christian might wear a crucifix as a necklace. Singh was driving from California to Texas on January 16 to pick up a chicken delivery when he was stopped by two officers from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for driving with a flat tyre in Pike County, Miss. According to the ACLU complaint - which is claiming a 'disgraceful' infringement of religious rights and has been lodged with Mississippi officials - the officers 'laughed' and 'mocked' Singh when he attempted to explain his kirpan was not illegal and actually a sacred religious article. 'One officer declared that all Sikhs are depraved and ''terrorists'',' the ACLU said in a letter to the DOT. Indian Sikh devotees gather next to the illuminated Sikhism's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar on September 1, 2013. A recent survey found that most Americans wrongly believed Sikhism is a sect of Islam. Sikhism is a progressive religion founded in the Punjab region (eastern Pakistan and northern India) over 500 years ago by Nanak. There are approximately 30 million followers worldwide. Sikh's devote themselves to a remembrance of God at all times, honest living and equality of mankind. They denounce superstition. They follow the teachings of 10 Gurus enshrined in the Sikh Holy Book. It is largely considered one of the only religions to give equal rights to men and women, with both sexes allowed to take part in Sikh religious ceremonies. The founder Nanak (1469 - 1538) was born into a Hindu family, but said he received a call from God establishing him as a guru, making the assertion: 'There is no Muslim, and there is no Hindu.' Singh was taken into custody for refusing to obey a command and was forced to return to Mississippi on March 26 for a court hearing. At the hearing, Judge Aubrey Rimes of the Pike County Justice Court ejected Singh from the courtroom because of the turban he was wearing, stating that he would not be allowed to re-enter unless he removed ""that rag"" from his head. However Singh's faith mandates the covering and he believes that to unwrap it in public would be both sacrilegious and shameful. The ACLU have since made their complaints public to condemn Singh's terrible treatment. The case follows the attack of Columbia professor Dr. Prabhjot Singh, who was set upon by a hate mob in Harlem last weekend. Dr Prabhjot Singh, a Harlem practitioner, Columbia professor and practicing Sikh, was attacked by a gang in Harlem last Saturday night in what police believe was a hate crime. Dr Singh was repeatedly punched in the head and torso by a gang that approached him on bikes about 8:15 p.m. as he walked along 110th Street near Lenox Avenue in upper Manhattan. Speaking about the attack, Dr Singh who was called 'Osama' and 'terrorist', said the incident was a reminder of the need for a 'national conversation' about what it means to be American. 'Ultimately, to simply punish the individuals who've acted out on hate crimes is insufficient,"" he told HuffPost Live. 'More broadly, we need to have a real national conversation around who looks American, what does it mean to be American.' Earlier this month a Stanford University survey found even though almost all turban-wearers in America are Sikh, about 70 per cent of Americans misidentify them as Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus or members of the Shinto faith. The survey also found that half of Americans believe Sikhism is an arm of Islam. When contacted by the ABC for comment, a DOT spokesman said the most recent Singh case was a 'personal matter'. 'We just got the letter. We're looking into the allegations,' the spokesman, Jared Ravencraft, said. The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed they were investigating the Pike County nondiscrimination policy.","Routine delivery ends in humiliation and disgrace .

Over 450 classic Chevys were up for auction this weekend in the middle of a Nebraska field. Despite many vehicles being covered in dirt and worn-down, visitors flocked to Pierce, Nebraska, to see the collection. An estimated 10,000 people travelled to see the cars, and more than 3,800 registered online to bid on an auction website by mid-day on Saturday, Associated Press reports. Car lovers checked out the collection of over 450 cars in a auction preview on Friday, including a 1965 Chevrolet Impala 2-door (right) A potential bidder checks out a 1959 Chevrolet Impala on Friday (left) ... but it's clear he may have some competition due to the crowd on Saturday (right) Auctioneer Yvette VanDerBrink, pictured, said the auction was 'kind of like marrying off your daughter' The first vehicle sold — a sky-blue, 1958 Chevy Cameo pickup driven 1.3 miles — secured the largest bid at $140,000, Associated Press says. Another bidder spent $97,500 on a red and white 1963 Impala with 11.4 miles on its odometer. Its original price was $3,254.70. Six of the most valuable models sold for a combined $545,000. Every hotel within 100 miles was booked, and some homeowners in Pierce have even rented out spare rooms for car lovers, KCAU-TV says. The vehicles were once owned by the late Ray Lambrecht, 96, who was the local Chevrolet dealer for 50 years. Lambrecht stored any unsold new vehicles up until his retirement in 1996. Reuters reports that more than 430 vehicles were pulled out of a grove where they were stored. Another 50 cars in better condition were moved out of storage sheds. Lambrecht opened his dealership in 1946, Fox News reports, as GM expanded its franchises nationwide. Facing health problems, Lambrecht finally decided to sell his collection. 'It's kind of like marrying off your daughter,' auctioneer Yvette VanDerBrink said. 'Some daughters you want to get rid of and some you don't. For car guys, the cars are their babies. So he was watching all of his girls go away.' All the cars must go, and if they're not sold, they'll be destroyed, according to CBS. Even if some of the cars are destroyed, they will nonetheless make history -- the History Channel broadcast the auction as 'History Made Now: Wheels of Fortune' on Saturday evening.

The Sikh community has pressured Walmart into pulling a turban-themed costume from its website calling it ‘insulting’ and tells the retailer to use more 'common sense' in future. The Sikh Coalition said in a letter on Friday that the costume is offensive to 9/11 victims and will cause ‘negative stereotypes about turbans and beards that have led to violence and discrimination against Sikhs and other minorities’. The Sikh Coalition offered an image of the original costume and the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, as part of their letter. Similarity: The Sikh community says the Halloween costume, left, bears too much resemblance to the al Qaeda terrorist Osama Bin Laden, right . 'We apologise': Walmart, who called the costume the 'Turban Beard Adult Halloween Instant Costume', pulled the product from their website . The letter: On Friday the Sikh Coalition asked Walmart to discontinue the sale of the costume . The group also sent letters to retailers such as Amazon.com, which listed the costume under the banner ‘Fun World Adult Men’s Osama Bin Laden Middle East Costume Turban + Beard’. Walmart described it as ‘Turban Beard Adult Halloween Instant Costume’. The costume appears to be manufactured by Fun World Costumes, and is for sale on the sites of retailers such as Sears and Rite Aid, among others. Rajdeep Singh, Director of Law and Policy at The Sikh Coalition, told The Huffington Post he doubts the costume would make people who had lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks comfortable. A Walmart spokesperson said they ‘disabled this item for purchase and are in the process of immediately removing it from our site’, according to the Post. ‘We sincerely apologise to any customers who may have been offended by this costume.’ Spiritual: Sikhs wear turbans due to their religious beliefs. It represents honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality and piety . Ignorance: About 70 per cent of Americans misidentify turban-wearing Sikhs (pictured) as Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists or members of the Shinto faith .

A grandmother who works at a Goodwill warehouse in California says a hug was the only reward she needed. Bonnie Patton found and returned $40,000 worth of Tiffany jewelry that had been accidentally donated in a box of donated clothes and household items. Ms Patton, a grandmother of seven, was a temporary worker with Goodwill in April when the alert went out that jewelry was possibly somewhere among the 25,000 items donated to the huge warehouse each day. Scroll down for video... Reunited: Goodwill Employee Bonnie Patton (left) and Goodwill Donor Sandra Williams (right) are seen together after the charity worker found Mrs Williams' mistakenly donated jewelry . Lost then found: Sandra Williams thought construction workers at her home may have taken the items but it was her daughter who accidentally took them to the charity shop . Priceless: The jewelry is worth about $40,000 but its sentimental value is irreplaceable . The jewellery belonged to Sandra Williams who had accidentally included some of most precious items along with pieces destined for charity. Ms. Williams, a banking executive, said she had desperately rummaged around her San Mateo apartment searching for her 'irreplaceable and sentimental' heirloom pieces during renovations of her home in April. 'I thought I'd hid it so well that even I couldn't find it or someone walked off with it,' she told ABC News. She was having construction work done on her home at the time of the items disappearance she even filed reports with her construction company and the police. The reward: Goodwill worker Bonnie Patton (right) said that a hug was enough of a reward for finding the jewels in the footfall-field sized warehouse . Sandra Williams: She accidentally donated her beloved Tiffany jewelry and had given up all hope of ever seeing the items again . Bonnie Patton: A Goodwill employee who showed true goodwill as she recovered the items and ensured they were returned to their rightful owner . Ms Williams even called the construction company to obtain the name and addresses of all their employees . It was only when she recalled her daughter had dropped off a bag books and clothes to Goodwill earlier in the week that she decided to call them. The charity explained to her that the chances of her rings being recovered was extremely slim given the enormity of the warehouse. On the day the rings were found, Ms Patton was working and she remembered hearing about the lost items. The rings and Tiffany pearls were all recovered in amongst clothes that were being sorted. 'Finding these rings was like a needle in a haystack,' said  Ms Patton. 'I was so excited for this lady. I would not personally want to lose my heirlooms, my personal memories, so I was very, very excited.' Mrs Williams was equally as jubilant. ""I could not believe the goodwill of Goodwill,' she 'I can’t believe that someone would find a 1.75-carat ring and not put in their pocket.' 'She wanted to give me a reward, but the thank you and the hug was my reward,' Ms Patton said. Ms Patton was promoted for her honesty when she made the discovery and is now a permanent staff member of Goodwill.","Tiffany rings and a necklace accidentally got sent to Goodwill donation store .

"By . Tim Finan . PUBLISHED: . 12:07 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:55 EST, 29 September 2013 . Eye-opening: The site challenges common perceptions of who commits rape and where they attack . Rape victims who were attacked by men they trusted will share their stories on a French website. More than 1000 shocking first-hand accounts have been submitted to the site called 'Je connais un violeur' - or 'I know a rapist' - since it launched at the end of August. So far, 800 have been published. In a statement on the homepage, women are invited to describe their tormentors. It declares: 'They were our friends, our partners, members of our family, or acquaintances. We know rapists... Allow us to introduce them to you...' The aim is to destroy myths about rape and rapists by asking victims to describe their attackers rather than go into the details of their rapes. 'You come across a daddy, a grandfather, a husband, Uncle Alain, a holiday fling, a colleague, a university professor, a friend of the family,' said Pauline, the site's creator. Pauline, a 27-year-old former student at the prestigious school Sciences Po, describes herself as a militant feminist. 'The rapists are not ""the others"",' she says. 'We wanted to show that the rapist is not the ugly villain hiding in a car park or lurking on a street corner. 'In 80 per cent of cases the attacker is known to the victim and in 67 per cent of cases the rape takes place at the home of the victim or the aggressor.' She spends two hours a day editing women's accounts, correcting special mistakes without altering the substance of their stories, removing the more lurid details of their rapes. Pauline also ensures the anonymity of the women and their rapists is preserved as she says 'it is not a vendetta site and is not about revenge'. By describing their rapists, the victims point the finger at men of all social positions. Guilt: The 'Slut Walk' that took place in cities around the world was made to challenge the view that victims 'ask for it' by wearing a short skirt, low-cut top, or drink too much. However, many accounts on 'I know a rapist' state they feel guilty for those exact reasons. The Tumblr blog is filled with harrowing descriptions of distress . Pauline, the creator of 'I know a rapist...' hopes the accounts will help victims to find the support they need . Their accounts involve similar scenarios and confessions of guilt. Many write: 'This is the first time I have told anyone,' or: 'Reading your accounts enabled me to understand at last.' Many women describe their distress and pain. One . victim wrote: 'His hands on my mouth, around my neck and his saying ""It . will be OK. Shut up"" whilst he went on and on.' Many others speak of their guilt, saying they had too much to drink that night. A . number of accounts say things like: 'it was as though I had asked for . it by wearing too short a skirt,' or 'a top that left my back bare'. The site, jeconnaisunvioleur.tumblr.com, has received more than 1000 accounts and published 800 . Others speak of their regret at having done nothing to seek justice or to speak about their ordeal. 'I did not go to the Police,' wrote one. 'I remained silent for a long time. I recently heard that he had spent some months in prison for rape. But not for my rape.' An estimated 75,000 women are raped every year in France but only 10 per cent are reported. Only two per cent of rapists are convicted. In an interview with Le Point magazine, psychiatrist Muriel Salmona said that sharing experiences - however painful - is of therapeutic value. 'What a relief it is for victims to know that they were not the only ones who were unable to speak about it, for fear of being faced with unbelieving family or friends; who had to forget everything over a period of years and who always had terrible doubts.' Women's writer Swan Nguyen told the magazine: 'The victim's family and friends can play a key role in the process of healing by helping her to lose the feeling of guilt and by backing her when she finally makes a complaint. She added: 'Being angry is fine but being able to transfer the anger against the person who has harmed you, that is better.'","'I know a rapist' French website is flooded with stories of women who were raped... not by perverts or predators but by men they thought they trusted .

He might not be fluffy or have big eyes  - but he is arguably one of the cutest animals around. Covered in scales with huge claws, a protruding nose and a long tongue, this pangolin shouldn't be so sweet - but the mammal can't help but melt hearts with his shy gaze and tiny body. Clutching his hands together, this orphaned baby has won over his surrogate mother - and is sure to win an army of fans with his cute looks. Scroll down for video . Ground pangolins are known as Manis temminckii in Latin but also go by the name scaly anteater and are one of the most endangered mammals in the world . Maria allows the baby to climb onto her hat as in the wild baby pangolins ride around on their mother's backs . Pangolins, also known as scaly anteaters, are found in Africa and are one of the most endangered mammals in the world. And this little creature is being cared for by his human 'adoptive mother', who initially cared for the mammal's birth mother, Roxy, when she was found on the black market. Roxy gave birth to the little pangolin during her stay at the organisation and the unnamed baby is now being hand-reared by Maria Diekmann. The 48-year-old feeds him a diet of milk, yoghurt and ants and often lets him sit on her head as in the wild the young often ride on their mother's back. Maria, from Namibia, . who runs conservation group Rare and Endangered Species Trust (REST), . said: 'Roxy was wild but was caught and taken around a local town in . boxes, to be sold on the black market.

'We hoped we could hold her for a few days until we could get a tracker on her before releasing her. 'But four days after receiving her she crawled slowly to me and sat in my lap and I soon realised that she had given birth. 'About three months later Roxy began begging to be let out. 'Because she had always returned previously, I let her out. She headed up a mountain and sadly that is the last time I saw her. 'After . many sleepless nights, the baby started responding well to plain . yoghurt, special animal milk formula and his twice daily ant forages.'

This baby pangolin, who is unnamed, has a 10 inch long tongue whihc could extend up to 27 inches when he is a fully grown adult . Maria has been caring for the baby since his mother Roxy abandoned him while only a few days old . 'His . favourite place was just behind her neck and that is why I believe he . still loves to crawl onto the top of my head as I walk around. Thus, I . always wear a hat,' Maria said. 'The photos that I took with my iPhone shows his tongue which is about a long as his body.' The ground pangolin - Manis temminckii in Latin - are endangered and rare to find because they are difficult to spot. They are covered in hard scales made from keratin, are nocturnal, and sleep curled up into a ball. They have extremely long, sticky tongues that start in the abdomen and are used to delve into insect mounds to collect prey.

Society's obsession with social networking is making it harder than ever for the bereaved and broken-hearted to move on. From Facebook to Twitter, the data and images documenting people's lives has been blamed for prolonging the pain of losing a loved one, either through death or the break-up of a relationship. Discussing how cyber culture affects the grieving process, one of Britain's leading scientists, Sir Nigel Shadbolt, said: 'When bad, sad or indifferent things happened to us, over time you forgot. That is why time could be a great healer. Haunted: Sir Nigel Shadbolt suggests social media is making it increasingly difficult to move on from the death of a loved one or a break-up . 'But If you've got this complete authentic playback of people and episodes, it'll be quite haunting.' And rather than being a comfort, Sir Norman suggests lingering online photos and messages can actually cause more distress. He added: 'One of the things that human psychology has evolved to do is forgetting. We don't have perfect recall, we didn't used to have this way of things being represented back to us.' The academic is just one of several influential figures who have called for social network users to be offered the option to delete or adapt their archives. Jonathan Zittrain, Professor of Law at Harvard University, said social media profiles should have 'expiration dates', adding: 'What I share with friends now I may wish only to share with family many years later — or it could be the opposite.' Prolonged pain: Harvard professor Jonathan Zittrain, Professor of Law at Harvard University, said social media should have 'expiration dates' so users can delete and edit their archives . Meanwhile, Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, Professor of Internet Governance at the University of Oxford, suggests that being able to see the online profile of people who have hurt us could actually hinder our ability to forgive. He explained: 'Psychologists tell us that forgetting and forgiving are intertwined — as we forgive somebody, our brain depreciates the memory of wrongdoing because it is no longer relevant to how we judge that person. Forgiving without forgetting is very difficult.' The claims come days after Bling Ring author Nancy Jo Sales interviewed teenagers in the U.S. who explained how social networking was destroying their lives. Her study for Vanity Fair magazine said youngsters used sites such as Facebook to combat loneliness, but many actually suffered depression, anxiety and feelings of . isolation, which, she claimed, was acerbated by social media.","Facebook and Twitter are making it harder to move on from heartache .

The photographs were posted on Instagram by Ilya’s girlfriend  Anna Kazakova, 28, who joined the brothers and Mark’s girlfriend Natasha Dovgjalo on the trip. Last night, Hannah Smith’s father David condemned the pictures as ‘insensitive and disgusting’. ‘They are going round shamelessly living the high life while I’ve lost my daughter and had to sell my home,’ he said. ‘They have blood on their hands but they couldn’t care less. This is money they made on a site that killed my daughter,  Hannah, so I don’t know how they can live with themselves.’ High life: Ilya Terebin and girlfriend Anna Kazakova enjoy a dinner together during their holiday .

But speaking last week, the tycoons’ father Oleg said it was ‘nonsense’ to blame ask.fm or his sons. ‘Stop spreading these rumours,’ he added. ‘Are you saying this girl didn’t communicate with anyone else – teachers, parents, and friends?’ Asked whether his sons should do more to prevent bullying on the site, he snapped: ‘I don’t know what you are talking about.’ Ask.fm initially offered to name the trolls who bullied Hannah Smith. It has also said it is improving security. But a source at the site, which makes £5 million a year in advertising revenue, later claimed that she sent most of the abuse to herself. Yesterday, an ask.fm spokesman said: ‘The brothers did attend, along with several hundred other people, the wedding of a good friend in Switzerland.

A deal over Iran's nuclear weapons should be struck with the US within three months, the Iranian President has said. Speaking before a landmark UN meeting between Iran and six world powers, Hassan Rouhani has said Tehran wants a quick resolution to the nuclear issue. Speaking to the Washington Post, Mr Rouhani said: 'The only way forward is for a timeline to be inserted into the negotiations that's short–and wrap it up. 'That is a decision of my government, that short is necessary to settle the nuclear file. Scroll down for video . Hassan Rouhani has said that any deal over his country's nuclear proramme 'is a question of months not years' Rouhani faces a back lash in his country after seeming to concede that the holocaust happened in a TV interview after eight years of denials from former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 'The shorter it is the more beneficial it is to everyone. If it's three months that would be Iran's choice, if it's six months that's still good. It's a question of months not years.' The apparent thawing of relations between America and Iran in recent weeks has seen Rouhani apparently admit that the holocaust happened in an interview broadcast on CNN. Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent years denying the holocaust as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish state of Israel, one of America's strongest Middle Eastern allies. While the new President would not be drawn on the scale or numbers invovled, he is now facing a backlash at home after a conservative new agency accused CNN of wrongly translating the remark. The improvement in relations between Iran and the West has also prompted the father of an imprisoned former U.S. Marine to beg for his son's release. Ali Hekmati is asking Rouhani to order the release of his son, Amir, as Ali is now suffering with a brain tumour and may not have long to live. In a letter, the ailing father says: 'I long more than ever to see Amir's face. I am now very sick. 'I ask that you let me see him again, one more time, and so that he may lead our family when I am gone. 'Amir is a good man. An honorable man. He is not a spy, I can assure you of that.' Amir Hekmati, a joint U.S. Iranian citizen, has been in prison in Iran since 2011 after being convicted of spying . Amir Hekmati, who has dual U.S. and Iranian citizenship, was arrested in Iran in 2011. The family claim he was visiting his grandmother but the Islamic state accused him of being a CIA spy and convicted him. A short while later a video was released showing Amir 'confessing' to his crimes. Amir's father has reason to be hopeful after Iran freed dozens of political prisoners last week, just as Rouhani was headed to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Earlier this month, Amir wrote a letter to US Secretary of Sate John Kerry describing his 'miserable prison conditions' and his belief that Tehran wanted to use him in a possible prisoner exchange. Hekmati's letter was smuggled out of prison and his sister authenticated the handwriting. The State Department said it was trying to determine Hekmati's condition through Swiss diplomats in Tehran. The Swiss represent U.S. interests in Iran because no U.S. officials are based there. The two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1979. Hekmati (pictured left), a former U.S. Marine, claims he was visiting the Islamic state to see his grandmother . Hekmati's father, Ali, says he has a brain tumour and wants to see his son 'one more time'. Right is a picture of Amir taken from Facebook in which he is said to be wearing a headdress for a Halloween party . Two other American citizens are believed to be detained in Iran: Retired FBI agent Robert Levinson and Christian pastor Saeed Abedini. The release of prisoners and the softening on nuclear talks are part of a fresh charm offensive by Iran following years of icy relations under the former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As a condition of any deal Iran has said it will agree to international inspections along the lines of those between 2003 and 2005 and has not ruled out a meeting with Barack Obama.

A white man who yelled racial slurs before fatally shooting a black man and a police officer in a 1994 rampage was today executed with the state's last use of its execution drug. Harry Mitts Jr ate a last meal of steak with sauteed mushrooms, Caesar salad with ranch dressing, Italian bread, french fries, peach pie, butter pecan ice cream and Dr Pepper before asking his victims' families to forgive him, saying he had carried the burden of his crimes with him for 19 years. 'I had no business doing what I did,' he said in a last statement to six witnesses representing his victims. Two clergy members and a friend were also in attendance. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Harry Mitts Jr. has been executedin Ohio for killing two men in 1994, including Sgt. Dennis Glivar, right, who went to the scene after Mitts shouted racial slurs and shot dead John Bryant, who was black . Mitts Jr., 61, was pronounced dead at 10.39am by lethal injection of the powerful sedative pentobarbital at the state prison in Lucasville after years of acknowledging his crimes and repenting. The state's supply of pentobarbital is expiring, and a new execution method will be announced later. Mitts was convicted of aggravated murder and attempted murder in the August 1994 rampage against random neighbors and responding police officers at his apartment complex in a Cleveland suburb. Wielding a gun with a laser sight and later other weapons, Mitts first shouted racial epithets and killed a neighbor's black boyfriend, John Bryant, and then shot and killed white Garfield Heights police Sgt. Dennis Glivar as he responded to the scene. Mitts also shot and wounded two other police officers. Lock up: He was put to death at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville on Wednesday morning . The Ohio Parole Board and Republican Gov. John Kasich had denied Mitts' pleas for mercy. Mitts, at his clemency hearing, had pointed to a virtually clean record before and after the day of the shootings and said he had found God in prison. After his conviction, he spoke of receiving a Bible from Glivar's mother and sister and a letter expressing their forgiveness and urging him to seek repentance. Mitts told the Ohio Parole Board he had drunk heavily because he was distraught over his divorce and had likely shot Bryant to draw police to his home in hopes they would shoot and kill him. He said he wasn't a racist and didn't remember directing racial slurs at Bryant before shooting him. He said he couldn't say why he didn't shoot two white neighbors he encountered ahead of Bryant. Changing: It was the last time Ohio will use a particular drug - pentobarbital - in its execution rooms (pictured) because its manufacturer has put it off limits to states for executions . Prosecutors argued that, with the murders, multiple shootings and additional death threats carried out that day, Mitts 'exhibited complete disregard for the lives of officers and innocent bystanders at the scene'. 'That further tragedy did not result from the bedlam that Mitts created on August 14, 1994, is in many respects a miracle,' a clemency report said. With Ohio's supply of pentobarbital expiring, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction has said it expects to announce its new execution method by Oct. 4. Pentobarbital is no longer available because its manufacturer has put it off limits to states for executions.","Harry Mitts Jr. shouted racial slurs before shooting dead his neighbor's black boyfriend, John Bryant, in 1994 .

The number of children suffering from depression is on the rise and more needs to be done to care for them, according to health experts. New NHS guidelines said that children as young as five are showing signs of depression and nearly  80,000 children in the UK are living with the mental illness. Cyber bullying, pressure from social media websites and the breakdown of the family unit are behind the thousands of young children with mental health problems, according to experts. The NHS says children as young as five years old are showing symptoms of depression (file picture) New guidelines set out by the public health agency National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) say children showing symptoms of depression need to be properly diagnosed and offered more support. If a doctor suspects that a child is depressed, they must acknowledge this in the child’s records and ensure the best possible care can be given to the child. Experts says family breakdown and cyber bullying are behind the rising numbers of children with depression . The guidelines advise state ‘age appropriate’ material and techniques should be used to help the child understand their treatment. Figures suggest that more than 8,000 children under the age of ten suffer from depression. Dr Gemma Trainor, a nurse consultant at Greater Manchester West Foundation Mental Health Trust said: ‘The increase in school-age children presenting with depression is a particularly worrying phenomenon’. But consultant child and adolescent psychotherapist Ricky Emanuel said there are ‘huge variations’ in the level of care delivered to young patients with depression. Mr Emanuel, who works at the Royal Free Hospital, London, helped develop the quality standards. He said: ‘I hope this quality standard can be used as a template to improve the care received by children and young people with depression in England. ‘There are huge variations in the type and quality of care available, which can have long-term consequences on the child or young person and family themselves, as well as for society as a whole. ‘The new standards set out the very best care and support for children and young people with depression.’","NHS says children as young as five showing signs of depression .

A few nights after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, David Posey heard a strange noise in his house and went upstairs to check on his son. The little boy, who had just seen his teacher and a first-grade classmate gunned down, was pounding on the floor. ""I know where the bad guy is,"" the child told his father, indicating down below, in hell. ""I'm beating him up."" Hundreds of children at the school that day survived the shooting, but the horrors have been especially difficult to overcome for some of the 6- and 7-year-olds who witnessed the bloodbath. Among the survivors are a dozen first-graders from the two classrooms where the gunman opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle. Nightmares are persistent, and any reminder of the attack - a fire alarm, a clap of thunder, even the sound of an intercom - can stir feelings of panic. At the building in a neighboring town where the survivors recently began a new school year, signs ask people to close doors softly and not to drag objects across the floor. In this file photo, Connecticut State Police lead a line of children from the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday, Dec. 14, 2012 after a shooting at the school . Their parents, grateful their children are even alive, have struggled out of public view, another set of families left reeling from the attack. For all the hugs and assurances they are safe, the parents can no longer tell their children there are no such things as monsters. ""The worst part is the helplessness,"" said Hugo Rojas, whose son also witnessed the shooting. ""You want to take that pain away. You want to be able to take those nightmares away, but you can't."" The gunman, Adam Lanza, who killed 20 children and six educators at the school, shot his way into the building the morning of Dec. 14. As the sound of gunfire and shells hitting the floor rang out from the hallway, the children in Victoria Soto's class were moved to the back of their room. They were sitting on the floor when Lanza burst through the door. No one spoke, not even Lanza. The gunman pointed his gun at the face of Posey's son, just inches away. But he didn't shoot him. ""He said he kind of just stared down the kids,"" Posey said. ""My personal belief is that at that particular time he hadn't crossed the threshold of shooting a child."" Lanza shot the teacher. And a girl. As Lanza reloaded his gun, children including Posey's and Rojas' sons ran past blood, shattered glass and the body of their principal, lying on the hallway floor. After firing off 154 rifle shots within five minutes, Lanza killed himself with a handgun as police arrived. He also killed his mother that morning before driving to the school.

A child reacts to police and fireman staged nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School where Adam Lanza opened fire on school children and staff on December 14, 2012 in this file photo . Posey and Rojas described in interviews how any reminder of the attack would traumatize their sons. To protect their privacy, they asked that the boys' names not be published. Most of the families of the surviving witnesses have tried to shield their children's identities and struggles and have declined to speak publicly. Two months after the shooting, Posey and his family were in the grocery store when an announcement came over the intercom. His son insisted they leave immediately. Posey was baffled, but his son later explained the intercom was on when Lanza began his rampage inside Sandy Hook . ""When the intercom goes off, that's when something bad is about to happen,"" he recalled his son telling him. Posey also noticed changes in behavior. His once agreeable boy began to rebel, refusing to brush his teeth. He started wearing his Batman and Iron Man costumes again. ""It's his ability to be a superhero and in control,"" Posey said. ""People don't hurt Batman."" Rojas said his son, who is in therapy, has had to cope with vivid nightmares. His son does not talk much about the shooting, but he sometimes asks why. The family tries to be honest, telling him they don't know why. He also asks about his friends who were killed. ""We talk about heaven,"" Rojas said. ""He knows they're there."" The families of the 12 surviving children who witnessed the shootings each received $20,000 from the largest Newtown charity fund. The families of the 26 people who were killed each received $281,000. In a letter to the foundation in charge of distributing the donations, Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra said $20,000 is not nearly adequate for the families of the survivors, who are likely to need counseling for years. ""Twenty thousand dollars will be insufficient to address the wide range of mental health needs for these youngsters and their siblings and parents for years into the future,"" Llodra wrote in the Aug. 7 letter urging the foundation to set aside money for the families' future needs. ""Please be aware also that many of these families suffered significant loss of income and loss of opportunity during the months immediately after December 14."" In this December 2012 file photo, police patrol the streets outside Sandy Hook Elementary School in the wake of a massacre which 26 lives, including those of 20 children . On the day of the massacre, Posey's children, including two at Sandy Hook, were attending their final day of school in Newtown before moving to Colorado a day later. In Colorado, Posey and his wife have joined survivors of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting to form a foundation to help schools prepare emergency plans and help survivors of tragedies to recover. He is also working with parents of Newtown victims on an effort to improve school safety. With time, Posey said, his son has shown signs of recovery. For a period after the shooting, the boy was fearful and worried about everyone's safety, insisting they go look for his mother when she left the house. But he now understands when his mother is gone. He's playing sports again. A long vacation to the Grand Canyon this summer appeared to help the whole family. Posey said his son also talks about becoming a detective who helps children. Rojas said his son was excited to return to school this fall and see his friends but also apprehensive. Overall, he said, his son is ""OK."" He wishes someone could tell him everything will be fine in a few years, but he knows it will be a long road for his son and the other survivors. ""Not a day goes by that we're not thankful that we do have our son,"" Rojas said. ""I think about our friends and neighbors who don't have that blessing anymore. Not a day goes by that I don't think about those 20 kids.""

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:03 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:03 EST, 29 September 2013 . Outrage: Durham Police Chief Constable Michael Barton, pictured here in 2012, has sparked debate after suggesting addicts should be 'given drugs' A senior police officer sparked fury last night after he called for the legalisation of banned hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Mike Barton, the chief constable of Durham Constabulary, said the war on drugs had ‘comprehensively failed’ and compared it to America’s disastrous efforts to ban alcohol during the Prohibition era. Addicts, he said, should be given or sold hard drugs through the NHS and ‘treated and cared for’ instead of criminalised. But anti-drugs campaigners condemned his comments. Mary Brett, from Cannabis Skunk Sense, said police were already failing to enforce drugs laws properly. ‘The war on drugs has never been fought – in fact there has never been a war on drugs,’ she added. ‘The police go around handing out cautions and a slap on the wrist even for people caught with hard drugs. ‘They hardly ever get prosecuted and sent to prison. People know that users take cocaine all the time in nightclubs, and the police should go in and catch these people. 'The idea of giving out hard drugs for free at taxpayers’ expense is abhorrent.’ Mr Barton’s intervention into the drugs debate came in an article for the Left-wing Observer newspaper yesterday. He argued that a controlled supply would undermine the criminal gangs who make millions selling drugs. He wrote: ‘Not all crime gangs raise income through selling drugs, but most of them do in my experience. So offering an alternative route of supply to users cuts off the gangs’ income stream. ‘If an addict were able to access drugs via the NHS or some similar organisation then they would not have to go out and buy illegal drugs. Drugs should be controlled. They should not, of course, be freely available. ‘I think addiction to anything – drugs, alcohol, gambling, etc – is not a good thing, but outright prohibition hands revenue streams to villains.’ Treatment? Anti-drugs campaigners decried suggestions that NHS hand outs of drugs could cure addicts . Comparing Britain’s drug policies with the situation that gave rise to gangsters such as Al Capone in 1920s America, he said: ‘Have we not learned the lessons of prohibition in history? 'The Mob’s sinister rise to prominence in the US was pretty much funded through its supply of a prohibited drug: alcohol. That’s arguably what we are doing in the UK.’ The police chief also said he was ‘deeply disappointed’ the Government had abandoned plans for a minimum price for alcohol. Mr Barton, the head of criminal intelligence at the Association of Chief Police Officers, has spent 34 years as a police officer. But his suggestions have been given short shrift by ministers. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous. They destroy lives and blight communities. ‘The UK’s approach on drugs remains clear. Warning: The constable said prohibiting drugs will lead to the rise of gangs like Al Capone's during the Prohibition in America in the 1920s, who thrived bootlegging alcohol . Mr Barton's claims that we have lost the 'war on drugs' has been blasted as hyperbolic in comparison with places like Mexico and California where drug trafficking is far more severe . 'We must help individuals who are dependent by treatment, while ensuring law enforcement protects society by stopping the supply and tackling the organised crime that is associated with the drugs trade.’ A recent report by the Home Affairs Select Committee appeared to endorse decriminalising drugs as a way of helping South American countries combat organised crime. Chief Constable Andy Bliss, ACPO’s drugs spokesman, said: ‘Clearly, a senior colleague like Mike Barton is entitled to his views and he has added his contribution to the national debate, but it would be ACPO’s position that these are matters for Parliament to decide. ‘We need in particular to be very thoughtful about setting clear boundaries, especially for young people, in relation to drugs, their misuse and criminal activity  surrounding them.’","Mike Barton, chief constable of Durham Constabulary, said NHS should hand out drugs to addicts and treat them .

A Victoria's Secret supermodel and her multimillionaire businessman husband are being sued by their landlord after allegedly trashing their $32,000-a-month Manhattan apartment and failing to pay several months' rent. Julie Ordon, who has also featured in Playboy and Sports Illustrated, and husband David Mimran damaged 'exquisite and valuable antiques, furniture and equipment' in the fully-furnished three-bedroom loft apartment, according to papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday. The landlord is suing the couple for $420,000, alleging that they failed to pay their last two months' rent at the apartment and underpaid their rent for six months prior to that. 'Nightmare tenants': Businessman David Mimran and his model wife Julie Ordon, pictured in 2010, are being sued by their former landlords for allegedly trashing their luxury SoHo apartment and missing rent . The lawsuit adds that they also made illegal alterations to the unit before leaving in August 2012. Joshua Price, the attorney for Allerand . LLC, which owns the building, claims in court papers that the couple . caused 'unspeakable damage' to the unit, the New York Daily News reported. He claims they damaged or ruined 'furniture, electronic systems, floor coverings and fixtures, which included many antiques and collectibles'. 'It appears that the damage was was intentional or the result of gross negligence,' the suit says.

President Obama has issued a stern warning to Congress saying that the 'extremists' who were threatening to shut down the government need to stop politicizing the 'full faith and credit of the United States' as it could rock the global economy. The President held a press conference Friday afternoon, hours after the Senate approved the temporary budget measure that would allow the government to remain funded so that 800,000 federal workers would not be furloughed come Tuesday. He called for them to fulfill their two main . responsibilities: 'Pass a budget on time and pay our bills on time'. 'Unlike . the last time they threatened this course of action, this debate isn't . really about our deficits...instead the House Republicans are so . concerned about appeasing the Tea Party,' he said at a press conference . Friday afternoon. Laying down the law: President Obama called for the group of 'extremists' on Capitol Hill who were holding up the vote to 'knock it off' and raise the budget before dramatically endangering the global economy . Not negotiating: Obama said that he will not bargain and trade in order to get the country's bills paid . Not messing around: Obama has not spoken with John Boehner all week . 'This . grandstanding has real effects on real people,' he said, citing how . military personnel who are serving overseas will have their pay delayed . and their families will be forced to do without. The . other issue that the President focused on in his speech was the fact . that following the passage of a budget, the next battle will be over . raising the debt ceiling, which he described as the decision to 'pay the . bills that have already been racked up'. 'Nobody gets to threaten the full faith and credit of the United States just for political reasons. 'The . American people have worked too hard to recover from a bunch of . crises... to see extremists in Congress cause another crisis.' The Senate has done their part to allow temporary funding of the government by passing the bill that will avoid a shutdown, but it now needs to be approved by the House of Representatives in order to be signed into law. The solution may not be reached until after the weekend- just hours before the deadline to avoid the shutdown- because Republican lawmakers are worried that a fraction of their members may vote against the budget bill if it is brought to a vote today. Their problem lies with the fact that the Democratic majority in the Senate stripped the bill of the provision that would defund President Obama's health care plan. Bring it on: Senator Ted Cruz was one of 19 Republicans who voted against the temporary budget bill that would keep the government open and avoid a federal shut down on Tuesday . Get in line: Senior Republican leaders- including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell- rejected the move to tie Obamacare funding to the funding of the government . A group of conservatives including Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz, who gained national attention for staging a 21-hour filibuster to make a point about how 'Obamacare' should not be funded', wanted the budget to both fund the government and defund the Affordable Care Act. In spite of Cruz's efforts, there was never a viable chance that those plans would be approved in the Senate because of the heavy Democratic presence. On Friday the Senate overwhelmingly rejected the 'Obamacare' provision- by 79 to 19. Some of the most senior Republicans in the Senate- including Minority leader Mitch McConnell, John McCain, and Lindsey Graham- voted to pass the cloture motion which would pass a continuing resolution that would keep the government fully funded until November 15. 'Today, the Republican Party has been infected by a small and destructive faction,' Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said. The overall budget bill was passed by the Senate but with a much smaller margin, as the final approval came with a vote of 54 for the bill and 44 against. Now, before the temporary funding goes into effect, the House needs to approve of the temporary funding. Looming: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid looks at a countdown clock as he warned that the Republican-controlled House must pass the budget bill or face being blamed for furloughing 800,000 federal workers . The Republican-controlled House could cause problems, however, because there is a group of rebellious Representatives who are willing to vote against the budget- and in turn, shut down the government- because they think it is insufficient in cutting down on spending. If the bill is not passed, 800,000 federal workers will be put on unpaid leave on Tuesday. On a wider scale, American standing in the world economy will be threatened as it was when the country's credit rating was downgraded following the 2011 budget debate. Leaders of the Republican party are among the most concerned about a shutdown as the actions of the riskier, more conservative members could spell doom for the party on the whole. If a shut down does occur because the House doesn't pass the bill, GOP leaders fear that it will be blamed on their party. Cruz's filibuster helped him raise both his public profile and campaign funds, but it did not win him a loyal army of Republican friends in the House who feel that they are being set up to look like they are against the conservative cause if they vote to keep the government funded. 'I think that a government shutdown is counterproductive to our message in 2014, because we transfer the public's attention perhaps away from Obamacare and instead put it on the pain that will be inflicted, that is still to be determined, on the effects of a government shutdown,' Republican Congressman Steve Womack said.","The Senate had to vote on a temporary measure to keep the federal government funded but a group of conservative Republicans attached a clause defunding 'Obamacare'

Republican leaders want to wait to hold the vote because there are concerns that conservative members may try to stop it from passing in order to make a point about the Affordable Care Act .

In a hearing room before arbitrator Fredric Horowitz, lawyers for the New York Yankees third baseman will argue why the 211-game suspension imposed by Major League Baseball on Aug. 5 should be overturned. 'Obviously this is going to be a grueling process all the way through,' Mr Rodriguez said. 'This has been a burden. It's been a big burden. So let's get it on.' A three-time AL MVP, Mr Rodriguez is fourth on the career home run list with 654. The Major League Baseball Players Association says the penalty imposed by baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is excessive. Unless there is a settlement, a decision isn't expected until the winter. Strike three?: Alex Rodriguez reacts after striking out in a recent game, he'll be looking to his a home run in his arbitration hearings this week . A veteran of baseball salary arbitration, the 64-year-old Mr Horowitz took over as the sport's grievance arbitrator in June 2012 from Shyam Das, fired a month earlier by management after almost 13 years. Mr Das had overturned a 50-game suspension of Milwaukee outfielder Ryan Braun in February after the players' association argued the urine sample was not handled properly. In Mr Horowitz's only decision thus far, he upheld a 100-game suspension imposed last year on San Francisco reliever Guillermo Mota for a second positive test. He has initially set aside Monday through Friday for the hearing, where each side can introduce evidence, present witnesses and cross-examine them. After the hearing days conclude, the sides will be given several weeks to submit final briefs. Mr Horowitz will then take time to make his decision. While technically chairman of a three-person panel, Mr Horowitz is the independent member joined by one representative of each side. Defiant to the end: Mr Rodriguez blasted the Yankees and MLB during a minor league rehab assignment in August, saying they were conspiring to keep him off the field . Mr Rodriguez has four law firms working for him, with team A-Rod including Joseph Tacopina of Tacopina Seigel & Turano (known for taking cases with a high media-profile); David Cornwell of Atlanta-based Gordon & Rees (who worked on Braun's case); Jordan Siev, co-head of the U.S. commercial litigation group at Reed Smith (a firm used by Rodriguez pal Jay-Z); and Bruce Simon of Cohen, Weiss & Simon (who represented MLB umpires in 1999). Earlier this year, Mr Rodriguez retained and then terminated two other firms. Yet, for all the outside legal help, much of the case will be presented by 55-year-old David Prouty, a Harvard Law School graduate hired by the players' association in 2008 from UNITE HERE, which represents employees in the hotel, gaming and food service industries. Mr Prouty was promoted to MLBPA general counsel in February, when union head Michael Weiner gave up that role a half-year after he made public he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Worked his way back: Despite all the forces working against him - age, rehabilitation after a second hip surgery, a looming ban - A-Rod worked his way back to the Majors after a successful Minor League rehab . Rob Manfred and Dan Halem, MLB's top labor lawyers, will direct management's case with assistance from Proskauer Rose, a law firm that represents several U.S. leagues. Mr Rodriguez was suspended for his involvement with the now-closed Biogenesis of America clinic in Coral Gables, Fla. The 13 other players penalized accepted their suspensions, which included a 65-game ban for Mr Braun and 50-game penalties for the others. MLB said Mr Rodriguez's was suspended under baseball's joint drug agreement 'based on his use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years.' He also was disciplined under the collective bargaining agreement 'for attempting to cover up his violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner's investigation.' For only three years: The tarnished player admitted taking steroids from 2001 to 2003 during his time with the Texas Rangers, as seen here . Mr Rodriguez is being treated as a first offender under the drug program, which means any suspension doesn't start unless upheld by an arbitrator. Following hip surgery in January and a leg injury sustained during a minor league rehabilitation assignment in July, Mr Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on the day he was suspended. The 38-year-old hit .244 with seven homers and 19 RBIs in 44 games. 'I'm really looking forward to at least one full off season of hardcore training,' said the oft-injured third baseman. 'I haven't had that in quite a long time - then come back in tremendous shape and help this team win. This team has a lot of things to do over the winter. Obviously my situation is going to play a big part in it.' Where it all began: A-Rod's career started in Seattle in 1996, some have speculated his steroid use goes back even that far . A-Rod and New York squawked at each other in the summer, with Mr Rodriguez maintaining the Yankees were trying to keep him from returning. The team denied the accusation. He is owed $86 million by the Yankees over the last four seasons of his record $275 million, 10-year contract. If he is suspended for the bulk of next season, the team has a chance to get under the luxury tax threshold of $189 million. But the length of any suspension will be decided by either Horowitz or in an agreement among Mr Rodriguez, MLB and the union. 'I will be there every day,' Mr Rodriguez said. 'I'm fighting for my life and my whole legacy.'","Long-awaited arbitration hearings begin Monday and are expected to last through the week .
If the suspension is upheld, it would effectively end Alex Rodriguez's divisive playing career .
The 38-year-old third baseman is still owed almost $90million by the New York Yankees ."

In the real world of amateur competition, though, it seems that matters are a bit more cut-throat. For Britain’s leading amateur ballroom dancer Kyle Taylor has had his ambitions of glory tripped up – amid rumours of skullduggery. Mr Taylor was tipped to waltz away with the top prize at next week’s prestigious International Ballroom Dancing Championships in London. But his dreams are in tatters after the Home Office refused to grant a visa allowing his Russian partner, Polina Shklyaeva, to travel to the UK to compete with him. Scroll down for video . Shock: Kyle Taylor and Polina Shklyaeva - ballroom dance champions are facing heartbreak after the latter was denied a visa . The rejection is believed to have come after an anonymous tip-off – rumoured to be from a rival dancer – alleging to the authorities that Miss Shklyaeva had been working illegally in the UK during her previous visits. ‘It’s completely untrue, and we are terribly, terribly disappointed,’ said Mr Taylor, 22, last night. ‘The decision seems to be based on lies. We think there have been dirty tricks involved, and have suspicions as to who is responsible. But there seems to be nothing we can do.’ Mr Taylor and Miss Shklyaeva, 20, have been representing Great Britain in international competition since 2011, under rules that allow couples with different nationalities to choose which to compete for. They have won several titles and are regarded by the British Dance Council (BDC), the sport’s governing body, as the country’s most talented prospects for a generation. This weekend, they were due to compete in two warm-up events in Sussex before appearing at the International Championships at the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday. Champions: The couple, pictured far right, with their trophy at Blackpool last year . Miss Shkylaeva’s failure to secure a visa has forced them to withdraw. It also threatens to stop them competing at the biggest event in the ballroom calendar, November’s National Championships in Blackpool, where they were hoping to defend the title they won last year. ‘Thanks to this Home Office decision, Britain’s best chance of a winner at the Albert Hall has disappeared,’ said Bryan Allen, president of the BDC. ‘I find the decision incomprehensible. There are so many skivers who come to this country and are just waved through. ‘And here we have a legitimate visa application, from a British champion who has represented this country many times, a lovely person from a good family, who wants to do things by the book, and she has been refused. It makes me so disappointed in our government.’ Mr Allen and the BDC provided letters vouching for Miss Shklyaeva. They have been unable to establish why the visa was refused. Not happy: Kyle Taylor with the letters he has received back from the Home Office . ‘It’s alleged that someone has complained about her. But we can’t find out a thing from the Home Office. They won’t discuss the case,’ he said. Speaking from Moscow, where she is a part-time student at the Russian State University of Physical Education, Miss Shklyaeva said that her application for a sports visitor visa was supported by 30 pages of documents confirming her status as an elite athlete. ‘I have been coming to Britain regularly for two years, always playing by the rules, so am shocked by what has happened,’ she said. ‘For such an instant change in the Home Office’s opinion towards me, there has to have been false information given to them. Kyle and I have been improving dramatically, so perhaps it has left our rivals with no option but to try to take us out of competition.’ The Home Office declined to comment. But in the rejection letter to Miss Shklyaeva it said it was ‘not satisfied’ she would leave the UK  after her visit. Miss Shklyaeva described that as ‘nonsense’. She said: ‘All I want is to represent Great Britain with Kyle, which I am very proud to do. If I am not allowed back into the country, it could be the end of my career.’","Kyle Taylor and Polina Shklyaeva are International Ballroom Dancing champions .

And we call on all states to play their part here, just as we will play ours.’ Mr Clegg, who backed strikes against Syria, also accused Bashar al-Assad’s regime of ‘war crimes’.

On the mend: Jonathan Vermont is back on his feet after his near-death-experience with sepsis . The tiny scar on Jonathan Vermont’s hand barely merits  a second glance. Yet because of this minute cut – just half an inch long – he almost lost his life. Barely a month ago he was lying in a hospital bed hovering between life and death, his body ravaged by sepsis, a blood condition that seriously affects at least 100,000 people every year in the UK and kills almost 40,000. And Jonathan, 22, a graduate and keen rugby player from Leatherhead in Surrey, was very lucky. His condition was diagnosed just in time to administer the intravenous antibiotics that saved his life. A new Health Service Ombudsman report states that a third of the 37,000 deaths from sepsis every year are a direct result of misdiagnosis or poor treatment. Substandard care in sepsis is costing the NHS £2.5 billion a year. Sepsis – formerly known as septicaemia – occurs when the body starts to attack its own organs and tissues as the immune system responds to micro-organisms such as bacteria that are already causing infection. Initial symptoms include feeling as though you have flu, but in extreme cases blood pressure plummets so low that vital organs are deprived of blood and shut down. Those with mild sepsis may be safely treated with antibiotics at home, but others require urgent hospital care. ‘It is more common than heart attacks and more deadly than a stroke,’ says Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care doctor at Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is campaigning with the UK Sepsis Trust to raise awareness of the condition and for research funds. ‘It kills more people every year than bowel, prostate and breast cancer combined, but it  is poorly funded and diagnostic techniques are pre-Victorian.’ Normally, sepsis affects the elderly or those with existing illnesses such as diabetes, kidney problems or pneumonia. But the fact that Jonathan developed it from an innocuous injury is a warning to us all. ‘I was scratched while training with . my rugby club in Dorking last month, during a scrum,’ he says. ‘Somebody’s finger must have just caught my hand. I didn’t think . anything of it at all.’ Just in time: As a result of the initial misdiagnosis for the sepsis as soft tissue infection, Jonathan was just hours from organ failure before given correct treatment . But 48 hours later, while walking his dog, he was startled to notice that his hand had swollen. Overnight the swelling worsened and Jonathan’s hand and arm ballooned up to his elbow. ‘It felt hot, throbbed with  pain and I couldn’t move my fingers,’ he says. His anxious girlfriend Beth, 21, who works for a sports tour company, texted a picture to her mother, who works in a hospital. Within minutes of receiving her reply, Jonathan and Beth were rushing to A&E at Epsom Hospital, where he was diagnosed with cellulitis – an infection of  the soft tissue – and transferred to St Helier Hospital in nearby Carshalton. Sepsis occurs when the  body responds to infection,  and can be caused by a huge variety of bacteria – such as  C.diff, E.coli, streptococcus or MRSA. Chemicals released into the blood to combat the  infection trigger widespread inflammation, which leads to blood clots and leaky vessels. Symptoms include a very high or low temperature, fast breathing, racing heartbeat, confusion or slurred speech. The skin may also be cool,  pale or mottled, and in  advanced stages the patient  can lose consciousness. About 100,000 people are admitted to hospital with  sepsis each year. Patients with the condition occupy more  than 30 per cent of intensive  care unit beds. Four days later he went home, believing it was all over. But the next morning, Jonathan felt as  if he had flu. ‘I had a soaring temperature, a headache and a sore throat. I felt dreadful,’ he says. Again he was persuaded by his girlfriend to go to hospital, where a blood test was taken. ‘Initially –  and confusingly, given that they had my discharge papers from the previous day – I was told I probably had tonsillitis. But then I was admitted to a ward.’ Analysis of his blood had shown that  he was in the middle of a dangerous attack of sepsis and just hours from organ failure. ‘I was barely functioning but I remember Beth phoning me, crying that I might die,’ Jonathan says. The confusion over his diagnosis exemplifies the lack of awareness of sepsis, according  to Dr Ron Daniels, consultant in intensive care at Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham and chief executive of the Sepsis Trust. ‘It ought to have been the first assumption,’ he says. ‘All medical professionals should be aware  of the subtle and fast-changing symptoms and do the necessary tests as soon as it is even suspected. These include blood tests for abnormal white cell count and lactic acid levels – high levels mean organs may not be receiving enough oxygen – as well as physiological observations such as heart rate and temperature. ‘The earlier the condition is caught, the better. In severe cases, every hour’s delay increases the risk of death by eight per cent and it is a tragic reality that  often a patient isn’t referred quickly enough. ‘It can take up to 72 hours to diagnose, by which point the organs may have started to shut down. If you think you or a relative may have sepsis, don’t hesitate to suggest it to a doctor.’ It is thought that by improving the speed of diagnosis, the NHS might save £170 million  a year. After four days of aggressive intravenous antibiotics, Jonathan was well enough to go home. ‘I hope that my experience may warn others,’ he says. ‘I’m proof that anyone can get sepsis, and I’m very grateful  not to be a statistic in  the report.’","Jonathan Vermont, got sepsis after suffering a cut during a rugby scrum .

Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has criticised customers at his own chain of health clubs and says lowering prices at his gyms has attracted the wrong sort of clientele. The multi-millionaire businessman said reducing the cost of membership at his Bannatyne's Health Clubs chain has led to an increase in 'problem customers'. Bannatyne, 64, who owns the UK's largest independent chain of health clubs, said lowering the price felt like 'devaluing' the brand but that he had to do it because he faced losing money. Duncan Bannatyne said cutting memberships prices at his health club caused a rise in 'problem customers' The Dragons' Den star (pictured left with Hilary Devey, Theo Paphitis, Deborah Meaden and Peter Jones) has been accused of having a 'Ratner moment' for criticising his customers . The wrong class of people: Bannatyne said that 'once you lower your thresholds, you start to attract more of the kinds of customers who create problems' However, the business tycoon said that he . had heard reports that new members were creating problems for staff, and . that the atmosphere within the gyms had changed as a result. He said his son-in-law Anthony, who runs one of the clubs, said they are attracting a different kind of customer since dropping the prices. He told Scotland on Sunday: 'More . and more, people are trying it on, trying to sneak in a friend without . paying or making complaints in the hope of getting money back. 'Once you lower your thresholds, you start to attract more of the kinds of customers who create problems and take up staff time.' Duncan Bannatyne has written about his recent business woes and divorce from wife Joanne in his autobiography . Monthly memberships at his gym chain were recently cut from £42 to £29 to try and attract new customers. Bannatyne told the newspaper the business was not 'in last chance saloon' but that slashing prices was a gamble. And even owning the company has not prevented him from uncomfortable encounters. He said he was 'intimidated' when he met two Russian bodybuilders who did not speak English at his Manchester branch and said older members would feel intimidated too. His comments were criticised by publicist Max Clifford, who compared him to jeweller Gerald Ratner. Ratner's business plummeted in value in 1991 after he called one of his products 'total crap.' Mr Clifford told The Independent: 'For someone to be criticising the people that are paying him, as Gerald Ratner found out years ago, is the last thing you should be doing.' Bannatyne has written about his recent business woes and divorce from wife Joanne in his autobiography, Riding The Storm, which was serialised in the Daily Mail. He lost £345million from his fortune and his spot in The Rich List over two years. Matt Barnett, Barclays chief executive . In 2003 Barnett shocked a panel of MPs, and the general public, but suggesting that he wouldn't use one of his own company's Barclaycard products because it was too expensive. He said: 'I do not borrow on credit cards. I have four young children. I give them advice not to pile up debts on their credit cards.' David Shepherd, Topman brand director: . Calling your own customers 'hooligans' probably isn't the best way to win their loyalty, but in 2001 that was who the Topman brand director said his clothes were for. Asked to elaborate, he went on to say: 'Very few of our customers have to wear suits for work. They'll be for his first interview or first court case.' When challenged on the remarks, he said that 'hooligan' probably wasn't offensive to his clientele. Winston Cigarettes executive: .

When he was told to take them all, Goerlitz asked if anyone else there smoked. An executive responded: 'Are you kidding? We reserve that right for the poor, the young, the black and the stupid.' John Pluthero, UK chairman Cable & Wireless: . In a reverse-Ratner, one chairman managed to offend his staff rather than his customers. In 2006 John Pluthero sent a morale-boosting memo to staff which read: 'Congratulations, we work for an underperforming business in a crappy industry and it's going to be hell for the next 12 months.' He warned of job losses before adding: 'If you are worried that it all sounds very hard, it's time for you to step off the bus.'","Tycoon said cutting membership price has changed atmosphere at clubs .

Mariano Rivera last night broke down in sobs after he made his final pitch at the Yankee Stadium - in what will no doubt go down as one of the most memorable departures in baseball history. The acclaimed relief . pitcher, 43, remained at the mound after his final pitch against Tampa Bay and wept uncontrollably when fellow Yankees Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte emerged from the dugout to remove him. Rivera, who has played for the team for 18 years, bawled during a thunderous ovation from the sellout crowd of 48,675 as he remained on the field for four minutes after the pitch. 'I was bombarded with emotions and . feeling that I couldn't describe,' Rivera said after the game. 'Everything hit at that time. I knew that was the last time. Period. I . never felt like that before.' Overwhelmed: New York Yankees relief pitcher Mariano Rivera cries as he leaves the mound in the ninth inning of his final appearance in a baseball game at Yankee Stadium on Thursday night . The Panamanian joined the Yankees in 1995 and has since gained a reputation as one of the most dominant relievers in baseball history. As he continued to weep on the field on Thursday, Jeter and Pettitte appeared on the mound and Jeter apparently told his old friend: 'It's time to go.' Pettitte, who also is retiring when the season ends on Sunday, gave Rivera a 30-second bear hug, followed by a 15-second embrace from Jeter. After the game on Thursday, Yankees manager Joe Girardi told the Associated Press that he had conceived the idea in the eighth inning of including Jeter and Pettitte. Support: Derek Jeter, left, applauds as Andy Pettitte, back to camera, embraces Rivera as he cries . Applause: The crowd remained on their feet throughout the emotional moment on the field on Thursday . Sadness: Tears fall from Rivera's eyes as he hugs Jeter before leaving his last ever home game on Thursday . 'I've never seen a player pull another player, so I had to ask,' he said. Girardi conferred with plate umpire Laz Diaz before the ninth, and Diaz consulted with crew chief Mike Winters. 'Then I said, ""Well, can I send two?"" and they said, ""Well, go ahead."" And I really appreciate that because I think it made the moment even more special for Mo,' Girardi explained. At first, Pettitte didn't think it was such a good idea but when he got to the mound, he quickly decided 'it was awfully cool'. The three players have known each other since they were in the minors in the early 1990s, and all three came up to the Yankees for the first time in 1995. 'It's crazy how fast it went by,' Pettitte said. Emotion: Rivera waves to the crowd after leaving the game against the Tampa Bay Rays in the ninth inning . Thankful: Rivera, 43, reacts to the fans at the end of his last home game before his retirement . Saying goodbye: He remained on the mound for four minutes before he was removed by his teammates . Memories: Rivera carries the ball after teammates Pettitte and Jeter removed him from the game . Rivera's demeanor caught Pettitte by surprise. 'I didn't say anything at first, and I didn't expect for him to be quite so emotional,' Pettitte said. 'He broke down and just gave me a bear hug and I just bear-hugged him back. 'He was really crying. He was weeping, and I could feel him crying on me.' When he walked off the mound for the final time with two outs in the top of the ninth, he wiped his eyes with both arms and blew a kiss to the first row behind the Yankees dugout. He hugged a tearful Girardi in the dugout, grabbed a towel to dab his own tears, came out again and doffed his cap to the crowd. All the while, the Rays remained in their dugout applauding. And after Rivera came off, Pettitte came out for his own curtain call before the bottom of the ninth as the Rays waited in their dugout, not wanting to interrupt the moment. Farewell: Bench coach Tony Pena hugs pitcher Rivera as manager Joe Girardi, left, looks on . Loved: Fans hold signs after Rivera's final appearance at a baseball game at Yankee Stadium on Thursday . Grateful: Rivera has gained a reputation as one of the most dominant relievers in baseball history . Rays manager Joe Maddon is a longtime fan of Rivera's consistency, durability and quiet humility. 'They know how to do things here,' he said. 'They're great at pomp and circumstance in this place. After the last out, Rivera took  a last walk to the mound, rubbing his feet on the rubber, kneeling and gathering a bit of his workplace as a keepsake. 'I wanted to get some dirt, just stay there for the last time, knowing that I ain't going to be there no more,' he said. He said he'll always remember the home finale, along with the five World Series titles. The Yankees lost 4-0 to the Rays. 'It was amazing. A great, great night,' he said and then paused. 'We lost. I don't know how I'd be saying that.'

But he was interrupted by the retired soldier, a Conservative party member, before he was ushered out of the hall by security guards. Interrupting Mr Hammond's speech in the main hall, retired Colonel Brazier said: ‘Tell the truth about the disbandment of the Fusiliers. ‘I write you letters, you don't respond. The public must know the truth - the Fusiliers are loyal soldiers, you have betrayed them. ‘Sir, you need to be looking at defence. This is denial, not defence. You're a disgrace.’ The 2nd battalion fusiliers, who also held a protest outside the conference centre, was formed in 1968 have served in Cyprus, Germany, Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Speaking outside the main hall to . reporters, Col Brazier, chairman of the Fusiliers Association, said he . was speaking on ‘behalf of all retired fusiliers’. He was accompanied by Captain Joe Eastwood, 76, from Cambridge, when he interrupted Mr Hammond. Colonel Brazier, 59, added: ‘I am very angry about the fact the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (2RRF), is to be disbanded. ‘The MoD are not answering our questions, it (the process) has not been open and therefore I am left with no choice. ‘I have asked, I have written, I have petitioned - I have been denied, it has been denied evaded and avoided and yes I am angry. My soldiers, the people I had the honour to serve with have been betrayed. Protest: Away from the conference hall thousands of people marched through the streets of Manchester in support of a variety of causes including the National Health Service . ‘We cannot operate as an armed force, when we are talking about being the force largest defence budget.’ He continued: ‘It's not just . about reviews and money. I know Mr Hammond is a banker and he obviously . behaves like one. What he has to do is look at the need. Of course there . have to be cuts but make them rational, make them about manning, make . them about capability, make them about recruiting.’ He said Mr Hammond should now be replaced as Defence Secretary by somebody ‘who knows what they are doing’. However Mr Hammond insisted the decision was made by the Army. ‘If they'd stayed in the hall a bit longer they would have heard the case that I was building in my speech for why we have to invest in the new capabilities we need to defend Britain,’ he told Sky News. ‘While we all cherish our military traditions - and we have great regiments with proud histories - we have to reduce the size of our conventional armed forces as we are investing for example in new cyber.

The protest is highlighting the impact of Government policies on jobs and spending across the health service, as well as the 'rapid sell-off' of the most lucrative parts of the NHS to private healthcare companies.

On trial: Andrew Batchelor, dubbed the 'Menace of Mayfair', posed as a jeweller to con wealthy victims into handing over their jewellery . A 'charming conman' who posed as a high class jeweller to dupe his wealthy customers into handing over their valuables has been jailed for the third time. Andrew Batchelor, 54, known as the 'Menace of Mayfair', tricked clients, including company directors and lawyers, into parting with more than £7,000 of jewellery, including Cartier bracelets and Rolex watches. Some items were third generation family heirlooms. Batchelor, who is also known as ‘Glasgow Goldfinger’ after running similar scams in Scotland, was jailed for five years in 2009 after pleading guilty to 29 charges, including 22 fraud offences, and banned from operating in the jewellery business. Within months of his release last year Batchelor broke the conditions of the order by working in the trade, carrying out deals for three women, and by entering a pawn shop. Batchelor has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years at Southwark Crown Court for what the judge called a series of ‘fundamental’ breaches’. The judge, Mrs Recorder Emma Arbuthnot said: ‘Within five months of leaving prison in September 2011 you set up a website to deal in luxury goods such as handbags and luggage but the site also showed images of jewellery. ‘Inevitably this attracted interest from members of the public who had fallen on hard times and needed to raise money by selling their valuables. ‘You called your site Park Lane Vintage, it was based in the heart of Mayfair. ‘A least two of the women said this address gave them confidence you were a legitimate businessman. ‘What they did not know was that you had 35 previous convictions for defrauding innocent members of the public of their jewellery.’ Prosecutors branded Batchelor a ‘charming conman’ over a nine-day trial during which he was heard to have pawned one client’s jewellery to fund his own lifestyle after promising to sell it. He claimed he intended to pay the woman by borrowing from his friends and family. Antony Swift, prosecuting, said today: ‘That’s not a business. If he were to appear on The Apprentice like that Lord Sugar would have words with him.’ Batchelor’s defence counsel, Gregory King-Underwood said: ‘It is as if he lived some kind of fantasy life. ‘He had the expertise but he did not have the ability to run a business. ‘He was less motivated by malevolence against the individuals and more by the fantasy life which he led.’ Batchelor was also jailed in 1999 for similar cons in London and Glasgow. In 1999 he was jailed for seven years - later reduced to five-and-a-half on appeal - for conning customers out of nearly £400,000 of valuables at his jewellery shop in Royal Exchange Square, Glasgow. 'Conman': Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Batchelor duped four victims into giving him their valuables for him to sell on their behalf . Prosecutor Antony Swift told a jury at Southwark Crown Court last week: ‘The defendant really is nothing more than a conman, a knowledgeable one, a charming on, but a conman nevertheless.’ He added: ‘In broad terms, we say the defendant is a fraudster, a conman, he cons people out of jewellery and watches in order to make a profit for himself and put other people at risk of loss. ‘He’s operated in that way in breach of a court order made in 2009 which is intended to prevent him from working in the jewellery business at all.’ The well-heeled fraudster was said to have wined and dined customers at top hotels before pawning or selling their possessions and pocketing the cash between February and June 2012. Among Batchelor’s alleged victims was businesswoman and school governor Eva Lewis, who lost a Cartier bracelet and bangle to him after she turned to him desperate to raise funds. She told the court he had treated her to lunch at London’s five-star Royal Garden Hotel before disappeared with gold jewellery worth more than £1,000. The court heard police managed to recover the bracelet but the bangle is still missing. Batchelor told jurors her had sold Mrs Lewis’s valuables as a ‘personal favour’. Expensive: The conman duped customers into parting with Rolex watches. The conman, from Bayswater, west London, was found guilty of two counts of failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order and had previously pleaded guilty to a third identical charge. He was found not guilty of two counts of fraud by abuse of position and one of fraud by false representation. The jury were unable to reach verdicts on one count of failing to comply with a Serious Crime Prevention Order, one count of attempting to breach a Serious Crime Prevention Order, and one count of fraud by false representation. He was sentenced to 30 months behind bars and ordered to pay £2,675 in compensation. A new five-year Serious Crime Prevention Order was also imposed. Detective Inspector Karl Amos of the MPS Lifetime Offender Management Unit said: ‘Batchelor clearly pays little regard to the criminal justice system. No sooner had he been released from prison than he was again setting up a false business in breach of the Serious Crime Prevention Order. ‘The early enforcement of the Serious Crime Prevention Order allowed the police to make an early and decisive intervention, limiting his ability to commit further crime and preventing further members of the public from losing their belongings.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Andrew Batchelor, 54, wined and dined customers at top hotels before pawning their possessions .

A conman who swindled thousands of pounds from vulnerable women he picked up on online dating sites was on bail for a similar crime when he committed the frauds. David Brice, 48, targeted women across Britain and charmed them into handing over more than £7,800 in cash and possessions by gaining their trust. Bristol Crown Court heard he defrauded the women while on bail from a three-year jail term for 'carbon copies' of the latest crimes. Three years ago,  Brice conned nearly £17,000 from women he had struck up an online relationship with. Brice, a self-employed tyre fitter, cried in the dock as he was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to six charges of fraud and one of theft, having swindled more than £7,809 from five more victims. Recorder David Evans told Brice: ‘You have a long, shameful history of stealing from and deceiving people for your own gain. ‘It seems clear that it is more than greed that motivates you. You have acknowledged that deceiving others out of their property gives you a perceived thrill. ‘In other words, you actually enjoy deceiving others. That is a most disgraceful character trait and one that you show no sign of casting off.’ Brice, of St George, Bristol, was jailed for three years in May 2010 after admitting nine charges of fraud and six of theft for swindling almost £17,000 from women he met on dating websites. Upon his release, he returned to several online dating sites and followed the same pattern as before to carry out near identical offences, the court was told. His plan fell apart after failing to con a woman of her car and cash. Brice picked up a Norfolk woman, referred to in court as Brenda, on dating website Smooch, and posed as a charming Good Samaritan, telling her he would help her swap her broken car through a friend. Taking him up on his fake promise, 'Brenda' drove to Bristol and paid Brice £150 for repairs to her car, then took him out for dinner, where he asked for a further £100. Brice drove Brenda to her sister’s home in Newport and promised the Ford Fiesta would follow, but vanished when she refused to pay a further £350. Police were called and Brice was arrested, prosecutor Ian Fenny said. Cruel con: Brice was jailed for four years by Bristol Crown Court after admitting to re-offending and conning five women out of more than £7,800 . Mr Fenny added: ‘He was continuing to offend while on bail for that matter. He continued to offend after his appearance before this very court where he entered a guilty plea.’ Another women, Rosemary, met Brice on the Plenty of Fish site, where he had the username ‘alwaysgrinning1’, and the couple arranged to meet at a B&Q car park in Yate, Gloucestershire, in April this year. Brice extracted £1,000 from Rosemary after telling her he needed the money to set up a fast food business, after which he returned to beg for a new computer and a mobile phone. Brice then disappeared and moved on to another woman, named as Carol, on dating site Oasis, claiming to be a fireman. On April 15, Brice met Carol in a Tesco car park in Eastville, Bristol, and persuaded her to hand over her daughter’s laptop before claiming he was tired and leaving. He charmed his third victim, Sylvia, a  57-year-old from Reading suffering from MS, on Plenty of Fish under another username. Sylvia paid for a hotel room and lent Brice £1,800, which she withdrew with her credit card at a cashpoint. Watching her from behind, Brice saw her pin code and later used the card to withdraw around £200, Mr Fenny told the court. Pickup-lines: Brice used online dating sites such as smooch.com to look for vulnerable women whom he could con out of money and possessions . Victim number four, Jill, who has learning difficulties, met ‘davethehappy1’ on Plenty of Fish and arranged to meet him on August 5 in Bristol. Yet again, his 'date' paid for a hotel room after which he persuaded her to withdraw £300 in cash. Looking for a way to get his hands on more of Jill's money, he ‘told her she was the one’, before the pair embarked on a £2,100 spending spree around the city. Mr Fenny said: ‘The spending spree involved the purchase of expensive items, items of jewellery, cigarettes and computers.’ Final victim Marie also met Brice on Plenty of Fish and he offered to fix her £2,409 moped. Brice collected the moped and a laptop, then vanished. ‘The complainants in this case are all in different ways vulnerable women,’ Mr Fenny said. ‘They are all mature women. One has learning difficulties, two have physical disabilities. ‘They were all looking for friendship through the internet. That was a frailty which the defendant preyed on. ‘They were anxious to find a relationship. This defendant - clearly in the eyes of many women - is very plausible. That has the hallmarks of a professional fraudster, which we say he is.’ Mr Fenny said Brice had 30 previous convictions dating back to 1984, including offences of theft, kidnapping, deception, burglary and fraud. Defending Brice, David Martin said his client did not exploit the women romantically or sexually. ‘In fact, one of the women went very close and was denied,’ Mr Martin said. He said Brice was a potential kidney donor for his partner Rachel and the couple had a ‘close relationship’. ‘It is like an addiction,’ Mr Martin said. ‘He can’t stop it. He has to stop it or he is going to spend the rest of his life in prison. ‘He said to me, ‘this is the last time, I am not doing this again, I feel genuine remorse for what I have put these women through’.’ But the judge told Brice: ‘I regard your word as utterly worthless.’ The victims full names were withheld from court for their protection.","David Brice, 48, was on bail when he defrauded women he met online .

Roger Bainbridge, 67, went missing after travelling to the tiny island of Antipaxos three days ago . The family of a British pensioner who has gone missing after visiting a tiny Greek island may have to pay for their own helicopter search, it has emerged. Roger Bainbridge, 67, was last seen three days ago travelling alone to Antipaxos which is just two square miles. His family from Kendal, Cumbria, could be forced to pay for the search as there are only two police officers on neighboring island, Paxos. Mr Bainbridge, a retired electricity board worker was on holiday with his sister Maggie Cooper who lives on the island when he disappeared. The father-of-two decided to go walking on Antipaxos alone, and was last seen boarding a boat to the island that lies just off the coast of Corfu. He was expected to return to his sister's house for a barbeque later in the day but never showed up. Mr Bainbridge went abroad for the first time just five years ago, and has been visiting his sister in Paxos every year since. His son, Iain Bainbridge, 39, said his father's disappearance was a huge shock that has sparked fear throughout his whole family. He said: 'Dad goes to my Auntie Maggie's house on the island every year - he loves the hot weather and enjoys swimming there. 'He's still a very fit person, he doesn't drink or smoke, and wanted to visit the other island, which is just a short boat trip away. 'My auntie was cooking a barbecue on Thursday night and my dad didn't make it home. There are only two police officers on the island of Paxos, and none on Antipaxos which has a population of just 64 . 'It's not like him to miss any event - especially when there's hot meat on the table.' As police presence on the island is so small, the family is becoming increasingly anxious. Estate . agent Iain added: 'There's only two police officers on Paxos, so I'm . not even sure if they regularly go over to the smaller island. 'The police over there could be out of their depth and it could mean we as a family paying for a helicopter. 'I've been racking my brains about what could have happened since Dad went missing. 'It just doesn't make sense - every possible explanation we've suggested as a family just doesn't stand up. Mr Bainbridge was visiting his sister in Greece when he took a boat to the island of Antipaxos (pictured) alone to go walking . 'If he was attacked, surely someone would have found his possessions or would have seen something. 'And if he got on the wrong boat heading back from Antipaxos, I'm certain he would have found someone who speaks English. 'It's a total mystery and it's becoming more worrying by the minute.' A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'I can confirm a British national is missing on an island near Corfu and we are providing consular assistance.'","Roger Bainbridge, 67, went missing three days ago after visiting island of Antipaxos .

Actress Naomi Watts shocked the world when she announced the late Princess Diana had given her 'permission' to play her on screen. But she is not the only one who believes the tragic royal is communicating with them from beyond the grave. Ken and Jo Dobson, who describe themselves as 'Britain's biggest Diana fanatics', claim to have experienced 'unmistakable' signals from the former Princess of Wales - and even believe they have seen her spirit. Scroll down for video . Dedicated: Jo and Ken Dobson say Princess Diana interacts with them from beyond the grave . Fan: Jo and Ken have met, among others, Diana's brother Earl Spencer and former butler Paul Burrell . The Gloucestershire pair, who first developed a fascination with the People's Princess when she entered public life with her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981, have amassed collectibles worth thousands of pounds and have dedicated their lives to preserving her memory. Jo, 74, said: 'We've loved Diana from day one.There was something about that young lady that just drew you to her. We can't explain it - we just loved her.' But it wasn't until after her untimely death in Paris in 1997 that they decided to formalise their devotion by co-founding the 'Diana Circle UK'. 'There are seven of us all together and we started this two years after Diana died,' said Jo. 'We were all standing outside Kensington Palace and we said ""this woman must never be forgotten - we must keep her memory alive"".' Every inch of their modest bungalow is now dedicated to Diana and they have so many photographs, sketches, plates and dolls that they are considering getting planning permission for an extension - or even erecting a tent in their garden. Collection: Jo and Ken have amassed memorabilia worth many thousands of pounds over the last 30 years . Shrine: The couple are convinced Diana was murdered and was 'like a lamb to the slaughter' They believe the huge collection could be worth a five-figure sum but say they would never sell any of the memorabilia. 'We're not worried about the money in this, we just buy, buy, buy,' said Ken, 76. The couple say they are also in contact with Diana's former butler Paul Burrell and speak to him 'once a week'. They constantly study the circumstances of her death and have no doubt she was murdered. 'She was a like a lamb to the slaughter,' said Ken, who recently lost his sight and believes Diana helped him through his stay in hospital. 'We don't think the truth will come out in our time - but it will in years to come.' Like Diana, who was once friends with TV medium Psychic Sally, Ken and Jo are spiritualists and say they have forged a bond with Diana. Spooky: According to Jo, Diana's face briefly appeared on a Christmas fairy one year before fading away . Memory: The pair co-founded the Diana Circle UK and hope to keep memories of the late princess alive . According to the couple, signs . include white feathers that have mysteriously fallen from the sky and a . special Diana candle which went out as her body was taken back to her . childhood home of Althorp in Northamptionshire. They . also have a rose bush in their back garden, which they say develops red . blotches around the day of Diana's death, which they call 'blood . spots'. However, the strongest signal to date came at Christmas one year, recalls Jo. 'I'll never forget it,' she said. 'We were at my sister's one year and she always had a big Christmas tree for her grandchildren. I just happened to glance up and instead of the fairy on top of the tree there was Diana's face - and she was just looking down smiling. 'Then she gradually faded away until she was gone. We are not spooky or anything but we believe it. We don't care what other people say.' Disapproval: The Dobsons have said that they are not impressed by the new biopic of Princess Diana . Despite their determination to keep Diana's memory alive, they are horrified by the release of the new film, Diana, which hit cinemas earlier this month. Jo, who says the only royals she has time for are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, said: 'We've got no time for this Diana film. I think in a way it's disgusting they've done this because 16 years on and that young girl could not be laid to rest. 'It's ruining Diana's reputation, that poor girl. She's done a lot for this country.' With the closing of the official Diana museum last month, Jo and Ken's next step is to try and inspire the next generation of Diana fans to continue the efforts of the Diana Circle UK, and preserve the memory of the People's Princess for years to come.","Jo and Ken Dobson, from Gloucestershire, say Diana sends them signs .

She is the first to admit her last novel Jump! was not as racy as some of her others, because it’s harder to write sex scenes now she is in her 70s. But at 76, Jilly Cooper, queen of the bonkbuster, has no intention of putting her pen down for good. Her writing is not just a passion, but a necessity to pay for the round-the-clock care needed by her husband Leo, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease more than a decade ago and is confined to his bed. Such is her devotion to her husband of 51 years – whom she has known since she was nine years old – that the writer would rather he be looked after at home than in residential care. Leo, 79, was rushed into hospital on . Christmas Eve 2011 after collapsing at home, and Miss Cooper lived in a . hospital for nine weeks. Despite often speaking of her love for the NHS and her awe of its hard-working doctors and nurses, she has revealed that a succession of scandals have left her - and others - unsure whether to go on supporting it. Criticism: Best-selling author Jilly Cooper has spoken out about the erosion of trust in the NHS . 'I think people are terrified,' revealed Cooper. 'One hears such scare stories. It's a bit like children . hearing about terrible abuse in children's homes and being terrified of . being taken away from their parent and thrust into a home. 'There is a real blackening the name of our institutions going on at the moment.' Now, she is determined to keep Leo at home in Gloucester. ‘He’s going to stay here,’ she says. ‘It’s sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly, so we have difficulty understanding what he means, which must be so frustrating for him, but he is so very brave.’ But her determination to care for her husband means Miss Cooper has to keep writing to pay the bills that stack up. ‘I’d had a minor stroke so I couldn’t do it on my own. I love writing anyway but I have to keep on working because I have to pay for it all. ‘Some people say, “Gosh, we have to work until we are 70”, but I feel lucky that I can.’ Tragic: Cooper, whose husband Leo has Parkinson's Disease, previously championed the health service . For Cooper, the fact that she can support her husband in light of the flailing state of the National Health Service is a good thing. She has previously spoken warmly of the NHS after receiving exemplary care following a mild stroke she suffered three years ago but now says that accountability within the organisation is a growing issue. 'Some . of the patients are a bit muddled and when a lady comes around with a . clipboard and asks when they last saw a nurse or a doctor they say two . days ago, even if it was two minutes ago and that's what goes down on . record,' she added. 'Accident and emergency are absolutely inundated and people have so much paperwork to do. It's the same with all our public services, there's so much time wasted filling in forms.' As a result, and despite the challenges involved in looking after husband Leo, who was last seen in public at the 2005 wedding of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, Cooper says she would never consider putting him onto a care home. 'Absolutely not. No. This is his home. He's going to stay here. I . love him. Everybody loves him, he's precious to us all. 'It's . sad because he has difficulty expressing himself and speaking clearly, . so we have difficulty understanding what he means, which must be so . frustrating for him, but he is so very brave.' Jilly says she is still writing, which, she adds, she needs to do to pay for the coupe's medical bills and care. Appearance: Leo Cooper was last seen in public at the nuptials of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . Image problem: A string of recent scandals have undermined confidence in the NHS says Cooper . 'I'd had a minor stroke so I couldn't do it on my own. We have a . live-in carer and extra carers coming in three times a day, who are . marvellous. '!t has to be paid . for but the NHS do help with things. This is a big house and all the . care is very expensive. I love writing anyway but I have to keep on . working because I have to pay for it all.' She added: 'I think people feel guilty about growing old and needing everybody there to support them. 'Some . people say, ""Gosh, we have to work until we are 70,"" but I feel lucky . that I can. Leo's my husband and I've got to get on with it.' She . is currently researching her latest book on flat racing and has . admitted her last novel 'Jump' was not as racy because it's harder to . write sex scenes in your 70s. Jilly . says her two adopted children, Felix, a property developer, and Emily, a . make-up artist, have looked after her 'wonderfully'. It . was Felix who noticed something was wrong when she had a minor stroke . and insisted she saw a doctor - a decision which could have saved her . life. She added: 'People don't like old moaners. I'm a great believer in laugh and the world laughs with you. People enjoy talking to older people because they are the key to the past and have stories to tell.'","The author says she feels lucky she can still work well into her 70s .

'I was losing myself in Guinness': Ricky Hatton has opened up about his drink and drugs problems . Ricky Hatton has revealed how his life became enveloped by drink and drugs – and that he came to the brink of suicide several times. The former boxer admits that depression took hold after he lost his first-ever boxing match, to Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in 2007. He has described how he broke down in tears following the bout, feeling that he’d let everyone down, and turned to alcohol in a bid to block out his anguish. The revelations come in Ricky's new book – War And Peace: My Story – extracts of which were published in The Sun on Sunday. The 34-year-old said: ‘I was losing myself in Guinness after Guinness. I didn’t care what I looked like. I was on a suicide mission.’ Ricky said he tried to commit suicide with a knife on several occasions. He said: ‘I lift the blade and terrible thoughts come into my head. I should end it sooner rather than later. The cold blade makes contact. I break the skin, pierce the flesh of my wrist. I just want to die.’ After losing to Manny Pacquiao in May 2009 in Las Vegas Ricky’s depression worsened and he turned to drugs. He said: ‘I hoped drugs might make things better, shortly after the Pacquiao fight.’ A year later he was filmed by a newspaper snorting cocaine in a hotel room. Ricky’s state of mind has much improved, in part thanks to help group Sporting Chance - founded by former Arsenal captain Tony Adams - which he said has taught him how to cope when things flare up. Ricky, from Hattersley in Greater Manchester, had another daughter in July and took to Twitter to show off Fearne Grace Hatton. He posted the news on his official page, before posting a couple of photos of the new arrival, one with his older children Campbell and Millie.

Hero: Mitul Shah, 38, pictured with his daughter Sarai, aged two, was killed by terrorist at the Nairobi shopping mall . A British man who offered himself as a hostage to save the lives of a group of children was today described by colleagues as a 'born leader'. Mitul Shah, 38, a sales executive from London attempted to strike a deal with the terrorists, replacing children with himself, a heroic act which gave several victims vital time to escape. The selfless father did not get through to the gunmen and was shot alongside a number of children in the Kenyan tragedy, leaving behind his wife and two-year-old daughter. Today his employers, the cooking oil company Bidco Oil, and his work colleagues spoke of their grief at his loss. The firm said in a statement: ‘He was a born leader and an inspiring soul loved by one and all.’ Mr Shah, who was born in April 1975 in North London, held dual British and Kenyan citizenship. After going to school in Kenya, he studied management science with . computing at Kent University in Canterbury, Kent and obtained a Bachelor . of Science degree. He then . joined Bidco Oil Refineries in Kenya as a management trainee and worked . his way up to become a team leader in the marketing department. Mr Shah, who leaves a widow, Rupal, and . daughter Sarai, was killed moments after he was helping 33 children . taking part in a TV cooking contest on the roof of the Westgate centre . in Nairobi. The event was being sponsored by his company. One of the directors of Bidco, Dipak Shah, said today that his family and colleagues were all devastated. He said: ‘He was trying to negotiate the freedom of the children in order for him to be taken as a hostage. ’Some had managed to save their lives, but unfortunately he, and others, did not. ’It . was a heroic and brave act - a true reflection of his soul. He was a . wonderful person who always went out of his way, beyond the call of . duty, to help others.’ Murdered: Mitul Shah, pictured with wife Rupal Shah and daughter Sarai, was unable to get through to the gunmen and was shot alongside several children in the Kenyan tragedy . Tribute: Mr Shah's employer and colleagues spoke of their grief at his loss, praising him as a 'born leader and an inspiring soul loved by one and all¿ . The body of 38-year-old Mitul Shah lies in the main hall of the Oshwal Community Centre in Westlands nearby to the Westgate Shopping Centre where hundreds of mourners and well-wishers come to pay their last respects . He said that, like his family, everyone at the company was grieving his death. He said: ‘We are anguished and . shell-shocked at the turn of events. The tragic loss of our colleague . and brother has created a vacuum in our heart as much as it has in our . organisation. ‘All employees . who have known him for long and short periods concur that he was an . immensely effective leader, easy to get along with - on a personal . level, very caring and concerned and on a professional level, highly . dedicated and motivated. ’He was highly talented and has enriched the lives of everyone he has come across. ’It . is a big, very big loss -not just for the family or for Bidco but for .

'He was among the first casualties of the Westgate Siege - losing his life in the first bout of attack, presumably killed while trying to protect some children who were assembled to participate or witness a cooking challenge.’ He had helped the firm win a number of industry awards and was also an accomplished sportsman, the company said. He had taken part in endurance races, swimathons and had climbed both Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. ‘He was young, dynamic, enterprising, . hardworking & well focused person as well as the youngest team . leader in Bidco, ‘the statement added. The avid Manchester United fan was also president of the company's football team. Yesterday, soldiers and doctors who were among the first people into the mall after it was reclaimed on Tuesday, spoke of the horrifying scenes inside . Bomb disposal experts with sniffer dogs were yesterday painstakingly combing the part of the building still standing for explosives before clearing forensic officers, police and troops to search for bodies . The collapse happened on Monday when government troops launched a massive assault on the mall where up to 150 people are thought to have been killed . Work colleagues paid tribute to Mr Shah on the internet. One, named Alkane, wrote: ‘He is a real hero and had an option to run away but he opted to become a saviour of kids without wasting a second. ‘This says it all about Mitul.

Campbell, who won 73 caps as a defender for England and two Premier League titles when he played for Arsenal, said he is likely to pursue his new career across Europe because of the 'archaic attitudes' in the domestic game. The 39-year-old, who retired in May 2012 following a 19-year footballing career to take a coaching course, said: 'There are no opportunities for me here, not until attitudes change anyway. Attitude: Sol Campbell said the way black managers were viewed in the British game was 'archaic' He told the Guardian: 'I want to start abroad. 'Everyone . has to ask themselves why there are not more black managers in this . country and why the likes of Brian Deane have to go abroad (to Sarpsborg . 08 in Norway) to get a chance.

He believes their attitude could be summed up by the fact that they went on to appoint the equally inexperienced Gary Neville, who was also a regular in the England defence in which Campbell so heavily featured, as assistant manager. 'I gave my heart and soul for the national team but the FA were not there for me when I had problems,' he said. 'It's obvious they want nice people who won't cause them any problems. I put out an olive branch and it got broken, but whatever, I'm ready to move on.' England assistant: Gary Neville is already an established member of the international setup .

An artist has blasted a gallery as 'fearful' after discovering her nude portraits had been censored with strategically placed strips of paper. Danuta Gray, 74, has removed her three watercolours of naked women from Birmingham’s Botanical Gardens studio two weeks before her exhibition was due to end. Gallery bosses have stood by their censoring, which was prompted by a teacher's complaint during a school trip. Furious: Danuta Gray, 74, was incensed when she discovered her paintings had been covered up . Mrs Gray, a former gynaecologist, immediately withdrew all her paintings - including a male nude, which, inexplicably, was left uncovered - when she heard about the decision. 'It’s a nonsense,' she said. 'You can’t even see a nipple! They are showing such ignorance. 'Nudes have been depicted since the fourth century BC. They are present in all cultures. 'Rodin’s sculpture of a nude male and female entwined in The Kiss has been on show at the Tate since before 1955, as well as numerous paintings of nudes, including those by Picasso and Matisse. 'The Tate does not cover up these works of art, and the people who come to see these exhibitions are in family groups, with children of all ages and people of all nationalities and cultures. 'There is nothing as beautiful as the naked body. Complaint: At first, gallery bosses took the paintings down after a teacher complained on a school trip . 'Fearful': Mrs Gray accused Birmingham Botanical Gardens of 'hypocrisy, prejudice and fear' 'I never thought that the Botanical Gardens would exhibit such hypocrisy, prejudice and fear. This is England.' Initially, the paintings were removed. But when Mrs Gray discovered and complained, they were reinstated and covered up. Mrs Gray, who moved to Birmingham from Poland in 1947, said: 'They explained the gallery was being used as a classroom. 'They were all aged seven. It is rubbish. With all the terrible things on TV, I’m sure the children of today know more about the human body than I do. 'First the paintings were removed altogether but I got them put back up. Then a friend was incandescent to see my female nudes covered with bits of paper. She tried to complain but the woman in charge wouldn’t come out. 'I was enraged by this censorship since I have exhibited nudes there many times before and in other galleries without problems. This 1917 painting entitled 'Reclining Nude (on Her Left Side),' by world-famous artist Amadeo Modigliani, is regarded as a classic. It was auctioned off at Christie's Auction House in New York in 2003 for $26.88 million . Accepted: Mrs Gray argues galleries such as Tate Britain proudly display nude paintings for all audiences .

Benefit fraudster: Dennis Hopwood falsely claimed £43,000 in benefits he wasn't entitled to . A wealthy pensioner pocketed £43,000 in a benefit fraud after failing to declare his family owned and later sold a luxury hotel. Former paratrooper Dennis Hopwood, 75, falsely claimed Pension Credit and council tax benefits over eight years despite receiving £500 per week from the family business. His scam continued even after his wife and son sold the Bridge House Hotel they ran in Acocks Green, Birmingham, for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Hopwood appeared at Coventry Crown Court on Friday where he pleaded guilty to receiving £27,710 in Pension Credit that he wasn't entitled to between October 2003 and May 2012. He also admitted evasion of liability by . deception between October 2005 and May 2012 when he falsely . claimed £15,538 council tax benefit. The pensioner received a 10 month jail . sentence, suspended for 18 months, after a judge branded his behaviour . 'thoroughly dishonest'. The ex-soldier was told he had narrowly . avoided being sent to prison because of his early guilty plea, genuine . remorse, and repayment of the £43,248 benefits. Hopwood was also placed on a curfew for six months, from between 9pm and 8am, and ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. The court heard that his wife, Barbara, and son, Paul, were partners in the Bridge House Hotel. Hopwood and his wife lived on the premises but he did not have a share in the business, although he carried out odd jobs. Hopwood began claiming Pension Credit for himself and his wife after stating on official forms that he had no additional income and savings of £6,000. The former soldier also went on to claim council tax benefit. Yet the Department of Works and Pension eventually became aware he was receiving £500 per week from the business account of Bridge House Hotel. In total, investigators found £40,000 was transferred to his account in 80 weekly payments between August 2003 and February 2005. The scam continued even after the hotel was sold in 2005, when £203,071 was paid into the account of Hopwood's wife and son. Yet . the ex-paratrooper failed to declare the capital and he and his wife . later bought a property in Darlow Drive, Stratford-upon-Avon, and were . left with no mortgage. Spared jail: Hopwood was given a 10 month prison sentence suspended for 18 months at Coventry Crown Court . Investigators eventually caught up with the benefit cheat who, under questioning, admitted his wife was running the hotel business but he initially denied receiving £500 per week. Hopwood later confirmed he had been pocketing the weekly cash. He also claimed he had little understanding of the benefit system - but admitted his actions could be seen as being 'a little shady'. Andrew Evans, defending, said his client was of previous good character and could not be more sorry. Hopwood, who suffered a stroke in 2010, had since repaid 'every single penny', he added. 'Anyone who knows Dennis Hopwood would find it very difficult to understand what he's done,' said Mr Evans. He said he was a former paratrooper and was wearing his tie in court to give him courage. The court heard neither his wife nor his son had any idea about his benefit fraud. The lawyer said his client had failed to declare his wider financial interests, which included that he had effectively an equitable interest in the hotel. Mr Evans added the crime was not 'premeditated' and his client was not a greedy man. But Recorder Spencer Bernard told Hopwood he had committed, a 'thoroughly dishonest and persistent scheme of offending, telling Hopwood: 'You knew exactly what was going on.'","Former paratrooper Dennis Hopwood, 75, was receiving £500 a week from his wife's hotel business before she sold it .

Grant Bovey was released from bankruptcy in 2011 following the collapse of his property business with debts of £50m . Anthea Turner's estranged husband is having money problems for the second time in two years after his media business lost £6million. Now Grant Bovey and the ex-Blue Peter presenter, who are going through a divorce following revelations of Bovey's cheating, are looking to sell their Surrey mansion and French ski chalet to cover the losses. The couple are thought to have received a £5million offer for the Surrey property earlier this month which, if completed, would give them a profit of £700,000. The couple also spent the night together in the chalet trying to finalise paperwork for its sale. Friends say Bovey, 51, is going to use the cash to restart his faltering business empire and that Anthea, 53, is supporting him, even after Bovey was caught cheating with 25-year-old socialite Zoe de Mallet Morgan. Zoe and Bovey split up in August after a party holiday to Ibiza underlined the age gap and left the father-of-four struggling to keep up. Despite being discharged from bankruptcy . in 2011 ago when his property business fell apart leaving £50million in . debts, Bovey believes a string of innovative new business ideas can turn . his fortunes around. A source close to the couple has told the Sunday Mirror that Bovey is now replying heavily on Anthea while he tries to get his business affairs in order. He is thought to be finalising a TV game show called Revolution which will allow viewers to take part using their smartphones. Sympathy: despite their divorce Anthea is said to be sympathetic to Bovey's plight . Records published by Companies House show that Yummi Media, founded by Anthea in 2010 because Bovey was still disqualified, lost £4.8million last year and another £1.3million in 2011. It also has debts of £2.3million. A source close to Bovey told the Sunday Mirror: 'The figures look bad, but that's because so much money has gone into getting the technology right. The rewards are potentially massive.' At the start of this month Anthea . accepted an offer of £5 million for her Surrey mansion, £700,000 more . than what she paid when she bought the six-bedroom estate in April 2011. This is the Surrey mansion that Anthea has reportedly sold for £5million after buying it for £4.3million . Set in five acres of land and complete with a swimming pool, the couple are splitting the proceeds evenly . Bovey hopes the money from the sale of this property and a French ski chalet will restart his ailing businesses . Set in almost two acres of land in a private road in Esher, Surrey with an indoor swimming pool, no doubt the sale will help her move on from her divorce. At the time a family friend said: 'At the moment she is talking of a fair split with Grant, but some of her confidantes say she should be tougher with him. 'They argue that she kept them both when Grant’s property empire imploded and her money went into the houses. 'But Anthea is nothing but fair and says they should share the proceeds.

Appalled: British writer Ann Cleeves says hit Scandinavian shows like The Killing are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women . A leading British crime writer says Scandinavian authors are too graphic in their depiction of violence against women, in a stinging criticism of 'gratuitous' hit shows like The Bridge and The Killing. Ann Cleeves, creator of the Vera Stanhope and Shetland novels, has expressed concern that prominent Nordic writers are trying to outdo each other when it comes to portraying gruesome crimes against females. She believes there is a trend that has entered ever more morbid and misogynistic territory following the worldwide success of Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy. From the opening episode of the TV . drama The Bridge, when the mutilated body of a female Swedish politician . is discovered, to the first season of The Killing, which starts with a . girl running for her life through a wood, and the serial killer . targeting women in Jo Nesbø's The Leopard, violence against females is . prevalent in Scandinavian noir. Cleeves, . speaking to the Observer from an event in Oxford where she was . discussing her latest Shetland novel, Dead Water, said that, although . there had always been violence in crime fiction, it was now 'much more . embedded'. She said: 'I . especially don't like the graphic violence against women and children, . often depicted in novels such as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and . others. I'm not sure if it's being done just to entertain, or whether it . really is necessary for the characters involved.' In . The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a character is anally raped. A teenage . Larsson witnessed three of his friends gang-raping a young girl, which . he said inspired the theme of sexual violence against women in his work. Larsson's original title for the first part of his Millennium trilogy . translates as 'Men Who Hate Women'. Gruesome: The Bridge, starring Diane Kruger and Ted Levine, has been a massive TV success but Cleeves says the level of violence is 'gratuitous' Graphic: Another popular show to come in for criticism from Cleeves is The Killing, starring Amy Seimetz and Bex Taylor-Klaus, pictured . Violent films like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo are in contrast to the more gentle works of Cleeves . Cleeves . said she had gone off Norwegian author Nesbø's work too. 'I preferred . his earlier books, which were much less violent. A lot of it is . subjective, of course. My work is less violent because we tend to write . what we want to read … and I'm not that interested in gruesome books. Any violence, to fit in well with a crime novel, has to have . compassion.' Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy has been a worldwide smash hit . Various . academic studies have investigated the much debated issue of violence . against women in the genre, questioning whether it is necessary, or . simply for entertainment value. US crime writer Sara Paretsky has argued this form of violence reflects sexism in society. Cleeves . has had huge success with her Vera Stanhope and Shetland novels. ITV . recently finished screening the third series of Vera, with Brenda . Blethyn in the title role, and has commissioned a fourth, now being . filmed in the north-east and due to be broadcast next year.

Romanian beggars who were given taxpayer-funded tickets home in July have already returned to the streets of London. A group of 20 homeless Roma were put on flights and coaches back to Romania by the UK Border Agency after their camp in Park Lane was cleared by police. But, Westminster City Council has said six of the group have travelled back and are sleeping rough on the streets again. Raid: Police and UK Border Agency staff wake up beggars on Park Lane in London and clear their camp in July . Back again: Some of the gypsies who were removed during the raid in July returned to the same spot a week later . The council, which spends more than £500,000 a year tackling the problem, said their return was a 'farce' and called on the government to tighten border controls. One Conservative MP said Britain was . effectively funding short holidays for beggars in Romania, while . powerless to stop them coming back. Under European Union law, Romanians have a right to be in this country for 90 days. After that, they have to . be working, studying or self-sufficient to be able to stay. Sleeping rough and begging are . grounds for removal. By . offering to pay for travel home the Government is avoiding a potentially . expensive legal battle, which can only begin once the 90-day limit has . been passed. Councillor Nickie Aiken said Home Secretary Theresa May needed to get a grip on the situation and added: 'We need to get stricter at the border, particularly if these people have agreed to go home in the first place at taxpayers' expense. Homeless; Around 20 Romanians were given tax-payer funded tickets home, but six have returned just two months later . Packing up: A Romanian travellers with a policeman at Park Lane after their camp was raided in July . 'The return of the Roma back in Park Lane just weeks after going home at the UK's taxpayers' expense renders the efforts to tackle and manage this problem an utter farce. 'It is evidence that the taxpayer is funding aggressive beggars to return home for a short holiday before they promptly reappear on the streets of Westminster.' Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: 'The only way we can deal with this is to end our EU membership on the current terms. 'These people have been paid to go home to Romania for a short summer holiday.' Other Roma sent home by coach had their tickets paid for by Thames Reach, a homelessness charity funded by London's local authorities and other public bodies. Upmarket: The beggars set up camp on Park Lane, one of London's wealthiest areas . A spokesperson for the charity said: 'There are particular issues in relation to Romanian rough sleepers and those engaged in street activity which may mean some choose to return.' After January 1, restrictions in place in Britain on Romanians and Bulgarians will be removed. The change does not affect the status of the Romanian beggars in London, but could cause an influx of people from the two countries. The Home Office said it was 'focusing on cutting out the abuse of free movement' and has demanded the European Commission tighten EU laws. A spokesman said: 'If someone with no permission to be in the UK refuses to return home voluntarily, we will take action to remove them. 'This includes Europeans who have been in the country for longer than three months and are not working, studying or self-sufficient. 'Border staff have the power to refuse entry to EU nationals on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health.'

He designed his own bright outfit with pearl buttons he found during his job as a street sweeper. He became a local attraction and used his popularity to collect money for his old orphanage. His success meant other charities called on him to help raise funds for them, and so he asked the market traders to help him - and the Pearly Kings and Queens were born.

'International man of mystery' Peter Foster is on the run from the law after a judge found him guilty of another weight-loss scam . Conman Peter Foster – the central figure in the 2002 ‘Cheriegate’ scandal – was hiding from the law last night after a judge found him guilty of yet another weight-loss scam. The 52-year-old Australian, ex-boyfriend of Cherie Blair’s former fitness guru Carole Caplin, failed to turn up for a court hearing in Brisbane yesterday amid claims that he was planning to flee on a luxury yacht to the Cook Islands in the Pacific. But last night the 72ft motor yacht Next Adventure was still moored on the Queensland Gold Coast and the whereabouts of the self-professed ‘international man of mystery’ remained unknown. The manhunt that has now started is yet another dramatic episode in the life and times of Foster, who wormed his way into the lives of then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie 13 years ago by first forming a relationship with Miss Caplin. Through her he became Mrs Blair’s ‘financial adviser’ and managed to help her purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. When she learned of his notoriety as a conman in the slimming industry she at first denied he was involved in helping her – until the Daily Mail provided emails from her to him in which she described him as ‘a star’ and said ‘we are on the same wavelength, Peter’. Yesterday, with a warrant out for Foster’s arrest, calls to his mobile went unanswered. Earlier in the day, Justice John Logan delivered a long-awaited judgment, finding Foster guilty of contempt by becoming secretly involved in Sensaslim, a weight-loss nasal spray which scientists said was ineffective and advertisements claiming it worked were based on false evidence. He had previously been ordered not to become involved in the weight loss industry. Foster . was also found to have shown contempt of court yesterday by failing to . show up for the judgment in the Queensland Federal Court. The . judge, acknowledging that Foster’s ageing mother Louise was recovering . from a stroke, gave him until 5pm to hand himself in to a police . station, which he failed to do. Foster wormed his way into Cherie Blair's life after striking up a relationship with her fitness guru, Carole Caplin (pictured) Cherie Blair broke down in tears in 2002 when admitting the conman's involvement in the purchase of two flats . Anticipating a guilty finding, Foster sent a letter to the court yesterday saying his mother was ill and he was in ‘understandable discomfort’ about the outcome of the hearing. He denied he was planning to flee, writing: ‘I would never abandon my mother, especially in her frail state of health.’ Foster made – and lost – millions of pounds with his slimming products by selling franchises. But the slimming industry has also been his downfall and cons associated with it have resulted in him being locked up in Britain, the US and Australia. Now Justice Logan has warned that he faces more jail time in Australia for the two acts of contempt.","Australian conman failed to turn up for a court appearance in Brisbane .

Developing: Mr Bradley was four years into a five-year development project that included a Monkey Temple . Mr Bradley, a former managing director of Legoland, was brought in by Viscount Weymouth, the son of Longleat estate owner Lord Bath, in 2009. Tasked with bringing the park into the 21st century, Mr Bradley embarked on an ambitious five-year investment and development plan. It involved several new visitor attractions including a £2million 'Jungle Kingdom', a monkey temple, and two luxury leisure complexes - the Bishopstrow Hotel and Spa in Wiltshire and Homewood Park Hotela nd Spa in Bath. A Longleat spokesman said: 'David Bradley has been temporarily suspended from Longleat and we are currently carrying out a review. The park has been awash with attention since it launched as the first safari park outside Africa in 1966 . From the start, it has housed wild animals native to Africa such as lions, giraffes, gorillas and cheetahs . 'We are unable to comment further on any claims as it would be unfair to those involved.'

Court appearance: Soldier Lee Rigby's family members arrive at the Old Bailey today to hear Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale plead not guilty to his murder . The pair also denied separate counts of attempting to murder police officers who arrived at the scene in Woolwich. The pair sat in separate rooms for the hearing, with Mrs Rigby sitting in the court’s public gallery. Wearing red t-shirts and black jogging bottoms, Adebolajo and Adebowale asked to be addressed by their adopted Islamic names of Al Mujaahid Abu Hamza and Ismail Ibn Abdullah respectively. After hearing submissions from the two barristers representing the defendants, the court allowed them to be called by their Muslim names  as well. Attacked: Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed as he walked in Woolwich, on May 22 . Adebowale, of Greenwich, and Adebolajo, from Romford, Essex, were remanded into custody and will stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 18.

Inmate: Angelica Belen, 25, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the deaths of her three children killed in a fire after being left home alone . A 25-year-old Wisconsin mother was sentenced today to 18 years in prison for the tragic deaths of her three young children, who perished in a house fire after being left without supervision. Last spring, an inferno sparked by faulty wiring in the kitchen of Angelica Belen’s home in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis killed her 5-year-old daughter, Nayeli Colon, and 4-year-old twin sons, Adrian and Alexis Colon. Their bodies were found huddled under a dresser.. Before sentencing Miss Belen to 18 years in prison and 18 years of extended supervision, Judge Jeffrey Wagner said he sympathized with the defendant, who had been struggling to raise four children, three of them with special needs. But he also said she had failed in her duty to take care of them. Her fourth child was visiting his father at the time of the fire. ‘I understand your terrible, terrible upbringing,’ Wagner said, referring to Belen’s childhood spent in an abusive home. ‘I know you were victimized yourself growing up, and I understand that and I take that into consideration. But there shouldn’t be this cycle.’ Her long dark curly hair shrouding her face, a tearful Belen apologized profusely for leaving the children alone and the hurt that she caused her family. At one point, she spoke directly to her dead children. Scroll down for video . Angels: Three of Belen's four children, 5-year-old daughter, Nayeli Colon (center), and 4-year-old twin sons, Adrian and Alexis, died from burns and smoke inhalation during the April house fire . ‘I’m sorry that you’ll never grow up. I am sorry that I will never see you grow up, graduate high school and have children of your own,’ said Belen, who pleaded guilty in July to three counts of felony child neglect. She was 3 in 1992 when her 17-month-old sister was found beaten and starved in her crib. Belen’s mother was sentenced to eight years in prison for child neglect, and her boyfriend was convicted of beating the child. The surviving siblings were placed in foster homes, where court records show Belen was abused.Prosecutor Mark Williams, who recalled attending Belen’s mother’s sentencing, said that while her upbringing was ‘horrific,’ it was no excuse. ‘She certainly started out behind the eight ball in life, but her sisters did well and this defendant had the chance to do well,’ Williams said. On April 11, Belen’s baby sitter fell through, so she placed her three young children in a second-floor bedroom and went to the new job she needed to support her family. Tough upbringing: Before sentencing Belen to prison, the presiding judge said he sympathized with the mother, who had been the victim of neglect and abuse as a child . Emotional: Belen tearfully apologized for leaving the children alone and the hurt that she caused her family . Too little, too late: Miss Belen apologized directly to her dead children, saying she was sorry they would not grow up and have kids of their own . The woman later said she decided to lock the kids because she didn't want them wrecking the house or getting outside where neighbors would see they were unattended. West Allis firefighters would eventually discover the bodies of three of Belen's four children huddled under a dresser, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. Autopsies determined the toddlers died of smoke inhalation and burns. During Belen's sentencing Friday, West Allis police detective Nicholas Pye said that sight of the three small bodies was the worst thing he has ever laid eyes on in 22 years of service, according to the station Fox6Now. The children’s horrific deaths divided Belen’s family, with one sister asking Wagner to sentence her to life in prison while other relatives pleaded for understanding. Belen faced a maximum 15 years in prison and 10 years of extended supervision for each death. ‘It is beyond my comprehension how a mother could do this to her children, her own flesh and blood,’ said Belen’s sister, Leah Sillix, who helped identify the children’s bodies and still has nightmares. Another sister, Maria Sosa, and . Belen’s aunt, Sharon Fredericks, said Belen had done the best she could . and needed more help than she received. ‘Her intention was to protect the children, your honor, it wasn’t to hurt them,’ Fredericks said. ‘She would never hurt them.’ Inferno: The deadly fire was caused by faulty wiring in the kitchen of Belen's West Allis, Wisconsin, home . Horrifying sight: The bodies of the three toddlers were found huddled together under a dresser . Williams reviewed multiple child welfare reports that described the children living in filthy conditions with dirty diapers, garbage and feces littering the home. Other reports described exposed wires, and once, the children eating out of a garbage can.But the prosecutor and others said child welfare workers shared responsibility for the children’s deaths. Belen received multiple warnings from the Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare for repeatedly leaving her children alone and was eventually charged with child neglect. Nonetheless, the children were never removed from her care. A Wisconsin Department of Children and Families investigation later determined the Bureau of Milwaukee Child Welfare hadn’t handled her case properly and overhauled the bureau’s in-home services program. Changes to the child welfare system in the wake of the case include more staff training, increased home visits and longer program stints for families.","Angelica Belen, 25, locked her 5-year-old daughter and 4-year-old twins in bedroom before leaving for work April 11 .

Proud owner Vanessa Bamkin, from Carlisle, Cumbria, adopted Glory after learning of her plight on an animal charity website. Brave: Glory the dog is recovering after having three prosthetic legs fitted after suffering horrendous abuse in Romania . The pet had been living as a stray in the town of Bacau, which sits 200 miles west of the Black Sea. A local factory worker took pity on her and cared for her. But when he went away for a week, in April, the little dog was attacked by a gang of thugs. The damage to her limbs was so extensive that both her front legs and one of her back paws had to be amputated.

Workers at the animal charity who saved Glory were so moved by her courage that they told her story on their website. And 2,000 miles away, in Carlisle, Cumbria, Vanessa and Roger vowed to help. The big-hearted couple paid for her to be vaccinated then travelled to Romania to collect her. They did some fundraising on the internet and were astonished when £4,000 poured in - enabling them to buy Glory's new legs from Gloucester firm Orthopets. Vanessa said: 'She's such a brave little dog. The first time she put them on she was very wobbly, but she did really well and walked a bit. 'She's wearing her new legs three times a day for a few minutes at a time. She seems very happy with them."" 'But we can't wait to give Glory a new lease of life. It will all be worth it.'

Virgin Atlantic has had to review its flight crew rosters after a pilot told official watchdogs that he and his co-pilot were ‘suffering symptoms of severe fatigue’. However the Civil Aviation Authority had to apologise yesterday for initially giving an ‘incomplete’ account of the incident. The CAA have now expressed ‘regret’ for suggesting that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep at the same time. Virgin Atlantic admitted on Thursday that it was the carrier at the centre of the fatigue row . The captain and first officer were understood to have put the 325-seat plane on autopilot after reaching a cruising altitude of 30,000ft during a flight in August. They then took it in turns to have 20-minute bouts of rest as the flight returned to Manchester from Orlando, Florida. The CAA have expressed 'regret' for suggesting that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep at the same time . The captain and the co-pilot had only had five hours’ sleep in the previous 36 hours, they revealed in a safety report lodged with the CAA, Britain’s aviation regulator. The CAA said yesterday: ‘The airline is now taking steps to adjust its rostering arrangements for flight crew.’ Virgin Atlantic admitted on Thursday that it was the carrier at the centre of the fatigue row. But it denied categorically that both the pilot and co-pilot had been asleep ‘simultaneously’ on the packed long-haul flight. In an embarrassing climbdown, the CAA has now issued a ‘clarification’ saying that while ‘both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately, they did not fall asleep at the same time’. Virgin Atlantic said the two pilots concerned had flown in to New York and had been expecting a longer break. They were ‘tired but able to fly’ and well within legal limits, according to a Virgin spokesman, who added: ‘We’re pleased the CAA has apologised and rectified its error.’",CAA 'regrets' suggesting both pilot and co-pilot slept at the same time .

A shoplifter who lied about his daughter being killed in a car smash and said he needed bail to attend the funeral has been jailed for perverting the course of justice. Andrew Gwyndaf Jones made up the horrendous tale when he appeared before magistrates in July this year facing four charges of theft. The 44-year-old, who had more than 120 previous offences, was set to be remanded in custody after his hearing was adjourned for a week. But he pleaded with the District Judge who was presiding over the case, saying his daughter had been killed in an accident and that he would miss her funeral if he was not granted bail. Judge Andrew Shaw agreed to turn Jones loose so that he could be at the service, but his lies were exposed after the girl's mother read a report of proceedings in the local press. After he had been bailed, friends and relatives of the young girl even began contacting her mother with messages of condolence. The furious mother contacted police, telling them that her daughter was alive and well and that Jones had made up the story to secure bail. When approached by officers, the thief said his bail application was in relation to another daughter and then a step-daughter. All his claims proved to be lies. Having been hauled back before the judge, Jones, of no fixed abode, was jailed for six months for the four shoplifting charges. He was then charged with perverting the course of justice in relation to the bogus bail submission. Jailed: Jones was sentenced at Mold Crown Court, above, after the mother of his child told police he had lied about the accident . After pleading guilty at that hearing at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: 'It is difficult to imagine how anyone could stoop so low.'

Drugs mule Michaella McCollum is not a drug dealer and her party girl public image is not a true reflection of her character, her former lover has claimed. Part-time DJ Brad Houston enjoyed a five-day fling with the Northern Ireland woman in Ibiza shortly before she was arrested trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of Peru. 'She's a 20-year-old girl, like anyone's normal daughter. She's not a drug dealer,' he said. The web developer from Salisbury also . said he believed McCollum was innocent because she had no cover story to . account for her week-long disappearance, which sparked a global . internet appeal. 'If she was going to do a big . £1.5million drug deal or be a mule, the last thing she would do would . (be to) get an international search for a missing person while she was . doing that,' he said. 'She would have set her Facebook . status or contacted her parents. She would have had a cover story. But, . out of nowhere she just disappeared.' McCollum, 20, from Dungannon, Co . Tyrone, and co-accused Melissa Reid, 20, from Glasgow, last week pleaded . guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge. They had hoped the behind-closed-doors . admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence but prosecutors . have demanded more information before accepting their admissions of . guilt. Speaking on a prime-time chat show . aired by Irish national broadcaster RTE, Mr Houston said he never saw . McCollum take drugs in Ibiza and he did not believe she was involved . with criminal gangs. 'If I thought she was involved with . dangerous people I do not think I would have spent any time with her,' he said. 'I have a career and I have a son as well so I wouldn't want . anything that could get me in trouble.' He also dismissed claims McCollum may . have been in financial difficulty because she had saved enough money to . pay for accommodation for the whole season. 'She really did pride herself on being a strong Irish independent woman,' he added. 'She's not a dealer': Yet McCollum, left, 20, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Melissa Reid, right, also 20, from Glasgow, last week pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge . Although their affair was brief, Mr Houston claimed to have a made a 'real connection' with the former nightclub hostess. Photographs of the loved up pair drinking champagne on a boat were posted on his Facebook page. He said: 'I was there for a week and we spent five days together and I really did fob off my mates to spend time with her. 'We got on the sauce and drunk quite a lot; went to a few clubs and done some really good stuff together. We had some really deep conversations so we really did connect well out there.' McCollum and Reid initially claimed . they were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to board a flight from . Lima to Spain with 24lbs of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their . luggage when they were arrested. They . have been detained by the authorities in Peru since last month and were . transferred to the Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima after their recent . court appearance. Prison hell: Mr Houston said that during his five-day fling with McCollum in Ibiza they 'got on the sauce and drunk quite a bit' he never saw her take drugs and he did not believe she was involved with criminal gangs . Both women had been working on the Spanish party island of Ibiza this summer although Mr Houston said he never heard his former lover speak about a friend called Melissa. 'The name Melissa never came up,' he told the Saturday Night Show. Mr Houston said he had not previously spoken out because he was in shock but now felt compelled to try and change the public perception of his ex. 'I can't really change what's happening with the court case over in Peru but, perhaps I can change the public's view on Michaella because there has not been a lot of support,' he said.","DJ Brad Houston had five-day fling with McCollum while on holiday in Ibiza .

Soldiers will be offered interest-free loans of up to £25,000 to help them get a foot on the property ladder. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will today unveil the £200million scheme to increase home ownership in the military. While three out of four officers in the armed forces own their own homes, just 36 per cent of other ranks do. In the Army, the number of non-officers who own homes is just 27 per cent. From next April for a three-year initial period, military personnel will be able to borrow the equivalent of half their salary interest free, up to a maximum of £25,000. Repayments will be spread over ten years to ensure they are affordable. Mr Hammond said: ‘Service personnel can struggle to enter the housing market as they move around throughout their career. By giving our troops this extra help they will be more able to set down roots and get on to the property ladder.’ Trouble buying a house is one of the main reasons given for leaving the armed forces. Personnel are often refused loans because of low pay, frequent moves and deployments across the globe. Computer credit checks often automatically rule them out as too risky. A report by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft for the Ministry of Defence found more than a quarter of military personnel had been refused a mortgage, loan or credit card as a result of their career. Barclays bank said on Thursday it will manually review any mortgage application from a serving member of the armed forces rather than leaving it to a computer.

Mark Carney yesterday declared that Britain is ‘leading the pack of the major advanced economies’ – only months after warning it was in ‘crisis’. The governor of the Bank of England confirmed the economy ‘strengthened’ this summer as it finally bounced back from the financial  crisis and recession. In an interview yesterday he said: ‘My personal view is, given the recovery has strengthened and broadened, I don’t see the case for quantitative easing and I have not supported it.’ His words are a crumb of comfort for savers who have been hammered by QE. They have lost out since interest rates were slashed to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 and the Bank started printing money to stop recession turning into depression. Critics say more than one million pensioners have been consigned to a life of poverty because of the Bank’s strategy. The policy has driven down annuity rates – meaning pensioners get a permanently smaller annual income on the nest-eggs they have saved. Campaigners welcomed Mr Carney’s comments but said there is still no sign of interest rates rising or QE being reversed. Simon Rose, at campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‘Savers may give one cheer to see the back of QE. But there’s no indication how the £375billion of gilts purchases by the Bank of England, which have done so much to damage pension funds, might ever be unwound. Savers are still under immense pressure with little prospect of relief in sight.’ The Bank has pledged not to raise rates until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or lower – something it does not expect until late 2016. In the same interview Mr Carney added: ‘The advanced economies as a whole are doing a bit better. That’s going to help the UK as a whole. These are [Britain’s] more traditional export markets so that matters. ‘Within the UK, we are probably leading the pack of the major advanced economies as we speak right now. But of course we had the deepest recession, so we are coming back from that.’ Not a solution: Governor Mark Carney has said he doesn't agree with simply 'printing more money' In April, he branded Britain a ‘crisis economy’ alongside the eurozone and Japan. Only last month he was lamenting ‘the weakest recovery on record’. The change of tune will delight George Osborne ahead of the Tory party conference. Official figures yesterday showed productivity in the UK workforce has risen for the first time in two years – boosting recovery hopes. Output per-hour-worked increased by 0.5 per cent between April and June – the first rise since the second quarter of 2011, the Office for National Statistics reported. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: ‘The UK recovery is showing signs of becoming sustainable as improved optimism feeds through to the hard data and the return of growth kick-starts productivity. ‘This recovery can be sustained, but probably not at the current heady pace and there will be bumps in the road.’ He said more QE, on top of the £375billion already pumped into the economy, was still an option, if the recovery falters. The pound soared against the dollar amid growing confidence among international investors in the economy.","Mark Carney confirms that the economy has 'strengthened .

Owners of overweight pets are ‘killing their pets with kindness’ by overfeeding them, according to a leading vet. Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, was . responding to an academic report that claimed feeding pets smaller . amounts could make them anxious and unhappy. American vet Dr Franklin McMillan argues in the US Journal of Veterinary . Behavior that animals have ‘emotional’ eating habits linked to comfort . and happiness, and that overeating is a result of turmoil or distress. But Mr Hargreaves, who runs a practice in Colne, Lancashire, said that was a ‘dangerous version of the truth’. Warning: Robin Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, said it is not cruel to limit food intake . Mr Hargreaves, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the new study encourages pet owners to feel bad about reducing their animal’s portion sizes. He said: ‘Too many people are killing their pets with kindness by overfeeding them. ‘And pet owners will do anything but decrease their animal’s food intake because they think it would be cruel. ‘The advice that anxiety can be caused by feeding animals less may be true in part in some cases. 'But as a vet who encounters overweight animals every day, a report that doesn’t openly discourage overfeeding is worrying.’ The research by Dr Franklin McMillan, a vet and former clinical professor of medicine at the Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine, in California, argues that overeating is a result of emotional turmoil or distress in an animal. The study in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior said that animals have ‘emotional’ eating habits that are linked to their feelings of comfort and happiness. Dr McMillan based his argument on the eating habits of pets, laboratory animals and humans. A growing crisis: Pet slimming shows are now popping up all over the country as animals struggle with obesity . More than a third of dogs (2.9million) are overweight or obese while 25 per cent of cats (3 million) suffer the same problem, according to figures from the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals, PDSA. Mr Hargreaves, who runs a practise in practice in Colne, Lancashire, said focusing on the pop psychology behind why pets are eating more and getting fatter will not solve the health problems that overweight animals suffer. ‘Feeding too much and exercising too little is the reason for pets becoming obese and unhealthy in the majority of cases. Common: Many pet owners in the UK and America believe their pets need more food if they are feeling anxious . ‘I find that pet owners are looking for any reason not to feed their animals less because they think it’s unfair or cruel on the creature. ‘I don’t want the message that “Cutting down your pets’ food makes them miserable and you a bad owner” to be taken too literally.’ Overweight pets have a lower life expectancy than healthy pets and often develop heart problems and arthritis. But despite the evidence around weight-related health problems, 90 per cent of dog owners admit to feeding their pets treats such as cakes, biscuits and takeaways.","Robin Hargreaves, president of British Vet Association, blasts new report .

Osteopath Dr Stephen Ward could have his 1963 conviction for living off immoral earnings quashed . Stephen Ward, the high-society fixer at the centre of the Profumo sex scandal, could have his conviction for living off immoral earnings quashed. One of Britain’s leading barristers is to conduct a review into Ward’s 1963 conviction that was linked to Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies. Geoffrey Robertson QC, a well-known human rights campaigner regarded as one of the country’s finest legal minds, is to conduct a forensic analysis of both the case against Ward and the conduct of the trial. Sources close to the inquiry say that, dependent on the review’s results, pressure could be brought on the judiciary to overturn Ward’s conviction posthumously. The disclosure comes on the eve of the launch of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical – called Stephen Ward – about Ward’s life. A decision to prosecute Ward, who took a fatal overdose the night before his trial ended, remains highly controversial. He was a successful and well-connected osteopath and portrait artist who became mired in Britain’s most notorious sex scandal of the 20th Century. It was sparked by the revelation that War Minister John Profumo was having an affair with showgirl Christine Keeler. She was also said to be sleeping with a Russian naval attache. Showgirl Christine Keeler, pictured on her way the Old Bailey in 1963, was having an affair with John Profumo the Secretary of State for War . The disclosures ruined Profumo’s . political career amid questions about national security – and the . consequences for Ward were even worse. The osteopath had introduced Profumo and Keeler at a now infamous party at Lord Astor’s mansion in 1961. A penchant for taking young women such as Keeler and her friend Rice- Davies under his wing, and introducing them to powerful men, made him the perfect scapegoat. He was arrested in June 1963 and charged . with living off their immoral earnings, as well as with a separate . charge of procuring prostitutes. The scapegoating of Stephen Ward is to be the topic of a new musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber . When the trial began, it quickly became clear that there were flaws in the prosecution’s case. Ronna Ricardo, a prostitute called to testify against Ward, withdrew much of her evidence and told the court the police had bullied her into taking part. Ward’s defence team also found serious problems with the evidence brought by a second prostitute, Vickie Barrett. But Ward became convinced he was going to be found guilty and overdosed on sleeping pills. In a suicide note he wrote: ‘I’m sorry to disappoint the vultures. I feel the day is lost. The ritual sacrifice is demanded and I cannot face it.’ Ward was still in a coma on July 31 when he was found guilty of living off immoral earnings but cleared of procuring prostitutes. He died three days later. In an account of the trial published the following year, campaigning journalist Ludovic Kennedy argued there was more evidence to suggest Keeler had been supported by Ward rather than the other way around. The scapegoating of  Ward is the subject of  the new Lloyd Webber musical, which has been  co-written by Oscar-winning lyricists  Christopher Hampton and Don Black. Hampton said last night he would welcome the challenge to a conviction he called ‘a complete travesty’.

The craze for the giant kitchen - or 'multifunctional living space' - complete with widescreen TV, DVD box sets and sofa, is becoming ever more popular, according to a report in The Times. Super-size: Families are now gathering in extra large kitchens known as 'multifunctional living spaces' Kitchens are now being extended outwards and even downwards to create what was once called a kitchen-dinning room. Often these extra large kitchens, also known as 'family rooms' are accompanied with sliding glass doors that lead to an outside area, such as a patio. Copper pans either hang from overhead racks or line brightly coloured walls coated with the highest quality paint. The all-important island remains central to the overall effect. In some London homes, there are now two islands, one for the hob and another for the sink. Trend: Often sliding glass doors will lead from the super-size kitchen to outside areas such as patios .

The boss of British Gas has seen his pay soar by nearly 40 per cent in five years – while customers’ bills rose at almost exactly the same rate. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, which owns the gas firm, was paid £1.73million in 2008. However last year his salary had shot up to £2.35million – an increase of 36 per cent. In 2008 the average annual British Gas bill was £625 but last year it had rocketed to £865 – a rise of 38 per cent. And Eton-educated Mr Laidlaw ended up raking in more than his £2.35million basic salary last year. His full pay package, which included bonuses for reaching long-term targets, totalled £4.97million. Fuel campaigners have attacked the salary increases at Centrica as they come at a time when fuel bills are making up a record share of household spending. Fuel Poverty Action spokesman Clare Welton said: ‘It is outrageous that Centrica bosses have accepted huge pay rises at a time when they are squeezing more and more money out of hard-up households. ‘With one in four households thought to be making the impossible choice between heating and eating, Centrica’s focus should be on helping their customers, not increasing their profits.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to freeze fuel bills if he wins power in the 2015 general election. Last night Labour MP John Robertson, a member of the Commons energy committee, said: ‘This is totally unacceptable. ‘I have said this over and over but it is time these people are brought into the real world.’ He added: ‘In this time of austerity, they need to do their bit the same as everybody else.’ Mr Laidlaw’s earnings have so far . helped him purchase three luxury homes – a Chelsea town house, a mansion . in the Oxfordshire countryside as well as a holiday flat on the Isle of . Wight. And despite . millions of British Gas customers enduring pay freezes since the start . of the banking crisis, other executives have also seen their pay soar. Freeze: News of Laidlaw's increased pay comes after Ed Miliband, pictured at the Labour Party conference in Brighton last week, pledged to freeze energy prices if he is prime minister .

Discount supermarket Aldi is taking on upmarket rival Waitrose by stocking Lobster for the first time. Over the past year Aldi has become the darling of the recession-hit middle classes attracting an extra one million, mainly affluent, shoppers who have helped to double profits, latest accounts released today show. Such rapid growth has forced the privately owned German supermarket to triple staff in every store and increase the number of checkouts. Upmarket: The supermarket has courted a recession-hit middle class in recent months . Its growing army of middle class shoppers are behind soaring sales which have jumped 40 per cent to £3.8billion after it won a host of awards including Grocer Of The Year and Supermarket Of The Year. Profits grew to £157.9million from £70.5million. Now bosses say the shift upmarket means it is having to upgrade its selection of mainly own brand produce for its new well-heeled clientele. Christmas will see entire legs of 6.5kg Serrano ham selling for £49.99, a fraction of the £407 price tag at some exclusive outlets. Lobster Tails weighing 240g will sell for £9.99 while a fresh three-bird roast, featuring duck, turkey breast and wild pheasant with pork & orange stuffing is also part of the festive selection for the first time. Lobster tails weighing 240g will sell for £9.99 when they hit stores later this year alongside £49.99 Serrano ham . The slogan 'spend a little, live a lot' is being reaped for all it is worth with cut-price versions of luxurious food . Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said Aldi is appealing to more people despite some customers preferring to keep it a secret: ‘We are continuing to open stores right across the country, attracting more people and a broader demographic to Aldi. ‘We have opened in affluent locations like Knutsford and Winchester and have been able to evolve in a direction that is more attractive to a wider group of people.’ Aldi has also opened new stores in upmarket Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon, Beverly, Nantwich, Didsbury and Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Shoppers have taken to its own brands which cost a fraction of the price of the popular household names but still win awards for quality. Its own-brand Champagne, Gin and Prosecco have all won awards, while many of its wines have been hailed by critics. Success: Own-brand versions of steak, champagne, olive oil, coffee and gin have been a hit with food critics . The previously simple three-bird roast, pictured, will be upgraded to include wild pheasant, similar to Waitrose . The supermarket has made a huge effort to attract the middle classes, introducing a range of superior products at budget prices including olive oils, spirits, wine, coffee, and Aberdeen Angus steaks. Lobster and ham are new additions to its list of luxury. But some shoppers will still feel the need to visit some of the more mainstream grocers to stock up on the brands they know and love. When Aldi opened its first store in Knutsford in June, 300 well-heeled locals queued from 3am having parked Aston Martins, Jaguars and Range Rovers in the car park. It along with rival Lidl, and upmarket grocer Waitrose have polarised the grocery market all growing faster that the more mainstream grocers as shoppers flock to either low cost or premium supermarkets. On Wednesday Tesco is due to show how its £1billion turnaround plan is progressing when it posts its half year figures. Days later it is also set to unveil a revamp of its premium Finest range as it lock horns with Waitrose for the posh pound. By contrast rival Sainsbury’s is also set to unveil its second quarter trading update on Wednesday. The latest industry dates compiled by Nielsen for the twelve-week period ending August 17th 2013 shows Aldi’s growth has continued into 2013, with its average basket spend now £18.63, while an average basket size of 16-17 products is almost on a par with Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, which stock more product lines.

She said that she had not spoken to her ambitious older sister, Gulnara, for 12 years. She went further, saying she ensured her two or three visits to Uzbekistan per year do not coincide with the times Gulnara will be there. 'We have never hidden this from anyone ... We have neither family nor friendship contacts,' she said. 'We don't even meet each other for family activities.' Gulnara, 41, who is seen as a possible presidential successor, is known as a pop singer and fashion designer and runs jewellery and cosmetics businesses and number of charities. Last year as her alter-ego GooGoosha, she recorded a duet with Gerard Depardieu, Until recently she was Uzbekistan's permanent representative in the UN in Geneva and the country's ambassador in Spain. However, there are plenty of similarities between the two: both lead jet-set lifestyles, hob-nob with Western celebrities and pride themselves on their generous philanthropic endeavours. Lola and her husband Timur have been included in a list of Swizterland's wealthiest people - and so has Gulnara. But it seems that rivalry and resentment trump sisterly loyalty. 'Any good relationship requires a similarity of outlook or likeness of character,' said Lola. Harmony? Lola's sister Gulnara pictured here with Sting, who defended his decision to perform in Uzbekistan despite its poor human rights record . 'There is nothing like that in our relationship, has never been and is not now.' She said she and her sister had had quite different characters since childhood.'And these differences, as you know, only grow over the years.' This is not merely a family squabble. Their father is 75 and rumours have begun to swirl around the question of his succeessor. Karimov has ruled the country since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 with such an iron grip that there are no major high-profile politicians waiting in the wings. Party: Lola and her husband Timur pictured in Saint Tropez . Gulnara has long been tipped as a possible successor, but she is deeply unpopular in Uzbekistan. A US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks referred to her as 'the single most hated person in the country'. The Harvard graduate has been given diplomatic status by her father, and according to the memos sent to Washington, seen as a 'robber baron'. Lola was no politician and wanted to focus on her family. But she told the BBC she thought Gulnara's chances of succeeding their father are 'slim'. It may be that Lola is publicly distancing herself from her sister because Gulnara has been linked to a wide-ranging international fraud investigations. Critics claim she runs a huge business empire in Uzbekistan. Gulnara has denied all wrongdoing. Lola told the BBC that she does not know whether her father is aware of the allegations surrounding her sister's business interests, ebcause she and her father never discuss politics. Asked why she sued the French news site, Rue89, Lola said that it hurts her when the media referred to her only as a 'dictator's daughter'.'I want to be seen as a person with her own principles and viewpoint,' she said. On the question of her father's policies, she said she agreed with his view that radicalisation of the population was largely due to unemployment and lack of opportunity. Karimov has been accused of using the pretext of combating Islamic extremism to quash all dissent. She said: 'And I am confident they cannot be solved by using force.' Karimov is accused of sanctioning his henchmen to slaughter hundreds of his own citizens at a massacre in the city of Andijan in 2005, though western leaders have courted him due to his country's proximity to Afghanistan. Human rights activists say he has had opponents boiled alive, and torture is widespread in the country's prisons. Uprising: the Andijan massacre in 2005 was one of the bloodiest episodes in Uzbekistan's post-Soviet history . Karimov said in a television interview in June that Uzbeks who went to Russia to look for work were 'lazy', and said he felt 'disgusted that people go there for a slice of bread'. Average annual income in Uzbekistan is just £1,063, and the US estimates that around one in four Uzbeks works abroad because of a lack of work closer to home. Her father has been accused of forcing Uzbeks, even minors, to spend their summers picking cotton for little or no pay. In her email interview she appeared to criticise this practice. 'I am against any exploitation, especially the exploitation of children,' she said. Ally: after 9/11 US President George W Bush met President Karimov, viewing Uzbekistan as useful because it borders Afghanistan . Curiously, despite Lola's claim that she and her sister have not spoken for 12 years, another leaked US cable suggests that only nine years ago the two partied together in the capital, Tashkent, where Lola reportedly owned a nightclub. '[Lola] Karimova typically arrives in her – one-of-a-kind, for Tashkent – Porsche Cayenne S sports utility vehicle around 10 o'clock for the traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours dancing the night away in the raucous disco. 'On occasion, her older sister, Gulnora, joins her around three o'clock in the morning,' the cable says.","Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva says she hasn't spoken to her elder sister Gulnara in 12 years .

Probe: Police have re-opened an investigation into the death of Princess Diana (pictured in 1990) after new evidence from Soldier N - who has now fled the country . An sniper who claims the SAS were involved in a plot to kill Princess Diana has reportedly fled to Thailand in fear of his life. The anonymous soldier is said to be laying low in south-east Asia as police investigators probe claims that members of the Army helped cause the car crash that killed Diana in 1997. It has been claimed that special forces agents shined a light into the eyes of Diana's driver, which led to him losing control of the car and hitting a pillar in a tunnel in Paris. The sniper - known only as Soldier N - made the claims to police investigators, leading to the inquiry into the Princess's death being reopened. But he fled the country before Scotland Yard could properly examine the evidence, which was handed over by the Royal Military Police, reported the Daily Star. Previous reports had placed Soldier N in an ex-part community in Dubai, but an anonymous military source had claimed it would be a hostile - and expensive - environment for him. The source said: 'He will not be welcome in the Middle East as there is a large community of former SAS personnel who use Dubai and other locations as a base for their work. 'It is also expensive to live in the Gulf states and I don’t believe that he has the resources to sustain a new life there.'

Thailand is said to be a popular destination for runaways due to its lenient police system and low cost of living. As Soldier N has a criminal record for handling firearms, there are many countries he would not be allowed to enter. Former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, 84, whose son Dodi was in the car with Diana and also died, has repeatedly called for further investigation of the crash, and is said to be angry that Soldier N was not prevented from leaving the country.","Unidentified Soldier N has said SAS were involved in Princess's death .

The writer who posted the break up text she received from a new boyfriend has revealed that she thinks of herself as the one who initiated the break up. Quin Woodward Pu is a blogger and author who writes about her social life in Washington, D.C. and her latest exploits caused an uproar when she decided to publicly shame the man who dumped her after only two dates. After meeting a 'rando' at a bar on Friday the 13th (which she told MailOnline 'should have been a sign' of things to come), Ms Woodward Pu was outraged when he had the gall to send her a text ending their relationship just days before her 26th birthday. Now she has revealed that his text came after she was the one to initially cool things down with him. While many commenters saw her scathing reaction in a series of texts that she sent to him following the break up as an overreaction, she has spoken out to clarify that she had initially been the one to 'pump the breaks' on the relationship. Vindicated? Quin Woodward Pu has said that she feels that she initiated the break up by 'pumping the breaks' on the relationship before receiving the text . She told MailOnline that on their second date, which took place last Saturday night, he suggested that 'maybe we shouldn't be seeing other people'. She said that she shrugged off the comment, saying 'Okay yeah let's talk about it later'. 'The rest of the weekend I went on another date, I was seeing other people. It was very casual,' she said. Less than two days later, she received the infamous break up text, which she felt was written in a condescending way where he assumed he 'had the upper hand' in the relationship. 'I actually spent the entire day really mad... I was stewing and really agitated I'm already pretty high strung to begin with,' she said. She crafted the admittedly 'hyperbolic' text and actually sent it to the editor who looks over her books and blog posts. The editor said that it was 'a little strong' and suggested she sleep on it before sending. When Woodward Pu woke up on the morning of her birthday, she still felt the same sting from the text and decided to go ahead and send it. 'I'm still mad. I still thought it was a d**k move- he thought that he had the upper hand and I'm none-the-wiser,' she said. 'Agitated': Woodward Pu said that the break up text made her mad because it assumed that he had the upper hand in their nascent relationship . She would not give any identifying details about the man when asked, except to say that he has a 9-year-old daughter and 'is not a young professional but is not middle aged'. She also would not detail whether or not they have spoken since she published the texts, only saying that she is sure that he is still employed and his bosses do not know that he is the person she is referring to. Firing shot: The unidentified man sent her this text after going on two dates and before another planned weekend . The self-published author said that . she has not read the comments to her story online- a practice that she . uses with all of her writing- but finds it funny that Reddit users . created Amazon accounts purely to review her books because even though . they have given scathing reviews, it helps her sales because her books . move towards the top of the 'most reviewed' list and give it more . publicity. 'I write my blog to entertain people, that's the only reason,' she said. 'I've taken great pains to protect his identity... I was not trying to ruin his life and I didn't ruin his life . The . timeline of events is the most controversial point that strikes a chord . with online commentators, as the break up text- and ensuing virtual . firestorm- came after only two dates. Woodward Pu met the man, whose . name she has not released, and they began exchanging emails before going . for a night of drinks, dinner and champagne. After discovering that they had . 'relatively good chemistry', she invited him to her upcoming birthday . party and when he could not make it, he invited her for a weekend-long . trip to nearby wine country. In an interview the day after she posted the break up text, Woodward Pu said that she had been the one to 'pump the breaks' on the relationship at that point. She explained that the man had tried to have a conversation 'DTR', where they would Define The Relationship, and she thought it was too soon. Quin Woodward's pompous self-aggrandized claims to be 'a 25 year old with two published books and a condo' has won her few fans and a host of negative comments . Quin Woodward Pu is the editor-in-chief of . Little Black Blog, and has written two books about her fast-paced life . in Washington, D.C. and her romantic exploits . ‘The man had just 24 hours prior . broached a DTR, which I politely shelved for the time being (that is not . in the original blog post because it seemed unnecessarily merciless to . point that out, but I see now that it is an integral part of setting up . my reaction), and who asked if he could spend an entire weekend with . me,' she told In The Capital. 'For . him to suddenly ""dump"" me after I'd already politely pumped the brakes . on our still-nascent ""relationship""--that is what caused the anger, to . try to preemptively end things before they'd even begun because he felt I . was pulling away.' Said anger included threats to send his employers proof that he was using his work phone to ‘sext’ her. 'Though . unsolicited and completely unrequited, I thought the taxpayer-funded . sexts from your agency blackberry were sweet, but your executive . committee may think the screenshots of your messages I sent to them are a . little cheesy,' she wrote in the text to the would-be suitor. On her Facebook profile late Thursday, she clarified that it was actually an empty threat. 'Let's all calm down, people. The boss was never informed. Government sexter is still very safely and soundly employed, with his superiors none the wiser,' she wrote. Though she was stunned into self-proclaimed paralysis after receiving the break up text- where the unidentified man assured her that he had ‘no doubt you'll move on quickly as you are a funny, smart, cool girl’- the speed at which her story engaged the public did not come as a surprise. Woodward Pu's two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' are in fact self-published tomes of her own autobiography which have received a host of negatives reviews on Amazon . Quin Woodward Pu's two volumes of self-published memoirs have been labeled 'narcissistic' and 'pretentious' ‘There is a reason why my websites are kept up-to-date, and why I consulted a lawyer the night before I went live with the post. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into,’ she told In The Capital. ‘The reason this story has caught so much attention is because it is relatable, on both sides of the gender line. ‘To be fair, the man has both my books; he also knew what he was getting himself into.’ She also proudly states that sales for her books have dramatically increased since the story came out, in spite of the less-than-stellar reviews on Amazon: they both have an average review of 1.5 stars out of five. Woodward Pu, who graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2009, wrote two memoirs about her ‘glitzy and glamorous’ pursuit of a ‘champagne-soaked’ career in journalism.","Quin Woodward Pu, 26, was unceremoniously dumped via text this week by a man she had been on two dates with .

Mockery: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, pictured at last week's Labour party conference, was accused of 'sneering' after she criticised David Cameron's plans to give married couples a tax break . Labour and the Liberal Democrats were accused of ‘sneering’ at marriage yesterday as David  Cameron said he would like to go further in restoring recognition for the institution in the tax system. Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls led  criticism of the Prime Minister’s plans for a £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples, and the Lib Dems also condemned it – opening up a key general election battleground. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, a champion of marriage, said: ‘I’m not sure why Labour are behaving as though this is a big surprise. The Prime Minister has always been very clear that this was a manifesto pledge and he would deliver it. ‘It strikes me that Labour are just using this as an opportunity to sneer at marriage. This is a popular policy that will help eight million hard-working people.’ The Prime Minister said he was ‘proud’ of the measure, which was revealed exclusively by the Daily Mail on Saturday, and would go further if re-elected with a Tory majority. Married people who earn under the £10,000 income tax threshold will be able to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to a higher-earning spouse, reducing their annual tax bill by £200 from April 2015. Couples where one spouse is a higher rate taxpayer – earning more than £42,285 in 2015 – will not be able to use the scheme. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, in the crowd at the Labour party conference in Brighton, said women would 'lose out' under the new proposals . ‘We are going to deliver,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘It has taken longer than I would like because obviously we have been battling with all the economic problems in front of us –and we’ve been in a coalition – but nonetheless we will in the next Finance Bill be legislating for recognising marriage in the tax system. ‘Obviously I’d like to do more  but I think it is right to start with  people on relatively low earnings.’  But Mr Balls said women ‘lose out’, adding: ‘It’s insulting that £3.85 a week would persuade anyone to get married. And the money will be paid mainly to men not women.’ Miss Harman said on Twitter: ‘Married man’s tax allowance will go to a man on his third wife but not to first two wives looking after his children.’ Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Treasury . spokesman, said Mr Cameron was ‘so out of touch he thinks people will . get married for £3.85 a week’. Labour’s . home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper said: ‘Sadly it’s clear that for . this Prime Minister most people’s love and commitment doesn’t count.’ Mainfesto pledge: The Prime Minister, pictured at the Tory party conference which began in Greater Manchester today, said he was 'proud' of the measure, and would take it further if he was re-elected . Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Stephen Williams added: ‘You don’t build a fairer society by using the tax system to favour one type of family over another.’ Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted it was right to recognise marriage. He said: ‘It is an institution that is the building block of our society . . . this is a measure that’s going to help four million hard-working couples.’ Dr Samantha Callan, of the think tank Centre for Social Justice, which has campaigned for such a move, said: ‘We’ve been calling for this since 2007. Half of all children born today will not still be with both their parents by the time they’re 15 and marriage is a more durable relationship.’ Tim Yeo, Conservative MP for South Suffolk, was a rare voice of criticism in his party. He said he regretted that the proposal ‘may exclude’ men or women on low incomes who have been widowed. I didn't expect gay marriage storm, says Cameron . By TIM SHIPMAN . Regrets: A new book has has revealed that David Cameron told an ally he wished he had scrapped the law . David Cameron admitted yesterday he had not foreseen the furore surrounding gay marriage legislation but did not regret pushing it through Parliament. A new book on the Coalition, published today, claims the Prime Minister confided to an ally that he wished he had ditched the law as it caused such bad feeling with grassroots Conservatives and backbench MPs. The Prime Minister reportedly said: ‘If I’d known what it was going to be like, I wouldn’t have done it.’ When gay marriage came to a vote in the Commons earlier this year, which Mr Cameron had vocally championed, more than half of Tory MPs refused to back him, meaning the PM needed Labour and Lib Dem support to get the legislation passed. Tory MPs claim that many party members tore up their membership cards in protest. The book, In It Together by Matthew D’Ancona, reveals: ‘In his bleaker private moments, Cameron was becoming savagely self-critical about his misreading of the party on gay marriage. “This is down to me,” he told one ally. But he was stuck with the measure now.’ In an interview with the BBC yesterday,  Mr Cameron denied he had made the comment. He said: ‘I don’t regret it and Britain is a more equal and fairer country for having done it. I’m passionate about marriage. I think it’s a great institution and I think it should be available to people who are gay as well as to those of us who aren’t.’ But he added: ‘I don’t think I expected quite the furore there was. It’s clearly been very difficult for some people to take on.’ Under the legislation, the Church of England was exempted from conducting gay weddings and other religious groups are allowed to refuse to do so. But Mr Cameron admitted that opponents of same-sex unions gained backing because he failed to explain that religious groups would not be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies against their will. ‘I’m not sure we got across to people that this was about marriages that could take place in register offices – this was not going to change what happened in church, mosque or synagogue,’ he said. ‘I’m not sure we got that point across.’","Deputy Leader Harriet Harman criticised the plans on Twitter .

George Osborne was today forced to deny thinking that Iain Duncan Smith is not clever enough to be a Cabinet minister.

But a new book reveals that relations between the two senior ministers are far worse than previously admitted. Clash: George Osborne (right) was forced to deny thinking Iain Duncan Smith was not clever enough to be in the Cabinet . Mr Osborne privately expressed frustration that Mr Duncan Smith ‘opposes every cut’ to benefits, according to In It Together by Matthew d’Ancona. As Work and Pensions Secretary Mr Duncan Smith is the architect of the government’s welfare reforms but has been locked in long-running battles with the Treasury over funding for his plans. According to the book, Mr Osborne confided in allies: ‘You see Iain giving presentations and realise he’s just not clever enough.’ In return, Mr Duncan Smith views Mr Osborne and David Cameron as the political equivalent of television presenters Ant and Dec, the book claims. But Mr Osborne today denied criticising Mr Duncan Smith for not being clever. ‘No, I did not. And I, by the way, work incredibly closely with Iain Duncan Smith,’ he told BBC radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think he is a remarkable individual who has transformed, almost single-handedly, the entire debate about welfare in this country and is deeply compassionate… And very clever. He went on: ‘Just because it’s in a book doesn’t make it true. I have huge, huge respect and time for Iain Duncan Smith. ‘And, by the way, here’s a staggering truth about this Government: the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Welfare Secretary can work together and deliver programmes like this and talk to each other is itself a sign that we have a functional government that is working for hardworking people.’ Denial: The Chancellor insisted he worked incredibly well with his Cabinet colleagues . Mr Osborne and David Cameron were Tory aides when Mr Duncan Smith was leader. According to the book, the ‘In the words of one familiar with IDS’s sensitivities,’ the book says, ‘Imagine waking up one morning to find out Ant and Dec are running the country.’ When Mr Osborne vowed to slash child benefit at the Tory conference of 2010, Mr Duncan Smith was caught off guard and warned the Chancellor that he was on a ‘power trip’. ‘I thought we were a team!’ Iain Duncan Smith exclaimed. ‘If we are going to do this . . . you know, we have to work as a team!’ Mr Duncan Smith’s spokeswoman refused to respond to the claims but one ally dismissed the ‘tittle tattle’, adding: ‘I’d be surprised if he knew who Ant and Dec are.’","Chancellor insists he gets on well with Work and Pensions Secretary .

With her usually shoulder length locks seemingly chopped into a soft bob, the 34-year-old actress revealed to E! read carpet presenter Ryan Seacrest that her crop was in fact fake. Rather than committing to a haircut, the actress had her hair carefully styled into a ‘fob’, or faux bob, and here Femail shows you how to copy this chic style. Keep your hair on! Homeland's Claire Danes pulls hair fake-out with 'faux bob' when she hit the red carpet at the 65th Primetime Emmys on Monday .

Errol said of Claire’s red carpet look: ‘The bob is a classic – it's the fast track to elegant and a great way to show off high gloss healthy locks, it's age versatile and there's an interpretation that works for all face shapes and hair colours. ‘It's an iconic look and will always work for the timeless glamour we like to see on the red carpet.  I love that Claire Danes rocked the fake.’ Errol says that the right tools and preparation are essential for Femail readers hoping to create the perfect ‘fob’ Where you are after a 'fob' or a full-on bob, Errol says make sure you get the right style for you. 'Ask what length overall and type of fringe or not will suit your face . shape, age and lifestyle. 'A longer version with soft fringe will be . easier to maintain and easier to wear. Do ask also about colour . choices, particularly on blonde tones, as they need to match skin tones . which change with age, just to ensure they flatter and don't appear . harsh. 'Ask about the amount of layers cut into a bob – too many results . in a loss of shape and the hair kicks OUT instead of IN which is the . signature look of a bob. 'Finally, the the minimum length of a bob I . feel for best flattering features should be to the jaw line, anything . above is quite difficult to pull off and isn't for everyone' He says: 'After a barrel brush blow dry to really smooth out all of the hair, use pins to literally mould the hair and push it underneath itself, rolled almost to the desired bob length. ‘Faking on longer hair in this way creates a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it's doubled up on itself. Use Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream to mould (use on wet hair before the blow dry) and Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray to set without stiffness.' 'A smooth, healthy, high shine finish is the key to all interpretations of the bob, so product preparation and the right styling tools are essential. Build in moisture before a barrel brush blow dry with Morocanoil Original Treatment applied from mid length to ends. 'Once dry, finish with a heated styling tool that locks in moisture and delivers shine. My Treat&Style has built in Keratin Capsules to infuse a shot of the hair's naturally produced protein, visible on the finish. Use a non-sticky spray to finish that allows movement.' The mother-of-one arrived as a nominee in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland, but the star left as a winner. Claire Danes appeared at the Showtime Primetime Emmy's Eve Party on Saturday with her normal long blonde locks . She also stunned on the red carpet, wearing an Armani Privé couture lace gown with a neckline slashed down to the navel, paired with subtle Neil Lane jewellery and Christian Louboutin shoes. However some critics thought the actress looked too skinny, drawing attention to her jutting collar bones and flat chest. Claire may have faked hers, but there was no doubt that bobs were as on trend as pale pastel dresses on the red carpet this year. Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery's bob was sleek and side-parted, while Giuliana Rancic added edge to her chic bob with a bias cut and Jane Krakowski softened hers with layers and a sweeping fringe. Errol says: Michelle Dockery's smooth, glossy, side-parted version brought great class to her overall look.' January Jones also opted for a short cut, though with a curled tousled look, which was also adopted by Julianne Hough and fellow Man Men star Christina Hendricks.

Designers Bob Panos and Karl Lee have now set up a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of their Mipwr cases. They explained: 'After witnessing the aftermath of power outages from recent natural disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy and the cruise ship disasters, we thought about taking an existing technology (electromagnetic induction), and making it small enough to fit in the back of a cell phone case. 'We thought, 'how cool would it be to have an alternative energy source, besides a backup battery, that could power a mobile device, so users could send out a message or phone call when they need to most?' Mipwr Dynamo is an all-in-one protective case, backup battery, and hybrid charger. The case contains a 400 mA battery and a concealed push lever that, when pumped, generates electricity, and charges the internal battery. The electricity created by squeezing the lever is produced by electromagnetic conduction. The top of the case comes off and the iPhone slides into the bottom and connects to the phone's battery charging point. A battery inside the case can be charged by plugging it into the mains.

After the phone is removed from charge, the case can be used as a backup battery by switching a lever on the side, pictured. The phone then swaps from using its own battery's energy, to using the energy stored in the case . The Mipwr Dynamo's inventors claim squeezing the lever produces the electricity by electromagnetic conduction, using components fitted inside the case, pictured in this concept drawing. The backup case adds two hours of battery life, while a minute of squeezing gives an extra 30 seconds of charge . When connected to the mains, the electricity charges the case and phone battery simultaneously. At any point after the phone has been removed from charge, the case can be used as a backup battery by switching a lever on the side. The phone then swaps from using its own battery's energy, to using the energy stored in the case. Once all that energy has run out, the lever can be popped out from inside the case and squeezed to generate extra charge. According the Kickstarter campaign: 'In the event you exhaust both the phone battery and Mipwr's backup battery - that will give you two extra hours of talk time - you can pump the push lever to produce 30 . seconds of talk or text time for 1 minute of pumping. There are already cases that double up as backup batteries on the market, including Mophie. Mophie cases, pictured, come in a range of colours and cost from around £50.

According to court documents in the Menomonie heist, Al-Huthaili gave the teller a note that read, 'I have a gun.' She allegedly demanded money and the teller gave her $2,350, which included 'bait bills' that are marked so police can easily trace them, the Star Tribune reported. FBI agents used the bills to locate her Roseville residence and the next day followed her to Rosedale, where they witnessed her purchase a laptop computer with cash. After she left the store, the agents examined the cash, determining it was that stolen in the Menomonie holdup. Al-Huthaili was arrested that night and agents say she admitted to a September 5 holdup of the First State Bank and Trust in Hudson as well as the one in Menomonie on Monday.

Samsung has revealed two gold limited edition handsets hot on the heels of Apple, after consumers went crazy for its golden iPhone 5S handset last week. The tech giant unveiled two limited edition Galaxy S4 smartphones in gold and pink, and gold and brown colour combinations, but they will currently only be available for customers in the Gulf region. While rumours of a golden iPhone were mounting some time before the launch of Apple's latest high-end smartphone a fortnight ago, demand for the gold version of the iPhone 5S handset was reportedly higher than the firm expected. Samsung has revealed two gold limited edition handsets. The tech giant unveiled two limited edition Galaxy S4 smartphones in gold and pink and gold and brown colour combinations, but they will currently only be available for customers in the Gulf region . While it would be impossible for Samsung to copy Apple's lucrative golden move in just two weeks, TechCrunch believes Samsung probably had its ear close to the Apple rumour mill to capitalise on the probable demand of gold handsets. So far it appears that the Samsung handset will only be available in the United Arab Emirates market, where Nokia has previously launched a gold smartphone. A scarcity of the gold-colored iPhone 5S models drove ebay auction prices for the coveted items into the five figures. On Monday this week, a single, unopened and unlocked 16GB gold Apple iPhone, which retails for around $200 in the U.S. on contract, sold for $10,100 (£6,295) following a brief but bitter bidding war on the auction website. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, said: 'This is our best iPhone launch yet - more than nine million new iPhones sold―a new record for first weekend sales.' On Monday this week, a single, unopened and unlocked 16GB gold Apple iPhone, which retails for around $200, sold for $10,100 following a brief but bitter bidding war on ebay . 'The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible and while we’ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly.' But according to Forbes, unless you ordered your gold iPhone in the first hour it became available Friday, it won’t be shipping until October. Apple also took a gamble on demand for novel coloured smartphone with the launch of its iPhone 5C handsets. Much like the unexpected demand of the gold iPhone 5S handset, the pink version of the cheaper handset has been a big success. Sales figures show Apple's gamble with colourful iPhones is paying off, with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined . Reports from iPhoneStockChecker.co.uk found that the blue model is the second most-popular device, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales. In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales. Apple could be looking to take this strategy into the iPad part of the business. Experts have already said there could be at least two new iPads released as soon as next month.","Samsung has unveiled two limited edition Galaxy S4 smartphones in gold and pink, and gold and brown colour combinations .

"By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 28 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:45 EST, 28 September 2013 . The North and South property divide is more evident than ever after house prices widened to a record high of more than £100,000. A house in the South of England is now typically 74 per cent more expensive than one in the North. Prices in southern regions have risen by 6.1 per cent year-on-year and this increase is almost double the rate of the 3.1 per cent rise seen in the North. The surge in the South is mainly down to price hikes in London, where a 10 per cent year-on-year growth marks the first time the capital has seen a double-digit increase since 2010. The average price of a property in London is now £331,338. Widening gap: The difference between the cost of homes in the north and south of England has continued to grow . The new figures from September show that all 13 regions in the UK have seen annual house price growth for the first time since 2007, according to Nationwide. The figures are signs that 'the pick-up is becoming increasingly broad-based', the building society said. But experts warned that a housing price bubble could emerge as demand for housing continues to far outstrip supply. The annual rate of house price increases rose to 5 per cent across the country, marking the strongest uplift seen since July 2010. Prices are also up by 0.9 per cent month-on-month, following a 0.7 per cent monthly increase seen in August, meaning the typical UK home is now worth £172,127. Fears have been growing in recent months that Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, which have widened mortgage availability and encouraged more low-deposit lending, could be helping to stoke up a house price 'bubble', with people overstretching themselves. On the up: House prices rose by five per cent since last year - stoking fears of a property bobble developing . But these concerns have been dismissed by lenders and by Chancellor George Osborne, who recently said that house prices have 'barely grown' outside London. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner warned that house building is still running at levels below what is needed to keep up with demand, which will fuel the upward pressure on prices. He said the acceleration in house price growth from a subdued pace last year has been 'surprisingly quick', although prices are still way off their previous peaks in many areas of the UK. He said: 'Overall, UK house prices are still around 8per cent below their 2007 highs. However, there is still significant regional variation, with prices in Scotland, Wales and the North of England around 12per cent to 14per cent below their previous peaks, while in many southern regions prices are 5per cent to 7per cent lower. Boom time: London has seen the biggest rise in property prices than anywhere else in the country . 'Only in London are prices at an all-time high, 8per cent above their previous peak.' He . added: 'The risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply, . affordability may become stretched. House price growth has been . outstripping average earnings growth since the middle of the year, for . the first time since late 2010.' At the moment, 'ultra-low' interest rates are helping to support the affordability of mortgage payments, he said. A typical mortgage payment for a first-time buyer is around 29 per cent of their take-home pay, which is in line with the long-term average. On a regional level, the biggest increases continued to be felt in London, where prices have risen by 10 per cent year-on-year and at £331,338 typically they are not only at an all-time high but are sitting 8 per cent above their 2007 peak. Bubble trouble: House building is not keeping up with demand, an expert warned . But the pick-up remains patchy. Manchester also saw a 10per cent . increase in house prices over the last year and Newcastle recorded an . 8per cent rise - but at the other end of the spectrum, prices were down . by 3 per cent annually in Carlisle and by 2per cent in Southampton. After London, East Anglia saw the second highest annual increase in . house prices at 6.6 per cent. House prices were up by 3.6 per cent in . Wales year-on- year and by 2.2 per cent in Scotland. Northern Ireland saw its first annual price rise since 2007, albeit a . small 0.9 per cent increase, indicating that prices there are starting . to stabilise, Nationwide said. Northern Ireland has the lowest average house prices out of all the . regions, at £108,671.

A Texas woman was arrested after bringing her seven-year-old son to meet an undercover cop she thought was a hit man she hired to kill his father. Nicolette Beard, 33, was charged with solicitation of capital murder Wednesday after paying an undercover agent to kill Anthony Drymalla, the father of her young son. Ms Beard agreed to end Mr Drymalla’s life for the paltry sum of $4,000, but had difficulty coming up with even that small amount of money. A friend of Ms Beard’s tipped cops to the scorned woman’s devilish plan to end Mr Drymalla’s life, according to the Houston Chronicle. With the friend’s help, authorities set up a sting operation to stop the plot before it became a reality, KBTX reported. Mr Drymalla and his family were placed in protective custody while the details of the meeting were ironed out. Meeting in the parking lot of a College Station, TX., grocery store, Ms Beard told the undercover cop to make it look Mr Drywalla’s death look like an accident and that she ‘wouldn’t have a problem with’  the hit man killing his wife or son, according to an incident report cited by KBTX.

A science-fiction fan who collects giant film props is selling a giant Star Wars replica after his girlfriend said she'd had enough it it. But Martin Fillery, 42, says he will use the proceeds from the sale of the £10,000 Imperial Scout Walker to buy more toys. And the musician from Ston Easton, outside Bath, has his eye on the Ectomobile ambulance from the hit 1984 film, Ghostbusters. Scroll down for video . Martin Fillery, who collects film props, outside his house near Bath with the Imperial Walker he's selling . Mr Fillery's two-legged machine - full name All-Terrain Scout Transport - appeared in 1983 hit Return Of The Jedi, where evil Stormtroopers used a fleet to attack the forest moon of Endor. He bought the wood and metal replica a few years ago and kept it outside, but his girlfriend, who does not want to be named, has run out of patience with the 16ft contraption that dwarfs their pretty stone cottage, and so Mr Fillery has put it on internet auction site eBay. The Imperial Walker comes complete with blasters as well as a trailer to cart around the iconic piece of Star Wars imagery. He hopes the AT-ST - known by fans as a 'chicken walker' because of its bird-like body and long legs - will go to a good home. Mr Fillery, a musician, said: 'I bought it about six months ago from a group of Star Wars enthusiasts up north who built it. 'They had run out of money, so I jumped at the chance to buy it - I've now had about as much fun as I can have from it. Not pretty: A closer view of the Star Wars replica shows why Mr Fillery's girlfriend may have gone off it after six years . Crowded drive: Mr Fillery's collection of movie props includes an enormous Incredible Hulk and a large Tardis . 'Just imagine having a giant Imperial Scout Walker parked outside your house - you'd never get visits from double glazing salesman.' Mr Fillery, whose collection includes a Tardis, and Incredible Hulk, several Ewoks and a Batmobile, initially bought the AT-ST to use as a stage prop with his Star Wars themed band, Hollywood's Finest. He said: 'I think my girlfriend is starting to get a bit worried about me. I've always been a bit mad, and I love sci-fi stuff, but my spending on props is going through the roof. 'We've got well over £100,000 worth of kit and costumes, I got someone to build me a full-size loader from the film Aliens. I paid him £400 a week to build it. 'The Scout Walker is amazing, but I realised pretty quickly that it was just too big to use as on stage, so I'm selling it so I can get more toys.' He added: 'I'm going to use the money to get two different versions of the Batmobile, and Echo1, the Ghostbusters ambulance. I do love my toys.' Mr Fillery, who estimates his collection of film props to be worth more than £100,000, admits 'I am mad' The Imperial Walker, which towers over Mr Fillery's west country cottage, is for sale for £9,800 after six years .

She will now look after Prince George . They had hoped to do it all themselves. But, as many new parents have realised before them, sometimes you need an extra pair of hands. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have bowed to the inevitable and hired a nanny for their seven-week-old son, Prince George. They have decided to keep it in the family, however – asking William’s former nanny, Jessie Webb, to come out of retirement and lend a hand part-time. Palace sources had let it be known as recently as June that the pair had no plans to pay for extra care. But, sources admit, William and Kate have quickly realised they are not a ‘super-couple’ and need some help, particularly as the duchess is slowly returning to limited royal duties. Miss Webb, 71, cared for the prince and his brother, Harry, in the early 1990s. She was eventually let go by Princess Diana, who often became jealous of those her sons grew close to. But William, now 31, enjoyed a warm, loving relationship with his nannies, and has always regarded Miss Webb fondly. He ensured she was a guest of honour at both his 21st birthday party and his wedding two years ago. Now, some 25 years on, she is looking after William’s own son – and the Cambridges believe George couldn’t be in better hands. Nanny Webb was on duty last night when the couple took to the red carpet for only their second official engagement since their son’s birth on July 22. A senior royal source told the Mail that she was working for the Cambridges on an ‘ad hoc’ basis. ‘Jessie Webb is helping the couple out,’ the source said. ‘It was a very recent decision.’ Miss Webb was first employed by Prince Charles and his wife to look after William and Harry when the future king was seven and about to start at prep school. It was the spring of 1990. While to the outside world all seemed well, Miss Webb soon found herself walking a tightrope as Charles and Diana’s relationship disintegrated. ‘Diana was often in tears and there were frequent rows,’ a former Kensington Palace figure recalled. ‘Jessie did not see it as her job to console the princess, so she did her bit to keep the children occupied and out of the way.’ Miss Webb (left) next to Princess Diana and Prince William at Prince Harry 's school sports day in 1992 . In their private lives the royal couple had already made their choices. The prince had returned to the warm embrace of his former love, Camilla Parker Bowles, and Diana was being consoled by Life Guards officer James Hewitt. Indeed, while on the surface it still seemed so normal, the reality was that by now the prince and princess were not just living separate lives but also maintaining separate homes. Increasingly, Charles remained at Highgrove during the week, while Diana and the boys were in London. It was against this background that Miss Webb began her duties. For generations, royal nannies had been picked from a relatively limited social circle. But with her warm Cockney informality and no-nonsense approach, Miss Webb seemed just the person to bring a bit of much-needed cheer into the household. Miss Webb enjoyed a healthy appetite herself and she thought the boys, especially Harry, needed feeding up. The nursery fridge groaned with sausages, bacon, buns, cakes of every description, and biscuits. Family: The Duke, Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine with their son, Prince George in the garden of the Middleton family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire . But the food all went. Indeed chef Mervyn Wycherley was once overheard saying of Miss Webb: ‘If I [didn’t] lock the kitchen door we would have no food left.’ Little boys, she would tell anyone who was listening, needed meat and potatoes. At first her large, reassuring presence helped diffuse the often fraught atmosphere between Charles and Diana, who by now were scarcely talking to each other. She took charge on weekend trips to Cirencester Park, where the boys played with their own cut-down polo sticks. Miss Webb, often described as a ‘like a ship in full sail’, seemed untroubled by the gathering marital storm. The Duchess of Cambridge arriving at the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards at the Royal Society in London yesterday . ‘She knew how to swoop up the boys when their parents’ arguments became too loud,’ a police bodyguard said. When William went away to Ludgrove school in the autumn of 1990, Jessie had only Harry to look after. If anything William’s absence – Diana missed him terribly – made the atmosphere even worse.  By the summer of 1991, the fairytale marriage was over in all but name. It was inevitable perhaps that as Charles and Diana lashed out, others got hurt, too. One casualty was Jessie. ‘In fact both Charles and Diana had decided it was time she should move on,’ said a former Palace figure. ‘He found her too big, too brash and generally too loud. Diana just stopped talking to her,  Jessie never really knew why.’ So it was agreed that she would leave ‘KP’ when Harry started at Ludgrove in the autumn of 1992. But Jessie was not brusquely discarded. Instead she found work courtesy of Diana’s Kensington Palace neighbour Princess Margaret. She went to work for Viscount Linley and his wife Serena, where she remained for several happy years. She then moved to a royal apartment in Kennington, South London, to enjoy her retirement. Initially, as revealed by the Mail, William and Kate had hoped to do without any outside help for their baby son. Indeed, the duchess broke with royal tradition and eschewed the services of a maternity nurse after his birth, preferring to go and live with her parents in Berkshire for almost a month. Neither were keen to advertise for a carer and as far as William was concerned, there was only one person he trusted for the job: Nanny Webb. Although not entirely keen to go back to work in view of her age, she was apparently ‘delighted and flattered’ to have been asked. She has been in Wales with the couple for the last week before returning with them to London on Tuesday. ‘The truth is she loves William very much and was happy to do anything she could to help out,’ a source said.","William hires Jessie Webb, his childhood nanny, to look after Prince George .

There's good news for Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen, David Walliams and Lara Stone, Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, and Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem... all of whom got married in 2010. The third year of marriage - marking the time when a couple settles into a comfortable co-existence - is the happiest one, according to new research. A study of 2,000 married adults found a year of post-wedding exhilaration is followed by a year of getting to know each other, but by the third you have come to accept each other's imperfections and begin planning to start a family, further cementing the relationship. Comedian and actor David Walliams married model Lara Stone, left, on 16 May 16 2010 at London's Claridge's Hotel, while actors Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford, right, married on 15 June 2010 in New Mexico . The in-depth study, commissioned by family law specialists Slater & Gordon, examined the dynamics of modern married life. It found that by the third anniversary both parties were content with the financial implications of tying the knot and sharing bills and expenses. Enjoying the luxury of two salaries also makes this an enjoyable time along with the fact that renovations or improvements to the marital home are likely to be close to completion. By contrast, the study found the fifth year to be the hardest to overcome due to factors such as tiredness or even exhaustion amid increasing workloads - and children. Oscar-winning Spanish couple Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem chose to tie the knot in the Bahamas in July of 2010 at the house of a friend, with Penelope wearing a dress designed by John Galliano, and the couple now have two children, Leo and Luna . Actress Emily Blunt and her boyfriend John Krasinski, left, were married in Como, Italy, on 10 July 2010, while Ali G actor Sacha Baron Cohen married Australian actress Isla Fisher, right,  in Paris on 15 March of that year . Family lawyer at Slater & Gordon Amanda McAlister said: 'It's not very often we see clients in those first few years of marriage but by the five year mark or a couple of years after they have children we often have married couples asking us for advice. 'The buzz of the first few years where everything is new is hard to maintain and often people find that married life hasn't lived up to their expectations. 'We encourage anyone having doubts at this point in their marriage to really think about whether it's a crisis that can't be overcome. Glee star Jane Lynch married her longtime girlfriend Lara Embry at an very intimate outdoors ceremony in Massachusetts on 31 May 2010 with just 21 guests . 'Often those clients will just be having a hard time and six months later their marriage will have completely turned a corner.' The study also found familiarity with each other, regular bickers over the sharing of chores and the stress caused by financial worries also takes its toll. Bringing a child into the marriage around this point can also put strain on the relationship. The report also found seven years to be 'the wall', which if scaled successfully paves the way for a long, happy and lasting liaison for matrimony. Researchers delved into the emotional and physical toll of trying to make a marriage work. And they found a reflective one in ten admitted 'they didn't realise how hard it would be' while others confessed to suffering an emotional 'comedown' after the high of the wedding. One third of people feel there isn't enough affection in their marriage and one in five say there are days when they regret the decision to marry completely. Unbalanced sex drives, different hobbies or social preferences were found to provide stumbling blocks after the first few years. The study found half the people polled said their wedding day was the happiest of their life and the first year was ranked just behind the third for general happiness. Major factors behind this were that they were 'basking in the newlywed glow' coupled with unbridled optimism about a new life together. But that soon faded, according to the study amid the harsh realisation of the determination it requires to make the marriage work- one third feel the love in their marriage has reduced since the big day. One in ten said they loved their partner less than they did the day they were wed. Around one in five admitted their marriage had not worked out the way they would have liked. And four out of ten said they could 'do more' to make their marriage work. Amanda McAlister added: 'People often get so overwhelmed by the first few years they forget that a successful marriage requires work. Marriages have ups and downs and highs and lows.'","Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen, David Walliams and Lara Stone, and Calista Flockhart and Harrison Ford all married in 2010 .

'Unfair': John McCririck and his wife Jenny arriving at the London Central Employment Office today . Racing pundit John McCririck insisted today that he had played the part of a ‘pantomime villain’ and claimed he had never been ordered to tone down his on-screen style. Speaking on the first day of his employment tribunal against Channel 4, the 73-year-old said he had lost his job purely based on his age, claiming: ‘There's nobody better around.’ Mr McCririck is taking former employer Channel 4 and TV production company IMG Media Limited to the tribunal, alleging that his sacking last year was motivated by age discrimination. The case, in Central London, started today but was adjourned until tomorrow while its panel of judges reads witness statements and watches clips of Mr McCririck's television appearances, including racing coverage and reality TV shows Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap. Mr McCririck - known for his bling jewellery, sideburns and deerstalker hat - was dropped when the station unveiled a new presenting team headed by Clare Balding. He later announced his plans to sue Channel 4 for £3million, claiming the broadcaster had axed him because he was too old. Speaking after this morning's brief hearing, the 73-year-old, who was accompanied by wife Jenny, said his apparent sexism was part of a pantomime role he claimed he had been encouraged to continue, especially including his appearance in reality TV shows. Speaking to reporters: Mr McCririck arriving at the London employment tribunal as he takes Channel 4 to court . Unhappy: Mr McCririck is taking former employer Channel 4 and TV production company IMG Media Limited to the tribunal, alleging that his sacking last year was motivated by age discrimination . ‘All the Big Brothers etc, it's a pantomime,’ he said. ‘Because Captain Hook is horrible to Peter Pan and kids in Peter Pan, it doesn't mean the actor playing him goes around abusing kids in the street. ‘All this is a pantomime villain thing that Channel 4 encouraged.’ Mr McCririck denied he was ‘anti-women’, and said if anyone he had given a nickname to during his time on air had asked him not to, he would have stopped. ‘It's a very public school thing, it's a bit immature but it lightens up the programme. Channel 4 never, ever said “Look, we don't like this sexist thing, we don't like it when you call your names, don't wave your arms around”. Claim: Solicitor Stephen Beverley (left) arrives with the McCriricks at the London Central Employment Office . Preparations: Mr McCririck and Mr Beverley ahead of their arrival at the London Central Employment Office . ‘If the producer had said “Don't wave your arms around”, fine, I would not have. They never, ever spoke to me once.’ 'All the Big Brothers etc, it's a pantomime. Because Captain Hook is horrible to Peter Pan and kids in Peter Pan, it doesn't mean the actor playing him goes around abusing kids in the street' John McCririck . He insisted he was still the best for the job, adding: “There's nobody better around - I have been sacked purely because of my age”. Mr McCririck claimed the decision to axe him had been made by ‘youth-obsessed bosses’. ‘We are dealing with ruthless, tough people. We have got anonymous suits and skirts who come into any company, they make their decisions, unattributable, unchallenged, they decide the future of people and no-one can answer against them. ‘It is a culture in this country of new people coming into jobs, they have got to change, they can't go in and keep the same people or people say ""What are you doing?"". All together now: Mr McCririck with poses with a group of women on Ladies Day at Royal Ascot in June . ‘It's an age thing, they use the word “freshen up”. Freshen up is a euphemism for kicking out older people. 'People in their 30s onwards live in fear in this country that the new suits and skirts will come in and just go for new and trendy. It's totally wrong' John McCririck . ‘People in their 30s onwards live in fear in this country that the new suits and skirts will come in and just go for new and trendy. It's totally wrong. ‘Former home secretary David Blunkett said “The way TV executives worship the cult of youth seems to be an unstoppable fetish”. ‘I am saying it's not an unstoppable fetish. If this tribunal gives punitive, exemplary damages then no employer would ever dare sack somebody because of their age. ‘This tribunal, if they act decisively, could end age discrimination.’ Unique style: Mr McCririck is pictured at work at Cheltenham Racecourse in Gloucestershire in March 1995 . Mr McCririck said the loss of his job had left him depressed and reduced to watching daytime TV, adding: ‘I have worked all my life, I have never missed a day's work, I have never been late, I live to work. 'To wake up in the morning and not have a job to go to is awful' John McCririck . ‘I want to work, I am capable of working and I have been denied work illegally. To wake up in the morning and not have a job to go to is awful.’ A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to John McCririck for his contribution towards Channel 4 Racing over many years. ‘However we reject the suggestion that discrimination on the basis of age played any part in the decision not to include John in the Channel 4 Racing team from 2013 and we are vigorously defending this claim.’ An IMG spokesman said: 'Along with C4 we will strongly defend the claim that age played any part in the decision not to include John McCririck in the onscreen racing team.' The tribunal will reconvene at 10am tomorrow.","Racing pundit, 73, takes C4 and IMG Media to tribunal in Central London .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.","Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays .

He is not performing for another 50 days but obsessively dedicated Justin Bieber fans in Brazil have already started queuing to ensure they get the best front row spots. About 150 Beliebers in Rio de Janeiro put up 17 tents last week to camp out until his November 3 concert at the Sambadrome. The teenage and adult fans take it in turns to sleep in the Belieber camp overnight to reserve their spot. Belieber city: Dedicated fans have set up camp outside the Sambadrome in Rio 50 days before Justin Bieber's concert . Clampdown: Police banned under 18s from the camp at night over safety fears and a number of robberies . Around 50 people were camping out with up to four people bedding down in one tent at a time. It had all been planned out with a well organised rota of names and times until Rio municipal authority stepped in and clamped down on their plans. On Monday, officials from the Social Development department swooped on the tent city to inspect safety and hygiene conditions, and to ban teenagers under the age of 18 from remaining overnight. They also ordered the youngsters to return to school or face disciplinary procedures. About 30 unaccompanied minors were found staying at the site. The authorities immediately threatened to close the camp down and report their parents to social services if the children remained. 'Legal guardians who are not watching their children could have their youngsters taken away from them,' warned Rio municipal social worker, Renato Lopes. Bieber is due to play at the Sambadrome on November 3 . 'If the camp is considered harmful and those staying there do not abide by our regulations we will dismantle it.' City police officers and representatives from the Public Order Department also visited the area and instructed fans to take down their stalls lining the pavement along Avenida Salvador de Sá during the day as it obstructed pedestrians’ pathway. As a concession for those who remained, the authorities agreed to allow the campers to put up their tents at 9pm every night until 7am the next day.  According to the Public Order agents, the camp violates the council’s code of conduct, which prohibits the installation of shacks on public roads or sidewalks. Last night the Mail Online visited the Belieber camp site near the centre of Rio de Janeiro and found a depleted base but an enthusiastic bunch of fans who are still determined to sit it out for the 50 day wait until the show. Only two tents remain, with around eight fans, over the age of 18, keeping guard of their positions on behalf of 150 other individuals. Even though it was raining hard and the temperatures had dipped making it a slightly chilly night, the ones settling in for the long haul were undeterred by  the hardship of their roadside environment. 'I’m certainly not put off by sleeping rough,' says Norton Braga, a 19-year-old student and the first person in the queue. 'I absolutely love Justin Bieber, I identify with his music. He inspires me and touches my heart.' Braga has been instrumental in organising the camp and constantly liaises with the police to ensure that fans are seen to be sticking to the rules. He also sorts out the rota of names for the two shifts. The day crew starts at 11am until 6pm then hand over to the overnight watch who stay until 11 the following morning. The tents have been erected beside the Sambadrome 24 hour security kiosk which has two guards in attendance day and night. Further down the road is the Rio de Janeiro military police headquarters. Despite the close quarters of the security several members of the group were robbed of money and possessions by drug addicts in the early days of queuing. Organised: Fans used a rota so they could take it in turns saving places and looking after possessions day and night . While the Mail Online was there, three municipal police officers arrived to check the tents had been put up at the agreed time and only those allowed to stay had remained. 'We are concerned about their safety during the night as it is not an ideal location to be in. It’s not a dangerous area but I wouldn’t let my 16-year-old sleep here overnight,' says municipal police guard Marco Teixeira. 'We will be driving past regularly throughout the night to keep an eye on them,' he adds. By the time the officers arrived all of the underage fans had gone home. One of them is Carolina Rangel, 14, who said: 'I was devastated when the police banned me from staying at the campsite over night and during the day without an adult. 'My parents are a little concerned about me being down here but they support me because they know it’s my dream to see Justin and be as close to him as possible. Camp Bieber: The obsessive fans hung a sign dedicated to their idol Justin Bieber . 'From now on, I’m only allowed to come down on Saturdays and my mum or dad has to stay with me.' Even though they have had quite a few insulting comments shouted by motorists in passing cars the fans say local pubs and restaurants have generously allowed them to use their toilets for a nominal payment of one reais (35p) and bathroom facilities to bathe in for five reais (£1.80). 'The police have actually been really nice to us. The other day they bought us pizza and quite a few people have given us food and bottles of water,' says Leais Mates, 19. 'We also bring our own supplies, biscuits and sandwiches and such like,' she adds. More than 36,000 fans are expected at the concert which is sold out. Many have paid around 350 reais (£100) for their tickets. Just before the Mail Online leaves, Beliebers treat us to a high-spirited rendition of ‘Boyfriend’ and declare their undying love for the star. 'I want to send a message to Justin,' shouts Cynthia Castro, 16. 'I can’t wait to see you. I promise I won’t faint when I do. Please marry me!'","About 150 fans set up camp 50 days before the concert on November 3 .

The Great Depression of the 1930s was an era of such extreme poverty and dramatic economic decline that it remains permanently etched on our collective psyche. One major reason for the lasting impression made by the most widespread and deepest depression of the 20th century is that it coincided with the growth of photography as an art form and the period was well-documented as a result. One of the most famous American photographers documenting the era was Walker Evans, whose beautiful and sometimes haunting photographs captured such detail and emotion that the subjects feel more alive and closer to the present than the past. Country Store and Gas Station, Alabama, 1936: During a decade of profound transformation, Evans created a collective portrait of the Eastern United States through his work for the Farm Security Administration that now acts almost as a Modernist history of photography . Parked Car, Small Town Main Street, 1932: Evans said his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that were 'literate, authoritative, transcendent' Evans said that his goal as a photographer was to make pictures that were 'literate, authoritative, transcendent.' Such was the influence of Evans' work that he was the subject of the first exhibition - 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' - devoted to a single photographer at the Museum of Modern Art in New York some 75 years ago. At the same time a landmark book – ‘Studio’ – was published which comprised approximately 60 prints of his indivisible art works from that MOMA collection. Now to celebrate the 75th anniversary of that landmark collection, MOMA is once again displaying Evans’ finest work and ‘Studio’ has been reissued.

During a decade of profound transformation, Evans created a collective portrait of the Eastern United States through his work for the Farm Security Administration that now acts almost as a Modernist history of photography. The 2013 installation of Walker Evans' work maintains the bipartite organization of the originals: the first section portrays American society through images of its individuals and social contexts, while the second consists of photographs of American cultural artifacts - the architecture of Main streets, factory towns, rural churches, and wooden houses. The pictures provide neither a coherent narrative nor a singular meaning, but rather create connections through the repetition and interplay of pictorial structures and subject matter.

In 1935, Evans spent two months at first on a fixed-term photographic campaign for the Resettlement Administration in West Virginia and Pennsylvania. From October on, he continued to do photographic work for the RA and later the Farm Security Administration, primarily in the Southern United States. Evans continued to work for the FSA until 1938. Evans later became a staff writer at Time magazine and then an editor at Fortune magazine before he became a professor of photography on the faculty for Graphic Design at the Yale University School of Art.

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 05:48 EST, 26 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:19 EST, 26 September 2013 . A devastated mother has told how doctors sent her one-year-old son home with a leaflet after failing to diagnose that he had suffered a stroke. Layton Morgan was discharged from hospital hours after his worried mother Jodie, 26, rushed him to A&E when the left side of his body went limp. His face dropped suddenly and he appeared to lose the use of his arm on September 7 this year. Layton Morgan, one, was rushed to Alder Hey Children's Hospital by his mother, Jodie, 26, when the left side of his body went limp and half of his face started to droop . Jodie and husband Shaun, 29, sped to the emergency department at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, Liverpool, where she explained Layton’s symptoms to a doctor. But despite her telling staff her son looked ‘like a stroke victim’, Mrs Morgan was assured a number of factors could have been responsible and was sent home with a leaflet on head injuries. After Layton continued to exhibit unusual behaviour and struggled to use his left arm, Mrs Morgan went back to hospital on September 12 and begged doctors for a second opinion. A series of tests confirmed Mrs Morgan’s worst fears and doctors told her Layton had in fact suffered a stroke. The mother-of-one has since been told it was most probably triggered by a bout of chickenpox Layton suffered in July. But even though research has previously shown a link between chickenpox and an increased risk of childhood strokes, Mrs Morgan said she was never asked if her son had suffered from the illness. A&E doctors at Alder Hey Hospital sent Layton home with a leaflet about head injuries despite his mother explaining that she feared he had suffered a stroke . Since the stroke Mrs Morgan said Layton can no longer speak and suffers mobility issues. He now undergoes weekly physiotherapy and speech therapy in the hope of restoring his ability to speak and move around normally. However, doctors have said Layton - who also has cystic fibrosis - may never recover fully from his ordeal. Mrs Morgan, an account manager, is now demanding to know why a doctor missed her son’s symptoms - leading to a delay in him receiving vital medication. She said: ‘On the day it happened I noticed he was dragging his arm and it was shaking when he tried to pick things up. When Layton was still struggling to move his left arm, Mrs Morgan took him to a GP who referred him to a specialist. The specialist carried out tests which revealed he had had a stroke . ‘Then he just stopped and looked at me and the left side of his face dropped - it looked like he was smirking but not in a natural way. ‘We sped up to Alder Hey and we saw an A&E doctor but they made us feel as though we were over reacting, like we were wasting our time. ‘I just said to them he looked like he’d had a stroke from the way his face dropped. ‘But they said it could be a number of factors and just gave me a leaflet on head injuries. Mr and Mrs Morgan believe the stroke could have been brought on by a bout of chickenpox that Layton suffered two months earlier . Even though research has previously shown a link between chickenpox and an increased risk of childhood strokes, Mrs Morgan said she was never asked if her son had suffered from the illness . ‘We got home and we were trying to get Layton to use his arm but when we handed him a toy he would just cry with frustration, he couldn’t reach out, so we knew something wasn’t right. ‘After it didn’t improve we went to our GP who referred us to a specialist. ‘The neurologist ordered lots of different tests including CT and MRI scans. ‘Later on she asked us to go into a private room and that’s when we knew it was bad news. ‘When she told us he’d had a stroke I got a bit angry, I asked how the doctor could have missed it. Layton, who also has cystic fibrosis, is now unable to speak and is still struggling to use his left arm. He is having physiotherapy and speech therapy but doctors are not sure he will ever fully recover . ‘I do feel like if I, as a person with no medical training, could spot the symptoms of a stroke then a doctor should have investigated it.’ Mrs Morgan said Layton, who could form basic words before the stroke, now struggles to speak at all. She added: ‘Part of the right side of his brain was starved of oxygen and died, he won’t ever get that back. ‘He’s seeing a speech therapist but I’ve noticed he can’t say little words like “papa” that he was starting to say before. ‘He struggles to get around sometimes because of his arm. Mrs Morgan said: 'Part of the right side of his brain was starved of oxygen and died, he won't ever get that back' ‘It’s like having a newborn again in some ways, it’s like starting from scratch. ‘He is on so much medication already and now he has to take more to thin his blood because doctors don’t know whether it will happen again. ‘He still seems happy in himself but it’s terrifying for me and my husband. ‘We literally sit and watch him constantly because we’re scared of it happening again. Layton now has to take blood thinning medication to prevent another stroke. He also takes medication for his cystic fibrosis. Picture shows all of the medication he has to take every day . ‘Even the slightest little thing now we think “is he having another stroke?”’ Mr and Mrs Morgan are now seeking legal advice and have submitted a formal complaint to the NHS Trust in charge of the hospital. Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust has launched an investigation into the case. A spokeswoman said: ‘We can confirm that we have received a complaint from the family concerned. Alder Hey Hospital says it has launched an investigation to establish what happened . ‘Alder Hey takes all complaints extremely seriously and the Trust is undertaking a full investigation into the allegations made. ‘We are continuing to liaise with the mother of this child and will formally respond to her once the investigation is completed.’ Alder Hey Hospital was hit by a scandal in 1999 after it emerged organs from hundreds of dead babies had been retained without permission. A stroke is a sudden disruption of the blood supply to the brain. It affects neurological functions such as movement and speech. There are two major types of stroke - ischaemic strokes which are caused by a blockage which prevents blood reaching an area of the brain, and haemorrhagic strokes which are caused by blood leaking from blood vessels into the brain. Both cause damage to brain cells. Every year about five out of every 100,000 children have a stroke. About half of these children have an underlying medical condition, such as a heart problem, which increases their risk of having a stroke. The other half are healthy before the stroke. One of the most common causes of strokes in these children is narrowing of the blood vessels in the head as a result of the chickenpox virus. This is a rare complication of chickenpox and it is not known why it happens. Symptoms include weakness down one side of the body, balance problems, slurred speech and a droop on one side of the face.

A former Labour Cabinet Minister broke ranks last night and disowned Tony Blair’s government for the ‘reckless’ NHS shake-up blamed for the Mid-Staffordshire hospitals scandal. Frank Dobson, Health Secretary from 1997-99, said he warned Mr Blair that a ‘mad rush’ to bring in more competition and targets in hospitals could harm patients. But Mr Blair ignored him and gave his Cabinet job to a crony who agreed to force through the changes. Mr Dobson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I told Blair that reckless changes could undermine patient care, but he didn’t want to listen.’ Mr Dobson criticised two of his Blairite successors as Health Secretary – Alan Milburn and Patricia Hewitt. He said: ‘They became obsessed with wanting to break up the NHS into individual units. ‘I made my views known to them but was ignored. They preferred to take the advice of management consultants to medical consultants. ‘Huge sums were diverted  away from nurses, doctors and patients to lawyers, accountants and PR men.’ Mr Dobson’s comments echo David Cameron’s claim that rather than NHS boss Sir David Nicholson, past Labour Health Secretaries should take the blame for the Mid-Staffs scandal in which hundreds of patients needlessly died. The Tories claim Labour has tried to save Sir David because many of his fateful decisions took place when the party was in power. An official report last month said  the desire of Mid-Staffs health chiefs to seek elite foundation status contributed to the scandal. Hundreds of patients died needlessly at the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust because of the poor standard of care . Protesters have been calling for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to resign in the wake of the Mid-Staffordshire hospitals scandal . Left-winger Mr Dobson was made Health Secretary when Tony Blair won power in 1997. He was forced out when Mr Blair appointed his close ally Mr Milburn to lead the drive towards foundation hospitals, with more competition and targets. Mr Dobson said: ‘When I became Health Secretary, a number of professors of medicine said to me, “For God’s sake, Frank, keep change to a minimum or you will distract us from looking after patients.” 'I never forgot their words. When people go to hospital they want to be in the hands of someone trained at a London medical school, not the London Business School. ‘Mid-Staffs was desperate to become a foundation hospital but only looked at the money aspect. Forcing hospitals to compete with one another is not a good idea.’ Both Mr Milburn and Ms Hewitt were unavailable for comment.","Warned against 'mad rush' for more competition and targets in hospitals .

Councils will be banned from using spy cameras to impose parking tickets under a crackdown on town halls that wage war against drivers. The plans will also see motorists get compensation for unfair fines. Ministers are to change the law to prevent local authorities using CCTV – intended to catch serious criminals – to boost their coffers by monitoring motorists who park in the wrong place. Councils will be banned from using spy cameras to impose parking tickets on motorists . Under the proposals unveiled today, those who have been targeted incorrectly and win an appeal will get double their money back – with compensation payments equal to the original fine. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles will also order a review of the spread of yellow lines amid complaints that parking restrictions in town centres have been imposed ‘over-zealously’ and are killing high street stores. The crackdown includes previously announced plans to extend the grace period for motorists before they get a parking ticket from five minutes to 15. Nine million parking fines are issued every year by town halls in England – even though there are only 19 million cars on the roads – and the scale of fines has soared to more than £1.3billion a year, double the amount when Labour came to power in 1997. Review: A traffic warden in action . Some 75 councils in England use static CCTV cameras and there are 102 cars equipped with spy cameras used for parking enforcement. Campaign group Big Brother Watch found 10.7 million fines have been issued over the past five years, costing motorists more than £300million. Councils in England are forecast to make £635million net profit from parking charges and parking fines this year, nearly 6 per cent up on 2012. Drivers appeal against 1.3 million parking tickets every year, with 660,000 winning, but parking adjudicators have no powers to award compensation for the hassle or distress if a council wrongly imposes a parking fine. Mr Pickles plans to change secondary legislation to give them the same powers as the Planning Inspectorate, which can award compensation when councils act unreasonably. ‘Compensation would act as a deterrent to councils,’ a senior  government source said. ‘The amount would be of a similar level to the fine.’ Mr Pickles and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will announce the changes at the Conservative Party conference, in a bid to show voters that the Tories are tackling the rising cost of living. Mr Pickles said: ‘The last Labour  government told councils to hammer hard-working people with higher parking charges and unfair parking fines. ‘We want to rein in these over-zealous and unfair rules on parking enforcement, so it focuses on supporting high streets and motorists, not raising money.’ One in three councils is earning more money from parking and service charges than council tax, a study has revealed. A . total of £10.2billion was made by local authorities by charging for . parking, school meals, funerals and other domestic services between 2011 . and 2012. The Audit . Commission said some councils are using the charges to boost their . income after the Coalition put a freeze on council tax rises. The . public spending watchdog revealed that ‘stealth tax’ charges for . services paid for a fifth of district councils’ spending. In London, . Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea and Wandsworth had incomes that . outstripped spending on equivalent domestic services. Woking Borough Council in Surrey made the most  from charges, using them to raise 87 per cent of its annual spending. Local . government minister Brandon Lewis said councils should not be . ‘hammering’ residents with stealth taxes, adding: ‘In particular, we . believe more should be done to protect residents from excessive parking . charges and unfair parking fines.’ He said parking spy cars were ‘a step too far’ adding: ‘Public confidence is strengthened in CCTV if it is used to tackle crime, not to raise money for council coffers.’ Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Arbitrary . parking rules force shoppers online or to out-of-town stores, causing . lasting damage to local firms and small shops.’ Residents . and businesses will be able to petition councils to start a review of . yellow lines, with a view to creating more short-term waiting bays, to . allow people to pop into local shops whilst avoiding all-day parking . charges. Tony Ball, of the Local Government . Association which represents councils, said: ‘Parking controls are not . about revenue raising, they  are absolutely essential for keeping the . roads clear and making sure people can park near their homes and local . shops. ‘Camera . cars have been instrumental in keeping children from being hurt or . killed … and CCTV plays an important role elsewhere in monitoring . traffic flow and keeping cars moving.'

Affectionately named ‘The Maggie Range’, the bag will be sold exclusively at the Conservative Party Conference. The £5 tote will be on sale until Wednesday October 2nd at a special pop-up shop dedicated to Baroness . Thatcher entitled ‘Maggie’s Shop’. The handbag featured on the tote, the Adagio, was one of Baroness Thatcher’s favourite top-handle handbags. Made . with immaculate craftsmanship, the handbag is still available on the . luxury brand's website from £1,100 as part of the Classics range. 'Working . with Launer captures an iconic part of Lady Thatcher's imagery' said . Scott Seaman-Digby, Commercial Director for the Conservative Party.

'It . has allowed us to faithfully recreate an item that as well as being a . bit of fun is a really great talking point for conference. 'We expect a rush on the tote bags as soon as we open at 9am and have already placed a reorder with suppliers'. Thatcher’s love of a . good handbag - frequently a Launer - became inextricably linked to her . political persona – particularly after her ministers in the 1980s coined . the phrase ‘handbagging’ - a reference . to both the structured  handbags she always carried and the dressing . downs she would give her team. Whilst Baroness . Thatcher embraced the gesture of a Launer handbag as a gift, she . insisted on always purchasing them herself, or through her shopper who . struck up a lasting friendship with Gerald. The Queen has long been a fan of Launer bags, awarding the company a Royal Warrant in 1981 and is often seen at public events clasping one of their creations . Baroness Thatcher would always send a letter of acknowledgement to Gerald whenever she purchased a Launer handbag. She would usually make two purchases . yearly throughout the 80s and 90s, all in a very, simple structured . style in black or nude tones. Baroness .

It was taken to a medical examiner's office, where it was later identified as that of 63-year-old Sang Ho Kim of Queens, according to Inspector Kenneth Lack of the Nassau County police department. Nassau County police said it appeared Kim had been embroiled in a business dispute with officials at Savenergy, a light fixture import firm, when he walked into the company's Garden City office last Wednesday morning and opened fire. 'There was some disgruntlement between him and the company he was attacking,' Nassau County Police Chief Steven Skrynecki said last week. An employee, 25-year-old Zachariah Yong Jae Shin, was killed, and the company's chief executive, John Choi, was wounded. Because the shooting happened near the Roosevelt Field mall, businesses and schools in the area went into a temporary lockdown for hours. Some shoppers later said they had fleeting fears that it might have been a replay of the terrorist attack that occurred at a mall in Kenya the preceding weekend. Police confirmed today that they had found a body floating in the Hudson River near a bridge north of New York City . The hunt for Kim later stretched from . Long Island to the northern New York City suburbs after his SUV was . located at a park in Cold Spring, N.Y., about 12 hours after the . shooting. Authorities employed dogs, helicopters and boats for several days in pursuit of the suspect through rough, mountainous terrain. His body was found about 10 miles south of Cold Spring. Police did not reveal further details . about the dispute Kim had with the company. Kim's sister told Newsday . last week that her brother had been cheated out of an undetermined . amount of money; the sister later said Kim had called her after the . shooting, threatening suicide.

Margaret Thatcher has been hailed by Conservatives as Britain’s greatest peacetime Prime Minister. So it seems a little odd that the Tories are paying tribute to the Iron Lady by selling off an extraordinary array of tat, including mugs, baby grows and tea towels. The bizarre collection of Tory-branded goods went on sale at the party’s conference in Manchester, ahead of an official tribute to the late leader as part of what has been dubbed ‘Thatcher Day’. Tribute: Iron Baby baby grows are on sale at the Our Maggie shop during the Tory party conference in Manchester . Baroness Thatcher died in April at the age of 87, sparking a wave of tributes from senior Conservatives. A 10-minute tribute to the former Prime Minister opened the conference today, followed by a speech from party chairman Grant Shapps drawing heavily on her upbringing as the daughter of a grocer. But outside the conference hall the spirit of enterprise is alive and well, with the Iron Lady’s image, name and slogans used to sell a wide range of memorabilia. It includes an ‘Iron Baby’ baby grow costing £15, a £8 bib and t-shirts costing £12 featuring the words: ‘The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of people’s money. There is also a £7 tea towel with the slogan: ‘You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it.’ However a £25 ironing board cover paying homage to the Iron Lady was mysteriously withdrawn from sale. Memorabilia: Helen Hopkinson displays a Little Iron Lady bib on the Conservative party stand . Keys to power: These £4.50 key rings are on sale on the stand to Tory party members .

On . the weekend Baroness Thatcher's ashes were buried, Mr Cameron said the . former premier's greatest legacy had been to ‘save our country’. Delegates . all joined in a prolonged standing ovation at the end of the film which . touched on key Thatcherite policies of encouraging home ownership, . privatisation and the ""export of freedom"" in the choice to stand against . the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The Falklands war was also the focus of a major section of tributes. Baroness Thatcher died in April and received a Ceremonial Funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, attended by the Queen.

No bottler: The first day of the Conservative conference was dubbed Thatcher Day, with a 10-minute video paying tribute to the Iron Lady . Hard labour: Former Blair spin doctor . Alastair Campbell posed with a bottle of Maggie Beer, as part of his campaign against alcohol abuse . In the film, Mr Cameron said: ‘She was a conviction politician... she did not believe in accepting the consensus. ‘She was a great Conservative because she put Conservative principles into action. ‘She knew it was not enough to debate, to think, to talk - you need to act. ‘That's what she did - she reshaped Britain in a new Conservative mould... she saved our country, that is her true legacy.’ Featured in the film were Chancellor George Osborne, Baroness Thatcher's close friend Conor Burns MP and Conservative MP Priti Patel. Off the cuff: These £12 cufflinks use one of Baroness Thatcher's most famous slogans to raise a smile . No mug: There is almost no item which has not been branded by the Our Maggie shop, including these £7 mugs . Taking notes: Several Tory politicians have sought to echo Lady Thatcher during their speeches in the main conference hall . Lady Thatcher became MP for Finchley in 1959 and was Conservative prime minister between 1979 and 1990. Mr Shapps used his speech opening the conference to draw inspiration from Baroness Thatcher’s upbringing. He told delegates: ‘We’ve been busy making Britain the most attractive place to set up shop. Because make no mistake – it’s this party – once led by a grocer’s daughter – which is and always will be the party of small business.’ Mr Shapps said Baroness Thatcher . inspired him to set up his own print business. ‘I’ll never forget lying . awake at night worrying about paying the bills. ‘Or . going to the cinema with friends, only to find out later that I’d . missed the best bits of the film because I’d been so deep in thought . worrying about cash flow.

A powerful music mogul is going to court this week in what has become a long, drawn out divorce case. Jason Flom split from his wife Wendy in 2010, but they are continuing to fight over what cut she gets of his reported $100million net worth. The two had been married for 20 years.

In the past, he worked for Atlantic, Virgin and Capitol Records where he personally signed Katy Perry. The soon-to-be ex-Mrs Flom, a former Atlantic Records exec herself, is arguing that she was pivotal in starting Lava Records and wants exactly half of Mr Flom's assets. A source close to Mrs Flom told the New York Post: 'Wendy insists she was hugely influential in helping Jason's career and wants half of everything. She claims she helped him establish Lava Records in 2009. But Jason does not want to cut the check and pay her the settlement she is demanding. He is saying she had nothing to do with his company.

The Prince of Wales today wore his army fatigues to watch soldiers of the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland in action . As Prince William hangs up his uniform to spend more time with his family, Prince Charles today put his back on for a visit to the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Acting in his role as Royal Colonel of the regiment, the Prince watched soldiers compete in a falling plate competition before awarding a trophy to the winning team. The Prince, who has served in both the Navy and the Air Force, then met with soldiers of the 7th Battalion at Barry Buddon Training Centre in Carnoustie, Scotland. An Army spokesman said: 'When a Royal Colonel visits a unit it's always very much appreciated that they wear their uniform, especially when the regiment is practising their skills out in the field. 'It's always good for Royal Colonels to see the soldiers in training.' It was just a drop-in visit though as the Prince then had to travel to Cardiff to lead the congregation at an emotional service for fallen police officers to mark National Police Memorial Day. Charles, patron of the event, attended the 10th annual service and joined a reception for families and colleagues of officers at St David's Hall in Cardiff in Wales. National Police Memorial Day is an annual remembrance event to honour all officers killed in the line of duty since modern policing began in 1792. A mounted police honour guard greeted Charles when he arrived in Cardiff, along with members of the public who had gathered around the hall. Charles, accompanied by the Lord Lieutenant Dr Peter Beck and Chief Constable Peter Vaughan of South Wales Police, then attended the memorial service in the Concert Hall. The service was also attended by representatives from the Home Offices of all four UK countries, including Home Secretary Theresa May and First Minister Carwyn Jones, who both delivered readings. Among those remembered was Metropolitan Police officer Pc Andrew Duncan, 47, who was killed in a suspected hit-and-run collision last week. Greater Manchester Police Constables Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, brutally murdered in a gun and grenade attack last September, were also honoured. Meet and greet: Prince Charles watched soldiers take part in a shooting competition before meeting them at Barry Buddon Training Centre in Carnoustie, Scotland . Honour: The Prince of Wales is the Royal  Colonel of the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland . Winners: Charles awarded D Company with the Falling Plates shooting trophy. Pictured from left to right are Pvt David Reid, Lc Cpl Charlie Urquhart, Pvt Paul Gess and Pvt Michael McInally . In a statement, Charles said: 'The tragic deaths of Ian Dibell, Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone last year have reinforced just how dangerous the Police Service can be. 'Our courageous policemen and women routinely endure hazardous environments in order to defend us and protect all our freedoms. 'But there is nothing routine about the courage they display. 'Indeed, to all those who keep us safe, and to their families, we owe a debt of gratitude that we can never repay. 'They will never be forgotten and their proud legacy inspires us and will always live on.' During the service Ms Hughes' stepmother, Natalie Hughes, read a prayer. Sgt Joe Holness, founder of the National Police Memorial Day, said it was 'crucial' for Charles to mark the day with bereaved colleagues and family. Busy day: The Prince of Wales also attended the National Police Memorial Day at St David's Hall in Cardiff today as he is patron of the event . Tribute: Prince Charles meets Sergeant Joe Holness, right, Founder of the Memorial Day which honours the memory of fallen police officers . He said: 'It is significant that the Prince of Wales overturned a moratorium in 2000 which was placed there after the Queen Mother died, meaning he was banned from taking on any other organisations as a patron. 'In 2006 I made an approach to him and he agreed to be patron because of the unique service the police provides. 'I think the fact that the nation is stopping and remembering the commitment of the fallen officers means a great deal to their families, friends and colleagues. 'It doesn't bring back the officers they have lost but it gives some small comfort and recognition of what that family has given."" Sgt Holness said around 4,000 police officers had given their lives in the line of duty since modern policing records began in 1792. 'There are between ten and 15 fallen officers every year,' he said. 'It is not too much to ask for one day a year to be set aside to remember their commitment to the public.' In the line of duty: Prince Charles meets Nicola McDonald, pictured left, who is the sister of Constable Phillipa Reynolds who was killed when a 4x4 hit her patrol car . Somber: The Prince of Wales sits with Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, left, and the Lord Lieutenant of South Glamorgan Dr Peter Beck, right, during National Police Memorial Day . Charles became Patron of the National Police Memorial Day in 2006 and last attended the annual memorial service in Glasgow in Scotland in 2011. Sgt Holness, a serving officer with Kent Police, initiated plans for the Memorial Day in May 2001, following the brutal death of colleague Constable Jon Odell. Pc Odell was killed when he was struck by a car in Margate in December 2000. The inaugural Memorial Day was held at St Paul's Cathedral on Sunday October 3 2004. Services have since been held across the UK each year, on the nearest Sunday to Saint Michael's Day, the patron saint of police. The service was last held in Cardiff in 2009. Steve Williams, Chairman, Police Federation of England and Wales, said it was important to recognise the sacrifice made by officers. Mr Williams said: 'Policing can sometimes be very dangerous. When people go to work you expect them to come home at the end of the day. Sometimes in the policing world, this is not the case. 'It is right that the public are reminded of the dedication to duty. 'I am so proud to be here today, as a Welshman. It is being held in Wales, we have the Prince of Wales here - it means a great deal.'

The Dowager Countess of Grantham’s contempt for anyone ‘in trade’ clearly isn’t shared by the real-life bosses of Downton Abbey, who are releasing a huge range of products to tap into a £100 million demand for merchandise . Tie-in products as diverse as jewellery, board games, Christmas decorations, wines, playing cards and roses are set to be sold in high street stores. John Lewis will begin stocking 37 items of Downton Abbey jewellery next week, including silver Edwardian Fleur drop earrings and a gold Belle Epoch scallop collar necklace. Highclere's accessories: A £25 gold tone crystal Edwardian-style necklace, inspired by one worn by Lady Edith, pictured right, and part of the range of Downton jewellery that will go on sale at John Lewis from next week . Meanwhile, Marks & Spencer hopes to cash in on Downton’s success with a range of beauty products emblazoned with quotes from the show, such as a soap with the slogan ‘I’d expect no less’ and a lipstick with the line: ‘Now stop talking and kiss me before I get cross.’ Downton’s leading ladies have also inspired a range of fabrics which will be on sale in independent retailers from next month. The burgundy and blue Lady Mary fabric are said to reflect her ‘strength and style’, while those inspired by Lady Edith have an Art Deco design to echo her love of  the unconventional. Fans can also buy the official Downton Abbey calendar, which is available at WH Smith, and two different jigsaws on sale at John Lewis. But these items are just the tip of the iceberg because the show’s producers, Carnival Films, have hired marketing firm Metrostar to exploit the Downton Abbey brand with products including tableware, bed linen and silverware.

Diane O'Meara, 23, was unknowingly used as the face of Lennay Kekua for months as the Notre Dame football star told and re-told the story about how he excelled on the field despite the personal tragedy of Kekua's death. Pictures that Miss O'Meara had posted on Facebook and Instagram were used in the elaborate hoax, which she says is a case of identity theft. Scroll down for video . Shock: Diane O'Meara could not believe it when she found out she was the face of Lennay Kekua . Apology: While Tuiasosopo has since called her and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better. Duped: Miss O'Meara says she's never met Manti Te'o, never spoken with him and has never exchanged words or tweets with him . She says the images were used to create . the Lennay Kekua online persona by alleged mastermind Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, an . aspiring musician and son of a California pastor. In an interview with NBC News airing today, Miss O'Meara said: 'I've never met Manti Te'o in my entire life. I’ve never spoken with him. I've never exchanged words, tweets.' She added: 'It's very bizarre and it's a very twisted and confusing scenario.' It wasn't until she was contacted by a Deadspin.com reporter investigating Kekua that she found out the truth. She told NBC News: 'In the past five years, [Tuiasosopo has] literally been stalking my facebook and stealing my photos.' While Tuiasosopo has since called her and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better. Mistaken identity: Miss O'Meara says that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo 'stalked' her Facebook for years and stole her photos to post under Kekua's name . Going public: Miss O'Meara calls the scandal 'twisted and confusing' Fake and original: The picture used by the hoaxers as the face of Lennay Kekua, left, was taken from this original photograph of Diane O'Meara, 23, a marketing executive living in Los Angeles .

She told the network: 'Ronaiah . has called and I know he has confessed but he has also apologized. But I . don't think there’s anything he can say to me that would fix this.' In another twist, O’Meara was drawn into the scam despite saying she has 'strong experience' with Internet advertising and is professionally competent with social media. That somebody whose job involves such work on the Internet could be so completely duped illustrates the chilling ease with which the entire scam has been carried out. Speaking to the New York Post last week, O'Meara's relatives told of their horror at what had happened. Olga Volkov said that O’Meara was a 'good person' from a 'good family.' Innocent: Diane was apparently unsuspecting of the scam - and was 'shocked' to find her face as that of Lennay . Inspiration: Te'o used the memory of Lennay Kekua to drove him to victory and create a myth that captivated the nation but any role he may have had in the hoax is now questioned . Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend won his a groundswell of public support last September as Notre Dame was heading into crunch games for the BCS championships. Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away. Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: ‘Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.' Next to the quote was O'Meara's picture. When Deadspin contacted O’Meara she said: 'That picture is a picture of me from my Facebook account.' All the other photos used on Kekua's . Twitter account came from the private Facebook and Instagram accounts . belonging to O'Meara, apart from one, which she unwittingly sent to . former high-school classmate Tuiasosopo. Shocked: Friends of O'Meara say she only found out yesterday she was the most famous woman in America right now .

Not the dashing and dishy lawyer, hero of the Bridget Jones novels and the Hollywood films that followed? He was the ultimate knight in shining armour — well, a cashmere coat and white shirt at least — the devoted hunk who rescues calamitous Bridget from myriad scrapes and japes, but most of all from herself. Surely he cannot be dead and gone, ceased to be, expired and gone to meet his maker? Dishy even in that jumper: Colin Firth as Mark Darcy . Well, I am afraid so. In Mad About The Boy, the brand new volume of Bridget Jones’s fictional diaries, author Helen Fielding reveals the terrible news. She has killed off her hero, stabbed him right between the pages without a second thought. After all those years, after the regrettable but gluttonous consumption of too many calories, alcohol units and toxic bachelors, there was almost a happy ending for Bridget. Following Darcy’s proposal at the end of the last book, The Edge Of Reason, we learn that the couple did go on to marry and have two children. Then tragedy struck. Marky has met his maker. Extracts published in a Sunday newspaper reveal that Mad About The Boy begins five years after Darcy has died. We are reintroduced to Bridget as a  51-year-old widow (‘35 if anyone asks’), a mother to little Mabel and nit-infested Billy. Surprisingly, she appears to have overcome the mortal blow of her husband’s death — on the surface, at least. Bridget Jones -The Edge of Reason from 2004: Renee Zellweger with Hugh Grant, left, as 'the despicable Daniel Cleaver' and Colin Firth who plays Mark Darcy . The contemporary Bridget is a foxy yummy mummy, immersed in an affair with a 29-year-old toyboy called Roxster. In one passage, Bridget gets lost in a moment of private reverie, recalling things she and Roxster did in the bathroom when her kids were asleep. I’m not giving anything away here when I reveal that it wasn’t synchronised tooth flossing. More alarmingly, the new Bridget is also obsessed with social media, more likely to be found counting Twitter followers than calories. How apt then that appalled Bridget Jones fans took to Twitter in their thousands over the weekend, tweeting in uproar when the demise of Darcy was revealed in The Sunday Times. Their responses sparked across cyberspace like angry firecrackers. ‘I refuse to believe it’. ‘My whole world has just fallen apart.’ ‘Not OKAY.’ ‘Am devastated. Why, Helen Fielding? Why???’ ‘Mark Darcy is dead. Bridget Jones is a widow!! This is all too much!’ These were just some of the reactions as the news clattered across the world. It led TV news bulletins, it was discussed on chat boards, it landed with a crash on newspaper websites. Readers and fans won’t know the cause of Darcy’s death, apparently buried deep in a flashback many chapters later, until the book is published next month. Until then, those who have become so upset by the news that the non-existent husband of a fictional character has been killed off will somehow have to contain their grief. Why should the death of Darcy cause such a reaction? To understand, we have to turn the clock back to remember the crazy days when Bridget first burst onto the scene, an everywoman for single girls; the patron saint of drunken wallflowers whose careers were going nowhere fast. Back in the mid-Nineties — shatteringly, it seems just like yesterday — Helen Fielding’s newspaper column Bridget Jones’s Diary first charted the life of a 30-something singleton trying to make her way in London. Bridget quickly became one of the most beloved characters in modern literature. With every unit of alcohol and cigarette consumed, Fielding practically invented chick lit. No one before or since did it so well or so wittily. In Mad About The Boy, the brand new volume of Bridget Jones's fictional diaries, author Helen Fielding reveals the terrible news... The first book came out in 1996 and went on to become a smash, eventually voted one of the top ten novels that defined the 20th century — along with 1984 by George Orwell and Anne Frank’s Diary Of A Young Girl. Published in 40 countries, it sold more than 15 million copies worldwide, and spawned a best-selling sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason. The two books were each turned into major films starring Renée Zellweger as Bridget, Colin Firth as Darcy and Hugh Grant as the despicable Daniel Cleaver. Bridget’s appeal stretched across continents; her singular, hilarious voice was a comfort to the lonely and the lovelorn. And her relationship with Mark Darcy really mattered — it was the beating heart of the story. After all, he was the ultimate chick-lit romantic hero; tall, dark-haired, handsome, rich, clever, kindly and divorced by a Cruel First Wife, who left him emotionally bruised and Unable To Trust. Only carefree, silly Bridget could make him happy again — and it was thrilling when he finally proposed. For millions of readers, if the world’s most famously socially dysfunctional singleton could find happiness at the end of the rainbow of dating and disasters, there was hope for us all. And now this? No wonder they are so upset. Of course, author Helen Fielding has always claimed that her character Bridget Jones is not autobiographical. However, it is telling that Fielding wrote the first books when she was a singleton herself. And now, just like Bridget, she is a single mother of two. There are other worrying signs. In the new book, Bridget still seems to be bumbling around in a disorganised mess, like a teen who won’t tidy her bedroom or her thoughts. Despite bereavement and motherhood, nothing fundamental seems to have changed in the pulsing, boy-mad walnut of her brain. She is obsessed with her toy-boy lover and with texting and tweeting. She admonishes herself for ‘lying in bed thinking erotic thoughts’ and wanting to give the other mothers ‘the V sign’ at the school gates. Oh, stop it! She also obsesses about ageing, as do the characters around her. This is supposed to be the voice of a middle-aged widow and mother of two? Most women, I think, would accept that they are not the same person they were at 30 as they are at 50. Life has a way of buffering emotions, smoothing out some, sharpening others. What was so important 20 years ago seems almost irrelevant now. Terrific: Bridget Jones was self-obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people. It captured what it was like to be young, free and single, trying to make your mark on the world . That was what was so terrific about the younger Bridget. She was self-obsessed and silly and preoccupied about how she looked and the effect she was having on other people. It captured what it was like to be young, free and single, trying to make your mark on the world. Yet surely one has to move on? From the glimpses we have seen so far, Bridget is a cheese who has plunged through the maturation process without touching the sides. She is still a ditz who cannot work the remote control of her television or stop herself from eating three big Macs a week, she continues to blunder around as if she fell out of Café Rouge half an hour ago. Emotionally, mentally and physically, Bridget has failed to move on. Today, she is an analogue woman in a digital age, struggling to keep up with the kids. She is growing old disgracefully — should we cheer or weep? Fielding’s publishers have said that the new book would ‘give a voice to the more mature social media-obsessed concerns of the women who grew up with Bridget’. Well, it might be true for a smattering of North London yum-mums, but I wonder how much resonance it will have elsewhere? Can we even be bothered with her angst any more? Perhaps in some respects, Mark Darcy had to die. In so many ways, he was like Bridget’s parent; always getting her out of trouble, kissing it better, giving her advice and loving her unconditionally. If Mark was there, he would be telling her to grow up. And if she grew up, she wouldn’t be Bridget.","At the end of the last book, The Edge Of Reason, we learn that the couple did go on to marry and have two children .

Disgruntled: Barry Norman claims to have seen more than 12,000 films - and today's don't match up . He claims to have seen more than 12,000 movies in his lifetime as a film critic. But yesterday Barry Norman branded films today ‘special effect ideas’ not stories. The 80-year-old criticised the film industry claiming they made films for people with the attention span of ‘fruit flies’. Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival today Mr Norman told how great films require ‘great plots’ but that too many today fall into the trap of ‘crash, bang, wallop effects.’ He said summer blockbusters in particular often used expensive effects for action scenes which end up amounting to nothing put great explosions of short lived excitement. Mr Norman said: ‘Too many films are made for a generation with the attention span of fruit flies. ‘I heard a depressing fact that films today are made for the 15 year-old to 18 year-old audience, who are there for the quick thrill and the fast affects. ‘You see them emerge from the cinema unengaged dragging their arms - I joke - but they aren’t charged up. They have had a short lived burst of excitement. ‘You can’t make a film on an idea you need a great story but sadly a lot of films today are made on special effects and the ‘crash, bang, wallop’ effect. ‘We are at an age where people go to the cinema and they want dialogue and that is a shame. ‘Often with these blockbuster films there is lots of shooting, lots of effects, lots of car chases and explosions and not very much substance.’ Mr Norman, a former Fleet Street journalist, began presenting the BBC programme Film in 1972. In 1988 he accepted a job offer with BSkyB where he remained for three years. Discussing his memoir novel about his late wife Diana Narracott at the festival Mr Norman joked about their early years of marriage. The former gossip columnist met his journalist wife when they were both reporting on Moscow State Circus in 1956 visiting London. The pair were married within the first year of dating. Simplistic: The recent Diana film, starring Naomi Watts, has been panned as 'safe' and 'simplistic' Ticket-sellers: Box office hit action films like White House Down are the lifeblood of Hollywood these days . He said: ‘Now-a-days people meet each other, move in together and sort of get on with it. Back in my day it was all much more formal than that. ‘So when we moved in together after getting married I’m not sure we really liked each other. We definitely weren’t happy for the first year, the first two years for her. ‘We had to get used to living with each other before throwing in the towel... In some ways young people today have the right idea. The 80-year-old former Fleet Street journalist was speaking at Henley Literary Festival earlier today . ‘But I think the key to happy marriage is space. Diana loved her sailing and I loved my cricket. She would go off on boats and I would spend the day at Lords and we would tell each other everything in the evening. ‘Of course we were both writers we had a huge amount in common but having our own things kept it ticking over.’ Mr Norman was invited to speak at the festival following the launch of his book ‘See you in the Morning’ which tells the life story of his late wife who passed away two years ago.","The former Fleet Street journalist berated use of 'crash, bang, wallop effects'

She is sure to gain the support of her 19-year-old brother, who has always been vocal about the love he has for his family. He sees his mum as one of his best . friends – revealing that she is the person he goes to for advice on his . love life – and is so devoted to 22-year-old Gemma, he had her name . tattooed in Hebrew on his left shoulder last year.

After Gemma graduated from Sheffield University with a first-class degree in July, Harry flew her to Las Vegas to join the band on tour in America for a month. Despite Harry’s whirlwind schedule, the pair still found time to enjoy some quality time together. While in Boulder, Colorado, they posted photos on social-networking sites of them riding bikes around the city, with Harry tweeting: ‘Just rode a bicycle round town . . . got frozen yoghurt and rode back. Nice night.’ Adding a picture of Gemma on her bike to his Twitter photos, Harry joked: ‘You’re supposed to take your feet off the ground, donut.’ Gemma was also spotted at a One Direction concert at the O2 Arena in London, cheering on her brother performing alongside bandmates Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik, all 20, and Louis Tomlinson, 21.

But no matter what’s going on in his private life, he always seems to have time for Gemma, who has become part of the former X Factor star’s celebrity entourage. Earlier this month, she was spotted accompanying Harry for a drink with his close friend, radio DJ Nick Grimshaw as well as Kelly Osbourne and her fiance Matthew Mosshart. The close relationship of the siblings, who grew up together in Cheshire, has long been a source of jealousy among Harry’s loyal female fans, with the pair often tweeting each other light-heartedly when Harry’s schedule forces them apart. In one tweet to her brother – one of the biggest heart-throbs of his generation – the young Miss Styles said last year: ‘Can’t open a magazine without seeing your ugly mug.’ While Harry has previously credited his older sister with keeping him grounded as his band was propelled to stardom, Gemma has always stood by him, describing him as ‘very thoughtful and caring’. One Direction’s popularity looks set to continue after the band announced a new record deal worth an estimated £10 million with Simon Cowell’s label Syco.

Popes John Paul II and John XXIII will be declared saints on April 27 next year, Pope Francis has decided during a meeting with cardinals. Francis had announced in July he would canonise two of the 20th century's most influential popes together, approving a miracle attributed to John Paul's intercession and bending Vatican rules by deciding that John XXIII did not need one. Analysts have said the decision to canonise them together was aimed at unifying the church, since each pope has his admirers and critics. Francis is clearly a fan of both. To be declared saints: On April 27 next year, Popes John Paul II (right) and John XXIII (left) - two of the 20th century's most influential popes - will be canonised . Fan of both: Pope Francis prayed at both the popes' tombs on the anniversary of John Paul's death, indicating that he holds a personal and spirituality connection to them . On the anniversary of John Paul's death this year, Francis prayed at the tombs of both men – an indication that he sees a great personal and spiritual continuity in them. Both popes are also closely identified with the Second Vatican Council, the 1962-65 meetings that brought the Catholic Church into modern times, an indication that Francis clearly wants to make a statement about the council's role in shaping the church today. A spokesman for Poland's bishops' conference said the dual canonisations would stress the fact that John Paul II continued the ideas introduced by John XXIII. Following in their footsteps: Pope Francis (pictured in St Peter's Square for his inauguration mass) is making a clear statement about the council's role in shaping the church . Originally, the canonisation was . expected to have taken place December 8 but Polish bishops complained . that would make it difficult for Polish pilgrims to come to the Vatican . by bus along snowy, icy roads. As a result, the first Sunday after Easter was chosen instead - a feast day established by John Paul.

John Paul made Jorge Mario Bergoglio - the current Pope Francis - a cardinal. Francis' immense popular appeal has also been likened to that of John XXIII, dubbed the ‘good pope’.

Timothy Porter has been jailed for 18 months for degrading a woman who he put under his trance, telling her he was her master and she was his sex slave . A self-taught hypnotist has been jailed for degrading a woman who he put under his trance, telling her he was her master and she was his sex slave. Instead of using hypnotherapy to help his vulnerable victim with weight-loss and anxiety issues, ex-RAF man Timothy Porter made the woman touch her breasts while he committed a sex act on himself. The grandfather, who had an unblemished record in the services spanning 24 years, has now been jailed for 18 months at Teesside Crown Court. The 40-year-old had previously pleaded guilty to causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent. Jonathan Walker, prosecuting, said Porter, who served at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire until the end of 2012, learned hypnosis and offered to carry out hypnotherapy on the married mother, whose identity cannot be reported. After a series of sessions, Porter turned up at her home on the night of December 2 last year when her husband was away. Despite her reservations, Porter offered to hypnotise her more deeply than before and the pair sat on a sofa. 'He kept saying, ""No mind, no will of your own"",' Mr Walker said. She became frightened but the session continued. Mr Walker said: 'The defendant stated he was her master, she was his sexual slave.' The amateur hypnotist then persuaded her to expose and touch her breasts while he performed a sex act on himself. She was roused from the hypnosis and went to the kitchen, the court heard, and Porter tried to restart the session, without success. Instead, his upset victim rang a friend, police were called and he was arrested. Mr Walker said: 'His account was that he believed she was consenting to his actions during the course of this incident. 'He agreed the incident had escalated and he misread the situation.' Mr Walker said the victim was deeply upset. Porter had previously pleaded guilty to causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent . 'It has had a profound effect on her sleeping pattern and her general health,' he said. She had declined Porter’s offer on previous occasions to use hypnotherapy to achieve more intense orgasms. Jon Gregg, defending, said: 'Sad it is to see a man who has served his country proudly for so many years in so many active operations in the dock at a crown court staring down the barrel of a custodial sentence.' Recorder Tim Gittins said the defendant was of good character, adding: 'You worked for Queen and country and undertook a number of arduous tours abroad.' Porter was jailed for 18 months, placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and banned from contacting his victim and from acting as a hypnotist for 10 years at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) He continued: 'Regrettably one of your recent hobbies or interests in recent years is to be engaged in an amateur way in hypnotherapy and hypnotism. 'You have had no formal training and it is of concern that you engaged in such activity with a number of females without learning anything of the dangers or restrictions.' Porter was jailed for 18 months, placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and banned from contacting his victim and from acting as a hypnotist for 10 years.","Timothy Porter learned hypnosis and offered to carry out hypnotherapy .

Concern was growing today for hunger-striking Pussy Riot dancer Nadia Tolokonnikova in her bleak Russian jail after her husband and lawyers were refused access because her health is 'so bad'. The 23 year old anti-Vladimir Putin campaigner is being administered medicine through an intravenous drip but is refusing all food. She is staging the protest over alleged death threats and 'slave labour conditions' at her grim Mordovian penal colony where she is now in the prison hospital eight days into a hunger strike. Hunger strike: Nadia Tolokonnikova, pictured in the dock during her trial, is refusing to eat food until she is moved to another jail . The singer and political campaigner is half way through a two year sentence for a protest song against Kremlin strongman Putin in a Moscow cathedral last year. The chief doctor 'officially told me that he was refusing me a meeting with Nadia,' said her husband Pyotr Verzilov, who said she was also incommunicado from her lawyers. 'They explained it by the fact that her state of health is so bad that she cannot speak with her defence,' he said. He complained of a 'full-scale blockade' against her. She vows to refuse food until she is moved to another jail. 'We have no idea what things can be happening to her now,' said Verzilov. Her lawyers have had no answer to demands to access to her, saying they fear 'psychological or other pressure'. The prison camps in Mordovia are remnants of Stalin's gulag labour camps. Jailed: Nadia Tolokonnikova, right, sits alongside fellow Pussy Riot members Yekaterina Samutsevich, left, and Maria Alekhina, center, in a court in Moscow, Russia, last year, before being sentenced to two years in prison . Pyotr Verzilov of Voina art group, husband of jailed Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, looks on as a petition for his wife's early release from custody is heard . Today, . one of her lawyers filed a complaint about the conditions at her prison . to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. 'The . situation in which Ms Tolokonnikova finds herself in the correctional . colony no. 14 in Mordovia, Russia constitutes one of the abhorrent . contemporary 'slave-like' practices,' lawyer Sergei Golubok wrote in . English. Tolokonnikova's open letter ignited a fresh debate about filthy jail conditions and prisoner abuse in Russia. Rights activists have for years sounded the alarm over prison conditions in modern Russia, but few complaints from female jails have previously been made public due to what activists describe as a culture of violence and intimidation. Several prominent figures called on the young mother to stop her protest. 'Unfortunately, . our society only reacts to extreme situations,' veteran rights activist . Lyudmila Alexeyeva said on Moscow Echo radio. Pressure: Supporters of Pussy Riot have attempted to apply pressure on the Russian government to release the jailed members . 'I would like to ask her to stop the hunger strike, she's achieved her goal.' In April, Tolokonnikova appeared before a court to argue for her prison sentence to be suspended or reduced. The labour camp where she has been held for more than a year argued against her release. It . said she was 'decisive, insensitive to ethics and conscience and . thinking only about herself' and also reports that she once failed to . greet a prison official during a hospital stay. One of the three Pussy Riot women jailed for hooliganism, Yekaterina Samutsevich, had her sentence suspended on appeal. Russia law does not make repentance a . condition for an early release but the court is supposed to take into . account the convict's behaviour in jail.
