"It is less than two months since she gave birth. But Chelsea Clinton's mommy tummy already appears to have vanished.

She emerged beaming, hand-in-hand with banker husband Marc Mezvinsky, to pick up her accolade for work on the Clinton Foundation at New York's Carnegie Hall, leaving little Charlotte at home. And according to Arianna Huffington, who attended the event, Chelsea revealed to her that she is 'still nursing and loving it!' The pair, who remained active and in the public eye until two days before the birth, have kept a relatively low profile in recent weeks, aside from attending Oscar De La Renta's high-profile funeral in New York last week. The day of her daughter's birth, she tweeted happily: 'Marc and and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.' One day later, she posted a photo of herself and her husband, an investment banker, beaming over their newborn daughter.

The couple, who married in July 2010, announced in April that they were expecting their first child. When Chelsea announced her pregnancy during a Clinton Foundation event devoted to empowering young women, she told guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' And tonight, her excitement was palpable.

"Predator: Stuart Hazell, Tia Sharp's murderer, looked up child pornography on his phone . Stuart Hazell was a pornography addict who downloaded sexually explicit pictures of children before he killed Tia Sharp and had relationships with both her mother and grandmother. The 37-year-old was particularly looking for images of girls who looked like Tia, it has been revealed and was caught with 'extensive pornography' on a memory card which he had tried to hide from police. He had also filmed the 12-year-old while she slept, and captured a video of her as she rubbed cream into her legs. This morning Hazell pleaded guilty to . Tia's murder, saying her family had 'suffered enough', after protesting . his innocence for months and initially pleading not guilty. When . her body was found in his attic after she had been missing for a week, . Hazell's DNA was on her clothes and Tia's blood was found on his belt, . leading the prosecution to accuse him of sexually assaulting her before . her death. Today, a . prosecutor told the court: 'We don't know and never will know exactly . what took place in that house that night, but it's clear that Mr Hazell . committed a significant sexual offence against her.' Hazell . first met Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell around 2003 or 2004, . when she was working as a barmaid at a pub in Merton, South London. He then had a relationship with her daughter Natalie Sharp, Tia's mother, but it lasted no more than a couple of weeks. Scroll down for video . Evidence: This image shows a blue memory card hidden by being stuffed inside the door of a cupboard in Hazell's home; the card turned out to contain child porn as well as video and photographs of Tia sleeping . Plea: Hazell in court today after pleading guilty to murder following weeks of denial . Shocking U-turn: Sobs and gasps could be heard in the public gallery as Hazell changed his plea to guilty . Hazell started seeing Ms Sharp in April 2007, and a month later moved into her house in New Addington. In Ms Bicknell's statement last week, she spoke of Tia's closeness to Hazell and her love for him. She said: 'When Tia went missing it didn't cross my mind that she could be dead. I always thought she was coming home. It didn't cross my mind that he would hurt her. 'He loved Tia, she idolised him. I love Stuart with all my heart, he was my world, but my grandchildren always came first.' Ms Bicknell said Hazell had shown no signs he couldn't be trusted around her. Around the time of Tia's death her killer took to Google to look up pornographic pictures of young girls, police discovered after searching his house following his arrest last August. Among the phrases searched for on Hazell's phone were 'naked little . girlies', 'underage photos' and 'young girl nudes', the court heard. He had also searched for terms like 'illegal underage incest pics', 'daddy daughter pictures' and 'little girls in glasses'. Victim: Tia was found dead at her grandmother's home in August last year after going missing for a week . Girlfriends: Hazell had previously dated both Tia's mother Natalie Sharp, right, and her grandmother Christine Bicknell, left . Hazell apparently sought out images of girls who looked especially like Tia, wearing glasses and having their hair in a ponytail. Last week prosecutor Andrew Edis QC . said: 'There are a number of professional-type pornographic photographs . with young teenage girls wearing glasses while performing sexual acts.' Hazell apparently acted out his fantasies by taking pictures of Tia. Police found 11 photographs and three video clips showing the girl sleeping on two memory cards hidden in his home. At least one of the cards had been stashed in the doorway of a cupboard. Police said they believed he had removed . the bathroom door so he could spy on the girl, and modified the light . socket in her room to create a 'spyhole'. Murder scene: The house belonging to Tia's grandmother where her body was found in the loft will now be bulldozed . Discovery: Pornographic images were found on two memory cards in Ms Bicknell's house, pictured . The most shocking image was taken after the schoolgirl's death, according to the prosecution. It showed Tia naked lying on a bed, and was captured a few hours after she died for Hazell's 'sexual excitement', prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said during the trial. He suffocated her and hid her body in Ms Bicknell's attic, then feigned ignorance for a week as the community rallied together to try and find her. Ms Sharp fled from the Old Bailey courtroom in tears when the footage of her daughter was shown to jurors. Hazell had also collected images of young girls being abused, and visited a site devoted to glorifying incest. Forensic analysis of his mobile phone records showed that he had been looking up child pornography via Google.","Stuart Hazell used Google to look up child pornography on his phone .

"Luis Suarez's four-month ban from football for biting Giorgio Chiellini has been upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, but the Barcelona star will be officially unveiled at the Nou Camp on Monday and will train with his new team on Friday morning. The decision means Suarez will be able to make his Barcelona debut on Monday in the Joan Gamper Trophy friendly against Liga MX side Leon at the Nou Camp if deemed fit enough. The Uruguayan forward was banned from all football activity on July 1 for the incident during the World Cup group stage match against Italy on June 24 in Natal. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Luis Suarez pushes photographer out the way as he leaves court' Controversy: Suarez was banned for biting Giorgio Chiellini (left) in a World Cup group stage match in June . Savage: Suarez dips his head to bite the Italian defender on June 24 in Natal, a game Uruguay won 1-0 . Wait: Suarez has not been officially unveiled in person as a Barcelona player since his £75million move . The 'football activity' aspect of the ban, apart from playing, has been removed, allowing Suarez to be formally unveiled, train, watch the team play and take part in other promotional activities and administrative matters. Suarez can: . - Train with Barcelona team . - Be officially unveiled by Barcelona . - Play non-official Barcelona games (including friendlies) - Play in Uruguay friendlies against Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia in September and October . - Attend games . - Take part in other promotional activities and administrative matters . Suarez can't: . - Play for Barcelona in competitive matches until October 26 . - Play for Uruguay in competitive fixtures for another eight games . CAS says FIFA's sanctions against Suarez are 'generally proportionate to the offence committed.' The 27-year-old will take part in a double training session with Barcelona on Thursday, at 09.30 and 18.30 local time. Suarez cannot play for Barcelona until October 26, where the Catalan giants take on Real Madrid in La Liga at the Bernabeu, and he remains banned for Uruguay's next eight competitive matches. However, the court's panel has ruled that the ban on any soccer-related activity is 'excessive.' The court said in a statement: 'The four-month suspension will apply to official matches only and no longer to other football-related activities (such as training, promotional activities and administrative matters).' Banning Suarez from training would have meant the ban 'would still have an impact on his activity after the end of the suspension,' the panel ruled. The ex-Liverpool star transferred to Barcelona for £75million after receiving the ban, but has since been unable to be unveiled or train with the team. The full details of the hearing will be released at a later date.

"Self pity: Child killer Stuart Hazell wrote letters complaining that he was crying himself to sleep in prison because of the 'nasty stuff' said about him . Child killer Stuart Hazell wrote a series of self-pitying letters from prison, complaining that he was bullied by other inmates and cried himself to sleep as he awaited trial. In the letters, written to a pen pal before he pleaded guilty to the murder of 12-year-old Tia Sharp, he complains that he cannot get counselling at Belmarsh maximum security jail in South East London. The 37-year-old, who was jailed for 38 years without parole last week, also proclaims his innocence in the mistake-littered letters and claimed to be a man with a gentle nature who would never hurt a woman. He wrote: 'I feel like I’m stuck in a bubble, it sounds soft but I even cry myself to sleep. 'Like I said when my cell door closed then I sit and cry, I won’t deny it, it truly hurts when people say nasty stuff about me, but if they knew me as me a bloke who would do anything for anyone it would paint a different picture.' His letters, published in the Sunday Mirror, also moan that the prison authorities could not offer him any psychiatric support as he was a remand prisoner, while counselling is only for sentenced prisoners - a situation he brands a 'joke'. Tia's body was found in the attic of the home in New Addington, South London that Hazell shared with Tia's biological grandmother Christine Bicknell, a week after the girl went missing in August last year. Hazell suffocated the 12-year-old during a sex attack after months of trawling vile internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept. Children’s charities demanded tighter . internet controls and detectives said his obsession with online child . porn ‘shaped his behaviour’. Victim: Tia Sharp, 12, was smothered by Hazell. He had previously looked for child porn and had filmed the girl as she slept . Hazell had insisted for nine months that Tia’s death was a ‘tragic accident’. The father of one claimed she slipped and broke her neck while he was babysitting her at the home he shared with Miss Bicknell. But in the letters he claims he would never have hurt a child or hit a woman, claiming he himself had suffered physical abuse as a child. He added: 'I . am a loveing, careing, generous bloke who would do anything for anyone . and I would go out of my way to help friends and family anyway I could.' Hazell initally claimed Tia's death was a tragic accident. He changed his plea to guilty during the trial . He also compares himself to Robert Stroud - the famous 'Birdman of Alcatraz' - after he befriended a pigeon outside his cell window. Stroud, a convicted killer, kept hundreds of canaries in his sell and even wrote books about them. He was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in a 1962 film. Hazell wrote: 'Strange how something so small can take my mind of the cayos (chaos) and madness and this last ten months have been full of cayos and madness believe me.' The letters also mention his love of football club Tottenham Hotspur, Wasps rugby club and TV shows Scrubs, Hollyoaks and How I Met Your Mother. Hazell’s criminal past included convictions for racially aggravated common assault in 2002, dealing cocaine in 2003 and possession of a machete in a public place in 2010, for which he was jailed for 12 months. Tia's Father Steven Carter punches the air as he leaves court after the sentence . He also has convictions for burglary and theft. Steve Carter, Tia's father, last week called for his daughter's killer to be hung. He said: ‘The four days of trial here were very hard to deal with, hearing the vile things Hazell did to Tia. 'He should serve his time and then be hung. ‘I do not see today’s events as justice for Tia, merely a legal conviction.’ Hazell also wrote to his father Keith from Belmarsh in August last year, saying he had made 'one mistake and my whole world has collapsed'. He told his father that he wishes he could 'turn back the clock' and that he was unable to eat or sleep in prison. The letter had two pictures of sad faces drawn on it and had two words written at the top: 'Forgive me'. Stuart Hazell's letter to his father . Guilty: Stuart Hazell . Dear Dad, . I . know I am probably the last person you want to hear from but everything . in papers ain't true, they twist and make their own s*** up. What . happened I will explain in time but put it this way, it was an accident . and I panicked. Stupid I know but for my stupidity I'm looking at 15 to . 18 years. I regret it every second of every day and there's nothing I can do about it. I think about taking my own life because if I don't someone will, that is a definite. I'm classed a Cat A prisoner, never thought this would ever happen. I hope you're not getting agro because of me, you know I'm not the bad person everyone's saying. I can't sleep can't eat I wish I could turn back the clock but I can't. I'm sorry to of lied to you all but I didn't know what to do. I understand if you rip this up and never want to know me again, I wouldn't blame you. Christine got arrested, she had nothing to do with this. I loved her with all my heart and sole. God . I hate myself. I should of gone about this a different way, told the . police everything. They're trying to say it was sexual but I promise you . it wasn't. It was an accident and I was a p**** to do what I done. If . I had the chance I would end it here and now, I got no money, no fags, . no hope. It's the Hazell curse and I only got myself to blame. And that will stick with me till my time comes which won't be long. I . just want you to know I love you all, I know Christine and family will . never forgive me, I know what's coming and I deserve it. I . want to ask you one favour and one favour only. Send me a little bit of . money in and I will never ask anything of you again, 1 mistake and my . whole world has collapsed. My own fault I know but don't listen to the papers, like everyone else. I will tell you in time. I love you all, no doubt you will hear I'm on Old Bailey soon. Tell Sarah and Marc and kids I'm sorry, and Mum Darren and family.

"FInal approval for the prisoner exchange that freed Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl was made by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, members of Congress learned on Monday from White House officials.

Last week, Hagel said the swap was a unanimous decision when speaking to the BBC. 'It was the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Director of National Intelligence, Attorney General,' he said. 'It was our judgement based on the information that we had that his life, his health were in peril,' Hagel also told the channel in defense of not giving Congress 30 days' notice of the plan. 'Can you imagine if we would have waited or taken the chance of leaks over a 30-day period?' Hagel said. Different story: Hagel earlier said the decision was made unanimously . Freed: Sgt.

"A luxury real estate agency has turned to drone technology to reel in top buyers for a $6.1 million Connecticut mansion. Halstead Property is one of a slew of high-end realtors who've begun using the remote controlled copters to capture the most captivating photos and video possible from inside and around America's finest homes. The five bedroom Greenwich, Connecticut estate is the most recent of some 200 homes Halstead has marketed using the technology. Scroll down for video... Marketing drones: This $6.1 million Georgian-style Connecticut mansion has gotten the drone treatment. Luxury real estate firm Halstead Properties uses the technology to take video that creates an experience more than simply an impression . 'We’re not selling $150,000 homes with this technology,' Matthew Leone, the director of web marketing for Halstead, told the New York Times. Instead, Halstead and firms like them are giving the most elite of potential buyers the red carpet treatment in an effort to entice them into cutting a check. The drones are set aloft with cameras in tow. They capture the interior and exterior of homes from angles impossible to reach with average cameras, but which give an experience when viewed online rather than just a glimmer of what the place is like. Calling in the drones: The camera-toting drones were used at the Greenwich, Connecticut home after it sat on the market a little longer than expected . Real estate envy: Halstead has created about 200 of the gorgeous real estate videos and one has even gained 500,000 views on its website . 'Multimillion-dollar homes demand Madison Avenue marketing and advertising, not Main Street,' Leone said. The Georgian-style Connecticut estate has five bedrooms, four wood-buring fireplaces, and heated pool and sits atop two majestic New England acres. The drone-produced video was taken in and around the mansion after it received a lot of interest, but no buyer, after hitting the market in October. Rather than be relegated to a one-dimensional slide show of what rooms look like, the video is a tour of how the home feels. Experiential: The drones allow real estate agents to create visual experiences of a home rather than just a series of pictures. Video of this Darien, Connecticut mansion--with its stunning seaside view and gorgeous swimming pool--has been viewed 500,000 times on the Halstead website . 'We¿re not selling $150,000 homes with this technology,' says Halstead's Matthew Leone. This Connecticut home listed for over $7 million . Another such video, of a $7.6 million home in nearby Darien, Connecticut, has been viewed an astonishing 500,000 time on the Halstead website. The use of drones has become the norm in the industry as their prices has gone down. What once would have been a production requiring professional camera crews and many thousands of dollars can now be done with a $500 drone. Halstead initially used the drones merely for still photos, but the improved technology and cost effectiveness have allowed them to start producing the slick videos. 'Multimillion-dollar homes demand Madison Avenue marketing and advertising, not Main Street,' said Leone . Inspired: The drones allow for wealthy potential buyers to truly experience the home from their computer screen .","Camera-toting remote-controlled drones are becoming a fixture in the marketing of high-end homes .

The Chillicothe Gazette reports Christopher Stiffler, a 34-year-old, father-of-two from Jackson, jumped over a bridge wall on U.S. 35 in Chillicothe following a series of crashes - here he is pictured with his wife, Sabrina . She continued: 'Our lives will never be the same, something will always be missing, and we will all hold the short time we had with you dearly. Gone too soon and loved so much. RIP our dear sweet Chris.' The Ohio State Highway Patrol says Stiffler had stopped his disabled car partially in the road around 6am Tuesday. Two other vehicles swerved to avoid Stiffler's car, but struck his vehicle as well as each other's. As an oncoming tractor-trailer approached the disabled vehicles and lost control, Stiffer jumped over the bridge to avoid being hit. Drop: The Ohio State Highway Patrol says Stiffler had stopped his disabled car partially in the road around 6am Tuesday - he later jumped over this bridge to avoid being hit by an oncoming tractor-trailer . Back-to-back crashes: Two other drivers involved in the run of crashes sustained minor injuries and were later released from hospital following treatment . The patrol reported Stiffler was taken to a hospital, where he died from injuries sustained from the 30-foot drop. James L. Ostrander, 54, of Jackson, who was behind the wheel of 1999 International tractor-trailer which veered towards Stiffler escaped unharmed. Two other drivers involved in the run of crashes sustained minor injuries and were later released from hospital following treatment. The incident remains under investigation.","Christopher Stiffler, 34, of Jackson jumped over a bridge wall on U.S. 35 in Chillicothe following a series of crashes .

"The Queen Mother warned against sending Prince Charles to boarding school in Scotland because she thought he would be miserable, a collection of previously unpublished letters reveal. She asked the Queen not to send the prince to Gordonstoun, in north Scotland, as he would feel ‘terribly cut off and lonely’. Charles’s grandmother said he should go to Eton instead, as not only was it much closer to home but also ‘staunchly Protestant’. Warning: The Queen mother advised against sending Prince Charles to Gordonstoun, as she thought he would be miserable, it has been revealed . But Prince Philip ruled that his eldest son would attend his old school – and Charles later described the multi-denominational school as ‘Colditz in kilts’. The Queen Mother’s letter of 1961 questioned the diverse religious ethos of Gordonstoun, which was founded by an experimental German-Jewish educator. She said: ‘It’s always a tricky one with the heir to the throne’, and going to Eton ‘would solve many difficulties, one being religion’. The correspondence is included in Counting One’s Blessings, a recently published selection of the late Queen Mother’s letters compiled by William Shawcross. The warning proved to be prescient as Charles hated the tough regime at the Scottish school, which included cold showers and morning runs all year round. In a letter home in 1963, he wrote: ‘The people in my dormitory are foul. Goodness, they are horrid. I don’t know how anybody could be so foul.’ Prince Charles and the Queen at Gordonstoun, in north Scotland, which he later described as 'Colditz in kilts'","Queen Mother warned against sending Charles to Scottish boarding school .

"A small rural primary school has organised a sleepover to London – so the children get a chance to see people who are not white. Payhembury Primary in Devon was criticised by Ofsted for being insufficiently ‘multicultural’. So the 68-pupil Church of England school is asking parents to pay for their children to make a two-day trip to a school with a wide mix of ethnic backgrounds. Idyllic: Payembury Primary School in Devon . The visit – described by one parent as patronising and bizarre – has been sold to parents as a way of boosting Payhembury’s Ofsted grade from good to the top rating of outstanding. The school they are visiting, Smallberry Green in Isleworth, West London – where three-quarters of the 410 pupils are from ethnic minorities – achieved the same good Ofsted rating. Explaining the motivation for the trip,  Payhembury headteacher Penny Hammett told parents in a letter: ‘The purpose of this trip is to build up a relationship with a school in a very different community to ours. 'This will enable our children to gain a better understanding of multicultural Britain, which was identified in our last Ofsted as being an area for development. ‘Through our topics, visitors and discussions we have been developing multicultural awareness in both Britain and throughout the world, but this visit will help us to experience in real life a school where there is a wide mix of children with different ethnic backgrounds and almost 50 per cent of the children do not have English as their first language.’ The letter also explains that four teachers will accompany the children on the two-day trip, which will involve pupils sleeping in the Isleworth school and using its catering facilities, for an estimated cost of £35. While in London, the Devon children will engage in outdoor activities and record a CD. Pupils from the school have written to their new pen-pals in London, some of whom will take part in a return visit to the school, near Honiton. Mrs Hammett’s letter invites parents to a meeting to discuss the trip. But yesterday one mother said: ‘I’m astounded by this idea. Just because the children go to a small school in the country does not mean they aren’t aware of people with different coloured skin to them. 'It’s very patronising  – and for the school they are visiting too.' Contrast: Students will visit Smallberry Green school in Isleworth, West London . ‘We are being asked to shell out £35 to try and boost their next Ofsted inspection. I think it’s a very cynical approach.’ However, another parent supported the initiative, saying: ‘I think it’s a nice idea. ‘We don’t live in an ethnically diverse area, so it’s good for the kids to meet children from other kinds of background.’ In Isleworth, student Usna Hakimi, 19, who was picking up her two sisters up from Smallberry Green, said: ‘They’ve just told me about the sleepover and they’re quite excited to meet other children from a different part of England. It’s good for them to learn about other cultures.’ Smallberry Green head Caroline Hodges said the trip was organised with Payhembury because it places emphasis on outdoor learning. ‘The children will not be doing any cultural activities when they are here,’ she said. The Rev Cate Edmonds, chairman of the governors at Payhembury, said: ‘We are fairly mono-cultural as an area in Devon and we don’t want children growing up thinking the whole world is full of trees and cows. This gives them an experience of urban living.’ Mrs Hammett said the trip, in which 29 pupils are taking part, was about providing an enriching experience for the children at both schools. ‘Devon is very quaint but our children don’t get to see the big wide world,’ she said. At Ofsted’s last visit in 2010, inspectors praised Payhembury as a ‘happy place’ but pointed out all the pupils were of ‘white British heritage’. Their report recommended ‘improving links with communities in contrasting parts of the UK and abroad’. Last night Ofsted said at that time inspectors were required to report on the contribution made by the school to community cohesion, a requirement removed in 2011.","Payhembury Primary in Devon was criticised for not being multicultural .

"They were separated at birth and adopted by two different families in the U.S. but seven-year-old twins Anna and Ella were reunited on Saturday. The twins' adopted parents had often remarked on how similar their girls were and when they realized the girls shared a birthday, the families started to wonder if they could be related. After agreeing to a DNA test over the summer, the girls' families discovered they were right, and the twins have since been reunited at Anna's North Carolina home. Bond: Ella and Anna were separated at birth but have now been reunited . 'It's a connection we can't give her. It's something we can never ever provide, and now we have one,' Ella's mother, Teresa Cuares, told Fox Carolina. At first the twins were shy when they were reunited at the weekend, but they soon developed a strong connection as they began playing. Neither of their adopted parents had been told that their daughters were twins. The Cuares family were told Ella had been left in a park and Anna's parents, the Kandls, were told she had been left on the doorstep of a hospital. The families met during the adoption process and stayed in touch through Facebook, where photos of their children, and them sharing the same birthday, made them suspect they were related. 'I'll look at Ella, and I can just see that they are related,' her father, Randy Cuares, said. Welcome: Anna and her big sister Becky meet Ella . Family likeness: The girls' adopted parents noticed striking similarities between their daughters . Anna's mother, Karen Kandl, added: 'They have a lot of the same facial expressions, so things like that catch me off guard.' After years of speculation, the parents decided over the summer to do a DNA test, which confirmed Anna and Ella are fraternal twins. The girls were reunited when Ella's family, who live in Michigan, stopped at the Kandls' North Carolina home on their way to Myrtle Beach. Connection: Ella and Anna immediately bonded when they were reunited . Ms Cuares said at first the girls were awkward with each other, but added: 'It didn't take long . for them to realize, ""Oh, if we go inside and avoid all this parent . stuff, we can get to know each other"".' Although Anna gained an older sister, Becky, when the Kandls adopted her, her mother said: 'I think it's invaluable for her to know she has a sister.' The girls and their families plan to stay in touch as the twins grow up.","Parents not told daughters were twins when they adopted them in China .

"A baby in Brazil has been offered for sale for £267 (R$1000) on a website because the parent claims it will not them sleep. Brazilian police have launched an investigation into the advert, which was posted on Tuesday on the OLX classified website. The advert features a baby of only a few months old dressed in a blue outfit, alongside the caption: 'Cries a lot and did not let me sleep and I have to work to survive.' The disturbing advert for the newborn baby posted on OLX was live on the site for 12 hours . The author, who does not disclose whether they are a man or a woman, provides a contact name and number for the city of Aparecida de Goiânia in the central state of Goias. The advert was active for more than 12 hours on the site before the company withdrew it for breaching the terms and conditions by advertising ‘inappropriate content’. Police Child Protection officer, Marcela Orçai, from Aparecida de Goiânia, said they are trying to track down the person who posted the advert. The officer added that records from OLX indicted that a sale had not taken place. The child was advertised under the Babies and Children’s section. 'We are trying to locate the person who . posted the advert. We believe that the individual may live in the Campos . Eliseos neighbourhood of the city but the address given does not exist. Also the phone number listed has no connection with the case,' Orçai . explained. The officer warned that police would make the culprit 'answerable for their actions.' OLX classified website is the largest . consumer trading website in the world with a presence in some 107 . countries. Each month the company reports that it receives more than 100 . million users buying and selling goods and services on its free . classified site. The advert contained a contact name and number for the city of Aparecida de Goiânia in the central state of Goias . Police said the advertiser has offended whether they actually meant to sell the baby or not. Orçai said it was an offence to publish the baby's image and use the telephone number of another person 'fraudulently'. Digital law expert Rafael Maciel told O Globo the offence committed was negotiating the sale of a life. He said: 'If the person is the parent of the child then they can be charged under Brazil’s Children and Adolescents Act for publishing the image improperly. The crime carries a penalty of up to two years in prison. 'However, if that person isn’t linked to the child and has advertised the child without the parents’ consent, it is an even more serious offence of defamation and they can be jailed for up to three years.' Maciel said that it is precisely for this reason that the culprit should be prosecuted. 'Even though the company has removed it . from publication, and acted correctly, nothing guarantees that the image . was effectively erased and will not be posted in the future on another . site,' Police Child Protection officer, Marcela Orçai . The officer said: 'On the internet an image spreads very quickly, particularly on a site as well known as this one. Perhaps the author doesn’t realize the implications.  It’s worth warning others not to do the same because the internet is not the place for this kind of joke. 'Even though the company has removed it from publication, and acted correctly, nothing guarantees that the image was effectively erased and will not be posted in the future on another site.' The lawyer pointed out that it is difficult for a website of this scale and with this level of transaction to monitor everything that gets posted beforehand. OLX,  which was created in 2006 and begun operating in Brazil in 2010, made it clear that it has no involvement in transactions between advertisers and customers who use the platform. A company spokesperson said the advertiser would have automatically been obliged to accept the terms and conditions regulating the site and pledged responsibility for the material before posting the offending sale. In April this year a traveller was arrested on suspicion of selling her 12 year old daughter for R$5,000 (£1,340) in Cromínia, in the same state of Goiás. The child had been handed over to a 28 year old man. Police found the youngster and she was returned to her father.","Advert posted under Babies and Children's section of website OLX .

"A million women who take Britain’s most popular contraceptive pills are to be told they risk developing potentially fatal bloods clots. All GPs have been ordered to warn patients that taking some of the bestselling brands of birth control tablets - including Yasmin, Femodene and Marvelon - means they are nearly twice as likely to suffer blood clots compared to those who use older varieties. Scientists have found so-called third-generation contraceptives caused 14 deaths a year in France – and now doctors in the UK have been ordered to alert women to the alarming dangers. Contraceptive risk: Some of the bestselling brands of birth control tablets - including Yasmin, Femodene and Marvelon - can increase the risk of blood clots GPs are warning . Doctors have also been told not to offer the newer types of pill to those at highest risk. Britain’s drugs watchdog has written to the country’s 60,000 GPs telling them they must, for the first time, go through a checklist when prescribing the pills. The aim is to ensure they are not given to women with a higher inherent risk of developing blood clots. And they have been told they should ‘carefully consider’ the risks when prescribing pills. The move follows a report by  the . European Medicines Agency, which found that synthetic hormones used in . third generation pills increased the chance of developing . life-threatening deep vein thromboses (DVT) much more than previously . thought. These . newer pills are prescribed about two million times a year. They are . popular because they are less likely than their predecessors to cause . side-effects such as weight gain, headaches, breast tenderness and hair . growth. But GPs have . now been told they must fully inform women of the risks of taking . different ‘combined hormonal contraceptives’, which contain synthetic . versions of the female hormones oestrogen and progesterone. The warning has come too late to save teacher Helen Thompson, who last month died from a clot, her devastated widower has said. James, from Oxfordshire, added: ‘The doctors said all women on the pill are at a higher risk of clots, but they said it was incredibly rare. 'What caused the clot 100 per cent we don’t know, and I don’t want to hurt myself by investigating further.’ A hospital scan revealed a clot on his 28-year-old wife’s brain, but she died within 24 hours of diagnosis. DVTs, which typically form in the leg, can travel up blood vessels causing a potentially fatal blockage in the lung called a pulmonary embolism. They can also go up to the brain, triggering a stroke. Risk factors include being older and overweight, smoking or being prone to a type of migraine. Last night pharmaceutical giant Bayer, which makes Yasmin and Femodene, said it would be making blood clot warnings more prominent on its packets. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctors’ Association, said the advice would change the way he would prescribe pills. He said: ‘Whereas previously I would have used Yasmin or Femodene as first line because they’re more “lady friendly”, now I probably wouldn’t be as keen.’ However, he said that he would still offer both to patients. The letter from watchdogs at the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which went out on January 22, stated that the risk of developing a serious blood clot from taking any combined pill was still ‘small’ and that any woman who had been taking a particular pill without any problems ‘does not need to stop using it’. The benefits ‘far outweigh the risk of serious side effects in most women,’ it went on. Being pregnant actually increases the risk of DVT far more than any pill. But the letter warned doctors that . ‘careful consideration’ should be given to each patient’s risk of . developing DVT, as well as the different level of risk each type of pill . held. Doctors . should ‘regularly reassess’ each woman’s risk and discuss  with them of . the potential dangers of the pills they were prescribing.  Similar . letters have gone out to doctors across Europe. Taking third generation contraceptives increases the risk of clots six times compared to those taking no pills at all. The . annual risk of a woman of childbearing age having a serious blood clot . is 1 in 5,000 if she is not on a combined contraceptive pill, it said. The . risk triples to about 1 in 1,700 a year if she is taking one of the . older forms of combined pill, and taking third generation pills means . the risk doubles again, to as high as 1 in 800. Risk: Scientists have found so-called third-generation contraceptives, such as Yasmin caused 14 deaths a year in France . The European  review was prompted  by a report from France, which found that from 2000 to 2011, 2,529 cases of serious blood clots – just over 200 a year – were down to combined contraceptives. Of those, 1,751 (146 a year) were due to third generation pills. These clots led to 20 deaths a year on average, 14 from newer versions of the pill and six from older versions. The French authorities consequently told doctors to offer the newer pills only if their patients had first tried the old ones – a harder line than the MHRA has taken. Doctors are still trying to understand the link between the newer pills and serious blood clots – but it is thought that it is the synthetic oestrogen which increases the risk. The hormones which appear to cause raised risks, are: gestodene, desogestrel, drospirenone, etonogestrel and norelgestromin. These are present in brands including: Evra Patch, Femodene, Gedarel, Katya, Marvelon, Mercilon, Millinette, Sunya, Triadene, Yasmin and Yaz. Older and apparently safer forms of progesterone are: levonorgestrel, norgestimate and norethisterone. Third generation pills were launched in the 1980s and official concerns were first raised about increased DVT risks in 1995. Dr Sarah Branch of the MHRA said yesterday:  ‘Women should continue to take their contraceptive pill. These are very safe, highly effective medicines for preventing unintended pregnancy and the benefits associated with their use far outweigh the risk of blood clots.’ Dr Asma Khalid of Marie Stopes International, added: ‘Any method of contraception comes with its own benefits and possible side effects, and it’s important that women are given the information they need to make informed choices.’ Georgie Holland was left partially sighted after suffering a stroke at the age of 17. She had been taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin for two years. Now 19, she still has limited peripheral vision in both eyes, suffers from headaches and will have to  take an aspirin every day for the  rest of her life to thin her blood. Her mother Kim said: ‘After what Georgie went through, I honestly don’t think Yasmin and these third-generation pills should still be available. 'I would warn any parents of teenagers to consider the risks of contraception.’ Mrs Holland, 45, recalled how former beauty pageant winner Georgie, right, spent a week in hospital after she collapsed. A scan revealed a blood clot in her brain, and doctors linked her stroke to the pill. ‘What happened to Georgie was devastating,’ said Mrs Holland from Kettering, Northamptonshire. ‘She dealt with it amazingly but it has changed her.’","Bestselling brands of birth control tablets linked to fatal blood clots .

"The South Sydney Rabbitohs have clenched their first rugby league premiership in 43 years, winning by 24 points against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. But it did not come easy for the red-and-green clad team, losing prop David Tyrrell just over an hour into the game - who was carted off the field on a stretcher and in a neck brace - after a horrific head-on clash with  Bulldogs’ James Graham. English brothers Sam and George Burgess also turned in courageous performances to run over the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6. Rabbitoh teammates carry Sam Burgess on their shoulders after their win against the Bulldogs. The moment is reminiscent of that experienced by John Sattler during the 1970 grand final when the former South Sydney prop broke his jaw .

Johnston celebrates with his Rabbitoh teammates after his try during the grand final match . Sam Burgess' suspected fractured cheek bone (left) was eerily similar to when former South Sydney prop John Sattler (right) broke his jaw during the 1970 grand final . Earlier in the night, Sam Burgess walked off the field worse for wear after the first half of the NRL Grand Final, with a suspected fractured cheek bone. About 10 minutes into the end-of-season match, the star player took a heavy hit as his mother, Julie, watched from stands of Sydney's ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park. It had an eerie similarity to an incident suffered by former South Sydney prop John Sattler who broke his jaw during the 1970 rugby league grand final but continued to play on to victory against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. While walking off the field after the half-time siren, Channel Nine commentator Brad Fittler asked Sam Burgess about his cheek and the footy star mumbled: 'It's f***ed.' Minutes after Sam Burgess took a blow to his face, his brother, George Burgess, was taken off the field with a suspected concussion. But both brothers returned to the field to play on until full-time. The smile could not be wiped off the face of Rabbitohs' owner Russell Crowe who maintained his poker face until the final siren blew . John Sattler had nothing but good things to say about Sam Burgess as they were interviewed after the drought-breaking match . As the final siren sounded over the stadium, Sam Burgess broke down in tears as his team broke its four-decade-long premiership drought. His teammates carried him over the field propped on their shoulders, reminiscent of the moment John Sattler's colleagues did the same in 1970. The cheers from the Rabbitoh fans were deafening as Burgess paid tribute to those closest to him - calling his mother 'the greatest woman in the world' - as well as the fans. 'I love my family...most of all we did for you fans,' Burgess said. He also gave a shout out to the Rabbitohs' owner, Australian actor Russell Crowe: 'Russell, good on you, buddy - what a man.' Of his injury, Burgess said he felt as if he had 'cracked my eyeball'. The British-born player also took home the Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match but shared the victory with his teammates. 'I'm accepting this on behalf of my team... one player probably doesn't deserve this [the medal],' the gracious Burgess told the crowd. 'I want to thank the fans for a cracking year I'll never forget.' Rabbitoh fans were out in force on Anzac Parade in Kingsford outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club (left), while one fan took his celebrations to the roof of a police vehicle (right) Fans waited for about two hours to catch a glimpse of their heroes with the premiership cup as police closed off 200m of the road . John Sattler said Burgess would be remembered for years to come in the history books, while the Rabbitohs forward said the former prop was an 'inspiration'. But the compliments did not just come from rugby greats for the Clive Churchill medallist but from his brothers as well who showed there was no sibling rivalry among the Burgess clan. 'Sam Burgess is my hero,' Tom Burgess said. After the game, Rabbitoh fans congregated outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club on Anzac Parade in Kingsford - in the city's eastern suburbs. Supporters waited outside the clubhouse for about two hours before the grand final winners showed up, holding the premiership cup above their heads. One of the people among the crowd was Andrei Perederiy told Daily Mail Australia police - some on horseback - had closed off 200m of Anzac Parade between Wallace Street and Sturt Street. 'The whole block if full, the carpark is full. Whole families are in the crowd - it's a good vibe,' he said. 'The team is making speeches.' The South Sydney Rabbitohs take on the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at Sydney's ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park . Fans of the Rabbitohs are hoping for a win after a 43-year premiership drought, while the Bulldogs won their last premiership in 2004 . Australian actor Russell Crowe will no doubt be part of the 83,333-strong at the stadium as he is the owner of the South Sydney side .

Russell Crowe has been recruiting some famous Hollywood faces to get behind the red-and-green squad . The grand final will also include a performance from U.S. band Train and guitarist Slash of Guns N' Roses fame . Hours before kick off, a sea of football fanatics coloured in red and green or blue and white were seen streaming into ANZ Stadium ahead of NRL's biggest clash. Fans of the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs got creative donning face paint, decorating bikes and turning flags into capes to show their support. The pre-game festivities included stalls and buskers to get supporters geared up for the end-of-season match, which kicked off at 7.20pm on Sunday at the stadium. The heat did not stop fans from braving the elements on Sunday, which is the hottest NRL grand final day on record, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. At 5pm on Sunday, the mercury peaked at 34.3 degrees at Olympic Park which broke the previous record set by last year's 33.4 degrees. Rabbitohs fans will be hungry for a win to break the team's 43-year premiership drought. The last time the South Sydney side were crowned premiers was in 1971 before colour television was introduced in Australia in 1975. But while the red-and-green clad team were the first to put some points on the score board, its players did not fare as well during the first half. Leading up to Sunday's clash, Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe has been actively recruiting his Tinsel Town friends to get behind his team. Rapper Snoop Dogg has been a long-time supporter of the side after being spotted in a South Sydney guernsey as early as 2007. On Friday, the recording artist - who is also known as Snoop Lion - posted a message from the Australian actor which contained details on how to watch the grand final clash. But Snoop Dogg is not the only famous face Crowe has recruited to the red and green. UK comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted on Friday: 'That bloke @russellcrowe tells me that the NRL grand final is quite a big deal this year' and hash-tagged 'Go Rabbitohs'. Crowe, 50, joined the sell-out 83,333-strong crowd at the spectacle, which also included performances from U.S. band Train, guitarist Slash of Guns N' Roses fame and former The Superjesus frontwoman Sarah McLeod. Daily Mail Australia reported on Saturday, singer Justin Timberlake - who is currently touring the country - turned down $2 million to play at the event, which they were hoping would rival the U.S. Superbowl.

"When you are related to royalty, life can become one long social whirl. And so it has proved for Pippa Middleton, who can barely have paused for breath in the past week as she appeared at a series of high-profile events. The latest was as a guest at Sir David Frost’s annual summer party, where the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister mingled with the great and the good from the media, politics and showbusiness, including Sir Michael Caine, Stephen Fry, Sir Elton John and Sir Bruce Forsyth. Social whirl: Pippa at the wedding in Alnwick (l-r), shopping near her home, at Wimbledon on Monday and at Sir David Frost's annual party . Miss Middleton, who was without her boyfriend Nico Jackson, looked striking in a vampish red lace sleeveless dress with nude underlay and sheer top. The Alice by Temperley Alberto dress cost £445, but is now on sale for £222.50. The 29-year-old paired it with a £135 pair of suede strapped wedges by Ash, a sensible choice for a reception on a lawn in a British summer. Described as a ‘simple and elegant . occasion dress’, it is made from red cotton lace attached at the neck to . a sheer ‘barely there’ chiffon panel which unzips at the back. Pippa's outfit was the latest in a string of fashions Miss Middleton has been seen sporting in recent days – some with more success than others. Pippa wore a vampish Alice by Temperley Alberto dress that cost £445 but is now on half price sale . The Duchess of Cambridge's sister was pictured leaving the party with Sir Bruce Forsyth and wife Wilmelia . David Frost said Pippa was invited because the pair met before the royal wedding and she has been for dinner . On Saturday she attended the society wedding of the year, the marriage of the Duke of Northumberland’s daughter Lady Melissa Percy to City broker Thomas van Straubenzee in Alnwick, Northumberland. Miss Middleton wore a black and white Tabitha Webb dress that drew compliments from onlookers. On Monday, wearing an elegant pale blue Sandro dress, she was in the royal box at Wimbledon to watch Roger Federer and Andy Murray win their first round matches. However, fashion followers pointed out that both styles had in the past been worn by model Kelly Brook. And on Tuesday, Miss Middleton drew unflattering comments as she was spotted returning from the shops in West London in a coral cashmere dress and cardigan. Tuesday night’s party, hosted by Sir David, 74, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, also numbered politicians Lord Hurd and Ken Livingstone among the 300 guests. Sir David told the Mail: ‘It was a . wonderful evening. We were very lucky with the weather and it was a . fabulous mix of company, everyone was on very good form.’ Pippa paired her dress, which had a revealing sheer panel at the back, with suede strapped wedges . Pippa mingled with the great and the good from the media, politics and showbusiness at the garden party . Asked how he knew Pippa, the broadcaster explained: ‘We met her before . the wedding and she has since been to dinner at our house in Chelsea, so . she is a friend in that sense. ‘She is a lovely young women, very witty and can hold her own in all . kinds of conversation. She has taken the enormous interest in her very . much in her stride. ‘One of the oldest guests there last night was the television presenter . Dennis Norden who, I learned, was 91, so it is always nice to have a . young mix of guests there too.’ That wit is also in evidence in a new diary she has written for today’s edition of The Spectator magazine in which she once again challenges London mayor Boris Johnson to a table tennis match. She says: ‘The last time I wrote in these pages, I issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take me on at ping pong. The Mayor said he’d be up for it, and his office duly contacted The Spectator to arrange the details. 'Team Johnson insisted that the match should be held at a venue of their choosing. I said by all means. And then — nothing. The Spectator has tried to follow up, but now it’s radio silence from the Mayor’s office. Is Boris scared or what? He should be.’ Middleton wrote about her love of 'Wimbers' in her column for The Spectator . Much of her column, however, was saved for Wimbledon or ‘Wimbers’, as she calls it. ‘Wimbers is tennis at its best, the grandest of all slams, which is why I like to go every year, at least twice,’ she writes, which means there is clearly one more appearance to go this year. She also wades into the evergreen row about men’s versus women’s tennis, saying: ‘Typically I prefer watching the men to the women. I don’t hate my own sex or anything; I just can’t stomach the women players’ shrieking…..There are male grunters, it should be said (Nadal, Agassi, Ferrer, Djokovic — though not, of course, the serene and beautiful Roger Federer), but they have a lower pitch so it’s not too offputting. The shriekers, by contrast, howl so loudly that they make it hard for the audience to focus on the tennis. ‘ . She also recommends a small flutter on Jo Wilfried Tsonga at 28/1 to win the championships – unfortunate as he pulled out yesterday with a knee injury.","Wore £400 dress to Sir David Frost's annual summer party .

"Pinned inside her mangled Mercedes, seriously injured and fading fast, Katie Lentz turned to her rescuers on the lonely open stretch of Missouri highway and asked them to pray. Struck head-on by a drunk driver on Sunday morning, emergency workers had been battling for an hour and a half to free Lentz, but to no avail. But as they joined hands a Catholic priest appeared, even though there were no bystanders and the road was blocked, who offered a prayer and an instruction to the rescuers that they would now be able to free her. Suddenly, heavy equipment needed to cut . through the metal arrived from a nearby town and Lentz was pulled from the wreck in time to . be saved - but when they turned to thank the priest, he was gone. Scroll Down for Video . Mangled Wreck: Emergency workers were struggling to save Katie Lentz when she was hit head-on by a drunk driver on Highway 19 near to Center, Missouri . Prayer: When emergency workers could not free her - Katie Lentz asked them to stop so that a prayer could be said . Effort: The desperate effort to save Katie Lentz was blessed by the Catholic priest who appeared from nowhere and just as mysteriously vanished . 'He came up and approached the patient, and offered a prayer,' Chief Raymond Reed told KHQA-TV. 'It was a Catholic priest who had anointing oil with him. A sense of calmness came over her, and it did us as well. 'I can’t be for certain how it was said, but myself and another firefighter, we very plainly heard that we should remain calm, that our tools would now work and that we would get her out of that vehicle.' That is when officers from the neighboring Hannibal Fire Department arrived with their jaws-of-life and Lentz was pulled to safety and put into an air ambulance to hospital. Turning to thank the guardian angel who had arrived from nowhere at their lowest ebb, the emergency crews could not find him. The highway had been blocked for a . quarter of a mile each end during the hour and a half rescue and no . bystanders and parked cars were anywhere near the crash site on Highway . 19 near Center. Divine Intervention: Katie Lentz was saved after emergency workers from Hannibal fire services arrived with heavy duty cutting equipment . 'We would like to find this gentleman and be able to thank him,' Reed said. 'As a first responder, you don't know what you're going to run into. We have a lot of tools, and we have intensive training. 'In this particular case, it is my feeling that it was nothing more than sheer faith and nothing short of a miracle.' Lentz suffered several broken bones to repair her legs, but her friends and family say that her spirit has been boosted by the apparent divine intervention. 'Both of her legs are very damaged,' Lentz's friend Amanda Wiseman said. 'Her wrist is broken, several broken ribs, so she's had a lot of broken bones to deal with.' Scene: Dozens of emergency workers battled to free Katie Lentz as she lay pinned in her Mercedes wreck on Highway 19 . Saved: Chief Raymond Reed said that the Catholic priest, now identified as Patrick Dowling, made everyone including Katie Lentz calmer before the jaw-of-life appeared from Hannibal . Chief Raymond Reed said rescue crews were struggling to cut through the strong metal of Lentz's Mercedes. 'It was a very well-built car, and when you compact materials like that one, they become even stronger because you're cutting through multiple things instead of one layer,' Reed said. Reed says Lentz was pinned in between the steering wheel and the seat and the prayer was offered just as he was told by the paramedics that Lentz was failing. 'Where did this guy come from?' Lentz's friend Travis Wiseman asked. 'We're looking for the priest and so far, no one has seen him. Whether it was a priest as an angel or an actual angel, he was an angel to all those and to Katie.' Empty Stretch: The road was closed for a quarter of a mile either side of the crash and there were no bystanders . The driver of the other car in that accident, Aaron Smith, has been charged with a DWI, second degree assault and failure to drive on the right half of the roadway. There are several Catholic churches in the area to Highway 19 - the nearest being St Paul's - however, the mystery priest has still not come forward.","Katie Lentz was hit head-on by a drunk driver on Sunday morning on an isolated stretch of Missouri highway .

"Gales of gases whipping through the universe are dimming galaxies, researchers have discovered. Astronomers found the bright core of a spiral galaxy 245 million light years away has unexpectedly lost more X-ray radiation than expected because of the strong winds. And these, in turn, mean the winds are able to spread through the superhot disk surrounding a black hole at speeds five times faster than was predicted. Astronomers have discovered strange and unexpected behaviour around the supermassive black hole at the heart of the galaxy NGC 5548. The researchers detected a clumpy gas stream originating in a superheated region called a quasar (illustration shown) flowed outwards and enabled fast winds to form . Wind storms of up to 620 miles (1,000km) per second are known in galaxies, but the new study found they can blow up to 3,100 miles (5,000km) per second. Most galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at their centres, including our own Milky Way. Around the black hole is a quasar, a disk-like region of superheated material drawn in from the rest of the galaxy. The black hole takes in matter from this quasar and then expels it outwards. However, the process of how this happens is relatively poorly understood. The new research suggests streams of gas shield the black hole by absorbing X-ray radiation. The streams are like wisps, flowing away from the disk surrounding the black hole but taking X-ray radiation with them. These streams of gas are produced in the quasar, through methods unknown. By absorbing X-ray radiation this allows winds to form that can blow material away. The research is the best evidence so far of these gas streams in action. And the studies found a new gas outflow that allowed the wind to reach speeds five times faster than originally thought. In fact, the streams blocked 90 per cent of low-energy X-rays. This could mean material is being pushed away from some black holes at a much faster rate than thought. The observations were made in the nucleus of galaxy NGC 5548, which contains a region of powerful X-ray light surrounding the galaxy’s central black hole. But the winds, rarely seen in the heart of this type of galaxy, cast new light on the poorly-understood processes about the interaction between galaxies and their central black holes. The study, published in Science Express, provides the first direct evidence for the long-predicted shielding process needed to accelerate powerful gas streams, or ‘winds,’ to high speeds. Almost all galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centres, but most are dormant as they have very little material near them. In some galaxies, however, gas, dust and even stars are close enough to the black hole to fall into it and they encircle the black hole in a superhot region known as a quasar. Astronomers call these ‘active galaxies,’ as the matter spiralling into the black hole forms the disk-shaped quasar that heats up and shines extremely brightly, emitting radiation, including X-rays and ultraviolet. The ultraviolet radiation can launch winds outward, which may be so strong that they can blow off gas that would have otherwise fallen onto the black hole, slowing its growth down again. This feedback mechanism means black hole winds can regulate both the growth of a black hole and its host galaxy. But the winds only come into existence if their starting point is shielded from X-rays. This artist's impression illustrates the finding, by an international team of astronomers, of the flowing outward from the supermassive black hole at the centre of active galaxy NGC 5548, with the arrow showing the line of sight of the observations. The gas filament blocked 90 per cent of the X-rays emitted from the black hole . The newly discovered stream of gas in the galaxy NGC 5548 - the first of its kind in one of the best-studied active galaxies - provides this protection, and it appears that the shielding has been going on for at least three years. ‘This is a milestone in understanding the interaction of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies,’ said Professor Graziella Branduardi-Raymont from University College London’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory. ‘I was delighted when our consortium agreed to focus the campaign on NGC 5548, as I first became interested in this active galaxy almost three decades ago, observing it with the X-ray instruments operating in space at the time.’ Supermassive black holes in the nuclei of active galaxies, such as NGC 5548, are known to expel large amounts of matter through powerful winds of ionised gas. This is the galaxy known as NGC 5548. At its heart, though not visible here, is a supermassive black hole behaving in a strange and unexpected manner. Wind storms of up to 620 miles (1,000km) per second are known in galaxies, but this new study found they can blow up to 3,100 miles (5,000km) per second . The persistent wind of NGC 5548, known for two decades, reaches speeds exceeding 620 miles (1,000km) per second. But now a new obscuring wind has arisen, much stronger and faster than the persistent wind. ‘The new wind reaches speeds of up to 5,000 kilometres [3,100 miles] per second but is much closer to the nucleus than the persistent wind,’ said Dr Jelle Kaastra, of the Netherlands Institute for Space Research. “The new gas outflow blocks 90 per cent of the low-energy X-rays that come from very close to the black hole, and it obscures up to a third of the region that emits the ultraviolet radiation at a few light-days distance from the black hole.' Because of this shielding, the persistent wind far away from the nucleus receives less radiation and cools down. This causes new features to arise in the spectrum of the wind detected, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of the strongest persistent wind component. Ultimately the research could herald new insights into how supermassive black holes interact with the galaxies they inhabit.","Researchers have found evidence for how rapid winds form in galaxies .

"The lines between fantasy and reality are becoming ever more blurred with the army's latest helmet design, which appears to have been inspired by a similar type of headgear used in the Halo video game franchise. U.S. Army researchers have developed new ways for soldiers’ helmets to provide better protection and comfort and have even introduced head-up displays and night vision goggles. Four years was spent developing the gear to better integrate protective materials, liners and heads-up display technologies and communications. Helmet of the future: Revision, a company best known for ballistic eyewear has expanded protection to the head, neck and face in the form of its new modular helmet system . Flexible: Taking a standard Army helmet, and adding a ballistic visor and a mandible that offers 9mm protection, the system is intended for both mounted and dismounted soldiers . Inspiration: It looks as though the idea for the Army's new helemet came from the Halo combat warfare computer game series . A face shield shield has also been introduced because of the high number of facial injuries in recent wars caused by roadside bombs. ‘Because of face injuries from rocks, glass and fragments from improvised explosive devices, there has been a call for increased protection’  said Don Lee, who leads the project at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, in Massachusetts. Lee cited a Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of Injury in Combat report that said of all the injuries to the head, 72 percent are to the face. Natick’s project is called the Helmet Electronics and Display System-Upgradeable Protection, or HEaDS-UP. Where fiction meets reality: It's easy to see where the Army took their inspiration from when you look at the video game Halo . Top secret: It¿s the culmination of a four-year research project at Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center called Helmet Electronics and Display System-Upgradeable Protection . Plugins: The helmet can attach to a cellphone in order for the soldier to receive up-to-date information on their display . Developed by ballistic eyewear company Revision, the modular HEaDS-UP system is composed of a standard Army helmet with expanded features that protect the head, neck and face. The add-ons include a see-through ballistic visor and a mandible face mask that protects against 9-mm ammunition and offers better eye, face and hearing protection than existing helmets. Most notable are the display technologies that can be projected on the inside of the visor. Though there aren’t any specifics on the projected displays yet, it’s likely there will be images of battlefield maps, targets, health monitors, communications and other Google Glass-type of info. The concept is a single helmet to replace two helmets soldiers use, the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet and the Advanced Combat Helmet. Upgrade: The helmet aims to provide a more fully integrated headgear system, making use of improved ballistic materials, non-ballistic impact liner materials and designs . Revolution: The Army is testing a new helmet that looks like headwear from the 'Halo' video game franchise. Notable add-ons include a heads-up digital display on the visor . Features: An overall improved design with see-through and projected heads-up display technologies, and better eye, face and hearing protection . Lee said that while this is ‘in no way, shape or form the Army’s next helmet,’ Natick will provide its research to the acquisition office for soldier equipment, PEO Soldier to help it develop future headgear. ‘We’ve come up with tradeoffs, ideas, designs that the soldier will benefit from in the end,’ Lee said.The helmet also comes with add-ons and not every soldier would wear every piece designed for the headgear. For instance, a soldier who is in a vehicle’s gun turret and therefore vulnerable would be able to add more protection. Research at Natick focused not only on materiel but biomechanics in an effort to improve the fit, balance and weight of the helmets. The heads-up display provides soldiers with  live targeting, GPS battle mapping, text communication from mission commanders, live video from surveillance drones and general battle status display. The helmet is powered by a phone and so is fully upgradable with new apps.","Developed by ballistic eyewear company Revision .

"Dogs possess skills similar to those of a five-month-old baby, researchers have revealed. As a baby's brain develops they they learn to notice the actions of people. Until now, this had been thought to be a trait exclusive to humans and nonhuman primates. The results are important because they show that dogs, like children, can recognise goal-directed behaviour. Scroll down for video . Research led by Dr Sarah Marshall-Pescini of Milan University says dogs show a similar ability to five month-old infants. In an experiment they were placed in a room with a person and two objects (shown) This means they know where to look and how to respond to people when it seems like something important might happen - which is also what infants learn to do. In the Milan University study the authors tried a test used on five month-old babies on dogs, and found the animals could perform it as well as children. In the test 50 pet dogs were placed in a room with a researcher and their response to an experiment was recorded. In the experiment the domestic dogs were shown a human interacting with two objects, a globe and watering can. Crows have a reasoning ability rivalling that of a human seven-year-old, research has shown. Scientists came to the conclusion after subjecting six wild New Caledonian crows to a battery of tests designed to challenge their understanding of cause and effect. Thetasks were all variations of the Aesop's fable in which a thirsty crow drops stones to raise the level of water in a pitcher. In the 'water displacement task', crows worked out how to catch floating food rewards by dropping heavy objects into water-filled tubes. They demonstrated an ability to drop sinking rather than floating objects, solid rather than hollow objects, to choose a high water level tube over one with low water level, and a water-filled tube over one filled with sand. First, the dogs watched as the person interacted with the globe. Then, when the position of the globe and watering can were switched, the dogs again watched the person and the globe in the new location. When the person then switched to interacting with the watering can, however, the dogs’ attention also shifted to the watering can. Like children, the dogs spent more time watching the human to whom they were used to watching in the experiment, rather than watching the spot they were watching at first. When an inanimate object was used with the two objects, the same response was noted. And in a third experiment, dogs looked longer at the person interacting with the new object in the familiar location rather than the familiar object in a new location. ‘Results provide the first evidence that a non-primate species can perceive another individual’s actions as goal-directed,’ the researchers write in their paper. The dog was acclimatised to one partilcular object in one location. When the person interacted with the object but changed location (shown) the dog responded more to them, rather than a new object in the old location . When the person interacted with a new object in the old location, the dog played close attention. This suggests dogs are able to recognise 'goal-directed' behavior, an ability that only primates were thought to possess .","Research led by Dr Sarah Marshall-Pescini of Milan University says dogs show a similar ability to five month-old infants .

"A bright idea: A yellow bicycle... complete with its own rather Gallic stuffed rider . It started in the land of brie, croissants and berets – but this weekend, the Tour de France rolls into the land of Wensleydale, parkin and flat caps. And it couldn’t be receiving a warmer welcome. With ‘Le Grand Depart’ set to provide a £100million boost to the economy, notoriously thrifty Yorkshire folk are only too keen to cash in. Some locals are renting out homes along the route for as much as £10,000, while others have sold spots in their gardens for hundreds of pounds. Room rates at conveniently-placed hotels have trebled, and farmers’ fields and village cricket pitches have been transformed into money-spinning campsites or car parks. Gary Verity of Welcome to Yorkshire, which successfully bid to host the race, praised the ‘natural entrepreneurial spirit of the people of Yorkshire’ and said ‘millions’ would be watching this weekend’s two stages - which are followed by a final UK stage from Cambridge to London. In preparation, some £6million has been spent by councils in ‘God’s own county’ on filling potholes and repairing roads on the route. It hasn’t been an entirely smooth journey, though, as residents have complained that nearby roads in far worse condition have been left untouched – and German cyclist Marcel Kittel, one of the favourites for the opening stage, has insisted the roads through the Dales are still ‘very dangerous’ because they are so narrow. Nevertheless, from tomorrow the world’s best cyclists will wind their way through cities, towns, villages and across the spectacular Yorkshire Dales countryside.

"A university professor died of lung cancer aged 37 after doctors repeatedly dismissed her illness as 'purely psychological'. Lisa Smirl, 37, saw three different doctors with a range of symptoms over a year-long period but they were dismissed as anxiety and depression. By the time cancer was finally diagnosed it had spread throughout her body and was terminal. Dr Smirl, who was married to a medical doctor and lived in Leeds and Brighton, kept a heartbreaking online blog about her treatment. Misdiagnosis: Despite Lisa Smirl seeing three doctors with symptoms, her lung cancer was repeatedly written off as 'anxiety and depression' Shortly after her diagnosis, she wrote: 'How is it possible that a 36-year-old, health [obsessed] conscious, occasionally social smoking, middle class, fiance of a doctor can develop metastatic lung cancer unnoticed. How?!? 'What the consultant told us was that not only was it the c-word, but that it was everywhere. 'My brain, my bones, my liver. While in some ways this was a terrible surprise, in another it was a huge relief. 'For the last year I'd been battling a range of bizarre and seemingly disparate symptoms that had forced me in September 2011 to go on sick leave from my job as a lecturer (assistant professor). 'The diagnosis at the time was anxiety and/or depression. And while I was both anxious and depressed, this was due to the increasingly disabling symptoms that my doctor kept insisting were purely psychological. 'So I was actually grateful for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were objective, physical reasons behind my illness.' Cambridge-educated Dr Smirl, who was originally from Canada, wrote how she first experienced shortness of breath and wheezing in late 2010, which was wrongly diagnosed as asthma. Not psychological: Lisa Smirl said in her blog she was relieved to have a concrete diagnosis even though it was of cancer . In spring 2011, she was referred to a physiotherapist for shoulder and arm pain and started experiencing 'visual migraines' - losing her vision for half an hour - in June. By September 2011, Dr Smirl was so sick she was forced to leave work, having been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and put on anti-depressants. But despite a dramatic weight loss, she claimed three different family doctors refused to consider her symptoms in connection with each other. Relief: Dr Smirl wrote a blog on her diagnosis, saying she was 'actually grateful' for a medical diagnosis that confirmed there were 'objective, physical reasons' behind her symptoms . She wrote: 'Still, despite my pleas, and a dramatic weight loss, none of my doctors (and I saw three different family practitioners) would consider my symptoms in conjunction with one another - insisting that they were all common, unrelated problems (migraines, asthma, depression, back pain).' In November 2011, she misread her asthma prescription and took ten times the recommended amount - but the drug made no difference to a violent cough. Her doctor finally sent her for a routine X-ray and within hours, she was given the devastating news that she had cancer. On her blog, called Stage V - as stage IV of cancer is considered terminal - she describes her journey from 'a woman diagnosed with ""anxiety"" to one with metastatic cancer'. Dr Smirl wrote: 'I can't prove it, and this is just my opinion, but I have no doubt in my own mind that my misdiagnosis was in large part due to the fact that I was a middle aged female and that my male doctors were preconceived towards a psychological rather than a physiological diagnosis. 'It is so easy to say that someone's symptoms are ""anxiety"" related if they are a little bit complicated, unclear or unusual. Don't repeat my mistakes. 'You know when something is wrong. Find another doctor that you connect with and who takes your concerns seriously. Get referrals. Get tested. Refuse to be dismissed.' Dr Smirl worked in the global studies department at the University of Sussex between 2009 and 2012, but took early retirement. Despite battling the disease, she maintained an honorary lectureship in the department until her death on February 21. She also completed a Great North Run to raise funds for the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in November 2012. A blog post from November 3 2012, marking the one year anniversary of Lisa's lung cancer diagnosis . Professor Richard Black, head of the school of global studies at the University of Sussex, led tributes.He said: 'Lisa was a fantastic colleague and friend, a great teacher and researcher and truly inspirational in the way she dealt with her illness.' Professor Justin Rosenberg, head of international relations, added: 'Lisa was an outstanding colleague who shared her intellectual and personal vivacity with academics and students alike.' West Sussex PCT and the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust were unable to confirm that they were involved with Lisa's treatment.","Lisa Smirl, 37, saw three doctors with a range of symptoms over a year .

"Kerry Kennedy said today that people were 'wrong' to accuse her of relying on her powerful family name to beat a drugged driving charge last week. The 54-year-old daughter of Robert F. Kennedy was acquitted last Friday after she accidentally took a sleeping pill which caused her to lose control and hit a tractor-trailer while driving down a New York highway in 2012. Ms Kennedy told the Today show on Monday that her access to 'wonderful lawyers' helped her win the case - along with the fact she was innocent. Scroll down for video . Kerry Kennedy told the Today show on Monday that she was fortunate her wealth allowed her access to 'confident counsel' to beat a drugged driving charge . She told Today that it was 'great to have this off my mind' after being found not guilty of the charge at a court in White Plains, New York on Friday. Ms Kennedy said that she didn't think her family name was why she was acquitted but acknowledged that having substantial financial means to hire the best lawyers played a part. She said 'they [the jury] found me innocent because I was innocent' but also thanked her 'wonderful lawyers' along with her family, friends and God. Kennedy, a human rights activist, described the trial as a 'scary process'. She said that she beat the misdemeanor charge because she had the means to fight the case in court which few people do and instead take a plea which can have a 'devastating impact on lives'. The 54-year-old said she refused a plea deal because it could damage her career as a human rights activist and prevent travel to Canada, Australia and New Zealand for up to ten years. Kennedy is the president of the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights. Talking about her case, she added: 'This was 20 months. It was a week off from work - I wasn’t going to be fired from my job.' She faced up to a year in jail for the misdemeanor charge although this would have been unlikely . for a first-time offender. Ms Kennedy said on Monday: 'We've got to pass legislation which will allow people to have access to competent counsel no matter who they are.' Ms Kennedy, the ex-wife of New York . Governor Andrew Cuomo and niece of President John F. Kennedy, left court . on Friday saying she was 'incredibly grateful' for the verdict, . adding: 'I'm happy justice was done.' She went on to say that she plans to 'celebrate' and won't be holding a grudge. Grateful: Kerry Kennedy left court on Friday with her elderly mother Ethel Kennedy, daughter Cara Kennedy Cuomo and 'wonderful lawyers' Ms Kennedy's 85-year-old mother, Ethel Kennedy, . and other members of their famous family attended the trial, which drew . so much attention that it was moved from a small-town courtroom to a . bigger courthouse in White Plains. The case was based around an accident when her car hit a tractor-trailer in 2012. She was found slumped at the steering wheel. Kennedy said she took the sleeping pill . by mistake instead of her thyroid medication. She testified that the . drug overpowered her and she doesn't remember the crash. The biggest question in the case was not whether she had taken the sleeping pill by mistake since both the prosecution and the defense agreed on that point. The problematic point was whether or not she realized she was impaired when she finally pulled over. The prosecution said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy should have pulled over when she felt its effects. Police said she failed several sobriety tests at the scene but passed several tests a few hours later at a police station. 'If I realized I was impaired, I would have pulled over,' Kennedy testified. A . few days later, Kennedy said her doctors believed it was caused by a . seizure, stemming from a brain injury early in her life. Then blood . tests found a small amount of zolpidem, sometimes sold under the brand . name Ambien. Kennedy was arrested in 2012 on a misdemeanor charge of driving while impaired. She . had driven her Lexus wildly on a highway, sideswiping a . tractor-trailer, blowing one of her tires and yet continuing to the next . exit, witnesses testified. Blood tests showed a small amount of zolpidem, sometimes sold under the brand name Ambien. Prosecutor Doreen Lloyd disputed Kennedy's account, suggesting in a closing argument on Thursday that the human rights advocate ignored the onset of symptoms because 'she had a schedule to meet.' And while Kennedy took the pill by mistake, 'she is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that,' Lloyd said. She insisted zolpidem works gradually, saying Kennedy's testimony 'belies the science of this drug.'Mocking the title of one of Kennedy's own books, Lloyd urged the jury to 'speak truth to power.' But defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt said there was no evidence - and it made no sense to believe - that Kennedy was aware, while driving, that she'd taken the pill. 'Accidents are not crimes,' Lefcourt said. With Kennedy's mother, Ethel, and . other relatives in the front row, Lefcourt said Kennedy was 'not seeking . advantage because of her family'. The trial is 'not a TV call-in program,' he said. 'This is an American court.' Douglas Kennedy- Kerry's brother- Acquitted of harassment and child endangerment after kicking a nurse in the maternity ward as he tried to leave the hospital with his newborn child in 2012. Like Kerry, he brought up his father's assassination during his testimony in the courtroom, saying that he wanted to bring the newborn out of the hospital in order to spend time with it like he was never able to do with his father. Senator Ted Kennedy- Kerry's uncle- Infamously drove off a bridge in Cappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts in 1969, killing his passenger Mary Joe Kopechne. He fled the scene of the accident and didn't report it for nine hours, during which time Ms Kopechne died. He received a two month suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to leaving the scene of a crime. Former Congressman Patrick Kennedy- Kerry's cousin- Crashed his car into a Capitol Hill barricade at 2.45am in May 2006. The then-Congressman from Rhode Island, who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, initially claimed that he was disoriented due to Ambien- the same drug that was in Kerry's system at the time of her crash- but he also had reportedly been drinking. He went to rehab and made a deal with prosecutors that by pleading guilty to driving under the influence, he would be let off with one year's probation and a $350 fine. William Kennedy Smith- Kerry's cousin- Acquitted of rape after he was charged following a sexual encounter with a woman in Palm Beach in 1991. He was out at a bar with his uncle Ted and Ted's son Patrick (both mentioned above) when they met two young women. The group went back to the Kennedy's house in the area and William, then 30, went on a walk on the beach with one of the women, aged 29. She claimed he raped her while he said they had consensual sex. He was acquitted of all charges. He later had a sexual assault case brought on by a female coworker dismissed in 2005 and settled out of court when a second such case was brought that same year. Mary Richardson Kennedy- Kerry's deceased sister-in-law- Just days after her husband Robert Kennedy Jr filed for divorce, Mary was charged with drunk driving in May 2010. She pled guilty and had her license suspended, but was arrested for drugged driving a month later. The mother-of-four killed herself in May 2012. Michael Skakel- Kerry's cousin- Charged with the 1975 murder of his 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley and spent 11 years behind bars following a 2002 conviction but he has been released from jail while he awaits a new trial. A judge recently allowed him to have a GPS tracking device moved from his ankle to a different part of his body so that he can fit his foot in a ski boot.","Kerry Kennedy, 54, found not guilty of drugged driving at a New York court on Friday .

"Lava from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano continues to move slowly through a vacant lot in a rural subdivision. Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton says it looks like the lava will bypass homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision. He says that as of Tuesday, the lava is about 19 days from reaching Pahoa Village Road. A geologist from the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory using a radar gun to measure the speed of the lava flow from the June 27th flow from the Kilauea volcano in Pahoa, Hawaii . Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton said the slow-moving lava is expected to bypass homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision, and the lava is about 5 days from reaching Pahoa Village Road . The road is the main drag though Pahoa Village and from there, it could reach Highway 130. The highway is a lifeline for residents living on the Big Island's Puna district. Workers continue to prepare unpaved roads to be used as alternate routes in case lava crosses the highway. The lava has slowed in recent days. Hawaii County Civil Defense says it advanced 270 yards since Monday. The flow is about 100 yards wide. Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists say the lava has moved an average of about 890 feet a day since Monday, slightly higher than the rate of about 705 feet a day between Friday and Sunday . The slow-moving lava is expected to bypass homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision, and the lava is about 5 days from reaching Pahoa Village Road . According to today's report from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, the flow continues to advance northeast through thick forest, moving at an average of 890 feet a day in the last three days, traveling 11.3 miles from the vent. Smoke billows from where the lava 'engulfs trees and other vegetation,' the report notes, though fires are fortunately not spreading away from the flow. Scientists predict it could cross Pāhoa Village Road, fewer than 2.7 miles away, as early as September 24, and then move onto block Hwy. 130. But unpredictability is part of the problem: The flow emerged June 27, but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late August, with several disappearances and re-emergences since then. The direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it. Point of no return: This map shows the location of the volcano and the small community of Pahoa which could be cut off entirely if the lava flow crosses the nearby highway 130 road . Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983. Scientists issued a warning last week when a lava flow that has been advancing through cracks in the earth for the past few months moved to within a mile of a rural subdivision. The flow since has slowed, but the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said it could reach the northwest edge of Kaohe Homesteads in a day-and-a-half. The county hasn't ordered any evacuations, however. Officials also are preparing for the possibility that the lava will cross Highway 130, which links Pahoa and the sprawling, mostly rural district of Puna to Hilo. This could happen within weeks. Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said lava has covered other major Big Island roads in the past, like a state highway in Kalapana and Chain of Craters Road which is partially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Downtown Pahoa, Hawaii. Surf shop co-owner Tiffany Edwards Hunt said there ís a threat Pahoa could become a ghost town if lava from Kilauea volcano crosses roads connecting the village with the rest of the Big Island . The part of Highway 130 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day, he said. The county is quickly trying to prepare alternate routes for people to use . Those who live on the slopes of Kilauea volcano know lava could start creeping their way at any time but the area is still a powerful draw for many who value its community and affordability . Lava flow from the Kilauea volcano is approaching the boundary of the Kaohe Homesteads division on the Big Island of Hawaii. Hawaii has declared a state of emergency with lava  now less than 1.6 km from houses . A vent on the volcano began oozing lava on 27 June 2014, moving downhill at up to 240 meter per day . The flow emerged from a vent at Kilauea's Puu Oo crater in late June. Since then, it has traveled nearly 9 miles as the crow flies, or just over 10 miles if its twists and turns are accounted for. The lava is creeping through thick forest, setting alight trees and generating smoke plumes. It is visible only from the air, unlike previous flows that tourists could watch drop into the ocean from coastal viewing areas. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a warning to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on Hawaii's Big Island, as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes . Lava from one of the world's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on Hawaii's Big Island .","U.S. Geological Survey says the lava could cross a major highway within the next five days .
No evacuations have been ordered, but access to roadways to the community is restricted ."
"Two Dutch pranksters ask the question we have all wanted to know the answer to. Can you really fool so-called experts into eating unhealthy food, believing it is the latest organic trend? And it seems the answer is yes, with the due managing to convince foodies that McDonald's food is actually a healthy alternative. These two girls were impressed with Sacha and Cedrique's offering . When asked to compare the duos food to McDonald's, their response was hilarious . Founder and CEO of Lifehunters, who aims to make movies that should go viral, Erik Hensel, told MailOnline: 'A lot of people in Holland are talking about organic and healthy food, so we wanted to see if people could really taste the difference between McDonald's and organic healthy food, which they didn't. 'When we saw the reactions in the edit we were laughing out loud, since it was so funny. 'We wanted to create something that was worth spreading and worth talking about. We wondered if you could taste if food is organic, so we tried it with McDonald's food since that was the least organic or natural food we could think off. 'We didn't had much expectations of the reactions, but the responses were great, especially because we just asked them what they thought about it and if it tasted better than McDonald's. 'The 'experts' told us it was way better and could 'really' taste the organic element in it.' It might not look like class canapes but this was chopped chicken and fish from McDonald's . It might not look appealing, but food experts loved the Dutch duo's offerings . The turnaround from Chicken McNuggets to organic convention standard was astounding . The pranksters had some fun along the way as they got set to dupe the public . Sacha and Cedrique, who are two of the Lifehunters, attend an organic food convention in Houten, Holland, where they were to present their delicacies. The problem is, that they don't even own a restaurant or have a menu of organically sourced foods, so they decide to play the ultimate prank. The pair head to a nearby McDonald's, and bag up a selection of items from the menu. Then, using only cutlery and some cocktail sticks, they transform the food into smaller, bitesize portions, and decided to market it as their new organic food menu. This 'expert' was definitely impressed with the fast food . Maybe this gentleman should have had a swill out before taking on McDonald's food . The taste-testing reactions of locals and experts at the convention at the Expo, Houten, are cringeworthy brilliant, as it is now time to 'some McDonald's snacks to the biggest food experts of the Benelux.' One gentleman, after swallowing down some Fillet-0-Fish says: 'Tastes like fish, reminds me of cod, rolls around the tongue nicely, if it were wine I'd say it's fine.' To spice things up still further, the duo ask people what they see as the key difference between their 'organic' treats and McDonald's. This lady's best bit was the fresh tomato - which the Dutch boys had earlier suggested was 'out of date' The organic convention drew a crowd of 'food experts as well as the general public . The responses are laugh out loud. Two girls, having tasted the Dutch duo's delicacies are posed the question: 'If you had to compare this, to say, McDonald's food, what would you say is the biggest difference?' To which, the excruciating reply is: 'It definitely tastes a lot better, and the fact it is organic is definitely a good thing. 'The taste is a lot richer.' Putting some Dutch flags onto the McDonald's food - a sure-fire way to trick the public . Another girl, who judging by her attire is either part of a stall herself, or one of the 'experts' says about the McDonald's: 'It's definitely a lot tastier than McDonald's, you can just tell it is a lot more pure.' Another lady adds: 'This absolutely has a lot more taste to it than McDonald's.' At the end of the video, Sacha asks Cedrique what they have learnt from their expedition. Cedrique responds: 'That if you tell people that something is organic, they'll automatically believe it's organic.' Quite so, Cedrique, quite so.","Sacha and Cedrique, from 'Lifehunters' show off 'delicacies' at convention .

"A woman from California who just moved to Texas has been told she is not eligible for a state driving lisence because her same-sex marriage isn't legally recognized there. Connie Wilson, her spouse, and three kids have moved to Houston but the last thing she was expecting was having issues in obtaining a Texas driver's license. Upon presenting her California marriage license to a DPS employee as a secondary form of identification, she was told that because gay marriage isn't legal in Texas, the certificate could not be used as a form of ID. Connie Wilson, her spouse, and three kids packed up their life and moved halfway across the country to Texas, the last hurdle she expected was getting a Texas driver's license . Connie Wilson (right) with her spouse Aimee (center) and their son Aidyn . Wilson brought her California driver's license, birth certificate, social security card and marriage license to a Texas Department of Public Safety office in Pasadena. 'The employee asked, 'Is this a same?' I knew what she meant, and I knew I would have a problem,' recalled Ms. Wilson to ABC 13. DPS officials say that Ms Wilson who changed her name to her partners' last name, must switch it back to her original birth name - and even then she would have to pay a huge number of fees. 'To receive a Texas driver license or identification card reflecting a name change from a same-sex marriage, a court order is required,' officials stated. Connie Wilson and her partner Aimee have relocated to the Houston area with their three kids. Connie took on Aimee's last name when they were legally married in California more than a year ago . Texas doesn't recognize same sex marriage. The DPS employee told Wilson even though she and her spouse are legally married, the certificate cannot be used to authenticate who she is. She was denied a Texas License . Ms. Wilson says she doesn't understand why she needs to spend money on a court order when the license already states her legal name. 'I'm not asking for a name change, I'm just asking for a new resident driver's license,' said Wilson. 'As of right now, I can't vote in the elections, which may be part of what they're after, I don't know,' she said. 'I'm being prohibited from having the last name of my children. I think that's a violation of me as a person,' said Wilson. 'I may as well pick another name out a hat.' If DPS will not relent, her one alternative is to renew her passport. Once she has the federal passport with her name, Connie Wilson, on it, she will not need a secondary identification to get a Texas driver's license. 'I love Texas and I just want to be a Texan,' says Wilson, who is moving with her spouse and their three children into a new home in the next two weeks.","A woman from California who moved to Texas says the state is denying her a driver's license with her new married name .

"President Barack Obama has signed a new executive order that authorizes his administration 'to impose sanctions not just on individuals but on key sectors of the Russian economy,' he said Thursday morning. Speaking on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One en route to Florida, he also announced a new raft of anti-Moscow choke-holds that the White House is attempting immediately to 'impose additional costs on Russia.' 'We're imposing sanctions on more senior . officials of the Russian government ... [and] other individuals who . provide material support' to them, Obama said in a brief statement. He also announced new sanctions on Bank Rossiya, which he said 'provides material . support to these individuals.' Scroll Down for Video . President Barack Obama addresses the Ukraine crisis at the White House Thursday, announcing new sanctions against Russian officials and a bank that holds their assets, and an executive order authorizing the government to make more moves . Showman: Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) spoke Tuesday at a rally celebrating his annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol after what the U.S> and other governments called an 'illegal referendum' Obama spoke for just a few minutes before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, en route to Florida for an economic speech and a Democratic Party fundraiser . The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control listed the new targets on its website as Obama spoke. 'We've continued to be deeply concerned' about Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions, he said. 'We've seen an illegal referendum in Crimea [and] an illegitimate move by the Russians to annex Crimea.' Putin's moves, he said, 'have been rejected by the international community and by the government of Ukraine.' He said the world would back 'the notion that nations do not simply redraw borders ... simply because they are larger or more powerful.' A senior White House official told reporters during a conference call following the president's remarks that new sanctions announcements could continue to roll out, and poked at some Russian officials who have portrayed a similar announcement on Monday as 'a slap on the wrist.' It's 'very important to tell Russia that if they further escalate they will be met with severe consequences,' another senior official said on the call. 'Russia is far more vulnerable and would be severely isolated if we were to move forward with additional sanctions.' Europeans like this woman near the Russian Embassy in Lisbon, Portugal have protested against the Crimea situation since Russia signed an accession treaty with the leaders of the Black Sea peninsula . Obama said there would be additional consequences in the form of a new round of sanctions if Putin makes a move across another nation's borders . On the march: Russian military ranks moved Wednesday towards a Ukrainian military base near the city of Perevalnoe. Russia's Constitutional Court has ruled unanimously that Putin acted legally by signing a treaty to make Crimea part of Russia . 'A whole slew of Russian officials' are being targeted, he said. They include 16 prominent men with close ties to Putin, the Kremlin or the Russian military establishment. Also, four non-officials are on the White House's newest list of 'designated' entities, including Yuri Kovalchuk, a billionaire who controls Bank Rossiya. That financial institution is Russia's 17th largest bank, with about $10 billion in assets. It 'will have any assets in the United States frozen,' the official explained, and 'will be barred from doing any business in the U.S.' Rossiya 'will be frozen out of the dollar' to 'prevent it from operating to the greatest extent possible,' he said. Reporters on the call heard a stern declaration that 'key sectors of the Russian economy are in play for additional sanctions' if Putin escalates the crisis by invading more of Ukraine, or other nations. Those economic sectors that the president is focused on, the official said, include financial services, energy, metals and mining, defense and related material, and engineering. Obama is traveling to Florida on Thursday for a Democratic fundraiser and a speech about the U.S. economy.","President signed new executive order authorizing the U.S. to sanction 'a whole slew' of wealthy Russians and a bank that holds their assets .

"Jose Mourinho has responded to a six-year-old Aston Villa fan's written request to manage his struggling side. Young Villa fan Jude Branson took pen to paper to make the plea last week, before Paul Lambert was sacked following Tuesday's 2-0 defeat by Hull City, and the Chelsea manager has now replied by sending him an autograph. Sadly for the youngster (and Aston Villa fans in general), the Special One's signature was written on a photograph of himself and not a contract to become the next manager at Villa Park. Six-year-old Aston Villa fan Jude Branson shows off his letter request to Jose Mourinho . Defeat by Hull has left Aston Villa in the relegation zone without a win in 10 Premier League games . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had the good grace to send the youngster an autographed picture . Diego Costa, scoring here against Villa in September, is also on the young fan's wanted list . Who will replace Paul Lambert as Aston Villa manager? In his message, Jude wrote: 'Dear Mr Mourinho, My name is Jude. I am 6 years old and I support Aston Villa. You are my favourite manager. Please could you manage Villa and bring Costa with you? We need help. Thank you Jude Branson.' 'Jude had a nice surprise today when he came back home from school to find that Jose had sent him a signed picture addressed to himself,' his father Phil told the Birmingham Mail. 'The only thing he wanted from his letter was Mourinho to take over at Villa. 'He he didn't get that! So the next best thing for him is definitely this acknowledgement from the man himself. Paul Lambert's reign as Aston Villa manager finally came to an end following a 2-0 defeat by Hull City . Aston Villa fans call for Lambert's head during the game against Hull at the KC Stadium . Tim Sherwood is the front-runner to replace Lambert and was also favourite for the QPR  job . 'It'll be framed and put on his bedroom wall. It's good to know that his letter was read and maybe even planted the seed in his head which will lead him to the Villa job one day. This is an excellent way to end a brilliant few days for Jude.' Defeat against Hull has left Villa in the relegation zone without a Premier League win in 10 games dating back to December 7. The search for Villa's next 'available' manager has began with Tim Sherwood the bookies' favourite while Jurgen Klinsmann, Steve McClaren and Glenn Hoddle are also being mentioned as potential candidates.","Chelsea boss has replied to Jude Branson's request to manage Aston Villa .

"The Sandy Hook gunman worshiped the devil and had an online page dedicated to Satan, a former classmate revealed, as his childhood barber recalls Adam Lanza never spoke and would stare at the floor every time he had his hair cut. Lanza's worshiping page had the word 'Devil' written in red, Gothic-style letters against a black background, Trevor L. Todd told The National Enquirer, something which he said was 'weird' and 'gave him the chills'. The FBI are trying to piece together his smashed up hard drive to see if his online footprint will reveal any motive for the killing, but they strongly believe he made use of devil-worshiping and suicide sites and boasted of his murder plans on message forums. Adam Lanza's childhood barber Bob Skuba revealed today that Nancy Lanza stopped bringing her son in for haircuts a few years ago so he thought he had moved away from the area. Time was running out: Nancy Lanza was searching . for other places to have her son Adam educated and traveled all over the . world to find something suitable . He told CNN that Adam would never speak or even look at him any time he came in for a cut, which was every six weeks for years. 'It’s just weird that I actually . touched him. I'd tried to joke with him,' Skuba said. 'He wouldn’t even . look at me. He would just be looking down at the tiles the whole time. 'I wish I would have killed him then. Or he should have killed himself a long time ago. He would have saved us all the trouble. 'I should have slit and stabbed him by accident. It would have been a lot better for those people.' Cutting Adam Lanza’s hair 'was a very . long half an hour. It was a very uncomfortable situation', stylist Diane . Harty said. She said that she never heard his voice even once and that Nancy, a . divorcee, also hardly spoke - only to tell Adam what to do as he would not listen to anyone else. Weird: A former classmate of Adam Lanza while they were at Newtown High School said he had online page worshiping the devil . It also emerged today that the chief . medical examiner in the massacre is enlisting the help of a geneticist . to see if they can find a biological motive behind why the 'troubled . genius' shot dead 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary . School on Friday. Dr H. Wayne Carver says he wants to . know if there is any identifiable disease associated with the behavior . of the shooter, especially as Asperger's syndrome - which Adam is thought to have suffered . from - is not associated with violent behavior. 'I’m exploring with the department of genetics what might be possible, if anything is possible,' Dr Carver said. 'Is there any identifiable disease associated with this behavior?' He is also awaiting toxicology results. Lanza's mental state is vital as to why he may have committed one of the worst mass shootings in American history. Another working theory is that he was . angry that his mother was planning to commit him to a psychiatric . facility because he was becoming too difficult for her to handle alone. Given his decision to kill his mother . Nancy while she lay sleeping in her bed at their Connecticut home and . then drive to his former elementary school to purposefully kill innocent . children, there had to be a strong connection in his mind between his . anger and the school. Nancy, 52, was thought to volunteer at . Sandy Hook Elementary School, and so the theory extends to the fact . that Adam felt he loved those children more than she loved him, since . she was planning to send him away. House of horrors: It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20-year-old . Struggling: Various family friends have said that she warned that you could never turn your back on Adam while he was in your care, explaining why it may have been taking a toll on her prompting for her to look for options . A friend told the New York Post that Nancy was overwhelmed. 'It was really hard for her as a . single mother. It’s hard enough raising an autistic child, just me and . my wife. I couldn’t imagine doing it alone,' said Rich Collins, 54, a . Lanza family friend who has an autistic son, Jeffrey, 17. 'I think it’s important to get the . part of the story out — that an unmarried woman was trying to raise an . autistic child on her own. I think she needed more support.' Fox News . quotes a neighborhood figure, whose father works as the pastor of an . area church, as saying that the 20-year-old shooter found out that his . mother was in the legal process of having him committed and was upset. That . news, coupled with his jealousy of the time she allegedly spent with a . group of kindergarteners at Sandy Hook, is thought to have served as the . basis of the killing. A number of factors are still unconfirmed in the theory, and it appears that they may remain as such for some time. Records . of conservatorship filings, which Nancy Lanza would have needed to make . in order to commit her son since he is over 18-years-old, are sealed by . the courts so if any such filings were made they will not be released . publicly. 'Adam Lanza . believed she cared more for the children than she did for him, and the . reason he probably thought this (was the fact that) she was petitioning . for conservatorship and wanted to have him committed,' Joshua Flashman . told Fox News. Targeted: All but one of the students in this first grade class were killed by gunman Adam Lanza, prompting the theory that he chose them because his mother worked with that group as a volunteer . Unanswered questions: It is still unclear what Nancy Lanza's connection was to Sandy Hook Elementary School, though it is confirmed that Adam attended it as a child . One of the biggest questions remaining . ever since the shooting was reported on Friday was Nancy's connection . to the school which was clearly singled out as a target by Adam. The majority of his shooting was . limited to the reception, where he forced his way into the building and . killed those standing in his way, and then to a single first grade . classroom. Those children . are thought to be the ones that Nancy grew close with during the last . academic year, when they were in kindergarten. Initial . reports immediately after the shooting claimed that Nancy was a full . time or even substitute teacher at the elementary school, though as the . chaos of the day slowed, school officials said that she was not on any . records of having worked there in any formal capacity. That option leaves the possibility open that she volunteered her time with the young children, though school board member Cody McCubbin could not confirm that role when asked by MailOnline. That was echoed by Lillian Bittman, a former school board member who told the Wall Street Journal: ‘No one has heard of her. Teachers don’t know her.’ Though the court records will never back up the claim that Nancy was trying to have her son committed, her actions do lend credence to the idea because she had spent much time over the course of this year traveling to different schools to find a suitable place to send Adam. Former babysitters of Adam's said that she warned that she could never turn her back on the young boy, meaning that when she went to visit prospective schools, Adam was either with her or very aware of the fact that she had gone shopping for his next home. In a Facebook conversation between Nancy and her former sister-in-law Marsha, Nancy revealed that she had wanted to downsize from her $1.4million home in Newtown. 'I am still in the same place but getting to the point where I may want a smaller house. I travel a lot, spend time with friends, work with a couple of charities,' she wrote in one of the messages. As a teenager, Adam Lanza would come in for a haircut about every six weeks without speaking or looking at anyone and always accompanied by his mother, said stylists at a Newtown salon. He stopped coming in a few years ago, and the employees at the salon thought he had moved away, said stylist Bob Skuba. Adam in the chair: Hairstylist Diane Harty said Adam was difficult to deal with . The comments from him and his colleagues were among the first describing how the Lanzas interacted with each other. Investigators have found no letters or diaries that could explain the attack, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Cutting Adam Lanza's hair 'was a very long half an hour. It was a very uncomfortable situation,' stylist Diane Harty said. She said that she never heard his voice and that Nancy Lanza also hardly spoke. Another stylist, Jessica Phillips, echoed their descriptions of the Lanzas and added that Nancy Lanza would give her son directions about what to do and where to go. Adam would move only 'when his mother told him to,' Skuba said. 'I would say, ""Adam, come on."" He wouldn't move,' Skuba said. 'And his mother would have to say, ""Adam, come on, he's ready."" It was like I was invisible.' He said Adam also wouldn't move from his chair after his hair was cut until his mother told him to.If a stylist would ask Adam a question, Skuba said, his mother would answer. 'He would just be looking down at the tiles ... the whole time,' Skuba said.Former classmates have previously described Adam Lanza as intelligent but remote, and former high school adviser described him as anxious and shy. Several people who knew his mother have described her as a devoted parent. Divorce paperwork released this week showed that Nancy Lanza had the authority to make all decisions regarding Adam's upbringing. The divorce was finalized in September 2009, when Adam Lanza was 17.                                                                                                            The Associated Press .","Medical examiner enlists help of geneticist to see if there is a biological reason behind massacre .

"The images from San Diego angered and shocked millions - a heavily pregnant woman begging with a young boy at her feet who then laughed as she was driven away in a Mercedes Benz. And now that woman has been found at it again a few days later. Only this time, she appears to have given birth and the man who drove her away is denying he owns a luxury car. A member of the public who had seen the original story of the woman caught begging last week outside Eastlake Village Center recognized the gang on Tuesday and called up her local news station. Scroll Down for Video . Busted: The woman - was found in University City and was confronted by a reporter who asked if she was the same woman panhandling across San Diego . Friends: Accompanying her was a man - who is believed to be the driver of the Mercedes and the young boy - who is believed to be the same boy begging with her last week . Once there, a reporter for 10News in San Diego confronted the woman, who was holding a newborn baby, while the boy and the man were accompanying her. The reporter, Emily Valdez, was told by the viewer that she had seen the man and woman holding a sign asking for money in the University City mall. Presenting the picture that went viral this week to the woman, the reporter asked if that was her. She said she couldn't speak English and then failed to respond yes or no. Infamous viral image: Shopper Melissa Smith, from San Diego, California, photographed the expectant mother and her child begging for money outside the city's Eastlake Village Center every weekend for the past two weeks . The same: A facial recognition expert said he is 80 percent sure these two women are the same - although in the days since the picture on the left, the woman appears to have given birth . The reporter then asked the man where his Mercedes was, to which he replied in Spanish, 'What Mercedes?' The group then made a speedy exit and this time, instead of getting into the German made car, entered a black minivan and sped off. Already convinced  this was the same woman and same group, 10News took their pictures to a face comparison expert. He said that despite the darkness, he was 80 percent sure the images showed the same woman. Last week, Melissa Smith, witnessed the-then expectant mother and her child panhandling - something she said they had been doing every weekend for the past two weeks. Matching: The woman (left) seems to be wearing very similar leggings to the woman who the reporter caught up with on Tuesday (right) Identical? The shoes that the woman on the left is wearing appear to be exactly the same as those on the right . It appears to also be the same boy pictured in both these images - an opinion shared by the facial recognition expert . Each time, they would hold a sign reading, 'Please help', and would receive money from dozens of shoppers. 'Lots of people gave them money,' Ms Smith said. 'Probably five people in five minutes.' But last week, Ms Smith was putting gas into her car when she saw the pair leave their panhandling spot and meet up with the woman's boyfriend - before driving away in a dark-colored Mercedes. 'I noticed they grabbed their little boy and they got into a Mercedes-Benz,' she told KGTV . 'I thought, ""Wow, a Mercedes-Benz. It's not even used - it's not old. It's a new Benz.""' The car appears to be an older Mercedes C320, which sold for $30,000 to $35,000 new. In outrage, Ms Smith immediately stopped pumping gas, climbed into her own car and followed the Mercedes down the road, while snapping photos of the luxury vehicle and its license plate. Ride home: This week, Ms Smith was pumping gas into her car when she saw the pair leave their begging spot and meet up with the woman's partner - before driving away in a dark-colored Mercedes Benz (pictured) Caught on camera: Ms Smith took this photo of the car as it drove toward a shopping plaza on Bonita Road . 'Lo and beyond they were in front of us,' she said. 'Here they are counting money, laughing and their little boy is not in a car seat or seat belt. He's all the way in the front seat with them.' Astonishingly, Ms Smith watched the car turn into a nearby shopping plaza on Bonita Road, before the pregnant woman got out, grabbed the sign and started begging again. As shoppers reached into their pockets to help her, Ms Smith started taking more photos of the woman, prompting the beggar to start shouting at her. She later sent the photos to KGTV. According to the news station, the Mercedes's license plate number is registered to a woman with an Escondidio apartment complex address, where rent costs around $2,500 a month. Residents at the complex said the people the station was looking for had recently moved and a forwarding address could not be obtained. Police said the trio have not been reported by anyone else since Ms Smith's encounter. It is believed that they have not been detained nor questioned by officers. The woman, her partner and the boy thought to be her son have not been identified.","Pregnant woman was pictured begging on San Diego street with young boy last week .

"Four years ago, Greece was hit by one of the worst economic crisis in history with concerns about social unrest and the country's possible departure from the eurozone keeping holidaymakers away. With tourism being the country's biggest industry, the country seriously suffered, but the mood here is changing. Tourism will be up 20 per cent next year and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010. And now, luxury hotels are opening their doors down south to draw in the kind of crowds you'd see splashing the cash in Monaco in a high-end revamp they hope will inject some serious glamour into the country. Back in business: Tourism will be up 20 per cent next year in Greece and the number of holidaymakers has doubled since 2010 with hoteliers hoping to redefine the south as the Greek Riviera . 'We want to transform the South Coast into the Greek Riviera,' says a local taxi driver, who had been out of work for eight months before securing a job as one of the new hotel's private drivers. 'We want this area to be a luxurious haven of choice for the world's jet set, VIP and celebrity clientele,' he adds. And they're not off to a bad start. Nikki Beach, a global beach club brand, has opened  in Porto Heli, a picturesque fishing village a few hours from Athens. You may not have heard of Porto Heli but that's kind of its appeal. The eastern Peloponnese region is a favourite among Athenian weekenders, royals, footballers and Greek shipping heirs, who use the remote location as a relaxing getaway, making it the perfect home for the newest addition to the Nikki Beach family. New opening: Nikki Beach has opened a super trendy hotel in Porto Heli, a picturesque fishing village a few hours from Athens . Room with a view: Each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the Agean waters and a 'floating bed' Nikki Beach was the brainchild of Jack Penrod, who became the largest McDonald's franchise owner in the State of Florida in the 80's. Tragically, the billionaire's daughter Nikki was killed in a car accident. Penrod decided that, rather than mourn his daughter’s passing, he would celebrate her life for years to come. In 1997, after a complete renovation, Nikki Beach Club was opened. The venue and its sister properties all over the world are a continuing homage to Nikki Penrod and the Nikki Beach brand is meant to exemplify all that she was as a person; beautiful, fun-loving, a trendsetter and cutting edge in every way. Fast forward twenty years and you'll find the famous beach clubs in eleven destinations worldwide, including Marbella, St Barts, Mallorca and Thailand, with Dubai, Turkey and Croatia resorts to follow. With it's all-white decor, infinity pool and super cool vibe, Nikki Beach Resort & Spa Porto Heli - a totally converted 1970s building spanning 8,000 square metres - is a place to see and be seen. Forget trying to wangle a sea view room upgrade because each one of the 66 suites comes with a panoramic view of the Agean waters, as well as personalised mini bar, 'floating bed' and Malin + Goetz toiletries. Well, if it's good enough for Mrs Clooney! Amal Alamuddin Clooney has been in Greece this week with Greek Culture Minister Kostas Tasoulas, after meeting him in his office in Athens as she begins advising the government on its bid to reclaim the Parthenon marbles . Who need a shared pool? Each one of the suites on the ground floor comes with its own private pool and the balconies light up by night . By night, the balcony lights turn purple, the DJ's beats subtly ramp up and the headboard lights dim to suit your mood; and that's just the standard rooms (which start at £235 a night). Elsewhere in the 5* hotel, there's suites with private pools, rooftop terraces and personal jacuzzis. Health and fitness play a key role here - you want to look and feel good sunbathing next to Porto Heli regular, supermodel Bar Refaeli, after all. The spa offers massages and facials using ESPA products and next summer will see the opening of every woman's dream hangout - a martini manicure bar. Fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel's jetties. You can reward your hard work in Cafe Nikki, the hotel's central restaurant offering a vast array of mouthwatering salads, gourmet burgers and the brand's iconic sushi dragon. Next summer, the resturant will offer gourmet dishes to suit the more sophisticated palette - think deconstructed Niçoise salad, sprinklings of caviar and plenty of lobster foam. Famous fans: Queen Letizia of Spain, left, has visited and Naomi Campbell once hosted the now iconic Nikki Beach white parties and often parties at the St Tropez beach club . Get in shape: Fitness fanatics will appreciate personal trainers who are on hand to whip you into shape on the hotel's jettys (or you can just lounge out there on a sunbed if you prefer) For a more laidback vibe, head upstairs to the resort's roof terrace, Pearl, which offers delicious pan Asian cuisine and fresh and fruity cocktails set to the sound of a live house DJ. If you can tear yourself away from poolside posing and champagne spray parties (the world record for bottles of champagne sprayed stands at an eye-watering 2,000), a 20-minute boat trip to the island of Spetses is well worth it. A car-free island, Spetses is home to trendy bars, delicious fish eateries (we loved Tarsana), and cool clubs. After dark, you'll find Greek shipping heirs partying the night away - and a 24/7 water taxi service back to the mainland beats rushing for the last tube in London. Yacht owners and local celebrities rest their heads at the Poseidonion Hotel, which recently celebrated its 100th birthday, and designer Etro loves it here so much, he makes the toiletries. So who can you expect to sprawl out on a sunbed next to in one of South Greece's hip hotels? Naomi Campbell is a fan of Nikki Beach; in fact, the famous 'white parties', which celebrate the start of the season, have been hosted by her. Coming soon: The spa offers massages and facials and next summer will see the opening of every woman's dream hangout - a martini manicure bar . Drinks with a view: The resort's roof terrace, Pearl,  offers delicious pan Asian cuisine and fresh and fruity cocktails set to the sound of a live house DJ by night . Eye candy: Footballer Ronaldo, left, and supermodel Bar Rafaeli both love Porto Heli . Prince William's godfather King Constantine II, the exiled King of Greece, has a holiday home and yacht here, and his sister, the former Queen Sofia of Spain, loves the area too. Her son, King Felipe of Spain, and his wife Queen Letizia have holidayed here. Michael Jordan, Cristiano Ronaldo and his Victoria's Secret Angel girlfriend, Irina Shayk, are rumoured to love the super exclusive Amanzoe, a ten minute drive from Porto Heli - and it's not hard to see why. The 38-suite resort boasts a yoga studio looking out to undulating olive groves, a private beach club and a staggering 598 columns inspired by the architecture of Ancient Greece. Seeking privacy? Fear not, each pavilion suite has a private pool, housekeeper and in-house chefs who can conjure up delicacies using honey from the local bee keeper and wine from the winery down the road. But this calibre of service comes with an A-list price tag; a night at Amanzoe will set you back 1,600 euros per night. While a weekend on the 'Greek Riviera' doesn't come cheap, who can resist panoramic views of the Aegean sea, cobalt blue waters and the chance of seeing Ronaldo in his speedos? Eat well, live well: The brand's famous sushi alligators, left, make up the menu and you can burn it off in a seaside personal training session on one of of the hotel's jetties .","Nikki Beach hotel opened in Porto Heli .

"A pensioner has spent £40,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to hang onto her looks. Katy Bedford, 75, who has been under the knife 18 times to keep her face wrinkle free, claims the only downside of her cosmetic addiction is that people won't stand up for her on the bus - because she doesn't look old enough. The pensioner, from Salisbury, Wilts, has never hidden her love of surgery and books herself in at the clinic at the first sign of getting  'turkey neck'. Scroll down for video . Katy Bedford, 75, has spent £40k on 18 cosmetic procedures to stay looking young and wrinkle-free . Katy first had surgery - a lower facelift with a Harley Street surgeon (left) - aged 47 in 1986 . Katy, a retired actress, said: 'As soon as I don't like what I see I say: ""Oh well, I'll have something else done"". 'It has been worth every penny. 'I wanted to look in the mirror and like what I saw smiling back at me - the effects of ageing aren't attractive at all' Katy first had surgery - a lower facelift with a Harley Street surgeon - aged 47 in 1986. Since then she has been perfecting her face and body with an average of one trip to the surgeon every 18 months. No step is too far for the obsessed OAP, who followed the masses of Brits that head abroad every year to go under the knife by having a lower facelift in Zagreb, Croatia. She returned in 2007 for liposuction on her legs, and again in 2008 to have a bump taken out of her nose. Katy, 75, used to work as an actress but retired several years ago . Her most recent round of plastic surgery involved another facelift, a neck lift in April 2012, a brow and cheek uplift and liposuction on her stomach just seven months later, and liposuction on her and right leg three months after that. Just last October, she had another series of liposuction to her right leg, hips, stomach, and her chest. Katy said: 'I just love it when the surgery is over and there's a three pounds of Katy left on the table.' And the mum-of-one hasn't said no to going back under the knife if she feels like she needs another nip or a tuck. She said: 'I'd never say never. My worst nightmare would be getting 'turkey neck', (even) if I was 100 I would have that done, I think it's hideous.' Katy, 75, claims people are often shocked to discover her age . So far, Katy has no regrets and she couldn't be happier with her results, and is full of praise for the skills of her most recent surgeon, Mohammad Azhar Aslam of Linia Cosmetic Surgery. She added: 'He is absolutely marvellous - really I couldn't have asked for better treatment. 'He's even managed to do some of my procedures under local anesthetic so that I can smile for him during the surgery and he can get my face absolutely right.' Although her daughter Sara-Madge Wynne, 34, a physicist working in Edinburgh, was at first hesitant about her mother's many cosmetic procedures, Katy says she soon came round to the idea. Katy said: 'My daughter raises her eyebrows and says ""Oh mum, you're not going to get another disgusting thing done to your face are you?"" Katy has undergone 18 different cosmetic surgeries since 1986 . 'But we were on holiday once and we saw a coach load of old dears trundling off their coach and I looked at them and I said:""'Would you rather that I looked like them?"" 'And she of course said ""no, you just carry on as you are."" 'I did promise her that I'd never look younger than her though. 'I always said that I wanted to do my improvements gently and little by little - it's awful when you suddenly see someone whose whole face has changed dramatically. 'If hadn't been so open about it I think even some of my closest friends and family wouldn't have noticed. 1986 - Lower face lift . 1995 - Eye Lift . 1996 - Face lift . 1997 - Corrective surgery to remove mark from previous cosmetic procedure . 2006 - Lower Face lift . 2007 - Liposuction on legs . 2008 - Nose job . 2012 - Lower Face Lift . 2012 - Neck lift . 2012 - Brow Lift . 2012 - Cheek Uplift . 2012 - Liposuction on abdomen . 2013 - Liposuction on back . 2013 - Liposuction on right leg . 2013 - Liposuction revision on right leg . 2013 - Liposuction revision on left hip . 2013 - Liposuction revision on abdomen . 2013 - Liposuction revision on Chest Wall . 'I am able to feel exactly as I want and as soon as I don't, I head back to the surgeon. 'When it comes to luggage at a train stations I'm happy to point out to people that just because I don't look my age, I still need help with my suitcase. 'I'm the first person to say ""I'm nearly 76 you know,"" to people who might be able to help me down the stairs. 'Most people are very surprised when I tell them, they normally just say - you look good for your age. 'But I think it's obvious that I must have had work done - nobody looks like this naturally. 'But people always think that people who have been under the knife look plastic and stretched - I think I'm quite the opposite.' Katy's surgeon at Linia Cosmetic Surgery, Azhar Aslamsaid: 'In my practice I've always had much older people - my oldest facelift was 89 but she was very active and just wanted to look better for the rest of their lives. 'Age itself is not a restriction but health is of course a crucial factor. We need to be sure that surgery can be done in a safe manner. 'People have surgery for all sorts of reasons, I had one lady who was moving to Spain in her 70s and wanted her breasts and arms to look good in a bikini. 'Just because you're older, your desire to look better to look better hasn't gone.'","Katy Bedford books herself in at the clinic at the first sign of 'turkey neck'

Canadian police described the Project Spade operation as one of the largest child porn busts they've ever seen. ‘It is alleged that officers seized hundreds of thousands of videos detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children, some of the worst that they have ever viewed,’ Toronto Inspector Joanna Beaven-Desjardins said. Scroll down for video . Massive haul: Canadian police described the Project Spade operation as one of the largest child porn busts they've ever seen . Police said 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia. Forty school teachers, nine doctors and nurses, and more than 30 people who volunteered with kids were among those taken into custody. The list of suspects also includes nine clergymen, six police officers and three foster parents. Police said the children were ‘rescued from child exploitation’ but did not give more details. Beaven-Desjardins said the investigation began with a Toronto man accused of running a company since 2005 that distributed child pornography videos to the tune of $4million in revenue, CTV News reported. Police allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed the videos via his company, Azov Films, to international customers. Global collaboration: More than 30 police officers from around the world gathered to announce the end of a 3-year child pornography investigation in Toronto . All walks of life: Police said 108 people were arrested in Canada, 76 in the U.S and 164 in countries from Spain to South Africa and Australia, among them teachers, doctors and priests . The videos included naked boys from Germany, Romania and Ukraine, which it marketed as naturist movies and claimed were legal in Canada and the United States. The head of the Toronto police sex . crimes unit told the Toronto Star that the X-rated images displayed . 'horrific acts of sexual abuse — some of the worst (officers) have . seen.' Police said they executed a search warrant at Way's company and home, seizing about 1,000 pieces of evidence: computers, servers, DVD burners, a video editing suite and hundreds of movies. Way was charged with 24 offences, including child pornography. Police also designated Azov Films as a criminal organization, charging Way with giving directions on behalf of a gang. The Azovfilms.com website has been shut down. Beaven-Desjardins said this is the first time in Canada that anyone has been charged with being a part of a criminal organization in regards to child pornography. Police said they began their investigation in 2010 and worked with Interpol in more than 50 countries including Australia, Spain, Mexico, Norway and Greece. More than 350,000 images and over 9,000 videos  - about 45 terabytes - of child sexual abuse were found during the probe, and arrests are continuing, Beaven-Desjardins said. Online filth: Police allege Brian Way, 42, instructed people around the world to create the videos of children ranging from 5 to 12 years of age, then distributed the videos via his company, Azov Films . ‘This operation shows that international police cooperation works. Despite large amounts of material and that this is time-consuming work, this shows that the Internet is not a safe haven for crimes against children,’ Norwegian police spokesman Bjoern-Erik Ludvigsen said in a statement. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service said it began its investigation by accessing the company website and making undercover purchases. People making the images included a youth baseball coach in Washington state who made more than 500 films and a school employee in Georgia who put a camera in a student washroom to videotape images of students' genitals, U.S. Postal Inspection Service inspector Gerald O'Farrell said. Beaven-Desjardins said the investigation is ongoing and believes more arrests will be made.","Three-year Project Spade operation spearheaded by Canadian authorities netted 348 suspects around the world .

"It’s been almost 24 years since the body of Ötzi the iceman was unearthed, yet scientists are still discovering secrets about the 5,300-year-old mummy. Using a modified camera, designed to capture a range of wavelengths, experts have spotted a previously unseen tattoo on the ancient specimen. The markings were spotted near the ribcage on the lower right side of the body, and they are the first etchings found on the front of the torso. Scroll down for video . Experts used multispectral imaging, including ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths, to photograph the 5,300-year-old mummy’s body. After processing the images, the researchers found unseen tattoos on Ötzi’s lower right rib cage that are invisible to the naked eye (original markings pictured left, scans shown right) In total, the ancient hunter has 61 tattoos grouped across 19 body parts, which the archaeologists previously thought were used as a primitive form of acupuncture. However, they claim the new tattoo may contradict this theory. The team have mapped these tattoos in the Elsevier Journal of Culture Heritage. The recent scans of Ötzi’s body were taken by Marco Samadelli, Marcello Melis, Matteo Miccoli, Eduard Vigl, and Albert Zink from the European Academy of Bozen Institute for Mummies and the Iceman and the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology. They used a 36MP Nikon D800 camera fitted with filters that captured wavelengths, including ultraviolet, visible and infrared. In total, the hunter has 61 tattoos grouped across 19 body parts. The archaeologists previously thought these markings were a primitive form of acupuncture. However, they now think the new tattoo may contradict this theory because it wasn't found near a joint. The team have mapped these tattoo groups (pictured) This table shows the location and shape of the tattoo groups. They range from 1mm (0.03 inches) and 3mm (0.1 inches) thick and 7mm (0.2 inches) and 40mm (1.5 inches) long.

Using this camera, they found linear ink markings across the body, ranging from between 1mm (0.03 inches) and 3mm (0.1 inches) thick and between 7mm (0.2 inches) and 40mm (1.5 inches) long. The majority of the tattoos consist of lines running parallel to each other, between 2mm (0.07 inches) and 8mm (0.3 inches) apart.

The right leg has seven groups of tattoos, the left leg has four, and visible tattoos are also found on the back of the lumbar region. The longest tattoos are around the wrist of the left hand, and many of these have been documented previously. However, using the modified camera, the researchers found a previously unseen group of tattoos that is barely visible. This tattoo was found in the lower thoracic, and shows four parallel lines varying from 20mm (0.7 inches) to 25 mm (0.9 inches).

This tattoo was found in the right lower thoracic, and shows four parallel lines of length varying from 20mm (0.7 inches) to 25 mm (0.9 inches). ‘This is of particular interest, as this represents the first tattoo that was detected on the iceman's frontal part of the torso,’ explained the researchers. The ice man's tattoos are largely seen on parts of the body that endured wear-and-tear, causing archaeologists to liken the practice to acupuncture. Radiological images of the tattooed areas of the mummy show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain. ‘In previous work on the tattoos of the iceman it was mainly believed that their application was done as a kind of treatment or diagnosis of health problems, in particular lower back pain and degenerative joint disease of his knees, ankle and wrist,’ continued the experts. ‘The conclusion was drawn because basically all tattoos were located in morphological areas close to the underlying spine and joints, where degenerations have been identified based on earlier radiological studies.’ But, the newly identified tattoo is not located close to a joint, which has led them to question this theory. When the mummy was first studied, experts were shocked at Ötzi's tattooed skin as they had never seen real examples of Copper Age tattoos before. They were also surprised as it is popularly thought that acupuncture was invented more than 2,000 years later in Asia. The ice man's tattoos (pictured) are largely seen on parts of the body that endured wear-and-tear, causing archaeologists to liken the practice to acupuncture - an ancient treatment for joint distress. Radiological images of the tattooed areas also show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain . Ötzi, (artist's impression) was 46 when he died, and measured 5ft 2 inches. He had brown eyes, and tests have revealed he was lactose intolerant . The 5,300-year-old 'ice mummy' known . as Ötzi suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease, a . bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to DNA analysis. Ötzi, . who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft 2inches, had brown . eyes,  relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. Ötzi was also predisposed to heart disease. Recent research focused on the DNA in the nuclei of Ötzi's cells, and it could yield further insights into the famous ice mummy's life. Ötzi was unearthed in September 1991 by German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. Researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat. Archaeologists . believe Ötzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper . axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival . tribe. Researchers say he was about 159cm tall (5ft 2.5in), 46 years old, arthritic and infested with whipworm - an intestinal parasite. His . perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold . storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a . constant temperature of -6°C. Visitors can view the mummy through a . small window. Alongside . his remains is a new Ötzi model created using 3D images of the corpse . and forensic technology by two Dutch artists - Alfons and Adrie Kennis. The right leg has seven groups of tattoos, the left leg has four, and visible tattoos are also found on the back of the lumbar region. The longest tattoos are around the wrist of the left hand (pictured) Ötzi got his tattoos by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin, which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks. Professor Frank Rühli, head of the Centre for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, told MailOnline the tattoos were probably a combination of decorative art and therapy. Archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing, tools and weapons found with the mummy frozen in the Alps on the Austrian, Italian border two decades ago, Ötzi was a herder or a chieftain in Copper Age Europe. Ötzi's tattoos are the only known examples of real-life ancient tattoos, as all other examples are found in artwork at the time, and reveal how the marks were made in Copper Age Europe. Ötzi (pictured) got his tattoos by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin, which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks . Professor Rühli said that while there might be a connection to suggest the tattoos functioned as a form of ancient acupuncture, it is difficult to see which ailments the mummy suffered from, so an indication of the marks being therapeutic is 'likely' but cannot be proven as there are not a number of similar bodies to study, found in the same location that are the same age. But, the Italian researchers aren’t ruling out that the new tattoo may have been used to treat pain as well. ‘It is known from previous studies that the iceman suffered from other pathological conditions that could have also caused pain in the chest area, such as gallbladder stones, whipworms in his colon and atherosclerosis. ‘Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the iceman's tattoos were indeed applied as a therapeutic treatment.’ The researchers now want to carry out further research into this tattoo and its relation to acupuncture points.","Iceman's tattoos are largely seen on body parts that endured wear-and-tear .

"It may seem unlikely, but the humble rabbit helped kill off the Neanderthals, researchers have claimed. Experts have long thought that the demise of the Neanderthal was down to food. Now a new theory claims that it was their inability to adapt to hunting small animals like rabbits that was the final nail in their coffin. Is this what killed the Neanderthals? Researchers believe an inability to hunt small animals like rabbits led to their demise . John Fa, of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in Jersey, counted . the skeletons of animals found in three excavation sites in Spain and . southern France. The remains of large animals such as deer that had been . dated as far back as 30,000 years ago were abundant in caves. But from then on, coinciding with the . disappearance of Neanderthals, rabbit remains became more prevalent. As deer ran out, experts believe the Neanderthals were unable to learn how to hunt small animals, and died out as modern man was better able to adapt . The . authors believe that humans were more successful at switching to . catching and eating rabbits. 'High dependence on the hunting and consumption of large mammals by . some hominins may have limited their survival once their preferred . quarry became scarce or disappeared,' he wrote. 'Adaptation to smaller residual prey would have been essential after the many large-bodied species decreased in numbers.' The researchers focused on the rabbit, described as a 'super-abundant species'. 'Analysis of bone remains from excavations throughout Iberia show . that this lagomorph was a crucial part of the diet of Anatomically . Modern Humans but was relatively unutilised during the Mousterian, when . Neanderthals were present,' they found. 'We suggest that hunters that could shift focus to rabbits and other . smaller residual fauna, once larger-bodied species decreased in numbers, . would have been able to persist.' However, the team admit it is not clear why Neanderthals would have had more trouble changing prey. Some believe they may have been less able to cooperate. Rather . than using spears, early humans probably surrounded a warren and . flushed out rabbits with fire, smoke or dogs, it is believed. Neanderthals and the ancestors of . modern humans never co-existed, according to a recent study which, if . correct, could rewrite conventional accounts of our species' early . history. The study suggests . that our evolutionary cousins became extinct in their last refuge in . Spain much earlier than previously thought. Previous dating of bone fossils found at Neanderthal sites in the region put the youngest at about 35,000 years. Now . researchers from Australia and Europe have re-examined the bones using . an improved method to filter out contamination and concluded that the . remains are actually about 15,000 years older. If . true, the study casts doubt on the idea that modern humans and . Neanderthals co-existed - and possibly even interbred - for millennia. Humans . aren't believed to have settled in the region until 42,000 years ago, . but the new dating has neanderthals disappearing from there around . 50,000 years ago. 'The . results of our study suggest that there are major problems with the . dating of the last Neanderthals in modern-day Spain,' said Thomas . Higham, deputy director of the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at Oxford . University. 'It is unlikely that Neanderthals survived any later in this area than they did elsewhere in mainland Europe.'","Researchers believe Neanderthals failed to adapt to hunting small animals once deer population dwindled .

"The days of drones needing to return to base to top up their batteries could soon be over. An MIT student has shown off a prototype system allowing a craft to land on a power line and recharge itself. The smart system uses the magnetic forces emitted by the lines to find the perfect place to perch itself. Scroll down for video . The MIT prototype that can land of a power line and recharge itself. It uses magnetic sensors to find the perfect place to perch. The system works using the power line's magnetic field. Four metres away from it, sensors in the plane's nose sense it, and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire, exactly like a bird. 'Small and micro UAVs have enabled a number of new mission capabilities, including navigatingin and around buildings and performing perch-and-stare surveillance,' wrote Joseph Moore, a PhD. candidate at MIT, who is developing the system. 'However, one of the primary limitations of these small vehicles is endurance, simply because they cannot carry suufficient power for long missions. However, Moore, who is a student at MIT's lab dedicated to developing small flying craft, realised that power was freely available - above the ground. 'Recent advances in xed-wing perching have made it possible to consider a new solution to this problem - landing on a powerline to recharge.' The system works using the power line's magnetic field. Four metres away from it, sensors in the plane's nose sense it, and allow the plane to fly itself so it lands perfectly on the wire, exactly like a bird. As the plane approaches the wire, it raises its nose to allow it to 'perch' on the wire with clamps where wheels would usually be. The U.S. Air Force is also working on a similar system, developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms, hover like bees, crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision. The Air Vehicles Directorate, a research arm of the Air Force, has released a computer-animated video outlining the the future capabilities of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The project, announced last year, promises to revolutionize war by down-sizing the combatants. 'MAVs will become a vital element in the ever-changing war-fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future,' the narrator intones. 'Unobtrusive, pervasive, lethal - Micro Air Vehicles, enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter.' One drone type soars like a pigeon and perches unobtrusively on a power line to observe a surveillance target with a camera. The Air Force is working on technology that will allow the drones to steal electricity from power cables and other sources - so they can continue to operate for days or weeks on end. Hovering: Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are the future of the unmanned drones program, according to a new video from the Air Force. The Air Force has already developed a drone capable of hovering like a moth . Perching: The video, released by the Air Vehicle Directorate, shows a pigeon-like drone that can draw power from an electrical wire while its camera watches a target . Crawling: The drones will be equipped with legs so that they can crawl through tight spaces like an insect . The project, which is based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was revealed in the March issue of the National Geographic magazine. Air Force officials said they have already produced tiny remote-control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes. Researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible. Still, the Air Force has a clear concept of what it hopes to accomplish with the program. The promotional video begins with a swarm of tiny drones be dropped on a city from a passing plane. The drones will work in concert to patch together a wide, detailed view of the battlefield - singling out individual targets without losing sight of the broader scene. 'Data will be communicated among the MAVs to enable real time, reliable decision-making and to provide an advanced overall picture for other platforms or operators,' the Air Force says. Killing: The video demonstrates how MAVs could be used to sneak up behind unsuspecting targets and kill them with a single, lethal shot . Lethal: The drones could be equipped with incapacitating chemicals, combustible payloads or even explosives 'for precision targeting capability' As the drones fall, they begin to fly - not like planes, but like insects. High frequency flapping wings allow the drones to hover and maneuver in tight spaces. The military has already produced a drone patterned after a hawk moth that can flap its wings 30 times a second. However, the activity exhausts the drone's tiny battery in just a few minutes, according to National Geographic.","MIT student has already developed working prototype .

"The discovery of a headless torso on the Malaysian island of Penang has sparked fears that there may be a serial killer on the loose in the former British colony. The murder victim, believed to be a woman, is the forty-sixth to be found on the island, a popular tourist destination, this year. The decapitated body was stuffed in a suitcase that was dumped near the island's Botanic Gardens on Thursday. The headless torso was discovered by a cleaner under a tree near the Botanic Gardens, pictured above . It comes just two days after another headless body - that of an Indonesian woman - was found floating in the sea off the coast of the island. And on Friday two human legs were found in an area being used for landfills, according to local newspaper the Sunday Star. Among the 46 victims discovered this year, 30 have been foreign nationals - 17 of whom were from Burma. It has prompted fears that the murderer is targetting foreigners. Senior police called for calm on the Malaysian island as a special police task force was being set up to investigate the gruesome crimes. Penang's police chief, Senior Deputy Commander Wira Abdul Rahim Hanafi, told the Sunday Star  that 'the situation is under control'. He also dismissed the idea that the killings could all have been carried out by one person. Many of the victims, who remain unidentified, have been found with their throats cut and wrapped in white cloth. Residents of Penang, pictured, are concerned that there could be a serial killer on the loose on the island . A number have been found dumped by the roadside in industrial areas of the island.

"Cleaners at the Olympic Park are being housed ten to a room at a huge temporary compound. The campsite in East London, hidden from public view, has 25 people sharing each toilet and 75 to each shower. They sleep in portable cabins, some of which have been leaking in the rain. Grim: Cleaners at the Olympic Park are being housed ten to a room at a huge temporary compound, pictured. The campsite in East London, hidden from public view, has 25 people sharing each toilet and 75 to each shower . And the bad weather has left the site flooded with stagnant water, forcing them to use abandoned crates as makeshift ‘stepping stones’ to move around the site. Hundreds have come from abroad to work at the Olympics despite promises that the jobs would go to Londoners. On arrival, some were horrified to be told there was no work for two weeks. But despite this, they were made to pay the cleaning company £18 a day in ‘rent’ to sleep in the overcrowded metal cabins, which works out at more than £550 a month. Others who had come to the UK desperate for the jobs turned back, describing  the camp as ‘horrible’, with showers and toilets ‘filthy’ from over-use. Poor conditions: The bad weather has left the site flooded with stagnant water, forcing the cleaners to use abandoned crates as makeshift 'stepping stones' to move around the site. This image shows how close the camp is to the Olympic Stadium . Andrea Murnoz, 21, a student from Madrid, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw the places people were sleeping. ‘When I first saw the metal gates and the tall tower in the middle, it reminded me of a prison camp. It looks horrible. 'I was thinking I would apply for a job, but I have changed my mind. My two friends signed up, but I think they are regretting it.’ Cleaners at the camp have signed gagging orders preventing them from talking to the Press and have been banned from having family and friends visit ‘for security reasons’. One worker, from Hungary, said conditions were ‘very bad’ inside the camp but he had nowhere else to live. ‘It is like a slum inside,’ the 24-year-old said. ‘The toilets are dirty and the space is very little.’ Another, also from Hungary, said: ‘When we saw the camp, we were shocked. When we came to England we thought accommodation would be much nicer. Employment: Hundreds of people have come from abroad to work at the Olympic Park . ‘Some of the cabins have been leaking and we have been told to fix them ourselves. Two girls have left already because they did not want to sleep in a room with men they didn’t know.’ Plans for the accommodation were backed . by London 2012 organiser Locog and waved through by the local council, . Newham, even though environmental health officers said the toilet and . shower facilities were ‘unlikely to be adequate’, while landscape . architects said the sleeping arrangements were ‘cramped’. Troops serving in Afghanistan could face extended tours of duty because of the Olympics security fiasco, it is feared. Some 3,500 service personnel men and women have been drafted in urgently for guard duties at the Games, potentially delaying battlefield training they would receive before deploying to Afghanistan. As a result, troops in Helmand are braced to spend an extra month there, although the Ministry of Defence denied there would be a knock-on effect on tours of duty. But councillors decided that because the . camp would be only temporary, concerns about the housing and welfare of . the workers were not ‘justifiable reasons for refusing planning . permission’. Any accommodation where more than two adults have to share a room is considered ‘overcrowded’ under housing laws. Health and safety guidelines state that employers should provide at least five toilets and five washbasins for every 100 people. Craig Lovett, of Spotless International Services which runs the camp, said the number of toilets and  showers per person exceeded requirements for temporary accommodation and that there were internet, medical and entertainment facilities on-site. He said shift patterns would reduce pressure on the facilities. He said unexpected heavy rain had been a ‘pain’ but the company was working tirelessly to sort things out. Messy: Some who had come to the UK desperate for the jobs turned back, describing the camp as 'horrible', with showers and toilets 'filthy' from over-use . He added: ‘This is not a prison. Nobody is forced to stay there. Many of our staff have come from areas where there is extremely high unemployment and are very happy to be working in the Games. ‘There will always be a couple of disgruntled people on site, but it’s a shame they didn’t come to talk to us to air their grievances because there are certainly processes in place for them to do that.’ A Locog spokesman said: ‘Cleanevent [part of Spotless] have assured us that the accommodation they are providing their workers is of a suitable standard.’ Plush: The conditions at the cleaners' camp are in stark contrast to the Olympic Village where the athletes will stay . Luxurious: Athletes in the Olympic Village will have access to a nice bar area complete with comfy armchairs and games . Workers fit out the container city in Hainault Forest with mattresses ready for the contract Olympic staff . Machinery is used to lift the heavy bedding to the upper level of the container housing so the rooms can be kitted out .","They sleep in portable cabins, some of which have been leaking in the rain, at the campsite in East London .

A study found that boys and girls born through IVF were just as chatty and independent as those whose mothers conceived naturally. However, when the IVF children were divided into two groups, there was a clear difference. Those created from embryos that were frozen before use were more sociable than those used when still ‘fresh’. Children born from frozen embryos are more sociable, chatty and independent than those born from embryos used when still 'fresh', a study found . Normally in IVF, the embryos thought to have the best chance of making a woman pregnant are used in treatment just a few days after they are made in a dish. Any that are left over can be frozen to allow her to try again if the treatment isn’t successful or if she wants to add to her family in a few years’ time. One in every 50 babies born in Britain is the result of IVF – and many of those will have started out as frozen embryos. Dr Allan  Pacey, a Sheffield University fertility expert, said it isn’t clear what’s behind the phenomenon. However, it may be that only the strongest embryos survive being frozen for several months before being thawed. Dagan Wells, an Oxford University IVF doctor, said it is possible the delay caused by freezing gives the woman’s body - including the delicate lining of her womb - time to recover from the powerful drugs given at the start of IVF treatment to boost egg production. Another possibility is that given that fresh embryos are normally used first and the frozen ones later, the ‘ice babies’ will be younger siblings. Younger brothers and sisters are often more laid back and more sociable than the more responsible eldest child. Normally in IVF, 'fresh' embryos thought to have the best chance of making a woman pregnant. Researchers  hope the finding will allay fears that children born from frozen embryos (pictured above) are somehow inferior . Professor Charles Kingsland, a consultant gynaecologist at Liverpool Women’s Hospital, said studies have suggested IVF babies are more sociable as adults. This may be because they tend to be born to older parent and so spend more time in adult company from a young age. He was sceptical that the finding is due to birth order. He said: ‘In my experience, when the first child was born from a fresh embryo and the second from a frozen one, the second child tends to be less socially integrated and a bit more stroppy.’ Researcher Lan-Feng Xing, of Zhejiang University in China, studied 250 kindergarten-age children. She hopes the finding will allay fears that children born from frozen embryos are somehow inferior. She presented her research at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu.","IVF children were just as chatty and independent as those born naturally .

"President Obama followed through on his threat to 'isolate' Russia for sending troops into the Ukraine against his wishes, suspending all military relations between the two countries on Monday. All scheduled military exercises, meetings and port visits are now cancelled in light of what Mr Obama considers a violation of international law. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent . troops into the Ukrainian sovereign region of Crimea over the weekend, . claiming he was trying to protect ethnic Russians from . 'ultra-nationalistic forces' in the country. 'We call on Russia to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine and for Russian forces in Crimea to return to their bases, as required under the agreements governing the Russia Black Sea Fleet,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement. Kirby added that while there has been speculation in the media about U.S. ship movements in the region, the Pentagon has not changed 'military posture in Europe or the Mediterranean'. Meeting with Israel: Mr Obama answers questions about the ongoing in situation in Ukraine while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office Monday . President Obama is currently working to rally Western allies in a united front against Russia's recent incursion on the Ukraine. 'I spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe, and I think the world is largely united in recognizing that the steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, their territorial integrity,' the president said. Russia justified its invasion of the Crimea to the UN Security Council on Monday, with Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin saying 'legitimately elected officials' had asked Russia to intervene. But U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power shot back, saying the move was 'not a consensual intervention...it is an act of aggression'. Defending the move: U.N. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin speaks during a meeting of the U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday . Calling out: U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power responded to Churkin's statements, saying it was not a 'consensual' incursion but an  'act of aggression' Russia's invasion of the Ukraine has been in response to the 2014 revolution which resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Moscow. President Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he sent troops into the Crimea to protect the ethnic Russians in the region from 'ultranationalistic forces'. About 60 per cent of those living in Crimea are ethnic Russians. But Russian forces seem to be acting as more than just peace keepers in the region. Armed men took control of two airports in the Crimea region on Friday in what Ukraine's government described as an invasion and occupation by Russian forces, stoking tension between Moscow and the West . Tensions rising: A Russian soldier on an armoured personnel carrier halted on a road in Ukraine around 20 miles from Sebastapol, where there is a large Russian military presence . Putin sent troops into the Crimea, going against President Obama's request that he not intervene. Above, Armed Russian navy servicemen surround a Ukrainian border guard base in in the Crimea region on Friday . On Monday, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Maksim Prauta announced that four Russian navy ships were blocking an anti-submarine warship and command ship and had ordered the crews to surrender or face seizure. Russian authorities have denied the incident. A source at the Defense Ministry told Interfax that the deadline to surrender was 5am Tuesday, but another source said no assault was planned and 'this is complete nonsense'. If true, a U.S. State Department spokesman said this would be a 'dangerous escalation' on Russia's part, for which they would be held accountable. As of 6am local time Tuesday, there had been no military action by the Russian forces, according to the Kyiv Post. Surrender? Ukrainian navy ship Slavutich is seen in Sevastopol harbor. Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials say that Russian forces have ordered them to surrender the ship and another an anti-submarine warship by 5am Tuesday. Pictured above on Monday .

Watching and waiting: People stand on board the Ukrainian navy corvette Ternopil at harbor of  Sevastopol, Ukraine on Monday . Back at the White House, Mr Obama said he believes Russia is on the wrong side of history, and should prepare itself for the consequences if it decides to proceed with military action in Crimea. 'But what cannot be done is for Russia, with impunity, to put its soldiers on the ground and violate basic principles that are recognized around the world,' Obama said. 'And I think the strong condemnation it's received from countries around the world indicates the degree to which Russia's on the wrong side of history in this.' President Obama said he is currently looking into ways to 'isolate' Russia including economic sanctions and restrictions on travel for Russian officials. 'What we are also indicating to the Russians is, if, in fact, they continue on trajectory that they're on, that we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic — that will isolate Russia. and will have a negative impact on Russia's economy and its status in the world,' President Obama said. He is also calling on Congress to approve an aid package for the Ukrainian government. A united front on Ukraine: Secretary of State John Kerry (left) and Vice President Joe Biden (right) listen to President Obama's talk with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday at the White House . 'One thing they can do right away is work with the administration to help provide a package of assistance to Ukraine, to the people, to the government,' Mr Obama said. 'At this stage, there should be unanimity among Democrats and Republicans … We should be able to come up with a unified position that stands outside of partisan politics. My expectation is that I'll be able to able to get Congress to work with us in order to be able to achieve that goal.' But allies such as France believe there are few options beyond that. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Russia's control of Crimea would not be easy to resolve. President Obama's latest comments come as he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week. Tomorrow, Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Kiev, where he will further relay Mr Obama's message of Ukrainian sovereignty. The president spoke with Putin on Friday for 90 minutes, but his Russian counterpart did not  take Mr Obama's advice to stay out of the region. So far the U.S. has suspended prep meetings for the upcoming G-8 Summit in Sochi, Russia and declined to send a delegation to the Paralympic Winter Games - also in Sochi.

"The owner of a Portland, Oregon microhome built of recycled materials is worried other tiny house dwellers are selling out. Phoenix and her partner's set of two 364-square-foot homes use Trader Joe's bags for wallpaper and tin cans for shingles, but not every micro-home owner is quite as frugal. 'Most of the tiny houses out there are mini-McMansions,' Pheonix says. Perfectly small: The owner of two Portland micro-homes says the tiny, frugal life is perfect for her family but fears the micro-home trend is losing touch with its roots . 'Most of the tiny houses out there are mini-McMansions,' says owner Pheonix as she stands in front of one of her two 364 square foot cottages . Phoenix lives in the set of miniature houses with her 24-year-old son and partner. They've personalized their abode out of found and repurposed goods like old bean sacks and hammered tomato sauce cans from a local pizza shop and she believe that's how things should be. 'This whole [tiny home] movement is about originality and creativity,' Phoenix says in a video by Kirsten Dirksen. Though short on space, creativity is something the homes do not lack. Phoenix's partner points out some more architectural quirks, such as the historical context of their porch swing. 'This is huge': Pheonix says she and her son, who lives in one of the two homes, used to live in a 3,500 square foot home in Maryland and hated it. She even thinks her tiny Portland abode is kinda roomy . Content: Phoenix hopes to never again require a full-size fridge or other big, modern convenience. She has just two pots to cook with and says it suits her and her family fine . 'Mid to late 19th century Dairy Queen,' he jokes. 'It's a Dairy Queen Formica bench.' The cramped quarters are made surprisingly livable thanks to vaulted ceilings, lots of sun and storage tricks like folding tables and a hideaway wine rack. Also notable are the window flower box made from a repurposed kitchen stove hood and light sconces made from roof tiles. 'We don't take our architectural pieces too seriously,' says Mr. Phoenix. 'We're after the cute factor.' The flower box on the home is actually an inverted restaurant stove hood with holes drilled in it. Here, Phoenix stands with her partner as they point out the home's architectural quirks . Creature comforts: Mr. Phoenix shows off the hatch to the home's crawlspace where they keep the wine .

Creative: Here, Phoenix's 24-year-old son draws in the loft he's made into an art studio . The home's siding is made of tomato cans recycled from a local pizza shop . Phoenix says the family used to live in a 3,500 square foot, four bedroom home in Maryland that had seven entrances but it never really felt like home. Downsizing has given the family a new lease on life, and even though their new haunt is a tenth the size of their old one, they're much happier. 'And this,' says Phoenix, 'is huge.' Pheonix's home has become a bit of a tourist attraction, but she says she glad to help spread the gospel of the micro-home lifestyle .",'Most of the tiny houses out there are mini-McMansions': Portland cabin owner says micro-homes are about creativity not trends .
"A young woman suffers with a condition that causes her to experience extreme emotional reactions to certain textures. The unnamed 22-year-old, known only as 'AW', was a patient of  Dr Vilayanur Ramachandran, a leading neuroscientist based at the the University of California in San Diego. In a recent article, he and his colleagues have revealed details of the patient who found that touching denim left her depressed and disgusted while contact with silk made her happy and contented. Disgusting: The woman referred to only as AW feels depressed if she comes into contact with denim fabric . Touching corduroy left her confused, leather aroused feelings of receiving criticism, multi-coloured toothpaste made her feel anxious, wax made her feel embarrassed, paracetomol tablets left her feeling jealous and different grades of sandpaper made her feel either guilt, relief, or as if she was telling a white lie. Synesthesia is a condition in which one sense is simultaneously perceived as if by one or more additional senses such as sight. Another . form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or . people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, colour or . flavour. Around four per cent of people are thought to have the condition which is eight times more common in women. Most synesthesists tend to be left-handed. There are no dangerous side-effects to the having the condition . Famous synesthesists include Marilyn Monroe, Mary J Blige as well as the artists Kandinsky and Hockney. After numerous tests, doctors concluded that AW suffered from a brain condition known as synaesthesia in which one sense produces a reaction from another sense because pathways in the brain are muddled. To compare reactions, Dr Vilayanur . Ramachandran and his colleague Dr David Brang then tested another 20-year-old . synesthesia suffer referred to as HS. HS felt no real emotion . when touching denim but was disgusted instead by the texture of fleece . and wax. Corduroy made her feel disappointed; bok choy made her feel . irritated, but smooth metal made her feel sedated and calm. He reported: 'In this subject, the . strongest emotion was evoked when she touched soft leather, which made . her feel extremely scared – she described the sensation as “making my . spine crawl.”' Sandpaper makes the anonymous synesthesia patient feel either guilt, relief, or as if she was telling a white lie . The scientists have reported in the journal Neurocase that the condition might have its roots in man's evolution. They wrote: 'Our primate ancestors may have evolved unconscious mechanisms for predicting the potential of an object to cause harm. 'Thus, tactile sensations which may be beneficial to survival (such as soft furs, for example, which provide warmth) may activate the parts of the limbic system mediating pleasure, whereas others which may be harmful (such as jagged stones) may be connected to those areas mediating aversion.'","An unnamed woman suffers with an extreme form of synesthesia, a condition that causes senses and emotions to become confused .

"Heroic: Rifleman Tuljung Gurung, of the Royal Gurkha Rifles, who has been awarded a military cross after fighting off a Taliban terrorist with his kukri, a traditional Gurkha knife . A hero Gurkha has won the Military Cross after single-handedly fighting off two armed Taliban attacking an Afghan patrol base... with just his ceremonial Kukri knife. Rifleman Tuljung Gurung tackled the gun-wielding insurgents armed only with his razor-sharp traditional Nepalese blade and forced them to flee. Incredibly, the soldier - now an acting Lance Corporal - battled them despite being dazed after a bullet smashed directly into his helmet and he was knocked down by shockwaves from an enemy hand grenade which he threw to safety when it landed next to him. Now the modest 28-year-old has won the third highest gallantry award for his courage in Afghanistan. Acting L/Cpl Gurung received the Military Cross for stopping the extremists from reaching sleeping British soldiers in the Helmand compound. Top brass said his selfless bravery had prevented a ‘potentially catastrophic loss of life’. He is among 117 servicemen and women who received awards in the operational honours list, published today. Most of the honours go to troops who served with 4 Mechanized Brigade in Helmand between October last year and April. Acting L/Cpl Gurung, who serves with the Royal Gurkha Rifles, was on duty at Patrol Base Sparta, in Nahr-e Seraj, at 4am on March 22 when he spotted two Afghans running towards his sangar, or watchtower. When he challenged them to stop, the insurgents opened fire with an AK47 assault rifle. One of the rounds struck him on the helmet, knocking him to the ground. Groggily getting to his feet, he saw a grenade bounce into the tower. Fearing it would explode, the married Gurkha picked it up and hurled it away a split-second before it detonated, the force of the blast throwing him to the floor. But as the dust and debris settled, Acting L/Cpl Gurung came face-to-face with one of the Taliban who was climbing into the 3 metre high sangar. L/Cpl Gurung drew his 18inch kukri and tenaciously took on the insurgent in hand-to-hand combat . Lacking room to aim his rifle, the soldier drew his 18inch kukri and tenaciously took on the insurgent in hand-to-hand combat. During the fight, the pair plunged to the ground outside the base. In a life-or-death struggle, Acting L/Cpl Gurung continued to lash out with the blade. He said: ‘He was quite a bit bigger than me. I just hit him in the hand, body, I just started to hit him. ‘I just thought, “I don’t want to die. If I am alive I can save my colleagues”. ‘I thought, “Before he does something I have to do something”. I was like a madman.’ Faced with his ferocity, the Taliban turned and fled. Acting L/Cpl Gurung’s citation said he had displayed the ‘highest levels of gallantry and courage’. Cpl Josh Griffiths of the Mercian Regiment, left, was given the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for saving his comrades despite having a broken back and Marine Craig Buchanan, right, won a Military Cross for 'inspirational bravery' when two comrades were murdered in cold-blood by two rogue Afghan policemen . Corporal Josh Griffiths ‘saved the lives of his wounded comrades’ when he repelled a Taliban suicide mission on March 25 - despite having a broken back. The 24-year-old, of the 1st Battalion the Mercian Regiment (Cheshire), suffered the injury when an insurgent drove a truck packed with explosives at Patrol Base Folad in Nad-e Ali, blasting a 40-metre hole in the perimeter wall. Cpl Griffiths, from the Wirral, Merseyside, was about to tuck into his evening meal, when the enemy struck. ‘The next thing I remember it was dark, I was on my back and one of the lads was screaming,’ he said. Despite wearing no body armour, Cpl Griffiths grabbed a light machine gun, charged forward and opened fire on the insurgents who were less than 50metres away. He also suffered an eye injury during the battle. But his heroism stopped the 30 Taliban and allowed casualties to be evacuated. Flight Lieutenant Chris Gent, 31, from Swanage, Dorset, risked his life by flying a Chinook through fog so thick visibility was only 30metres to save a severely-wounded Afghan soldier. File picture . One British soldier, Lance Corporal Jamie Webb, 24, died in the attack and 14 were injured. Cpl Griffiths, awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - one level below the Victoria Cross - said: ‘It is a great honour to be recognised but we lost someone that day and I’d rather him be alive and not have the medal.’ Royal Marine Craig Buchanan, 26, won a . Military Cross for ‘inspirational bravery’ when two comrades were . murdered in cold-blood by two rogue Afghan policemen. He . was part of an eight-man patrol in Nahr-e Saraj last October when the . traitors opened fire, killing Corporal Channing Day, 25, and Corporal . David O’Connor, 27. Unsighted . because of the swirling dust, Marine Buchanan, who lives in Exmouth, . Somerset, restrained from firing for fear of mistakenly hitting a . comrade. ‘That is the ultimate soldier’s nightmare,’ he said. But displaying nerveless bravery, he manoeuvred to stand in the line of fire between the remaining gunman and the stricken troops. He then shot the gunman dead. His citation reads: ‘Buchanan’s quick thinking and bravery saved lives and prevented a difficult situation from escalating.’ RAF Flt Lt Christopher Gent received a Queen's Commendation for Bravery in the Air .

Fearlessly flying the aircraft just 20ft . from the grounded, often at walking speed, he avoided perilous obstacles . including trees, observation balloons and insurgents on the ground. Despite being evacuated, the casualty died. Flt Lt Gent’s citation commended his ‘skill, courage, calmness and exemplary leadership under significant pressure’. He said: ‘As we were flying, I was thinking, “It doesn’t get worse than this.” But it was balancing the risk to the crew with that of the life of the casualty.’ Cpl Oliver Bainbridge has been awarded the Military Cross . A soldier who has been blown up at least three times during his military career has been recognised for his brave actions in Afghanistan. Corporal Oliver Bainbridge has been awarded the Military Cross for a 'display of personal courage, selfless commitment and inspired leadership'. But the 25-year-old, from the Royal Dragoon Guards, confessed that some of his colleagues have joked that they might not like to stand too close to him in the future, because of his tendency to get blown up. Cpl Bainbridge was the commander of an armoured Jackal vehicle in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, when it was blown up by a IED. He dragged the driver of the vehicle into a crater made by the bomb when insurgents began firing. He said: 'I laid on top of him to protect him, he was helpless and couldn't do anything. 'We couldn't even get our heads up out of the crater, the firing was that accurate, it was really close.' Once other soldiers started returning fire, Cpl Bainbridge organised moving his injured colleague to the relative safety of another vehicle. He later returned to the Jackal to recover any sensitive equipment, while still being shot at. The incident, last November, was the third time he has been blown up by an IED - similar incidents happened while he was in vehicles during a previous tour. 'It's inevitable you're going to think ""what if?"" when you have these near misses but you just have to stop yourself from doing it, because if I carried on thinking like that I wouldn't be able to go out and do my job.' Cpl Bainbridge, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, said although he shared some of his near misses with girlfriend Georgina James, he had kept his mother sheltered from some of his more dangerous situations. 'When I first told my mum (about the Military Cross) she was angry - she said, ""It means you've done something dangerous"". She is proud though, both her and my dad are really proud. 'My dad said he couldn't stop shaking for a few hours.'","Tuljung Gurung fought desperately to protect his comrades .

"Katarina, the world’s loneliest orangutan, has been moved to a new zoo where, for the first time in her life, she will mix and play with other apes. And those who have campaigned for her freedom after her plight was revealed by MailOnline last November hope that she will even find herself a boyfriend among her new companions. Once the private pet of Malaysian royalty before she grew into adulthood, she was passed on to her first zoo where she was locked in a compound by day and a cage at night, living out a heartbreakingly-lonely existence. Scroll down for video . Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan, plays on a rope, which was her only plaything in her enclosure in Lipis Zoo, Malaysia. She will now have companions for the first time in her life . Katarina peers out through the bars of the night cage where she used to have to sleep on a concrete floor . The 12-year-old is believed to have never seen another of her species apart from her murdered mother . Campaigners hope the horrendous conditions Katarina endured will now be a thing of the past . Visitors to the Kuala Lipis zoo, 80 miles east of Kuala Lumpur, teased her by throwing junk food and pieces of rubbish at her and even tried to get her to smoke cigarettes that were tossed into her compound. When I visited the zoo I was saddened to find Katarina, aged about 12, sitting at the top of a dead tree staring out across houses that were spreading into the nearby jungle, her natural habitat. Wildlife activist Upreshpal Singh, director of the Friends of the Orangutans group who accompanied me to the zoo, said at the time: ‘Sadly, she thinks she’s the only orangutan in the world - apart from perhaps having a memory of her murdered mother. ‘And there is no doubt her mother was murdered because no-one would be able to take a baby from its mother without being savaged. ‘The mother had to have been killed, perhaps by villagers or people protecting palm oil plantations, and then we believe Katarina ended up as a pet with a member of one of Malaysia’s royal families. ‘Once she became too big to be kept as a pet, she was passed onto the zoo - and a new life of total loneliness began. ‘She doesn’t even know how to behave like an orangutan. She has shown no natural behaviours.’ Katarina had no bedding and was forced to sit on cold concrete every day for at least 12 hours after the zoo closed its doors at the end of visiting hours. Katarina sitting forlornly at the top of a bare tree as suburbia spreads towards her in her old Lipis home . The forgotten ‘wild woman of Borneo’ - early explorers referred to orangutans as 'The Wild Men of Borneo' - came to the attention of Mr Singh, who in turn drew my attention to Katarina’s unhappy life. ‘I only need to look into her eyes and I can see the loneliness there,’ he said. ‘Where is the spark that I’ve seen in other orangutans? She sits around without a soul nearby because everything has had to be fenced off to try to stop people throwing stuff at her. ‘She’s been sitting in a tree, which has no leaves and stays there all day, doing nothing, because there has been no other orangutan for her to associate with and play with. ‘Katarina has been as miserable as sin and I’m determined to get her moved to a place where there are other orangutans and where she can be happy for the rest of her life.’ Now Mr Singh’s hopes have been realised - or almost. While he wanted her to be moved to a rehabilitation centre, he has had to accept that Katarina’s rehousing in another zoo is better than keeping her in the Lipis compound. Malaysia’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks revealed today that Katarina was moved last Thursday to the Taiping Zoo and Night Safari in Perak, 130 miles north of Kuala Lumpur, where she is being quarantined before she will be introduced to the other orangutans at her new zoo. The move came after Mr Singh and his organisation handed over a petition to several ministries, including the Prime Minister’s office, stressing the urgency to move the orangutan. More than 14,000 people from around the world - many of whom were moved by MailOnline’s story - signed the petition begging for her to be moved to another zoo or sanctuary where she would be able to mix with other apes. Katarina 'doesn’t even know how to behave like an orangutan', says campaigner Upreshpal Singh . Within days of the petition being handed in to wildlife officials, Katarina was being moved to her new home. The wildlife department has confirmed that Katarina’s new home was inspected last year and was found to be complying with regulations. Once a special permit was approved, Katarina was moved to the Taiping Zoo where she will soon be introduced to her new friends, who are of the same species of orangutan. ‘It’s not an absolutely perfect result, but it’s much, much better than where she was,’ said Mr Singh. ‘We’re all hoping now that she will find happiness at last.’ Today it is estimated that only 50,000 orangutans remain in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on Borneo, which is shared by Indonesia and Malaysia. Their world is dying around them, as trees come down to make way for oil palm plantations and adult apes and babies are hacked to death by workers protecting the planted trees. For those people, hungry orangutans are pests which must be destroyed.

"Sainsbury’s is trying a radical approach as it attempts to reduce the environmental impact of transporting toilet rolls to its stores. The supermarket chain is shrinking the diameter of the cardboard tubes inside its own-brand toilet paper. Each roll will be 11 millimetres slimmer – 112mm instead of 123mm – while the number of sheets will remain as 240. Sainsbury's is shrinking the diameter of the cardboard tubes inside its own-brand toilet paper (not pictured) With each Briton getting through an average of 50 toilet rolls a year, supplying it involves huge costs and has a big impact on the environment. Sainsbury’s claims the move will avoid 500 annual lorry trips from suppliers to stores and save 140 tons of carbon dioxide. It insists customers will not struggle to squeeze the new toilet rolls onto holders. Spokesman Kate Tucker said: ‘We wanted to shrink the tube as much as possible and this was as far as we could go to guarantee that it will still fit customers’ toilet roll holders.’ Sainsbury's claims the move will avoid 500 annual lorry trips from suppliers to stores and save 140 tons of carbon dioxide . In the past, manufacturers including Andrex have made rolls last longer by increasing sheet numbers. But this is thought to be the first time that any firm has tried to change the size of the tube inside. The new rolls will be go sale next month at the same price as before – £1.99 for four. Miss Tucker said the change would give ‘an essential household product a lower carbon footprint.’ She added: ‘Shoppers will get the same amount of toilet paper but with a smaller tube and therefore less packaging – including the outside film.’","Average Briton gets through 50 toilet rolls a year .

"Ministers are to scrap plans for a ‘conservatory tax’ following a massive Tory backlash. A senior Government source told the Mail that the proposals are ‘dead in the water’. This latest abrupt U-turn comes only a week after we revealed the move which would force homeowners to fork out hundreds of pounds extra on measures to improve energy efficiency when they build an extension or fit a boiler. Although the Liberal Democrat-inspired plans are still out for consultation, the source said: ‘We are absolutely not going to have a conservatory tax. It is an attack on aspiration and we want nothing to do with it. It will be blocked.’ Green tax: Ministers are to scrap plans for a 'conservatory tax' following a massive Tory backlash . The rethink came as ministers struggled to regain control of the political agenda after an Easter break dominated by Budget rows over tax raids on charities, churches and the elderly. On another tumultuous day for the Coalition, key developments included: . ■ Ministers signalling a climbdown over a planned cap on tax relief for charitable donations, as a survey showed two-thirds of Coalition MPs are against it. ■ Tory Party treasurer Lord Fink joining the criticism of the charity cap, warning it would slash donations to good causes. ■ The deans of 23 cathedrals warning that George Osborne’s plan to slap VAT on listed building alterations ‘seriously jeopardises the sustainability of our great buildings’. ■ Nick Clegg admitting the Government was in ‘a rut where every potentially good story turns into a bad one’. ■ Senior Tory David Davis warning the Government had made a series of ‘straightforward unforced errors’ in recent weeks. ■ Labour announcing it is to force a Commons vote this week on the so-called ‘granny tax’. The £3.5billion raid will hit 4.4million pensioners, with some losing up to £323 a year. ■ David Cameron defending himself against charges of grandstanding on the world stage after spending all of last week out of the country on a tour of the Far East. The Mail’s revelation last week that ministers planned to force millions of homeowners to install costly energy efficiency measures when making home improvements infuriated Tory MPs. Under the ‘mandatory’ scheme anyone wanting to build a conservatory, replace a broken boiler or install new windows would have to seek permission from the council. It could then require them to improve the energy efficiency of their homes by investing in measures such as loft and wall insulation and draught-proofing. Block: A powerful group of Tory ministers, . including the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, left, Employment Minister . Chris Grayling, right, and Housing Minister Grant Shapps, mobilised quickly to . block the move . Loans would be available under the Government’s £14billion Green Deal scheme to help pay for the measures, the cost of which could run into hundreds of pounds. But the scheme alarmed many Conservatives, who feared it would deter families wanting to improve their homes. MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘We should be supporting aspirational families who want to better themselves and improve their homes, not clobbering them. It is a crackpot scheme and I hope it is strangled at birth.’ Fellow Tory Mark Pritchard said: ‘The tax on conservatories should be renamed a tax on Conservatives. It is another anti-aspiration tax, and a tax on one of the UK’s favourite hobbies – DIY.’ A powerful group of Tory ministers, including the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, Employment Minister Chris Grayling and Housing Minister Grant Shapps, mobilised quickly to block the move. Mr Cameron is also said to have been alarmed by the proposal. The controversial measure is included in a consultation issued by Mr Pickles’s Department for Communities and Local Government. Ministers planned to force millions of homeowners to install costly energy efficiency measures when making home improvements . Sources said it had been included at the behest of former Lib  Dem Energy Secretary Chris Huhne as a result of Coalition ‘horse-trading’. Mr Huhne has since been forced to step down to fight criminal charges over allegations that he asked his former wife Vicky Pryce to take speeding points on his behalf. A source said: ‘It is a shame that the idea ever made it into the consultation at all, but the Lib Dems got their way.’ A senior Government figure said the mandatory element of the scheme would be dropped when the final proposals are published. ‘We are not against people insulating their homes and we are not against the Green Deal, but it should not be mandatory,’ he said. The decision to scrap the ‘conservatory tax’ before it has even got off the ground is likely to anger some Lib Dems. A source close to the new Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey defended the proposal, saying it would save homeowners money in the long term. ‘We are just asking people to make improvements to make their homes more energy efficient – it seems to me that actually helps the homeowner,’ said the source. ‘Of all the building regulations there are, this is one of the few where the entire financial benefit accrues to the homeowner. It will save them money on their fuel bills over the medium to long term.’ However, a raft of recent research  has cast doubt on the level of savings claimed by the Government. Some pilot studies have found that the cost of energy efficiency measures is far higher than the savings on bills.","Move would force homeowners hundreds of pounds on energy efficiency measures when they build an extension or fit a boiler .

"This should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever been on a long road trip or an all-inclusive holiday with their in-laws. As the half-term holiday approaches, a recent survey has revealed that just three per cent of Brits would prefer to go on a trip with their partner’s parents. It appears men enjoy – or tolerate – trips with their in-laws far more than women do. Of the three per cent who would welcome such a getaway, two-thirds were male. We are family: A survey found that just three per cent of Brits would prefer to go on a trip with their in-laws . Bring the kids? Only 30 per cent of those polled said they prefer to travel with their children . The survey asked 1,000 UK adults to rank their top travel companions and it found that travel is not always a family affair. Just 13 per cent of respondents said they prefer to go on holiday with their parents, with a higher percentage of women favouring getaways with mum and dad. In comparison, six per cent said they prefer to travel alone than with a partner, friend or someone else, according to the poll commissioned by travel search website Momondo.co.uk.

"Courageous: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with Prince William and their son Prince George, had the perfect birth she was hoping for . The Duchess of Cambridge delivered her son perfectly – without recourse to any powerful painkillers. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Kate had a completely natural birth after arriving at the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, just after 5.30am last Monday. As four midwives monitored the as-yet unborn baby, the Queen’s former gynaecologist watched closely behind the glass of the £5,000-a-night suite. Assisted by two other top medics, Marcus Setchell – who delayed his retirement to oversee the birth of the third in line to the Throne – made sure the birthing plan went without a hitch. Kate’s calm demeanour once Prince George was in her arms – and the gentle support of her husband Prince William – truly moved the seven-strong medical team. Although the Duchess was in labour for 11 hours, sources in London have told The Mail on Sunday that she opted not to have powerful painkillers. The precise sequence of events in the delivery room will always remain a closely guarded secret for those present – and they have refused all requests for interview. But the family of neonatologist Dr Sunit Godambe, who was on hand to check the health of the newborn Prince, have told of their pride that their treasured son helped deliver a future King. At their home in a Mumbai suburb, Dr Godambe’s closest relatives spoke of the honour he had brought to the family. When his family phoned Dr Godambe the day after the birth, they congratulated him on his role. His eldest brother Nitin said: ‘The first thing we told him was that we were so proud of him.’ As he spoke, Dr Godambe’s 82-year-old mother, Jyotsna Godambe, who lives in the less fashionable east side of Mumbai’s Bandra suburb, glowed with pride. Dressed in an immaculate white sari with gold, red and pale blue details, Jyotsna smiled broadly as she explained: ‘When we spoke to Sunit on the phone, he said he just did the delivery with the other doctors and it was normal. ‘We have had so many friends and relatives calling because everyone is very happy.’ Jyotsna said that she spoke to her son, he was modesty personified. Though her son has just helped to deliver the new Prince, she confessed that she knew little about the Royal Family. Even so, the moment the birth was announced, her friends and neighbours started ringing to congratulate her, she said. ‘His ambition was always to be a doctor,’ said his mother. ‘He would play games of doctors and patients. He was very clever at school and always winning competitions.’ Newborn: Kate was in labour for 11 hours before giving birth to George, pictured . Sunit, the youngest of three brothers, is married to another doctor and the couple, who live in Middlesex, have a son and a daughter. As his family clustered around the phone at their home in Mumbai, almost 5,000 miles from the West London hospital, Dr Godambe told them of his joy at helping the delivery. The consultant did not disclose any confidential medical details, but said he had been honoured to take part in such a historic occasion. ‘He said it was very exciting and he was so happy,’ said his brother Nitin, 54. The medical team had been meticulously preparing for the delivery for a month. Experts: The Duchess had a top team on hand to help her through the birth including gynaecologists Marcus Setchell (centre) and Alan Farthing (right) It is understood from sources that there were no problems, no scares, no alarms, and everything went according to plan. The medical team who helped Kate through the birth was overseen by Mr Setchell. The Duchess was also monitored by a team of midwives throughout her labour. Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, professor of midwifery at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, led the team, which also featured Arona Ahmed, a married mother of two from East London, Jacqueline Venkatesh, from Harlow, Essex, and Lisa Greene, from East London. All three had to cover shifts over a 24-hour period and had been on stand-by in case the Duchess went into premature labour. Top facility: The Duchess was rushed to the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital where she gave birth to Prince George on Monday evening . When George was born it is believed that Ms Venkatesh was the midwife on duty, although Professor Dunkley-Bent was also in the room for the textbook delivery. The others there to share the joyous moment were Mr Setchell, his assistant consultant obstetrician, Guy Thorpe-Beeston, and Dr Godambe. Dr Godambe is a specialist in complex and high-risk births, and it was his job to check Prince George’s health the instant he was delivered. Dr Godambe’s middle brother, Vinit, 52, described him as the ‘intelligent one of the family’. ‘He was always very sincere about what he was doing,’ said Vinit, who runs a car rental business. Dr Godambe studied paediatrics in India before becoming a neonatologist. ‘He has delivered a lot of babies in his time but he was the happiest person when he did this one,’ said Vinit. Nitin said their late father worked as a neighbourhood official for the Mumbai municipal corporation. It was a well-respected position, he said, but his brother was the one who had really made good. ‘Sunit was a very clever student. His wife is a doctor, and their son wants to become one too,’ Vinit added. Dr Godambe and his family moved to the UK ten years ago but return to India once a year to visit family, said Nitin. ‘Sunit likes the UK and the people are good. He is a big fan of the Royal Family and we are so proud of him for what he has done.’ One hospital insider said last night: ‘Sunit Godambe is quite brilliant but is the last person who would wish to appear on TV. That’s just not his personality. His skills in treating sick babies, however, are renowned.’ The Duke and Duchess’s spokesman declined to make any comment about ‘such a private moment’. I gave birth to my sons Jake and David on the Lindo Wing and, like Kate, was under the care of obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston. So I understand how Kate stayed so serene in the glare of all those cameras when she leftSt Mary’s. Mr Thorpe-Beeston is so calm and reassuring, and that transmits to his patients. Safe hands: Nina Forman and her daughter Orli in the Lindo Wing with newborn David . My son Jake, whom Mr Thorpe-Beeston delivered in 2002, was by far my easiest birth – even though he was born on Bonfire Night! It was so noisy with fireworks going off outside, but Mr Thorpeand a dedicated chef was on hand to whip up delicious meals for patients and guests. Beeston kept me calm – even joking that Jake would be a noisy child because of the fireworks. The Lindo has eight bedrooms, all with separate bathrooms and a separate delivery room. The wing has recently been refurbished, but when I was there, it was quite standard: a metal bed and ordinary cotton sheets. There was a special Lindo Wing-branded washbag filled with toiletries in the bathroom and a dedicated chef was on hand to whip up delicious meals for patients and guests. I was shown how to breastfeed properly, how to bathe the baby and how to change a nappy. And a physiotherapist taught me pelvic floor and tummy exercises – all part of the wonderful service. My husband Saul and I had decided to go private for safety reasons. Saul’s aunt was starvedof oxygen at birth, born disabled and died at 12. So, yes, it cost £5,000 even back in 2002 – but what price your children’s health?","Duchess of Cambridge gave birth without recourse to powerful painkillers .

Extravagant: The Presidential Suite costs £19,784.40 - more than most of the striking workers make in a year . Another unnamed maid and mother-of-two added: 'I've worked in this hotel for 15 years and my salary has never increased. We decided to go on strike because employees at other luxury hotels are better paid than us.' A spokesperson for Le Royal Monceau – Raffles Paris said: 'The strike, by some of the employees of Le Royal Monceau – Raffles Paris, initiated by delegates of the CGT union, continues. Only 11 per cent of the hotel’s total employees are involved. 'The management of the hotel respects the right of these employees to strike.

"Accused: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could face spy charges in the U.S. after a court revealed his apparent 'role' in the theft of secret military documents, it emerged today. Lawyers have produced logs of online chats they claim show him coaching U.S. Private Bradley Manning how to break passwords to gain access to military computer networks. The prosecutors made the allegations in an hour-long presentation at Manning's pre-trial hearing for allegedly uploading 700,000 stolen documents to WikiLeaks. They disclosed three new excerpts  taken from the Guantanamo-held suspect's personal Macintosh laptop. In one, he allegedly asks Mr Assange for help in figuring out a password. In another, he tells him,  'I'm throwing everything I've got on at you now' and estimates the 'upload is about 36 pct' complete.To which the 40-year-old WikiLeaks boss replied, according to the prosecutors, 'OK . . . great.' He has denied direct contact with Manning, but his lawyers believe the evidence produced in the military court would form an espionage conspiracy case against their client.

He said: ""The most important issue here are our games, and Saturday [the match against Gibraltar] is really, really important. We have come off the back of a great win against Georgia and it's important to focus on that. ""Whatever headline... let's just say we came here and there hadn't been a book - there would have been something else, seriously. ""He [Keane] would have slipped down there on the field and we'd have been talking about that, maybe broken his leg or something like that. There would have been something. ""There will always be something here in the lead-up to games, and that I can guarantee. The Irishman's latest publication reveals more on the deterioration of his relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson . The former Manchester United captain also wrote of problems with goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel . Keane had a volatile relationship with Patrick Vieira but revealed he respects the former Arsenal captain . ""I genuinely don't know what the headlines are in the book. It obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another - the very fact he put his name to this book would suggest that it's exactly what would happen. ""It's there and it doesn't matter. The games are the most important things for us."" Asked if he had discussed the book with Keane in advance, O'Neill said: ""I thought about it at one stage or another but then, why? He's over 21 - I think - and he should be capable of dealing with his own stuff."" O'Neill, who asked Keane to join him in the Republic set-up when he was appointed in November last year, has had to become used to the focus he attracts ever since, with the approach from Celtic and Aston Villa's subsequent successful attempt to appoint him as Paul Lambert's assistant during the summer cases in point. Away from all the media attention Keane was busy putting the Ireland players through their paces on Tuesday lunchtime ahead of the qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany . However, while much of his own time in front of the media is spent fielding questions about his number two, he is adamant it is not an issue for him. ""Not necessarily, not at all,"" O'Neill said. ""He's an iconic figure. He's been here for a long time - you know that. He was an absolutely fantastic footballer and now he's making his way in management."" O'Neill was in relaxed mood as he was quizzed about Keane's book, and even joked about the former Ireland captain's burgeoning beard after recently jokingly questioning the sartorial elegance - or otherwise - of the Irish media pack. Asked if he would be having a word with the 43-year-old, he said: ""Well I must admit, I might well do because he looks really bedraggled. There is no doubt at all about it but I think he wants to join your group, so I think that's the essence of it."" The Republic of Ireland will be taking on Gibraltar and Germany in their upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers . Darron Gibson (right) says there have been a few jokes made within the Ireland camp about Keane's book . Within the camp, the players too were taking all the fuss in their stride. Former United midfielder Darron Gibson said: ""There have been a few comments, but nobody's talking about it. The lads just get on with it. There have been a few jokes made around the table, but, like I said, nothing serious. ""I have not seen any of the comments, to be honest with you, so I'm in no position to be comment on it. I'd rather not."" Asked if Keane is the type of assistant whose leg players can pull, Gibson replied with a smile: ""I've not tried. I'll let you try first."" Meanwhile, O'Neill has called 20-year-old Hull defender Brian Lenihan into his squad after losing Seamus Coleman, as well as Shay Given and James McCarthy, due to injury for the double-header.

"The captain of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is nothing more than a geek who took his work home with him, investigators have today revealed. Police officers probing the disappearance of flight MH370 said they do not believe the captain had practised sabotaging his own aircraft on his own flight simulator. Speculation had been rife that Captain Zahaire Ahmad Shah had spent time on his flight simulator at home in Kuala Lumpur, working out how to make the Boeing 777 'invisible' after it took off bound for Beijing on March 8. Scroll down for video . Investigators probing the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are understood to have found nothing suspicious on the flight simulator and computer seized at Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's (pictured) Kuala Lumpur home . CNN today reported police sources had revealed after reassembling the simulator at police headquarters, experts believe it showed nothing suspicious. The same applied to the captain's computer, it was claimed. With nothing lurking on either device that raised alarm bells, the discovery appears to corroborate the protests by 53-year-old Zaharie's family and friends that he was noting more than a 'tech geek' who loved flying so much, that he took his work home with him. The claims only serve to deepen the mystery of what happened to the aircraft as the search enters its twelfth day, spanning an area the size of Australia. If, as sources claim, the flight simulator and the captain's computer are free of any suspicious material, it diverts suspicion from him, but does nothing to solve the mystery of what else could have caused the plane to suddenly turn in a westwards direction, towards the Strait of Malacca. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak today said someone with a high degree of flying skills had deliberately disabled the communication system. Investigators retrieve deleted files from captain Shah's home flight simulator which allegedly showed him rehearsing a landing on a small runway after flying above the southern Indian Ocean . As suspicion shifts away from Captain Zaharie (right), police officers are said to be refocusing on co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid (left) whose last words before communication with the aircraft was lost were 'all right, good night' But with the evidence appearing to . point the finger away from the captain, suspicion is set to fall back on . to co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. The . 27-year-old's last words before all communication with the aircraft . ceased, were 'All right, good night' - which is not a normal sign off. Some . experts have suggested that late at night, flying over a ‘quiet . region’, like the South China Sea, pilots do sometimes chatter idly over . their radios. he revelation comes as a satellite image appeared to show the missing plane in the skies above an expanse of jungle. The image is taken from Tomnod, the map search website currently being used by hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to search for missing passenger plane, was posted on Reddit on Sunday. The authenticity of the photo has not yet been verified and the region depicted in the photo is as yet unknown. Intriguingly, the plane appears to have been painted white. A satellite image provided by Tomnod, an online map website, appears to show a passenger plane in jungle . Spotted: Thai military say they picked up an unidentified aircraft on radar bearing off the flight path, heading left over Malaysia and towards the Strait of Malacca . The image was found by an university student in Taiwan, according to Taiwan's China Times. The . image has surfaced at the same time as the news that Malaysian . villagers claim to have seen the missing Malaysian Airlines jet flying . over the north east of the country at around the time the aircraft is . thought to have made a 'U-turn'. At least nine people - tuna . fishermen, farmers and villagers - in the Malaysian state of Kelantan . have made reports to police about seeing lights in the sky and some said . they heard the loud noise of an engine. These . accounts appear to match the conclusions of investigators who say the . jet flew low to avoid radar after making a sharp turn and heading west . from its course over the South China Sea. Investigators . told the New Straits Times that they were now convinced the aircraft . flow low over the village, which is in the north east - exactly the same . area where the villagers and fishermen who saw bright lights in the sky . and heard noises on the night the jet vanished are living. The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board . 'Terrain masking', as illustrated here, is a technique used by pilots to avoid radar detection . Investigators told a Malaysian . newspaper that the Boeing 777 had dropped to a lower altitude - under . 5,000ft - to avoid ground radar, using the surrounding terrain as a . sonar barrier. Mr Alif . Fathi Abdul Hadi, 29 who said he saw the light heading towards the South . China Sea at 1.45am on the night the aircraft disappeared. Lending . credibility to the account by Mr Alif is the claim by fisherman Azid . Ibrahim, 55, who saw a bright light streaking overhead at 1.30am on . Saturday, about 100 miles south of where Mr Alif had seen the light. Mr Alif told said the bright light . was the type that aircraft use when taking off and landing at night - . like a car uses its headlights. 'I was walking towards the rear of my house when I saw the light, and wondered where it was heading to,' he said. 'The airspace here is like a highway for aircraft and they usually travel in routine patterns. 'However, . the light I saw was moving towards a completely different direction. It . was going towards the sea, near Bachok (which lies to the south of Mr . Alif's home).' Another theory today examined the possibility that a fire on board, caused by a bomb hidden in the cargo hold among four tonnes of mangosteens - an exotic fruit about the size of an orange - could have downed the flight. An explosion could cause the cabin to lose all compressions and render the pilots unconscious before they were able to apply their oxygen masks. The theory is supported by one witness, who claims to have spotted an aircraft on fire over the South China Sea. New Zealander Mike McKay, working on an oil rig off the southern coast of Vietnam, claims to have seen what he believed was an aircraft on fire at about the time all communication with MH370 was lost.","Suspicion fell on Captain Zahaire Ahmad Shah when investigators discovered a simulator at his Kuala Lumpur home .

"Roberto Martinez will meet Samuel Eto’o this weekend to discover his plans as the striker edges closer to leaving Everton. Eto’o missed the FA Cup replay with West Ham on Tuesday after he told Martinez he was not in the right frame of mind to play; Everton’s manager then gave him permission to travel to the Middle East, where he has an offer from Qatari side Al Gharafa. The three-time Champions League winner is also the subject of strong interest from Sampdoria and his agent, Claudio Vigorelli, claimed he has agreed a deal to move to Genoa, despite a lucrative offer from Brazilian side Santos.

Eto’o missed the clash with West Ham after he told Martinez he was not in the right frame of mind to play . Should Eto’o leave, Everton would look to command a fee but Martinez has not ruled out the possibility of the 33-year-old still being at Goodison Park beyond the window. So far he has made 12 starts in all competitions and if that figure were to reach 15, Eto’o would automatically trigger a one-year extension to stay at Everton and Martinez wants to see what his intentions are going forward and if he is able to play against West Brom on Monday. ‘Sampdoria haven't contacted us,’ said Martinez. ‘We don't know. Maybe he has made his mind up. He has trained really well. Whether he is involved on Monday is something I’m going to decide before the game, depending on the needs of the squad and the needs of Samuel. ‘I'm not looking at these games for Samuel to be involved because it's not right, unless we have made a decision one way or the other, which allows Samuel to be fully focused on what he's doing. While the window is open, he is allowed to consider his options. If he stays, we will welcome that.’ There have been suggestions Eto’o has become a disruptive influence in the dressing room but Martinez said: ‘No, no. I know we have a lot of these stories coming out but the players laugh at them. There is nothing sinister. He has a few options and is looking at them.’ The Cameroonian striker signs autographs for Everton fans outside Goodison Park .

"A sixth suspect was arrested Friday in connection with the September shooting of 13 people in a Chicago park. Darren Curtis, 28, faces a litany of charges for his involvement in the Sept 19 mass shooting on the basketball court of a South Side park. Mr Curtis has been charged with three counts of attempted murder and three counts of aggravated assault, a Chicago Police Department spokesperson told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . The sixth person arrested: Darren Curtis, 28, is the latest person arrested in connection with the September shooting at Chicago's Cornell Park . Mr Curtis was apprehended Friday at his South Side home, police said. He is expected to appear Sunday afternoon in Central Bond Court. It is not exactly clear how Mr Curtis was involved in the attack, and officials are not commenting at this time. The arrests come as the youngest . victim- 3-year-old Deonta Howard- is said to be making a speedy recovery after he was shot in the cheek. Police . have identified two gunmen and three others who were accomplices, most of . whom face attempted murder and aggravated battery charges. Recovering: Deonta Howard, 3, was hit with a bullet in the cheek during the gang-related shooting on Thursday . Next steps: The boy is due to be released on Wednesday and his mother Shamarah Leggett (right) says that he will need reconstructive plastic surgery on his face during the recovery . Investigators believe Tabari Young, 22, . was the principal gunman and he was charged Tuesday, McCarthy said. Bryon Champ, 21, who was charged a day earlier, was also a shooter, the . police superintendent said. A suspected lookout, Brad Jett, 22, and Kewane Gatewood, 20, have also been charged in connection to the shooting, which is Believed to be retaliation for a previous gang shooting weeks earlier, according to WLS. Another suspect, David Logan, 22, has been charged with unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing justice, according to the Chicago Tribune. Authorities describe Champ as a documented gang member and say he was convicted in July 2012 on charges of unlawful use of a weapon by a felon. 'He just keep saying, ""Ma, they shot me, they shot me with a gun. You heard me, mama?"" And I say, ""Yeah, I heard you.' But I just say, 'You OK. You a big boy. You a soldier,""' the boy's mother Shamarah Leggett said.

Accomplices: Brad Jett, 22, (left) was thought to be the lookout and Kewane Gatewood, 20, (right) was also charged in connection to the shooting . Ms Leggett, 24, told the paper that her son's face and right eye are still swollen from the gunshot wound and he will need reconstructive plastic surgery. The boy's spirits do not appear to have been beaten down, he was seen around his hospital room and refused to take off his new favorite Nike sneakers whenever he was put to bed. Deonta's recovery is particularly remarkable given the fact that he was originally considered to be in critical condition initially after the shooting. Julian Harris, 22, said the three-year-old victim was his nephew Deonta, who goes by the nickname 'Tay-man'. 'They hit the light pole next to me but I ducked down and ran into the house,' Harris said. Hurt: Three-year-old Deonta Howard, pictured, was shot in the face during a drive-by shooting on Thursday . 'They've been coming round here looking for people to shoot every night -- just gang-banging stuff. It's what they do.' Corey Brooks, pastor of New Beginnings Church on the South Side, told the Sun-Times that the bullet passed through Deonta's face, but did not cause brain damage. 'The family's all here,' he said. 'They're pretty distraught.' Twelve others - three women and nine men between the ages of 15 and 41 - were shot and emergency crews rushed them to hospitals.

"The number of Americans in poverty has jumped to an incredible 27-year high, with almost one in six people now falling into the bracket. More than 46 million people, or 15 per cent, are in poverty - which is up from 44 million, or 14 per cent, in 2009, the Census Bureau said. The report highlights the huge economic challenges facing President Barack Obama and Congress as they battle to save the U.S. economy. Poverty: Jalinh Vasquez holds her sister Jayshel Barthelemy in Louisiana. The number of Americans in poverty has jumped to an incredible 27-year high . Rising: More than 46 million people, or 15 per cent, are in poverty - which is up from 44 million, or 14 per cent, in 2009, the Census Bureau said . The number of people lacking health insurance increased to 50 million, which is a new high after revisions were made to 2009 figures. Losses were due mostly to working-age Americans who lost employer-provided insurance in the weak economy. Main provisions of the health overhaul do not take effect until 2014. But one aspect taking effect in late 2010 allowed young adults 26 and younger to be covered under their parents' health insurance. The poverty level is now at its highest level since 1983 and the rise was the third poverty rate increase in a row. The statistics released on Tuesday cover . 2010, when U.S. unemployment averaged 9.6 per cent - up from 9.3 per . cent the previous year.

Going up: The number of people lacking health insurance increased to 50 million, which is a new high after revisions were made to 2009 figures . The median household income was $49,445, a 2.3 per cent fall from 2009. The 46.2 million people in poverty in 2010 represents the largest number in 52 years since estimates began, reported MNSBC. Reflecting the recession's lingering . impact, the poverty rate from 2007 to 2010 has risen faster than any . three-year period since the early 1980s. At that time a crippling energy crisis amid government cutbacks were contributing to inflation, spiraling interest rates and unemployment. Bruce Meyer, of the University of Chicago, cautioned that the worst may yet to come in poverty levels. He cited rising demand for food stamps as well as 'staggeringly high' numbers in those unemployed for more than 26 weeks. Meawhile, it was revealed poverty rose among all race and ethnic groups except Asians - and child poverty went up from 21 per cent to 22 per cent. Poverty among people aged 65 and older was statistically unchanged at nine per cent, after hitting a record low of 8.9 per cent in 2009. The U.S. poverty rate is only lower than three countries in 34 tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in France.

"Sometimes, mother really doesn't know best. The mom of a seven-year old boy from Virginia dressed him up for Halloween night in a Ku Klux Klan costume. Jessica Black, from Craigsville, says her little boy, Jackson who is seven actually asked if he could also dress as a member of the white supremacist group, so she decided to make him the costume. Ms Black says it's a 'family tradition'. Scroll down for video... Are you KKKidding? A mother from Virginia allowed her seven-year old son to dress up like a Klansman from the Ku Klux Klan because it was 'family tradition' when she was growing up . Ku Klux Clanger: Jackson Black, 7, appears to be a sweet boy whose mom is simply following their family tradition . It's all good in the hood: Jessica Brown says her brother wore the costume when he was in kindergarten and in 7th grade too . 'My brother dressed up as a member of the KKK when he was in Kindergarten and when he was 13,' said Ms Black. A reporter from WHSV asked the little Jackson why he decided to wear the controversial costume but it was clear from his answer that he did not know the historical signifiance of the outfit or how offensive the clothing can be. His mother didn't appear to know any better, justifying her actions by pointing the blame squarely in her sons' direction. 'I did tell him that if you do it, you know there's going to be people talking about you. There's going to be people saying bad things about you when you do wear it,' she advised. Not OKKKay: Neighbor Wendi Sprouse says the family are offending a lot of people by their actions . Quite the Kostume: Mom, Jessica Black thinks people are overreacting. She has received a number of threats on her Facebook page as a result of the Halloween costume . Neighbors say they were shocked when they saw Jackson Black's costume and that his mother should bare full responsibility. 'I just think it's really sad that a kid is being taught that. That young, because they don't know any better. You don't hear that much about it,' said Wendi Sprouse, 'That little boy roaming around as a Klansman.

Ms Brown sees nothing wrong with the costume for one night a year and he son appears to happy also despite the controversy she's stirring up. She reaffirmed her position by revealing the Klu Klux Klan still exists in Craigsville, Virgnia. 'It's suppose to be white with white. Black with black. Man with woman and all of that. That's what the KKK stands for. The KKK every year, raises money to donate to the St. Jude's,' she protested.

"Anthropologists have long puzzled over how much contact Neanderthals had with modern humans and when this may have occured. Now, a genome taken from a 36,000-year-old skeleton has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between the two species. The study of DNA recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known Europeans - a man who lived in  Russia - shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the Ice Age, helping sow the seed for the modern-day population. A genome taken from a 36,000-year-old skeleton (skull pictured) has shed new light on the period of interbreeding between Neanderthals and humans. The study of DNA  shows that the genes of the earliest inhabitants of the continent survived the Ice Age, helping sow the seed for the modern-day population . The Kostenki genome revealed a small percentage of Neanderthal genes, confirming previous results that found Neanderthals and the first humans to leave Africa for Europe, briefly interbred. Even today, everyone with Eurasian ancestry - from Chinese to Scandinavian and North American - has a small element of Neanderthal DNA. But despite Western Eurasians going on to share the European landmass with Neanderthals for another 10,000 years, no further periods of interbreeding occurred, the study claims. Professor Robert Foley, of the University of Cambridge, questioned whether Neanderthal populations dwindled fast and how late modern humans encountered them. ‘We were originally surprised to discover there had been interbreeding. Now the question is, why so little?’ he said. ‘It’s an extraordinary finding that we don’t understand yet.’ The Kostenki genome revealed a small percentage of Neanderthal genes confirming previous findings that found Neanderthals (illustrated) and the first humans to leave Africa for Europe briefly interbred. Experts think this happened approximately 54,000 years ago . It is commonly thought that Neanderthals died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources. A recent study by the University of Oxford suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred. Experts believe that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct, instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans. The study didn’t cover eastern regions such as Uzbekistan and Siberia, where Neanderthals are also known to have lived. ‘So it is still possible Neanderthals lingered later in some areas,’ Professor Chris Stringer said. ‘Overall pattern seems clear - the Neanderthals had largely, and perhaps entirely, vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago.’ Lead author Dr Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary biologist of the Centre for GeoGenetics at Copenhagen University, said the work revealed the complex web of population relationships in the past. He believes the study has revealed a firm framework with which to explore how humans responded to climate change, encounters with other populations, and the dynamic landscapes of the Ice Age, for the first time. Anthropologists now believe that Eurasians separated into at least three populations earlier than 36,000 years ago. All the decedents of Western Eurasians, East Asians and a mystery third lineage, developed the unique features of most non-African peoples - but not before some interbreeding with Neanderthals took place. The new study allows scientists to more accurately estimate when this occurred - around 54,000 years ago - before the Eurasian population began to separate. The ancient man’s complete genome is the second oldest modern human genome ever sequenced. By cross-referencing it with previous research, the team discovered a surprising unity running from the first modern humans in Europe. They believe that a ‘meta-population’ of hunter-gatherers with deep shared ancestry managed to survive through the last Ice Age and colonise the landmass of Europe for more than 30,000 years. The study of DNA used in the study was recovered from a fossil of one of the earliest known Europeans - a man who lived in Kostenki, in western Russia (marked on the map) Even today, anyone with Eurasian ancestry - from Chinese to Scandinavian and North American - have a small element of Neanderthal DNA. A sequenced human genome with rows of protein data is pictured . While the communities within this population expanded, mixed and fragmented, this was a ‘reshuffling of the same genetic deck’, the researchers explained. European populations as a whole maintained the same genetic thread from their earliest establishment out of Africa until Middle Eastern populations arrived in the last 8,000 years, bringing with them agriculture and lighter skin colour. Marta Mirazon Lahr, from Cambridge University’s Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies, said: ‘That there was continuity from the earliest Upper Palaeolithic to the Mesolithic, across a major glaciation, is a great insight into the evolutionary processes underlying human success. ‘For 30,000 years, ice sheets came and went, at one point covering two-thirds of Europe. ‘Old cultures died and new ones emerged - such as the Aurignacian and the Grevettian - over thousands of years, and the hunter-gatherer populations ebbed and flowed. ‘But we now know that no new sets of genes are coming in: these changes in survival and cultural kit are overlaid on the same biological background. ‘It is only when farmers from the Near East arrived about 8,000 years ago that the structure of the European population changed significantly.’","Genome was taken from a 36,000-year-old skeleton found in Russia .

"Ron Vlaar's agent has hinted the defender is ready to quit Aston Villa in the summer when his contract expires and insists no talks have taken place over a new deal. The Holland international says he is committed to the Villa cause but, like Tottenham target Fabian Delph, is preferring to keep his options open about where his future lies. Aston Villa defender Ron Vlaar (right) will be a free agent in the summer after his contract expires . Vlaar's agent Arnold Oosterveer confirmed that Southampton showed interest last summer but that he opted to stay at Villa Park for one more season. Oosterveer would not be drawn on interest from Manchester United and Arsenal but said: 'We have not spoken to Aston Villa, the club have not requested talks with us. 'The ball is with Aston Villa. Ron is in a situation which is not unfavourable. We are in no hurry. Vlaar caught the eye with impressive performances for Holland at the World Cup in Brazil . 'I don't want to respond [to rumours about Arsenal and Manchester United], but the natural break for Ron is now and it's the time to take a nice step. He is ambitious.' Talking to Voetbal International, he added: 'Last summer, Southampton were interested in Ron. But we asked ourselves whether that club would be a step forward compared to Aston Villa. Now that club are suddenly second, so things can happen quickly.' Vlaar gave Villa a scare last night when he was forced off with a calf injury during the first half of Holland's friendly with Mexico.

"Leader: Warren Jeffs, left, smiles during his 2007 trial for coercing the marriage and rape of a 14-year-old follower to her 19-year-old cousin in 2001 . Convicted pedophile and imprisoned FLDS leader Warren Jeffs continues to wield enormous power over two notorious polygamist towns on the Arizona and Utah border  he used to call home and that non-Mormon residents are spied on a new lawsuit alleges. The Department of Justice has filed a civil-rights motion against Colorado City and Hildale, Utah, which claims that the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day, of which Jeffs is the president, runs both town's and not the elected leaders. As part of the lawsuit, fawning letters sent by Colorado City Mayor George M. Allred to Jeffs, 57, were filed that claim to reveal how the shamed polygamous religious leader was asked for advice on who to appoint as new police chief for the town and is even assumed to have a supernatural ability to speak to God. While the allegations of theocratic rule in Hildale and Colorado City are not new, the two letter's the Department of Justice claim to be from Allred offer up the most clear-cut evidence to date of how the lines between civil and religious authority are blurred in the polygamous heart-land. Attorneys with the Department of Justice allege that members of the FLDS prevented a non-FLDS family in the twin-towns, which are collectively known as Short Creek, from getting water, engaged in questionable surveillance and kept some female members from 'escaping'. Secretive: A woman walks ouside a large wall surrounding the compound of Warren Jeff's the prophet leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) in Hildale, Utah . The first letter sent by Allred is dated June 6th, 2012 and is covered with the instruction 'Private' over it and was delivered to the Louis C. Powledge Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice near Palestine, Texas where Jeff's is serving a sentence of life in prison plus 20 years, to be served consecutively, and a $10,000 fine for the sexual assault of one 12 and one 15-year-old girl. Allred's letter begins with religious praise for Jeffs, 'As my spiritual leader I write to you today with joy and rejoicing in the Lord our God, even Jesus Christ.; . 'It is my firm belief that you have all rights, power and ability to get the very word of God for all who desire it.' Allred's alleged letter welcomes Jeff's suggestions on who should fill the recently retired post of chief of police as if he is in direct conversation with God. 'If the Lord had someone he would like to have in that position,' Allred writes according to the Salt Lake Tribune, 'it would be very helpful to get his sure word on who he desires to occupy that position.' The Department Of Justice lawsuit which is scheduled to go to trial on January 28th next year also includes the action of plaintiffs Ronald and Jinjer Cooke, a non-FLDS couple who believe they were actively discriminated against along religious lines. Colorado City, Arizona. Warren Jeffs, of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is  still the leader of the polygamist Mormon sect living in Colorado City and  Hildale, Utah . Court documents seen by the Salt Lake Tribune allege direct collusion between the church and the city which would contravene the constitutional separation of state and religion. In a second letter sent by Allred to Jeffs, dated December 14th, the town's mayor asks for Jeff's opinion on changing the town's charter. Indeed, in a bizarre request, Allred seeks the opinion of the convicted sex offender on the prospect of minting the town's own currency. In a final aside, Allred seeks the approval of Jeff's in his handling of the twin city's civil disputes before going on to add, 'I am so grateful the Lord has chosen You (sic) as his mouthpiece to all the world.' The letter's were intercepted by Department of Justice attorneys working with the Cooke's own legal team. Surveillance: Ex-security members for the FLDS in Hildale and Colorado City allege that female members were stopped from 'escaping' the twin-towns . The worrying claims were matched by a declaration from Willie Jessop, who ran the FLDS security in the twin towns until he left the church in 2010 that he met with elected officials to 'convey to them the FLDS Church's view on the events' in the two twin-towns. And in another unsettling development Jessop's junior Patrick Barlow has provided a statement to the Justice Department that claims the FLDS security apparatus had access to and would use surveillance cameras in the two towns. 'It is my understanding and belief that church elders and senior government officials knew of and authorized the linkage of the church surveillance system with the cities’ surveillance system,"" Barlow continues according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'We could also broadcast church messages over the local fiber-optic network.' Barlow also alleges that he spied on the Cookes for five years because they had become a 'threat to the church' and that the town's religious leaders wanted to prevent them from getting connected to the water supply and to drive them from the community. Home: Two woman talk while children stand on a car in Colorado City, Arizona . Another serious allegation to emerge from the lawsuit is that church security would warn the community leaders when outside law enforcement were arriving and that they had instructions to stop female members of the FLDS from escaping. 'I am aware that church security was also used to keep the FLDS ladies from getting away from the community,' Barlow states in court documents. However, Blake Hamilton, an attorney representing the towns is adamant that the letters will not be able to authenticate the letters because George M. Barlow, not George M. Allred, was the mayor of Colorado City at the time the letters were written. However, the Attorney General's office in Arizona claims that the same man used both names.","New lawsuit filed in Arizona alleges that Warren Jeffs still wields considerable influence on Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona from his Texas prison .

"When it became clear that Roy Keane's second autobiography had reached the shelves early, two former Manchester United players got in touch to make enquiries. 'What has he said about me?' was the rather anxious tone. Typical Keane. Still making people nervous. As his first book told us 12 years earlier, when Keane cuts you, he cuts deep. Aston Villa assistant manager Roy Keane is all set to release his second autobiography this week . The former Manchester United captain (restrained by Paul Parker and Gary Neville) wrote of problems with goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel . Frank Lebouf, Marcel Desailly, Roberto Di Matteo and Gus Poyet all go at Keane during a Charity Shield Final in 2000 . Keane (right, alongside Carlos Quieroz, Laurent Blanc, David Beckham and Ryan Giggs) opens up about difficulties he endured while at Old Trafford . This, however, is a different book to the first, a book with more layers, a book that reveals much more of Keane than perhaps we would ever have expected. The headline chapters are there in newsprint  and we shouldn't be surprised. Over the last decade or so, the 43-year-old has lived a rich sporting life and the former Manchester United captain was always unlikely to leave scores unsettled. But beneath the froth and the cherry-picked anecdotes, Keane presents us with a remarkably complex self-portrait of a man for whom the closure of a playing career left him troubled, physically vulnerable and, most interestingly of all, scared. Offered the chance to play for Real Madrid in the wake of his exit from United in November 2005, Keane actually took a call from Emilio Butragueno while he sat on the toilet but here the comedy ends. 'I didn't go,' Keane writes. 'It was fear that decided me. Fear of the unknown. 'As usual, I was looking at what may go wrong. 'Hindsight is a f**ker of a word.' Keane with a New York Yankees kit on - complete with baseball bat - and (right) sharing a joke with former United goalkeeper Fabian Barthez .

On that MUTV interview . Knew Ronaldo would be one of the best . Keane - proudly wearing the captain's armband - in the driving rain at Goodison Park against Everton in February 2004 . Keane all smiles with Gary Lineker shooting a TV commercial in Ireland . If his first book – memorable as it was – served to reinforce Keane's deliberately constructed image of driven, cold-eyed, one-track hard man, this one questions those stereotypes quite starkly. As he writes himself: 'My mid-life crisis has been going on for years'. Some life decisions are taken on whims. For example, he accepted his first pundits gig with ITV after something he read in his horoscope. Ultimately, though, TV work left him feeling 'like a failure', as did a brief foray on to the celebrity circuit after his sacking from Ipswich. 'Playing football with f*****g JLS, that was never my masterplan,' he says. 'I didn't like what I was becoming.' Clearly, Keane's departure from Old Trafford – and his manner of it – has stayed with him. He has tried to cut his emotional ties with the club but he has failed. Similarly with his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Keane is withering in his assessment of Ferguson, at times unstintingly so. He hints at selfishness and double standards in Old Trafford's great patriarch. Equally, though, the search for approval and recognition in a mentor goes on. After Keane's Sunderland team were drubbed 4-0 at home by United in 2007, Ferguson offers him a player on loan. 'It was the one time he showed me – I suppose – affection,' Keane reflects. 'He caught me off guard. I thought: ""He actually cares, a bit"".' Here, Keane points clearly to his own insecurity, vulnerability even. It is a theme of the book. The image of one of the great footballers of our time aimlessly kicking a ball against the inside of his garage door in Cheshire as he waited for the phone to ring post-United is a sombre one. Meanwhile the one of Keane lying on his hotel bed in searing agony from his hip problem after refusing to admit he wasn't ready to train on his first day at Celtic points to a peculiar willingness to please. 'I didn't want to let anyone down,' he says. Equally the admission that he never personalised his office at Sunderland is telling. At his rented flat in County Durham he didn't have a TV and ate baked beans and pot noodles. 'If things go badly I want to be able to clear it out quickly,' he writes of his office in the north-east. 'One box. Ready for a quick getaway.' Keane (centre) pictured lining up for his local school in Cork as a young midfielder before being picked up by Cobh Ramblers . There are two sides to Keane (photographed in 1994), who admitted in his book that he enjoyed working in TV punditry because of the company kept . A fired-up Keane confronts Tottenham Hotspur defender Justin Edinburgh during Nottingham Forest's 2-1 FA Cup final defeat at Wembley in 1991 . Ferguson had a relationship that deteriorated with the Republic of Ireland international while Manchester United continued to win major trophies . Keane (organising a wall to include David Bellion, Jesper Blomqvist, Nicky Butt, Giggs and Kieran Richardson) was disparaging towards his team-mates at United . Keane writes about a range of topic in his autobiographyThe Second Half . The first autobiography painted Keane as a loner who deliberately didn't have the mobile phone numbers of his United team-mates. This time, he emerges as fundamentally more sociable – albeit in his own way – and as a man who worried – and cared – much more about what team-mates and rivals thought of him than he ever let on. Certainly, the presentation of Keane the worrier – worrying about retirement, his public image, his friends – is new. 'Over the years I have played different roles,' he admits. 'Sometimes I don't know what role I'm supposed to be playing.' At Sunderland, it appears that he reconciled that dilemma, at least in part. For a time, he was successful. The essence of Keane remained – deliberately asking staff to set up a tactics boards at half-time so he could kick them over in 'rage' – but subtleties emerged, too. Ground staff were invited to eat with the players rather than in their old hut at the far end of the training ground, he used mental tricks to remember names of cleaning staff while he gave his own Championship medal in 2007 to a reserve goalkeeper who hadn't qualified for one of his own. There are clear shades of Ferguson, here, of course. His shadow hangs over huge swathes of the book, whether Keane realises it or not. Equally, there are pockets of 'old Keane' too. His admission that he was briefly 'glad' to hear one of his own players had suffered a heart attack while on loan at Leicester – 'It would deflect from our own woeful performance that night' – was something he may regret revisiting in print while his return to the Alf-Inge Haaland incident of lore feels gratuitous. There are, however, moments of splendid self-deprecation here. Keane tells how his first team-talk as manager of Sunderland focussed on a goalkeeper 'playing' for the opposition who he hadn't realised had been sold two weeks earlier. The first single he ever bought was Karma Chamaeleon by Culture Club – maybe he should have left that bit out. Certainly if Keane's first book – indeed his whole career – seemed designed to cultivated an image then this sequel has confronted, questioned and perhaps even dismantled it. It is this - the book's great honesty - that makes it so worthwhile. 'I have always been a bit wary and I hate that about myself,' he admits. 'When I was a player I shut doors on myself, now I don't have to.' VIDEO Keane releases second controversial autobiography .

"A foot-long alligator has been found underneath an escalator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. A maintenance worker discovered the alligator, which is between 12 and 18 inches long, on Friday in Terminal 3, Chicago Police spokesman Jose Estrada said on Sunday. An officer captured the reptile by putting a trash can over it. A foot-long alligator was found underneath an escalator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Friday . ‘We don't know where it came from or how long it'd been residing in the airport facilities,’ Estrada said. ‘It's one of those random incidents.’ One theory is that the gator was taken to the airport via train and then probably freed after the person realized they weren’t going to be able to get past security with it. Photos appeared on Twitter of someone with a similar-sized alligator on-board a blue line CTA train headed for O’Hare, reports CBSChicago. 'They probably realized they couldn’t take it through check point, and just let him go, but oh my God,' said Tineka Walker of Universal Security who first discovered it. The alligator was spotted underneath this escalator by a maintenance worker . The animal is now being cared for by the Chicago Herpetological Society. It will need to be treated for about six months because it . appears the owner didn’t feed it properly and stunted its growth. ‘It was in pretty bad shape,’ said Jason Hood, the group's president. ‘We're trying to get it healthy and find a place for it.’ He said the gator would likely head to an out-of-state alligator farm once authorities give the organization the all-clear to release the animal. It’s illegal to keep an alligator as a pet in Illinois. No one was injured.

"Frozen chicken breasts sold at some high street supermarkets are pumped up with 20 per cent of water and additives, it emerged today. Shoppers are forking out 65p a kilo for water after the meat, imported from Brazil, is 'tumbled' in a cement mixer-like machine in the UK . The poultry - processed by Westbridge Food Group - is repacked and sold at Asda, Aldi and Iceland in their own-label bargain ranges. Workplace: Chickens are processed at a slaughterhouse near Sao Paulo, Brazil, which are then 'tumbled' in the UK, repacked and sold at some supermarkets . Sainsbury sells frozen chicken fillets from the same Westbridge factory with added water but not as its own label, a Guardian investigation has revealed. The imported raw frozen chicken, which has already had salt or a mix of corn oil and salt added, is  'tumbled' with water and water-binding additives by Westbridge which is based in Malvern, Worcestershire. Supermarkets are not breaking the law by selling chicken with added water if the amount is stated on the packaging. But there are concerns by the Food Standards Agency [FSA] over the interpretation of the rules by the supermarkets who have told the paper they do not believe they are breaking regulations. Food process: Workers at the slaughterhouse in Brazil: When the raw meat arrives in the UK it is pumped up with as much almost 20 per cent water and additives . The legal question is whether the chicken . is defined after tumbling as a 'preparation' or a 'product' that no longer retains the characteristics of raw meat. Supermarket: An Aldi spokesman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously' The Dutch Food Safety Authority has swooped on several factories in Holland to stop the practice of tumbling of imported chicken which would be later resold as raw meat. It told the paper that chicken produced like that was illegal if sold in its country. Additives in discount ranges include phosphates to stop water leaking out during cooking and the sugar dextrose which hides the saltiness of raw meat, making it more succulent. But the Guardian study revealed that most shoppers were unaware they were paying for large quantities of water in their meat. The probe revealed that Asda and Aldi packs have 18 per cent  added water in their chicken while Iceland and the Valley brand in Sainsbury's have 15 per cent. Following the research, the food watchdog is  asking Westbridge for information on its processes to see if  their chicken meets regulations. A spokesman for the FSA told the paper: 'This is a complex area of EU food law which, as the European commission itself has acknowledged, is subject to interpretation. 'The FSA is investigating and working with local authorities to visit relevant premises in the UK to … to identify the precise legal status under regulations.' Asda declined to comment, but the Guardian has learned that the supermarket is talking to the supplier and regulator over the legal status of the chicken it has been selling. Selling discount frozen chicken breasts: High street favourite supermarkets Iceland and Asda . Aldi said: ""We take these allegations very seriously and are working closely with our suppliers to determine whether any further action is required to comply with our high requirements."" A spokeswoman for Iceland said the supermarket never misled its customers. 'We are confident that all of our suppliers meet the required regulatory standards and that they are interpreted correctly.' Sainsbury's responded  that it had been reassured the trading standards and environmental health authorities had found the supplier fully compliant with current regulations.

"If you've ever wondered why the rest of your family towers over you in height - it may be down to a rare genetic misfortune which has left you with a miserable batch of 'short genes'. Scientists at the the University of Exeter conducted a study to find out what factors determine a person's height. They discovered that one fifth of the genetic factors that cause height to vary between siblings is that the smaller brothers and sisters have 'simply inherited a big batch of short genes.' Scroll down for video . Scientific research has found that one fifth of the genetic factors that cause height to vary between siblings is down to 'short genes' (above, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito star in 1988 film Twins) The study also found while it was commonly thought we are taller than our ancestors thanks to better diets, this factor is only responsible for a fifth of the growth spurt. Four fifths is down to genetics passed on from one generation to the next. The study is the largest of its kind in history and also revealed that more than half of the factors involved in determining height are explained by the simple common genetic variation - the differences between and among different populations. By examining the DNA from more than 250,000 Europeans, researchers from the international GIANT consortium checked more than two million common genetic factors - those shared by at least five per cent of participants. From this they found 697 genetic variants in 424 regions of the genome, the genetic material of an organism, that are related to height. Before 2007 virtually nothing was known in this area of research. Professor Tim Frayling of Exeter's Medical School said: 'It's common knowledge that people born to tall parents are more likely to be tall themselves. 'Short genes': At 5ft 8in, actor Casey Affleck (right) is half a foot shorter than his movie star brother Ben, who stands at around 6ft 3in . 'Most of this is down to the variations in our DNA sequence that we inherit from our parents - the different versions of all our genes. 'In 2007 we published the first paper that identified the first common height gene, and since then the research has come on leaps and bounds. 'We have now identified nearly 700 genetic variants that are involved in determining height. 'This goes a long way towards fulfilling a scientific curiosity that could have real impact in the treatment of diseases that can be influenced by height, such as osteoporosis, cancer or heart disease. 'It also a step forward towards a test that may reassure parents worried that their child is not growing as well as they'd hoped - most of these children have probably simply inherited a big batch of 'short genes'.' Dr Andrew Wood added: 'Our findings have helped to identify a large proportion of the genetic architecture that contributes to determining our height. The study, led by the University of Exeter, also found that while it was commonly thought we are taller than our ancestors thanks to better diets, this factor is only responsible for a fifth of the growth spurt . 'We know that as a population we have become taller over the last few generations, because of factors including improved nutrition. But more than 80 per cent of the factors in height variation are known to be down to genetics, with the rest caused by environmental factors. 'Thanks to advances in technology, we now have access to far greater quantities of DNA data. 'These data sets are proving to be a genetic treasure trove which has enabled us to shed light on height, and we expect to continue to make significant advances, both in this field and in other human traits.' 'Our results suggest that massive human genetic studies, possibly into the millions, will continue to uncover all the subtle effects of our genetic variation that influence our health, behaviour, body shape and all aspects of what makes us who we are.'","University of Exeter conduct largest study on height variation in history .

But the West Ham crowd simply couldn’t ‘Adam and Eve’ it, after seeing arguably the world’s best footballer strutting his stuff in their Upton Park manor. And this football-loving corner of the capital was treated to more than enough Messi magic. Even in second gear, the little Barcelona genius was sensational — eventually winning this international friendly for his side with a penalty.

Goal: Sharbini 11. Man of the Match: Lionel Messi . Referee: Andre Marriner 6.5. Spectators had queued long before kick-off to catch a glimpse of him, thousands of them making sure they were in their seats just to watch him warm up. Wearing his orange adidas boots, the Argentine then led his team-mates out to face an understrength Croatia team. There was a strong Premier League presence in their starting XI: Pablo Zabaleta, Angel Di Maria, Sergio Aguero, Santiago Vergini, Erik Lamela and Spurs newcomer Federico Fazio all featuring. The crowd gave Messi a rapturous reception when his name was announced. And it took just five minutes for him to bring them to their feet; a mesmerising run from right to left had the Croatia defence bewildered only for Manchester City’s Aguero to fluff his lines in front of goal. The run sparked roars of ‘Arg-en-tina Arg-en-tina’, though they stopped abruptly in the 11th minute when Croatia took the lead with a wonderfully crafted goal finished by Anas Sharbini. There were first-half spells when Messi cut a frustrated figure, yet an air of anticipation gripped Upton Park every time the ball was at his feet. He set up Aguero again in the 18th minute, playing a perfect pass to outwit Marin Leovac, before Aguero and Di Maria forced goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic into good saves. Slowly but surely, Messi’s influence grew. He stole a yard of space on the edge of the area to play a one-two with Aguero, but Marko Leskovic produced a goal-saving challenge. Messi combined with Cristian Ansaldi before rippling the side-netting with 10 minutes of the first half still to play. When Argentina were awarded a free-kick on the edge of the area, hundreds of camera phones were at the ready. But Messi’s free kick did not trouble Kalinic as Croatia held their lead.

The former West Ham striker remains a revered figure for his heroics during the club’s controversial relegation escape in 2007. Fans were cheering again in the 48th minute when Ansaldi’s long-range effort took a deflection off Aguero to put Argentina level.

Messi, 27, stepped forward to score his 45th international goal. Chants of ‘Messi, Messi’ echoed round Upton Park — but even that burst of adulation was topped by the ovation Tevez was afforded when introduced in the 61st minute. The announcer’s decision to introduce the Juventus striker as ‘West Ham legend’ was, perhaps, pushing it — but it mattered not as the decibel levels rocketed. This night, though, belonged to Messi, even if he did miss a brilliant chance late on. Even for Tevez, playing second fiddle to Messi is not to be sniffed at.

"Sheffield United's main sponsors John Holland Sales have warned they will consider tearing up their contract with the club if convicted rapist Ched Evans is re-signed. The League One club confirmed on Tuesday they had not yet decided to re-sign Evans, but that the 25-year-old would be allowed to return to training following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association. Plenty have opposed Evans' return to professional football, most recently TV presenter Charlie Webster, who was one of three club patrons to resign from their roles on Wednesday. Ched Evans will start training with his former club, despite opposition from some Sheffield United fans . And John Holland say they will 're-evaluate' their position if Evans is given a contract at Bramall Lane following his release from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence. 'The club has confirmed to John Holland Sales Ltd that the player has not been re-employed,' a statement read. 'The training is with a view to enable Mr Evans to return to a level of fitness which might allow him to seek employment within football. 'John Holland Sales is a long established family business and condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms. 'Whilst ever the 'ex-player' is not employed by Sheffield United Football Club, John Holland Sales Ltd remains committed to its commercial partnership. Should this situation change John Holland Sales will re-evaluate its position as shirt sponsor.' Evans is to marry his fiancee Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison . Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days, you are also taking on a role model,' Clegg told LBC Radio. 'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime. 'It is for the football club to decide, but I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people. 'I'm sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of Sheffield United.' Back-of-the-shirt sponsors DBL Logistics, on the other hand, have promised to sever ties with the Blades if Evans is given a contract at Bramall Lane. 'DBL Logistics is a business that has been built with family values at its core. It strongly condemns rape and violence of any kind against women,' a statement from the transport company read on its Facebook page. 'DBL Logistics would end its back-of-shirt sponsorship with Sheffield United if the club employed a convicted rapist. 'However, whilst the current situation remains and Ched Evans is not contracted to Sheffield United, DBL Logistics will continue its business to business relationship with the club.' United manager Nigel Clough maintains the decision to let the former Manchester City player train was not rushed, and that Evans has a right to return to football. 'Everybody realises the gravity of the situation and seriousness of everything and that's why it has taken so long to even get to this stage,' Clough said. 'It has been prompted by the PFA and that's as far as it goes now. 'We deliberated as a club for some weeks and came to this decision. According to the law of the land he is entitled an opportunity to resume his career.' Charlie Webster has decided to resign from her role as patron of Sheffield United after Evans' return . 'Sheffield United haven't made a statement for four months and today, in fact, I had a conversation with the chairman. It was a positive conversation and I walked away from that… I read the statement and I looked at what the club were saying, and the stance that they've taken and the stance that the PFA have taken. 'At no point has anyone made a decision and Sheffield United still haven't made a decision. They've succumbed to the PFA, the PFA have asked if they trained with him, the FA have said it's a 'dilemma' and at no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime.' 'Over 155,000 people now have signed a petition against Ched Evans going back to the club. Nobody's making a decision and I suppose I feel that I need to make a decision as patron of Sheffield United. My decision, which I informed the club earlier on, is that I resign as patron of Sheffield United and Sheffield United Community Foundation, which is all about inspiring the next generation through sport. Webster appeared on BBC Newsnight on Tuesday night, and spoke strongly about her stance . 'My decision is based on the fact that no convicted rapist, as in Ched Evans, should go back to the club that I am patron of, and go back into the community and represent the community. 'He's not just going into a job, he's bandied as a role model and we cheer him on as a role model, and he's influencing the next generation of young men who are currently still making their decisions on how to treat women and what sexual mutual consent is. 'I currently haven't had a response from the club but as I said I did have a conversation [with the chairman] which was very positive and friendly earlier on. They said to me that they still haven't made a decision but they have made a decision to let him come and train back at the club. 'I hope [that what I say now will have an impact]. I've spoken quite a few times now and now I'm here speaking to you. I'm trying to, I suppose, give victims of sexual abuse a voice because I think in this day and age, in 2014, we're a rich society – rich in education as well – and still there isn't an education on mutual consent.' [On the fact that Ched Evans has served his time] 'The PFA are the players' union so of course [chief executive Gordon Taylor] is going to say that – his interest is only for the players and to make sure the players get the best out of their situation. 'It's the same union that has recently been sued for sexism because it didn't allow a woman into a dinner, so I don't know what you would take from the PFA. 'Why have the club chosen to listen to the PFA and not the tens of thousands of fans that say they don't want Ched Evans back at the club…' Webster said: 'At no point have Sheffield United acknowledged the extremity of his crime' on Newsnight . 'The point you've just made is that he scores goals, so why would the club bring him back to train? To me that's for one of two reasons: the club are bringing him back to get him match fit to play, or they're bringing him back to train him up to be sold in the January transfer window which is not a moral decision or a community decision, which clubs say they are all about. They are the heart of community. You cannot have it both ways. [On the crime being sexual] 'There's a lot [on the Wikipedia list of sports stars' crimes] so maybe the FA, instead of saying 'This is a dilemma' which is what the chairman Greg Dyke said, he should maybe do his job which is impose rules. 'Maybe the FA should make rules so that players can be told what they can and can't do. In my mind they can't go and rape and then go back into their job to influence the next generation. To me, it is personal, because I can comment on sexual abuse because I have been sexually abused, but also because I'm the patron of this club and of the Foundation, and I was brought up in the community of Sheffield, and I'm worried about my community. 'A lot of the fans have spoken up but the fans who are supporting Ched Evans maybe need to look at their own families and imagine what it would be like if it was their daughter or their wife or their mother, because one in five women in this country are sexually abused, which is a statistic that shouldn't exist in 2014. 'The reason why is because nobody speaks about it and the reason why nobody speaks about it is because they get abused. Me speaking about it, I've been abused; the lady that started the petition, she's been abused… I got told I should have a slap around my face to get myself back in order.' Evans scored 42 goals in 103 games for the Blades, having previously played for Man City and Norwich City .","Main sponsors John Holland Sales will 're-evalute' if Ched Evans re-signs .

"The longest-serving Venus spacecraft is beginning a plunge into the atmosphere of the solar system’s hottest planet on Wednesday, after a hugely successful eight-year mission. Esa’s Venus Express has far outperformed expectations, with initial estimates for the mission expecting it to last not even two years at 500 days. But now, as the spacecraft runs out of fuel the mission is finally being brought to a close in the most dramatic of fashions - by sending it into the atmosphere of one of the most volatile planets we know. On Wednesday, Esa's hugely successful Venus Express spacecraft will begin lower and lower forays into the harsh Venusian atmosphere (illustration shown). The series of aerobraking maneuvers will see the spacecraft lowered to an altitude of just 80 miles (130 kilometres) above the surface - but it's unknown if it will survive . Venus Express was launched back on 9 November 2005 and arrived at Venus on 11 April 2006. Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but has a similar mass. It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million kilometres). One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days. Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. It's believed that its atmosphere contributed to a runaway greenhouse effect that made the planet inhospitable. The planet's extreme high . temperatures of almost 480°C (900°F) make it seem an unlikely . place for for life as we know it. It has since been orbiting Venus in an elliptical 24-hour loop that begins a distant 40,000 miles (66,000 km) over the south pole, affording incredible global views. Its orbit then takes it to an altitude of around 155 miles (250 km) above the surface at the north pole, close to the top of the planet’s atmosphere. Each . orbit, however, required more and more fuel to be spent as the . spacecraft battled against radiation exerted from the sun to maintain . its speed. Now the fuel supplies necessary to maintain the orbit are running low, reports The Conversation. In May, routine science operations of the spacecraft ceased, with efforts shifted to making lower passes through the atmosphere. From 18 June until 11 July so-called ‘experimental aerobraking’ will take place, with the spacecraft’s altitude gradually lowered. 'We have performed previous short ""aerodrag"" campaigns where we’ve skimmed the thin upper layers of the atmosphere at about 165 kilometres [100 miles], but we want to go deeper, perhaps as deep as 130 kilometres [80 miles], maybe even lower,' says Patrick Martin, Venus Express mission manager . It is not known, however, if the spacecraft will survive these risky operations - the fuel may or may not run out, while the electrical components may not handle the strain. Whatever the outcome, the endeavour will provide some invaluable science about the composition of the Venusian atmosphere. Shown here is the minimum altitude the spacecraft is expected to reach. The spacecraft has been in orbit around Venus for eight years but, as it is running out of fuel, a decision was made to send it on a risky but potentially science rich mission deep into the atmosphere of Venus . It will also prove a useful experiment into the limits of aerobraking. Venus Express is not the first spacecraft to journey this far into the Venusian atmosphere. That honour is bestowed to a series of Soviet spacecraft in the 1960s, 70s and 80s called the Venera probes. About a dozen were sent on daring missions to the surface of Venus, with only a handful being successful. The intense heat and atmospheric pressure crushed each of the probes in up to about an hour once they had penetrated the atmosphere - but a few managed to survive long enough to return data and images. The Venera probes were succeeded by the Vega spacecraft, high-altitude balloons that were sent into the atmosphere of Venus on scientific missions. Aerobraking can be used as a way of getting into orbit around planets without having to carry quite so much fuel, thus reducing the launch mass. But spacecraft are typically not subjected to intense aerobraking, instead only ‘brushing’ the atmosphere of a planet. If Venus Express survives this mission, it could allow for more extreme aerobraking manoeuvres in future - allowing for spacecraft to carry more advanced instruments at the expense of additional fuel is not needed. But if the spacecraft is still healthy afterwards, its orbit will be raised again to an altitude of 300 miles (475 kilometres) in mid-July. Limited operations will continue for several more months but, by the end of the year at the latest, the fuel will have been exhausted. This will mean that as 2014 draws to a close, the decay of the spacecraft’s orbit will continue until it deteoriates completely; there is no chance of it surviving into 2015, according to Esa. In its time orbiting Venus, Esa's spacecraft has returned huge amounts of scientific data. This included observational evidence for past and present volcanoes on the surface, possibly accounting for the runaway greenhouse effect that gave the planet its thick atmosphere and scorching temperature . In its eight years it has found volcanoes on Venus, tracked extreme weather, seen evidence of extraterrestrial lightning and much more. With a suite of seven instruments, the spacecraft has provided a comprehensive study of the ionosphere, atmosphere and surface of Venus. 'Venus Express has taught us just how variable the planet is on all timescales and, furthermore, has given us clues as to how it might have changed since its formation 4.6 billion years ago,' says Håkan Svedhem, Esa’s project scientist. And there could be more surprises in store yet, if its communication equipment survives the foray through the atmosphere and is able to send data back to Earth.","Esa, headquartered in Paris, is beginning the descent of its Venus probe .

"Founded in 1823, the world’s most famous debating society has proved a valuable training ground for many future politicians. But the brightest young minds in the country packed out the Oxford Union last week to discuss whether Yorkshire puddings should be served with roast chicken. The union - which has hosted former prime ministers, top sportsmen and actors among other high-profile names - argued whether it is wrong to serve the puddings with just roast beef. Animalistic behaviour: Passions ran high at the Oxford Union as members argued over whether Yorkshire puddings can be eaten with chicken . The long-held tradition was talked about being ‘outdated and out of touch’ with modern British life, the room of more than 300 members and future politicians claimed. Passions ran high as the debate heard that Yorkshire puddings now also have a ‘rightful place’ on a plate with roast chicken. Meanwhile others argued British traditions need to be ‘treasured, upheld and preserved’ during the hour-long discussion. Fierce debate: The long-held tradition was talked about being ‘outdated and out of touch’ with modern British life, the room of more than 300 members and future politicians claimed . The Oxford Union has a reputation for bringing international guests and speakers to debate in its halls. Previous guests include the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, former US presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and ex-prime ministers Sir John Major and Winston Churchill. Formula One racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart, actress Dame Judi Dench, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein and author and presenter Stephen Fry have also spoken at the debating society. The Yorkshire pudding discussion made a change from the usual cut and thrust debate of world politics. Last month, new research by Aunt Bessie’s found that more Yorkshire puddings are now being eaten with roast chicken than with roast beef on British dinner tables. Oxford Union: Founded in 1823, the world’s most famous debating society has proved a valuable training ground for many future politicians . As a result, the Oxford Union decided to deem whether this was now a ‘socially acceptable’ thing to do. Oxford Union spokesman Mayank Banerjee said: ‘Whilst the majority of our debates focus on world affairs, we do have a lighter side, and debates about popular culture can become quite fierce. ‘This is our first foodie debate and might well pave the way for more in the future.’ To help spark the debate, the students first tucked into a roast chicken dinner with Aunt Bessie’s Yorkshire puddings. ‘Mums see a role for Yorkshire puddings irrespective of whether it’s beef or chicken and often face complaints from family members if they are left off the menu. ‘We’re pleased that some of Oxford Union’s greatest minds are in agreement.’ The union’s membership is drawn primarily but not exclusively from the University of Oxford.","Long-held tradition is talked about being 'outdated and out of touch'

"Norway could do little to stop Estonia from beating them in Oslo, even after 15-year-old prodigy Martin Odegaard came on as a second-half substitute. The visitors scored the opener through attacking midfielder Konstanin Vassiljev in the 24th minute, and held on to their slender 1-0 lead despite the home side  threatening after the break.

He has already trained with Bundesliga sides Bayern Munich and Stuttgart, met Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp and visited La Liga giants Real Madrid. On Wednesday night, Odegaard was given some 30 minutes to make his mark by Per-Mathias Hogmo, though his creative spark was wasted as his team-mates could not find the finishing touch. Odegaard himself had a late chance to equalise after cutting sharply inside, only to see his shot fly over the crossbar. The statistics suggest this match was one-sided. Norway had 15 shots to Estonia's seven, but the visitors never allowed the hosts to get back into the match during a tense second half. Vassiljev's opener was as simple as they come, too, and  Norway goalkeeper Orjan Nyland will feel he could have done far better. Martin Odegaard comes on for Mats Moller Daehli in the second half . Odegaard got half an hour in Oslo to impress Europe's elite clubs on Wednesday night against Estonia . Meeting a cut back pass from the left flank, Estonia's utility player Vassiljev side-footed the ball towards goal, proving too fierce for Nyland between the sticks. Hogmo is now under pressure. His team are currently third in Group H with six points, three behind leaders Croatia and Italy, as they head to Baku to face Azerbaijan on Sunday. With just three points from their opening three games, Estonia are second from bottom in Group E.

"A video allegedly showing Mohamed Al Alami's funeral was posted online last week . A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who fought against British and US forces in Afghanistan has been killed while fighting for Al Qaeda in Syria. Mohammed Al Alami was released from the top-security detention centre in 2006 after convincing officials that he was no longer a threat to the West. The 37-year-old, who spent four years in custody, claimed he confessed to being a terrorist only after being beaten and threatened with death. But it has now been revealed that he was killed last month while fighting for Al Nusra Front, one of the most violent and ruthless Islamic groups in Syria. A video posted on YouTube last week showed a funeral in which Alami is praised by a rebel leader for enduring ‘the prison of the Americans in  Guantanamo... where he did not reform or change’. The disclosure will further fuel concerns that Britain and the United States should not become embroiled in Syria’s civil war, in which Al Qaeda-affiliated groups are playing an increasingly prominent role, with hundreds of rebel fighters reportedly defecting to them. Western intelligence agencies including MI6 and the CIA fear that any weapons sent to bring down the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad could used to attack the West in the future. One official said last night that, in addition to the defections, Syria had experienced a ‘massive influx’ of  Islamists seeking jihad in recent months. The official added: ‘Volunteers have come from Chechnya, Iraq, Tunisia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Australia and even Britain. We are now seeing in-fighting between various rebel groups and the Islamists may soon become the dominant force.’ Rebels: what started out as a unified force fighting the rule of Bashar Al Assad has splintered into warring factions allowing Islamist groups like Al Qaeda to move in . Conflict: Western nations appalled at Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons are hesitant about arming rebel forces in case they accidentally put guns in the hands of terrorists . Moroccan-born Alami confessed to fighting against US and British Special Forces in Afghanistan shortly after the September 11 attacks. He was captured three months later, following the fall of the Taliban, while attempting to cross into Pakistan. He was handed over to the CIA before being flown out of Afghanistan, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and manacled to the floor of a US transport aircraft. During his interrogation, which is believed to have taken place at the covert CIA prison in Bagram airbase, Alami admitted being a  member of Al Qaeda. Peace: US Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured left) has agreed to a peace plan put forward by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov which would see Assad hand over his stockpiles of chemical weapons . The news that an Al Qaeda fighter has been killed will back up campaigners who say there is no need to get involved in Syria's complicated civil war . He said he attended the Al Farouq paramilitary camp in Afghanistan where he saw Osama Bin Laden, who was there ‘to encourage and reinforce the trainees’ commitment to the cause of jihad’. Along with dozens of other terrorist suspects, Alami was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002 and was detained at the notorious Camp X-Ray for several weeks before being moved to another detention centre on the same site. But he later recanted the claim that he had been trained by Al Qaeda and said that he had confessed only after being beaten and threatened. Pentagon records and documents released via the WikiLeaks website reveal that Alami was released in 2006. The documents also state that Guantanamo commander Major General Geoffrey Miller opposed the move. Experts say that former Guantanamo prisoners are viewed as heroes  by Islamist fighters in Syria for  keeping faith in their cause during their detention. Last night, a White House spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports that a former Guantanamo detainee has died in the fighting in Syria.’","Video apparently showing Mohammed Al Alami's funeral was posted online .

"She has built a career on being the funny one with the rounder figure. These days she is a little less rounder, however. According to Star magazine, Melissa McCarthy has shed about 45 pounds. 'She's been making small changes and seeing big results,' a friend told the weekly. 'It's given her a real confidence boost.' Scroll down for video... The shrinking star: Melissa McCarthy lost 45 pounds in the past month, according to Star; on the left she is pictured looking slimmer in early November and on the right she is fuller in August . The 44-year-old Heat actress has shed the weight by cutting back on pasta and bread. 'She has been on a high protein, low carb diet,' said the insider. But the cousin of Playboy model Jenny McCarthy is not about to go overboard when it comes to dieting. 'Melissa knows that fans love her big and beautiful, and she's not obsessed with dieting,' said the source. 'She's looking for a happy medium.' Thinner in her midsection: The 44-year-old star looked noticeably thinner in her face and neck as she walked in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles . What motivated the Tammy star to shed the pounds was not the pressure Hollywood puts on her. Rather, she just wanted to live longer. 'Melissa realized she wasn't being as healthy as she could be,' said the friend. 'She wants to set a good example for her kids and she wants to be around to become a grandmother too.' A good mommy: The Bridesmaid star with one of her two daughters shopping at Cost Plus World Market in Sherman Oaks, California in June . The actress, who shot to mega fame with the 2011 hit Bridesmaids, has children Georgette, aged four, and Vivian, aged seven, with actor Ben Falcone, who she wed in 2005. Star's source claimed the beauty used to weigh 265 pounds and now is at 220 pounds. Over the summer, the Gilmore Girls star told People she has a 'good sense of self-worth' which she has 'grown into.' Yet, she's not totally unaffected when she's the target of negativity. The actress revealed she's had to deal with some nasty comments, ranging from her acting ability to her size. 'I've never felt like I needed to change,' she said. 'I've always thought, ""If you want somebody different, pick somebody else."" Less stylish times: Melissa donned a less flattering ensemble as she visited Jimmy Kimmel Live in October . 'But sure, criticism can sometimes still get to me. Some things are so malicious, they knock the wind out of you.' The star also hopes her daughters grow up knowing that looks aren't everything and it's what's on the inside that counts. Melissa has had a successful run and there seems to be no sign of her slowing down any time soon. She is currently filming B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations which is slated for release in 2015, along with her other film Spy. The star is also said to be returning to the silver screen with The Heat 2.

"Edward Snowden has been pictured in public today for the first time since leaving Moscow airport. The National Security Agency whisteblower emerged to collect the Sam Adams Associates Integrity in Intelligence Award. The picture was published on the same day his father Lon Snowden arrived in Russia to see his son. Scroll down for video . This is the first picture of former NSA analyst Edward Snowden (third from right) since he was given temporary asylum in August. He is pictured receiving the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence Award. (pictured l-r: Coleen Rowley, Thomas Drake , Sarah Harrison, Jesselyn Raddack  and Ray McGovern) Lon Snowden told reporters in Moscow he was 'not sure' if Edward Snowden would ever return to the U.S. Dressed in a black suit and . open-necked blue shirt, Snowden was seen smiling alongside UK WikiLeaks . journalist Sarah Harrison, who took the leaker from Hong Kong to Moscow . and also obtained his asylum. The precise location of the award ceremony is not known, although it is believed to have been in Moscow. The award is given annually for people operating within the intelligence community who stand up to abuse of information gathering. Previous winners include Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and former British Intelligence translator Katharine Gun who leaked information suggesting America acted illegally in pushing for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Four former U.S. government officials who met Snowden said today he is adjusting to life in Russia and shows no sign of regrets about leaking highly classified information. The Americans, who once worked for the CIA, FBI, Justice Department and NSA, have criticized the U.S. government and in some cases exposed what they believed was wrongdoing in the its security agencies. They are the first Americans known to have met with Snowden, 30, since he was granted asylum in Russia in August. Thomas Drake, a former NSA executive who . gave inside information to a newspaper about an electronic espionage . program that he saw as invasive, said: 'He spoke about going out and about and getting to understand Russia and its culture and the people. 'This is where he lives now, and so where you live is your home.' He does not know where he is meeting his son but will be brought to him by lawyer Anatoly Kucherena (left) The four former U.S. officials refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living. 'For his own safety it's best that no one else knows where he actually lives,' Drake said. 'But I believe he is making the best of his circumstances and is living as normally as possible.' Drake and the other Americans - Raymond McGovern, Jesselyn Radack and Coleen Rowley - said Snowden was in good spirits and still believes he did the right thing in disclosing the NSA surveillance program. They said they saw no evidence that Snowden was under the control of Russian security services, as many in the U.S. government believe. 'He spoke very openly about a whole range of things, a number of which I won't get into here, but it certainly didn't involve any kind of manipulation by the Russian government or anyone else for that matter,' said Radack, a former Justice Department adviser now with the Government Accountability Project. 'He definitely is his own person and makes his own decisions and says and does what he wants to.' Earlier today, Lon Snowden told . Russian television crews outside the airport this morning that he doubts . his son will return to the U.S. He is currently living in a secret location after he was charged with violating the Espionage Act for . disclosing NSA's highly classified surveillance of phone and Internet . usage around the world. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was given temporary asylum by President Putin . 'I'm not sure that my son will be returning to the U.S. again,' Lon Snowden said but added that 'that's his decision.' He added: 'He's safe and he's free, and that's a good thing.' Lon Snowden also said he has not had direct contact with his son and would not say when or where he will be meeting him. He added: 'I am his father, I love my son and... I certainly hope I will have an opportunity to see my son.' Edward Snowden was stuck at a Moscow airport for more than a month after his arrival from Hong Kong on June 23. He was granted temporary asylum in Russia in August and his whereabouts remain secret although his lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, insists that Snowden lives in Russia. Lon Snowden said that it is his . understanding that his son has now stopped leaking information, which . was a condition of his prolonged stay in Russia. He thanked Russia and President Vladimir Putin for sheltering his son. Edward Snowden's asylum status has strained the already tense relationship between the U.S. and Russia. In September, President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Putin at a Russia-hosted summit. The . decision to publish the leaked information in The Guardian newspaper . has also provoked criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron and MI5 . director-general Andrew Parker, who has warned the leaks are a ‘gift’ to . terrorists.

"A team of scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory. Using laser beams 60,000 billion times more powerful than a laser pointer, the Oxford University team made scaled supernova explosions on a table-top. They say this could be used to study supernova explosions in the laboratory, instead of observing them in space. Oxford University scientists have recreated a supernova in a laboratory. Shown here is their experiment; a carbon rod (centre) is being heated by lasers coming in from the left, causing an explosion that expands a shockwave into surrounding argon gas, mimicking a star's expansion into the interstellar medium . Supernova explosions, triggered when the fuel within a star reignites or its core collapses, launch a detonation shock wave that sweeps through a few light years of space from the exploding star in just a few hundred years. Type Ia: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes. Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion. Type II: . A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a . core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode. Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds. Hypernova: Extreme . type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting . in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown. They are the among the most energetic events in the universe. But not all such explosions are alike and some, such as Cassiopeia A, show puzzling irregular shapes made of knots and twists. To investigate what may cause these peculiar shapes the international team led by Oxford University scientists devised a method to study the explosions in the laboratory. To . recreate a supernova explosion in the laboratory the team used the . Vulcan laser facility at the UK's Science and Technology Facilities . Council's Rutherford Appleton Lab. 'Our . team began by focusing three laser beams onto a carbon rod target, not . much thicker than a strand of hair, in a low density gas-filled . chamber,' says Jena Meinecke, an Oxford University graduate student, . who headed the experimental efforts. The . enormous amount of heat generated  by the laser - more than a few million degrees Celsius - caused the rod to explode, creating a blast that . expanded out through the low density gas. In . the experiments, the dense gas clumps or gas clouds that surround an . exploding star were simulated by introducing a plastic grid to disturb . the shock front. 'The . experiment demonstrated that as the blast of the explosion passes . through the grid it becomes irregular and turbulent just like the images . from Cassiopeia,' says Professor Gianluca Gregori of Oxford University's Department of Physics, who led the study published in Nature Physics. The results confirmed that supernovas do not always expand uniformly into interstellar material such as dust and gas. Cassiopeia A, a false colour image shown here using observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, is a supernova remnant found 11,000 light years from Earth in the Milky Way. It's odd shape is likely due to interactions between the initial explosion, 300 years ago, and the surrounding interstellar medium . Pictured are the team of researchers who performed the experiment, shown back in 2012 at STFC's (Science and Technology Facilties Council) Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. To perform their latest experiment the team Vulcan laser at the Central Laser Facility, a high-power laser system . 'It may sound surprising that a table-top laboratory experiment that fits inside an average room can be used to study astrophysical objects that are light years across,' says Professor Gregori. 'In reality, the laws of physics are the same everywhere, and physical processes can be scaled from one to the other in the same way that waves in a bucket are comparable to waves in the ocean. 'So our experiments can complement observations of events such as the Cassiopeia A supernova explosion.' The Cassiopeia A supernova explosion was first spotted about 300 years ago in the Cassiopeia constellation 11,000 light years away. The optical images of the explosion reveal irregular 'knotty' features and associated with these are intense radio and X-ray emissions. Whilst no one is sure what creates these phenomena one possibility is that the blast passes through a region of space that is filled with dense clumps or clouds of gas. Supernovas (artist's illustration shown) are among the most energetic events in the universe but we still know very little about them. It is often said that a star going supernova releases more energy in the explosion than our sun will in its entire 10 billion-year lifetime . Jena Meinecke from Oxford University was the lead author on the paper. Here she is shown using Central Laser Facilities' (CLF) Vulcan laser to investigate the turbulent flow of inter-colliding plasmas in an ambient background, a separate Laboratory-based astrophysics experiment, in May 2012 . One further puzzle of supernovas is their interaction with magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are known to influence the generation of radiation during a supernova explosion. But how magnetic fields came to be found everywhere in the universe is a mystery. 'Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe,' says Dr Donald Lamb, from the University of Chicago. 'We're pretty sure that the fields didn't exist at the beginning, at the Big Bang. 'So there's this fundamental question: how did magnetic fields arise?' The results of this experiment are significant, say the team, because they help to piece together a story for the creation and development of magnetic fields in our universe.","A team from Oxford University have recreated a supernova explosion .

"What lurks at the bottom of the ocean? That’s a question a team of researchers funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) will be hoping to answer. Using one of the most advanced robotic submersibles in the world, scientists have just plunged to one of the deepest points on Earth. Scroll down for videos . The 40-day HADES project (Hadal Ecosystem Studies Project), funded by the NSF (National Science Foundation), is aiming to discover how marine life can survive at extreme ocean depths. Pictured is an abyssal grenadier spotted at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on a previous mission . Their location is the Kermadec Trench, found just off New Zealand. At a depth of 6.24 miles (10.04 kilometres) it is the fifth deepest trench in the world. An inflow of deep waters from Antarctica also makes it one of Earth’s coldest trenches. The 40-day expedition to observe this fascinating location began on Saturday. The team will be using one of the world’s most advanced submersibles in the world, Nereus, in tandem with other technology. The vehicle the team are using to explore the Kermadec Trench is Nereus. According to the NSF it is the world’s only full-ocean-depth, hybrid, remotely-operating vehicle (ROV). The hybrid design means it can be operated remotely both with and without a tether. The advanced vehicle weighs 6,200 pounds (2,800 kilograms) and is slightly larger than an average car. It is powered by 2,000 lithium-ion batteries and its hull can handle intense pressure. The vehicle can operate remotely for up to 12 hours. Imagery and video is streamed to a ship on the surface using a fibre-optic cable that is about the width of a human hair. It has previously been used to explore the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of any ocean on Earth. The project is known as the Hadal Ecosystem Studies Project (HADES), and its goal is to perform the first systematic study of life in ocean trenches. ‘The proposal to study the deep-sea environment as part of HADES was high-risk, but, we hope, also high-reward,’ David Garrison, program director in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences that funds HADES, says in a release. ‘Through this exciting project, we will shine a light into the darkness of Earth’s deep-ocean trenches, discovering surprising results all along the way.’ Ocean trenches like this are some of the least explored locations on the planet. It’s often said that we know less about the bottom of the oceans than we do the surface of the moon. According to Tim Shank, a biologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, one of the participating organisations, advances in technology now make such difficult missions possible. ‘We know relatively little about life in ocean trenches, the deepest marine habitats on Earth,’ he says. ‘We didn’t have the technology to do these kinds of detailed studies before. ‘This will be a first-order look at community structure, adaptation and evolution: how life exists in the trenches.’ The destination for this mission is the Kermadec Trench just off the coast of New Zealand, the world's fifth deepest trench and also one of the coldest due to inflow from Antarctica . One of the world's most advanced deep-submergence vehicles, a remotely operated submersible called Nereus, will be used by the researchers in their explorations . Among the questions the scientists are trying to answer, they will be hoping to find out how marine animals can survive at extreme pressures of 15,000 pounds (6,800 kilograms) per square inch. For comparison, the pressure at sea level on Earth is 14.7 pounds (6.67 kilograms) per square inch. The mission will see research conducted at 15 stations, which include both sites at sea level for testing purposes and along the base of the trench. At each station imaging probes outfitted with cameras and experimental equipment known as Hadal-landers will be deployed. Included in the experimental equipment will be respirometers, which will study how animal metabolism works at such extreme depths. Life within deep trenches, such as the cusk eel imaged previously at the depths of the Marianas Trench, is known to be unusual and unique. The researchers will be hoping to discover how marine animals can withstand pressures 1,100 times that at sea level . Ocean trenches were once thought to be devoid of life. Now it is believed that they are home to unique species unlike anything found elsewhere on Earth. This mission will help to uncover not only how animals can survive here, but also what their food supply is. The project will also provide important research for climate change studies. Trenches are known to act as carbon sinks, so it is hoped the researchers can study how carbon and other chemicals are held on the ocean floor. A crustacean scours the edge of the Marianas Trench in the central Pacific Ocean. It is not known how animals such as these are able to get food, something this mission will be hoping to discover .","A 40-day expedition to the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand has begun .

"Doctors are warning of the dangers Viagra abuse, where the drug is mixed with narcotics such as ecstacy to enhance a feeling of euphoria. With sales of the drug rising by 25 per cent in the run up to Valentine's day, there are fears that abusing the drug could lead to potentially fatal consequences. Scientists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney . have identified a 'sextasy' craze that's gaining popularity on the . club scene. Popular: Sales of the drug increase by 25 per cent in the run up to Valentine's day. But there are fears that abusing the drug could lead to potentially fatal consequences . They say that users of ecstasy . are combining the drug with Viagra in an attempt to amplify its . 'euphoric effects'. The problem with this is that mixing the two drugs can trigger what's known as 'serotonin syndrome'. This is a potentially serious drug interaction that occurs . when too much serotonin builds up in the body, say scientists from the National Drug and Alcohol Research . Centre in Australia. Although serotonin is . often referred to as the 'happy hormone', too much of it can cause . confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, tremors. In severe cases . it can result in seizures, an irregular heart beat or even a coma. Viagra sales have risen year on year ever since it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription-only sale back in 1998. But its users are no longer only elderly gentleman wanting to pharmaceutically enhance their performance between the sheets. Problems: Psychosexual counsellors are reporting treating more young men who have become dependent on Viagra for improve their sexual performance . Used correctly, it's a welcome and safe form of pharmaceutical help . But it's the worrying trend of young men abusing the drug, and in some . cases combining it with other lethal drugs and narcotics, that has . health officials concerned about the long term mental health consequences as . well as the more immediate physical dangers. Instead, Viagra is now considered a 'party drug' among young men and is often mixed with a 'cocktail' of other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy which health professionals warn could have long term or even immediately fatal consequences. While each combination poses a different health risk, researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles are specifically concerned about the growing trend of combining Viagra with 'poppers' or amyl nitrate. Both drugs serve to dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow - but combining them results in a sudden drop in blood pressure which can cause a stroke or heart attack. Talking about this deadly combination Dr. Marilyn K. Volker, Sexologist an Associate Fellow of The American Academy of Clinical Sexologists says:  'Viagra and nitrates are never to be used together,' adding, 'people have died from doing that'. Viagra is now considered a 'party drug' among young men and is often mixed with a 'cocktail' of other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy - with potentially fatal consequences . But as well as the physical health risks, experts are also keen to warn the public of the mental effects too. Raymond Francis, a psychosexual counsellor on Harley Street, . says every month he treats about 15 young men - with an average age of . 32 - who have become dependent on Viagra for improve their sexual . performance. This week, prescription requests for erectile dysfunction . treatments have risen by 20 per cent. As a result, Superdrug is currently dispensing one such . treatment every three minutes. The pharmacy's Online Doctor saw demand peak at 9.31pm on . Wednesday as Britons took advantage of home delivery of their medication before . Valentine's Day. Simon Lea, business development manager at Superdrug, . said:  ‘It seems as though this Valentine’s Day weekend is likely to be . our busiest period in the history of the Superdrug Online Doctor service. ‘We anticipate dispensing around one erectile dysfunction . aid every three minutes during our busiest delivery and collection times. ‘We don’t want to just raise awareness of the service, we . also want to encourage more men to get the treatment they might have been too . embarrassed to ask for before. 'This is a problem that matters not just on . Valentine’s Day, but also throughout the other 364 days of the year.’ He said: . 'I think this is just a small sample of the problem. These men don’t . have any physical problems that would cause erectile difficulties. 'Instead they feel they need it because they are putting too many expectations on themselves.' Francis, . like many experts, believes some of his male patients are negatively . influenced by their exposure to Internet pornography. Theorising . that like men who are exposed to pornography early in life who then . acquire a dependence on pornographic imagery for sexual stimulation, . young Viagra users may also develop a kind of dependence on this little . blue pill. A theory supported by scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. They . took 1,207 sexually active males and examined the erectile function . characteristics and 'sexual confidence' among recreational users of . Viagra, prescribed users of Viagra and nonusers of Viagra. After completing the survey they discovered users of Viagra 'reported lower erectile confidence and lower overall satisfaction compared with nonusers.' Concluding their results support the 'possibility that recreational erectile dysfunction medication use among healthy young men may lead to psychogenic erectile dysfunction.'","Mixing the two drugs can cause an interaction called serotonin syndrome .

"Former JJB Sports chief executive Christopher Ronnie, 52, was jailed for four years at London's Southwark Crown Court today for pocketing £1 million in a 'very greedy fraud'. Ronnie, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, was found guilty of fraud last month over three six-figure cash payments from companies who were doing business with the sportswear giant while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told London's Southwark Crown Court: 'This was a flagrant and disgraceful breach of your duty as a CEO of a public limited company.' Former chief executive of JJB Sports Christopher Ronnie, 52, (pictured) has been jailed for four years after accepting more than £1 million in backhanders from suppliers while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008 . Ronnie was £11 million in debt to an Icelandic bank when he took money from two suppliers to the sportswear giant. The Scottish tycoon used some of the cash to splash out on property in Florida in America. But when the troubled Icelandic bank tried to recover its cash, Ronnie lied about his assets and liabilities, Southwark Crown Court in London heard. The charismatic businessman was found guilty last month of fraud over three six-figure cash payments when he was at the helm of JJB Sports in 2008. The judge added: 'Within months you were grossly abusing that position by embarking upon a course of conduct which was dishonest in the extreme. 'Over a period of nine months they gave you just under £1million. 'You hid the fact they had paid you those sums because you wanted to keep your position as CEO and keep the money, and spend it as you did, mainly on the house. 'You had to disguise the real reason for the receipt of that money, you went to great lengths to do so.' The judge said Ronnie had tried to bat off the allegations, telling police it was part of a 'witch-hunt' against him. A JJB Sports closing down sale in Ealing Broadway shopping arcade - Christopher Ronnie has been found guilty of fraud for receiving undisclosed payments while he was chief executive of the company . The judge added: 'I'm unable to see any sign of remorse or even embarrassment about what you have done. 'This was a flagrant and disgraceful breach of your duty as a CEO of a public limited company. 'This was a particularly vulnerable period in the company's history prior to its collapse.' Business partners David Ball and David Barrington - who worked for the firms which made the loans - were sentenced to 18 months in prison each for helping Ronnie cover his tracks. All three must serve at least half their sentence. The suited trio all looked relaxed and stared straight ahead with passive expressions as the sentences were read out. The case against the three men cost the British taxpayer £630,000 - £500,000 on Ronnie's case alone. The fraud focused on three large loans of several hundred thousand pounds which he received from suppliers, but failed to declare to the JJB board. Ronnie, who lives in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and was chief executive of JJB Sports between August 2007 and March 2009, received the payments in 2008. His company, Seacroft, received £650,000 in February 2008 from supplier Performance Brands. That June he received 380,000 US dollars (about £197,000) from Fashion and Sport, another supplier. Southwark Crown Court (pictured above) heard that Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets . A third payment, again from Fashion and Sport, was made to Ronnie later that year, this time of 250,000 US dollars (about £134,000). Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander, and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets. But he falsified information about his assets and liabilities over these loans when he bought shares in JJB Sports. The group was founded in 1971 by Wigan entrepreneur Dave Whelan, who sold it in 2007. It ended up with huge debts after a series of acquisitions  between 2007 and 2009, and failed to keep pace with rival Sports Direct. JJB Sports collapsed after restructuring attempts failed, leaving it with £150 million debts. A report filed by administrators at Companies House shows sportswear group adidas was owed £10million, while Nike and Umbro were each owed £8 million. The sports clothing chain went into administration at the beginning of October 2012 and 2,200 employees were made redundant after administrators could find a buyer for only 20 stores. Sports Direct acquired control of 20 JJB stores when it bought the rump of the collapsed business. Most of them have now been closed. The court heard that the fraud could have shaken the market's trust in the company had it come to light at the time. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said: 'One cannot pin a fiscal health on a company which, by anyone's point of view, was going through tough times. 'But Mr Ronnie was trusted and hailed as this new and brilliant leader.' Self-made businessman Ronnie went from being able to raise £190 million on the market to fund his stake in JJB, to being a man 'broken financially', his defence lawyer, Jim Sturman QC, said. Mr Sturman said it had been a 'hellishly difficult year' for Ronnie, who was left in financial straits following the economic crash. He said: 'He left school before he was 16 and by virtue of hard work and charisma he managed to build himself up to a position where he could borrow £190 million to buy the stake in the company. 'And the crash caught him unawares as it caught others unaware.' Ball, 54, and Barrington, 52, covered up emails relating to the loans and asked a computer engineer to wipe any trace of the emails, the court heard. But the engineer was so concerned that he contacted the Serious Fraud Office. Ms Moore said it was 'sheer fluke' that he had the material and showed it to investigators. Ronnie, who did not give evidence in his own defence, was convicted of three counts of fraud, and two of furnishing false information. Ball, 54, from Sutton, Surrey, was convicted of two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice, as was Barrington, 52, from Sale, Cheshire. Ronnie was also banned from being a company director for eight years. Confiscation proceedings to claw back some of the costs of the case are expected to be launched. David Green, director of the Serious Fraud Office, said: 'These defendants contrived to hide information regarding their dealings from both JJB's board of directors and the SFO once its investigation began. 'That the investigation resulted in these convictions, despite such attempts to derail it, reflects the SFO's determination in tackling complex and elaborate fraud.'","Christopher Ronnie, 52 , was found guilty of fraud last month .

"You must be toking: Uruguay's unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has made it halfway through congress . Uruguay moved a step closer to becoming the first country in the world to legalise marijuana today in a last-ditch assault on the country's ruthless drug cartels. The bill, if passed, would allow anyone to grow, sell and consume cannabis freely, while a confidential registry would keep people from buying more than 40 grams a month. The unprecedented plan to put the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry has already made it halfway through congress, giving President Jose Mujica a long-sought victory in his effort to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs. All 50 members of the governing Broad Front coalition approved the proposal in a party line vote just before midnight Wednesday, keeping a narrow majority of the 96 lawmakers present after more than 13 hours of passionate debate. The measure now goes to the Senate, where Mujica's coalition has a bigger majority and passage is expected to come within weeks for the proposal to make Uruguay the world's first nation to create a legal, regulated marijuana market. 'Sometimes small countries do great . things,' said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the U.S. Drug . Policy Alliance. 'Uruguay's bold move does more than follow in the . footsteps of Colorado and Washington. It provides a model for legally . regulating marijuana that other countries, and U.S. states, will want to . consider - and a precedent that will embolden others to follow in their . footsteps.' Marijuana legalization efforts have . gained momentum across the Americas in recent years as leaders watch the . death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in . Mexico and Central America. Presidents Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia . and Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala also have called for reforms, and a . recent report by a commission of the Organization of American States . encouraged new approaches, including legalization of marijuana. But no sitting president has gone as far as Mujica to support the creation of legal alternatives to marijuana trafficking. 'At the heart of the Uruguayan marijuana regulation bill is a focus on improving public health and public safety,' said Hannah Hetzer, a Drug Policy Alliance staffer who moved to Montevideo to help shepherd the proposal. 'Instead of closing their eyes to the problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking, Uruguay is taking an important step towards responsible regulation of an existing reality.' Legislators in the governing coalition said putting the government at the center of a legal marijuana industry is worth trying because the global war on drugs had been a costly and bloody failure, and displacing illegal dealers through licensed pot sales could save money and lives. Trailblazer: President Jose Mujica a long-sought victory in his effort to explore alternatives to the global war on drugs . Pot in my back yard: Critics warned that marijuana is a gateway drug and said fostering the bad habits of addicts is playing with fire . They also hope to eliminate a legal contradiction in Uruguay, where it has been legal to use pot but against the law to sell it, buy it, produce it or possess even one marijuana plant. Critics warned that marijuana is a gateway drug and said fostering the bad habits of addicts is playing with fire. Mujica said he never consumed marijuana, but believes regulations are necessary because many other people do, even though recent polls suggest two-thirds of Uruguayans oppose the plan. There is a popular misconception that marijuana is already legal in The Netherlands. However, although it is technically illegal there, the drug is widely available as police can't prosecute people for possession of small amounts. The country's many licensed 'coffee shops' are a huge tourist attraction in Holland with an estimated one . million holidaymakers a year, including Britons, heading to Amsterdam to . legally buy and smoke drugs. The Netherlands decriminalised soft drugs in the 1970s, making it legal to buy up to 5g of marijuana from licensed vendors. There are currently around 750 coffee shops in the country, with around 220 of those in Amsterdam, mostly in the city's famous red light district where prostitution is also legal. When the law was proposed the Dutch health and justice ministries said: 'We attract other types of tourists apart from drugs tourists. 'This law will put an end to the nuisance and criminality associated with coffee shops and drugs trafficking.' Those opposing the law cited a fear that Dutch residents could sell the marijuana they could legally purchase on to tourists at an inflated price. National Party Deputy Gerardo Amarilla said the government was underestimating the risk of marijuana, which he called a 'gateway drug' for other chemical addictions that foster violent crimes. 'Ninety-eight percent of those who are today destroying themselves with base cocaine began with marijuana,' Amarilla said. 'I believe that we're risking too much. I have the sensation that we're playing with fire.' Under the legislation, carrying, growing or selling pot without a license could bring prison terms, but licensed consumers could grow up to six plants at a time at home. Growing clubs with up to 45 members each would be encouraged, fostering enough marijuana production to drive out unlicensed dealers and draw a line between pot smokers and users of harder drugs. The latest proposal 'has some adjustments, aimed at strengthening the educational issue and prohibiting driving under the effects of cannabis,' ruling coalition deputy Sebastian Sabini said. 'There will be self-growing clubs, and it will also be possible to buy marijuana in pharmacies' that is mass-produced by private companies. An Institute for Regulation and Control of Cannabis would be created, with the power to grant licenses for all aspects of a legal industry to produce marijuana for recreational, medicinal or industrial use. Dozens of pro-marijuana activists followed the debate from balconies overlooking the house floor, while others outside held signs and danced to reggae music. 'This law consecrates a reality that already exists: The marijuana sales market has existed for a long time, but illegally, buying it from traffickers, and in having plants in your house for which you can be thrown in jail,' said Camilo Collazo, a 25-year-old anthropology student. 'We want to put an end to this, to clean up and normalize the situation.' Ganja-rous game: Marijuana legalization efforts have gained momentum across the Americas in recent years as leaders watch the death toll rise from military responses to unabated drug trafficking in Mexico and Central America . Reformists: Presidents Juan Manuel Santos of . Colombia, right,  and Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, left, have also called . for reforms . The heavy toll, costs and questionable results of military responses to illegal drugs have motivated marijuana legalization initiatives in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington, and inspired many world leaders to re-think drug laws. The secretary-general of the Organization of American States, Jose Miguel Inzulza, told Mujica last week that his members had no objections. Pope Francis, however, said during his visit to Brazil that the 'liberalization of drugs, which is being discussed in several Latin American countries, is not what will reduce the spread of chemical substances.'","Proposal has been approved by government, now goes to the Senate .

"Proposals: The European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso outlined the plans for lower international phone charges during his 'State of the Union' speech . Landline calls anywhere in Europe will cost the same as ringing family or friends at home, while mobile phone calls will be capped at 16p a minute, it has been revealed. Companies will also be barred from charging more for international calls within the EU under plans which could lead to a dramatic reduction in one of the biggest household bills. The proposals outlined by the European Commission would 'abolish premiums' within the 28 member states, meaning dialing relatives abroad would cost the same as a long-distance, domestic call. The plans are the latest move by Brussels in a long-running battle with telecoms companies over 'rip off' fees which can lead to costs almost double those in the UK . Vodafone charges customers up to £1 a minute to call European countries on its standard price plans while the international rate for BT is 23.2p a minute for calls to landlines in France or Germany. The proposals were dubbed the 'most ambitious plan in 26 years of telecoms market reform' by Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso in a state of the union speech, according to the Daily Telegraph. The continent's biggest mobile providers, who charge customers millions to use their handsets abroad, could now fight the proposals over the fees. The new laws are designed to create a . single market for telecoms services in Europe and block what Brussels . officials referred to as 'arbitrary profits'. Reaction: BT have said they will look at the proposals and 'determine their impacts' The European Commission also wants to . make it far easier for customers in member states to be able to switch . provider and walk away from a contract if it is not met by what is . stated in adverts. Neelie Kroes, vice president . and the digital agenda commissioner responsible for the plan, said: 'The legislation proposed today is great news for the future . of mobile and internet in Europe. Cheaper: The plans would see a huge reduction in phone costs which are one of the largest household bills . 'The European Commission says no to roaming premiums, yes to neutrality, yes to investment, yes to new jobs.' Ryah Heath, spokesman for the digital agenda package said they were taking a carrot and stick approach to the plans. He said: 'The carrot is for the phone companies to offer an EU-wide phone plan which works everywhere. 'We will exempt them, but if they don't do that, consumers will be able to choose a different company when they travel abroad if they are not happy with the prices their company are offering.' A spokesman for BT said the company would look at the plans and wait for the proposals to be finalised in the Euoprean Parliament and Council. But, they said their views will be made known to EC, Ofcom and The Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Anne Bouverot, Director General of GSMA, which represents mobile phone operators, said: 'The Commission has rightly identified that increased investment in Europe’s telecoms infrastructure is needed to drive progress across all sectors of the economy but, on balance, the package needs to do much more to support this goal.' 'A more thorough and comprehensive approach is required and the mobile industry stands ready to contribute to efforts to develop an ambitious shared agenda to underpin Europe’s digital economy. 'Reform today will set the context for investment and innovation in Europe’s digital economy for the next ten years. 'It is essential that we get it right and this process should include a comprehensive review of the increasingly outdated regulatory framework for telecoms in Europe. 'The right policies are ones that encourage investment, enable innovation and help build consumer confidence. 'We will continue to support efforts to develop these to help drive Europe towards a connected future that meets the expectations of its businesses and consumers.'","Plans outlined by European Commission would 'abolish premiums'

"If Susan Rice is nominated to be the next Secretary of State, she could face fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress. But now it has emerged that she could also lack support closer to home, as Hillary Clinton has said she would prefer John Kerry to succeed her as America's top diplomat. The ambassador to the UN is considered the frontrunner for the high-powered job, despite coming under fire from the GOP for her role in the government's response to the Benghazi attack. Scroll down for video . Feud? Hillary Clinton is apparently opposed to the idea of Susan Rice becoming Secretary of State . However, Clinton is apparently not keen for her to take over, according to a report in the Chicago Sun-Times, and instead supports Kerry, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'Hillary is not close to Rice, who is tough but is not the friendliest person,' a White House source told the newspaper. 'And Hillary's brief comment recently that Rice had done ""a great job"" was considered underwhelming and tepid.' Earlier this week, the outgoing Secretary of State claimed to be a fan of Rice, saying: 'Susan Rice has done a great job as our ambassador to the United Nations. 'Of course, this decision about my successor is up to the President, but I am very happy he has the opportunity with a second term to make a decision.' Frontrunner: But Rice will face fierce Republican opposition is she is nominated by Barack Obama . Rice, 48, got her start in politics from Hillary's husband Bill, working on his 1992 presidential campaign before being appointed to the National Security Council. She then served as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs from 1997 to 2001. Obama is widely believed to favour her as Hillary's successor - partly because appointing Kerry could lead to a tough battle for the Democrats to hold on to his Massachusetts Senate seat. But Rice has become a hate figure for senior Republicans such as John McCain, who has threatened to block her appointment if she is nominated by Barack Obama. Alternative: John Kerry is also believed to be in the running for the post of America's top diplomat . The GOP opposition stems from a series of television interviews Rice gave in the days after the assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, when she insisted that the raid stemmed from protests against an American-made video mocking the Prophet Muhammad. That claim has since been debunked - but Rice now says she was simply relying on an assessment provided to her by intelligence agencies. While McCain and others appeared to soften their opposition to Rice last week, after a meeting with her on Tuesday they reiterated their concerns and again threatened to stop her becoming Secretary of State.","Would prefer John Kerry to succeed her, according to insider source .

"Having set a date for her big day, Claire Donnelly was delighted to be able to get down to the business of choosing her wedding dress. So the 31-year-old booked an appointment at boutique bridal shop By Design in Gloucester . But Miss Donnelly  was left devastated after shop workers reportedly told her she was too big to be fitted for a gown. She says she was left feeling humiliated after an assistant told her the shop did not stock dresses big enough for her size 16 figure. Too fat? Bride-to-be Claire Donnelly, size 16, says she was distraught to be told there was nothing big enough - or that she could afford on her £450 budget - in Gloucester bridal boutique By Design . Claire, who is 5ft 2ins, was then told that she would not be able to afford any of the designs in the shop with her budget of £450 to £500. The retail assistant, who lives in Gloucester, said: 'The assistant took one look at me and said there was nothing there that would fit me. 'She asked what my budget was and said there was nothing there I could afford. I was taken aback by her attitude. 'I was trying to find one super dress for one super day and I just felt completely deflated. I was so upset and just wanted to go home.' Unhappy: Claire claims that the boutique told her she was too big for any of their dresses - but manager Tim has hit back, saying they were never rude, and tried to accommodate Claire the best they could . The average UK woman has measurements of 39-34-41, putting them into a size of either 14 or 16. Claire, who is due to get married next August, is now calling for dress shops to accommodate all shapes and sizes to avoid embarrassments for brides-to-be. Tim Shayle, manager at By Design, said their dress prices start from around £500 - with additional costs for alterations and fittings, and that on the day Claire came into the boutique, she said she had a budget of £450 to £500. But he insisted that he always tries to accommodate brides and their budgets, whatever they may be, to help them get a deal that allows them to have the style they want. He said: 'This is a difficult subject and we try to handle these situations as sensitively as possible. 'We are only a small boutique shop and it is a business decision to only stock certain sizes for people to try on. 'We only carry a certain amount of stock so we are limited to the sizes we have. Economies of scale: Bridal boutique By Design said they don't carry samples in a size zero either. 'It's a commercial decision,' manager Tim said. 'We stock the samples we get asked for most. We simply don't have space to keep everything in store' 'Wedding dresses have to be perfect, but in order to help the customer as best we can we need to know what they can afford.' 'We . were never rude. Claire did try on dresses in the shop but unfortunately . they were not her size. 'We do the very best we can but sometimes you . just don't have the stock. You can't please all of the people all of the . time. It is very unfair for Claire to vilify us for not having what she wanted. 'You wouldn't go to Long Tall Sally and ask for a size 10 in a regular length and get upset if they didn't have it. 'It's . a purely commercial decision to stock the range of sizes we do, and down to economies of scale. Any . clothing retailer would tell you what their specific market is. We are the same.

'We go no lower than 8 in our samples or higher than 14 - but we've made both smaller and larger sizes to order. 'We do our best to keep our customers happy. Without customers we don't have a business, after all. 'Miss Donnelly could absolutely have asked for any of our samples in a size 16 or 18, but we do have to consider budget. 'Hers was £450 to £500.

"A new washing machine that uses virtually no water could give a whole new meaning to ‘dry cleaning’. Instead the technology uses millions of tiny plastic beads that remove stains and odours from garments. The company behind the technology, Xeros, claims the process is not only more effective at cleaning clothes, but it’s also far more efficient. Scroll down for video… . Instead of water, the technology uses tiny plastic beads that remove stains and odours from garments . It estimates that if all UK households converted to Xeros technology, they would save approximately seven million tonnes of water per week. The nylon polymer beads have an inherent . polarity that attracts stains in a similar way to how your white nylon . garments can get dingy over. However, . under humid conditions, the polymer changes and becomes absorbent. Dirt . is not just attracted to the surface, it is absorbed into the centre. After the water dissolves the stains, the dirt is absorbed into the centre of the beads, where it remains trapped. After . the cycle is complete, the beads are spun out of the load through holes . in the drum, where they then return back to s sump pump and are reused. The polymer beads also cut down the amount of detergent needed to clean clothes, and can be used for up to 500 loads before they need to be replaced. Strangely, the researchers that developed this technology at Leeds University were initially attempting to solve a completely different problem. Professor Stephen Burkinshaw wanted to . find out how to help dyes stay on fabrics for longer. But he realised . the process could work in reverse to remove stains. Not long after the breakthrough, the group developed a prototype, and a spin out company called Xeros. During . the wash cycle, more than a million tiny polymer beads are added into . the load along with a cup of water and a few drop of Xeros’s special . detergent. The machines are thought to require less than ten per cent of the water used in normal washing machines. They also use just a fraction of the electricity needed to complete a cycle with a traditional machine .

Currently, the technology is only available for hotels and large launderettes, but the company plans to create a household version in the near future. 'The bead-cleaning system is now being developed for domestic laundry use and research is underway to explore how it can be applied in other applications including leather processing,' said Xeros chief executive, Bill Westwater.

"Alf-Inge Haaland has dismissed Roy Keane's latest comments in their long-running feud and mocked the Irishman's beard by comparing him to Saddam Hussein. Keane re-ignited the issue in his new autobiography The Second Half, having admitted in the first book that he deliberately set out to injure Haaland during a Manchester derby at Old Trafford in 2001. 'There are things I regret in my life and he's not one of them,' wrote Keane. Roy Keane admitted he does not regret his horror tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland back in 2001 . Keane (right) lunges towards Haaland with his right boot during a Manchester derby in 2001 . The Manchester United midfielder gets nowhere near the ball as he smashes into Haaland's right knee . Keane's challenge was revenge for Haaland accusing him of playacting four years earlier at Elland Road . Haaland is left in a heap on the Old Trafford turf following Keane's premeditated challenge . Asked what he thought of the comments by his former Norway teammate Egil Ostenstad on Twitter, Haaland posted a picture of a bearded Saddam shortly after his capture in 2003 with the message: 'cant take a man seriously when hes got a beard like....' The tweet was later deleted but the former Manchester City and Leeds defender posted another message on Tuesday joking that the former Iraqi tyrant’s family would not want him to be connected to Keane. He wrote: ‘Sorry for deleting my tweet last night. I had to. SH’s family did not want to be associated with your former leader.’ Haaland also gave a statement to TV2 in Norway, saying: ‘I haven’t actually said anything. I just said that I don’t take his comments seriously. There’s no use getting on your high horse and saying that everybody else is an idiot if they don’t agree with you.’ The feud goes back to a game between Manchester United and Leeds in 1997 when Keane ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in a tackle with Haaland who stood over his opponent and accused him of faking the injury. Haaland dismissed Keane's latest comment on Norwegian TV, saying he doesn't take them 'seriously' Haaland compared Keane's beard to that of former dictator Saddam Hussein but quickly deleted his tweet . Keane stands over Haaland and shouts at him shortly before being sent off for his thigh-high tackle . The United captain exacted brutal revenge four years later with a horror tackle on Haaland, launching into a high tackle on the Norwegian's right knee. He was sent off and handed a three-match ban and a £5,000 fine. Writing in his first book in 2002, Keane said: 'I'd waited long enough. I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. 'And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries. Even in the dressing room afterwards, I had no remorse. My attitude was, f*** him. What goes around, comes around. He got his just rewards. He f***** me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye.' Keane's shocking revelations led to an FA enquiry and he was banned for an additional five games and fined a further £150,000. VIDEO Keane releases second controversial autobiagraphy .

He launched a £6million legal action against Keane following his rival's admission but that was dropped when he accepted that he had been forced to retire because of problems in his other knee. Speaking recently about his rift with Keane, who is now assistant manager at Aston Villa, Haaland said: 'He has never apologised and if he doesn't want to apologise, that's up to him. I don't expect him to say sorry. He's not exactly Nelson Mandela. It seems that this is the way he wants it. I can't get my career back. 'I don't think him talking about it is going to change much. I'm not expecting anything. It's not like I'm not sleeping at night. 'Maybe he wants to show that he is still a hard man. If that's how he wants to be, that's up to him. 'It's not good to talk like this, just like in his book, for kids who grow up hearing this stuff from him.

"A slaughterhouse boss has become the first person to plead guilty over the horse meat scandal that rocket British supermarkets last year. Peter Boddy, 65, who runs West Yorkshire slaughterhouse in Todmorden admitted failing to comply with food traceability regulations in court today. A jury heard he sold 50 horses for meat in 2012 but failed to keep proper records to show where the meat had ended up. Peter Boddy, left, is the first person to plead guilty over horse meat scandal. His colleague David Moss, right, also appeared at court today to answer charges of failing to comply with food traceability regulations . There was no suggestion that buyers had been falsely sold the product as horse meat, however, prosecutors confirmed they did not know what shops or food vendors the meat had been sent to. Boddy appeared at Southwark Crown Court today where he spoke only to confirm his name and the guilty plea. His colleague and co-defendant, slaughterhouse manager David Moss also stood in the dock. He denied forging an invoice in February 2013 in Boddy’s name concerning the number of horses sold in a transaction. Boddy's slaughterhouse in West Yorkshire, pictured, which was raided by police and officers from the Food Standards Agency amid the horse meat scandal allegations in 2013 . The pair are accused of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations in relation to horses, which state the source of meat should be traceable from field to fork. Both men are also charged with failing to comply with food traceability requirements for more than 17 horse carcases between July 2012 and February 2013. However neither entered pleas and intend to apply for the charge to be dismissed. In a second trial minutes later, slaughterhouse bosses Dafydd Raw-Rees, 66 and Colin Patterson, 43, from Wales, answered separate charges in a catalogue of food-labelling failures. Dafydd Raw-Rees, left, and Colin Patterson, right, from Wales also appeared at Southwark Crown Court today . Their company, Farmbox Meats Limited, allegedly sold goat meat to unwitting customers as ‘lamb trim’ and ‘lamb shanks’. Raw-Rees and Patterson, who worked at Tyne Parc, Llandre in Dyfed, are also accused of processing horse carcasses, without regard for traceability guidelines. They denied 19 counts of selling falsely labelled goat meat. Farmbox Meats Limited is believed to have gone into administration and no longer operating. Supermarket giant Asda withdrew its 500g Beef Bolognese Sauce, left, from sale after tests indicated the presence of horse DNA. Its 600g Beef Broth Soup, right, was also withdrawn as a precaution in February 2013 . Meat from French food company Spanghero found its way into Findus beef lasagne in Britain last year . In September last year, the Food Standards Agency issued a recall notice for all frozen lamb, beef and mutton trim supplied by the firm. Prosecutor Adam Payter said both cases concern alleged criminal offences discovered as a consequence of the investigation into the horse meat scandal in January 2011. ‘It is not clear where some of the horse meat they processed ended up’, Mr Payter said. An application to transfer the two cases, which are expected to be heard separately, was rejected today. Both trials will be heard at Southwark Crown Court at a date yet to be set. Both pairs will reappear in a second trial due to be heard at Southwark Crown Court at a date yet to be set .","Peter Boddy, 65, admitted failing to comply with food traceability regulations .

"Charged: Jennifer Fichter, 29, confessed to police that she had had sex with her 17-year-old student for four months, falling in love with him and having an abortion . A Florida teacher who had a four month affair with an underage student and aborted his child left her previous job after being investigated for another inappropriate relationship with a teen boy. Jennifer Fichter was said to have been infatuated with the eighth grade student and was suspended from her job while an investigation was launched in 2008. A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed. Fichter resigned from Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in the fall of 2008 after administrators suspended her. Scroll down for video . Fichter had reportedly told another teacher that a 14-year-old student 'makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes' An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed against the 29 year old in the 2008 case. But she is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck. Police said she confessed to a love affair with a 17-year-old student and even claimed she got pregnant with his child but had an abortion. Ficher, who worked at the Central Florida Aerospace Academy was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor. The teen has not been identified. Scene: Jennifer Christine Fichter, 29, was an English teacher at Central Florida Aerospace Academy in Lakeland, Florida (pictured) and the teen was her student . According . to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse began in November when the . pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup . truck. The . teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the . parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New . Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck . The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators. During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion. Fichter also said she was in love with the student and wanted to continue seeing him. 'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel. 'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him.' Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail.

He didn't even own the bloody thing - Keane on the Rock of Gibraltar dispute . I knew Ronaldo would rule the world . Roy Keane has hit out at Manchester United's famous 'class of '92' by saying their importance to the club's dominance of English football has been overstated. United's legendary youth side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1992 contained the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Phil Neville; all became vital to later success at Old Trafford. The group of players took their story to the silver screen, releasing a film last year on their rise to stardom. But Keane, in his new autobiographyThe Second Half, airs his distaste for the 'brand' of the group. He also uncovered a different side to Scholes, who has always been revered for his squeaky-clean image off the field. 'Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image,' Keane said. 'Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.' (Left to right) Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham as the Class of '92, which Roy Keane says has 'become a brand' According to Keane's new autobiography, The Second Half, Paul Scholes (left) had 'more of an edge to him' than people thought . Keane celebrates with one half of the Class of '92 as Ryan Giggs gives United a 1-0 lead against Juventus in the Champions League in 2003 . With almost 4,000 senior matches for United and close to 100 major trophies between them, Beckham and Co clearly delivered on their promise as the most talented set of Red Devils players since the Busby Babes in the 1950s, but Keane believes the Class of '92 'brand' has slightly overtaken the team's own success in that period. Keane adds: 'The Class of ’92 – all good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated. 'The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it. However, the Corkman clearly still felt happy to be part of a team that included the most successful United youth graduates to date, 'But we all had the same aims. We all had the same hunger.' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

Keane and the Class of '92 became the most successful side in the club's rich history as Ferguson's side completed the Treble in 1999, becoming the first English club to achieve such a feat. The Red Devils went undefeated for 33 games in all competitions before producing the most dramatic of Champions League comebacks against Bayern Munich - a final which Keane was forced to miss through suspension. Speaking about the talented generation, Ferguson said: 'I have been fortunate to work with many exceptional young players, but the Class of 92 was unique. For so many of them to stay together and succeed at the highest level is a great tribute to their talent and this club’s belief in the power of youth. 'I am convinced that no group of players will ever make such an impact on the English game as those boys have done – and continue to do.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"As America digested the results of the U.S. midterm elections yesterday, one person on Capitol Hill seemed to be more interested in ice hockey than politics. It has been revealed that somewhere in Congress a person was editing NHL legend Wayne Gretzky's Wikipedia page - changing his height from 5 feet 10 inches  to 6 feet. Twitter account @CongressEdits, which tracks anonymous Wikipedia edits made from Congressional IP addresses noted the change and posted in on social media. Somewhere in congress a person was editing NHL legend Wayne Gretzky's Wikipedia page yesterday . Incidentally, it appears that whoever made the edit did actually change the page to reflect Gretzky's correct height, which NHL also puts at 6 feet. And this isn't the first time someone in congress has been caught making Wikipedia edits. Earlier this year, Wikipedia put a ten-day total ban on edits made from computers within Congress after humorous changes were made to notable people's profiles, and other edits promoted conspiracy theories. Changes to the page of Lee Harvey Oswald claimed that he assassinated President John F Kennedy 'on behalf of the regime of Fidel Castro' and former US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfled is described as a 'lizard alien'. A representative from the Capitol building said that the ban was caused by the actions of 'two or three' and was drawn to attention by @congressedits. Earlier this year, Wikipedia put a ten-day total ban on all edits made from computers within Congress . The changes were brought to the attention of Wikipedia administrators when an edit was made from a House IP address for the website Mediaite, calling the media blog 'sexist' and 'transphobic' and alleging that it 'automatically assumes that someone is male without any evidence.' The website had written a story beforehand about the false edits coming from computers in the Capitol building. Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, told the BBC at the time that he was far from shocked by the edits and that it has 'always gone and it always will'. However, he did say that the Twitter feed may have been responsible in part for some of the more outrageous edits. It turns out ice hockey star Wayne Gretsky is 6 feet tall, and not 5 feet 10 inches as Wikipedia previously stated . 'There is a belief from some of the Wikipedia community that it only provoked someone - some prankster there in the office - to have an audience now for the pranks, and actually encouraged them rather than discouraged them.' He added to the BBC: 'Maybe someone at the House of Representatives better think about their IT staff - they might be hunting them down this very moment.' It emerged that Wikipedia has been warning users from Congress since March 2012. Wikipedia can be edited by an user any time and anonymously, but the changes are monitored by the website's volunteers, known as Wikipedians. They reverse rogue editing and sometimes ban users who continually change entries.","Anonymous person edited Gretzky's height from 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet .

"Gutted: Eileen Remedios begged the thief to return her bicycle after it was stolen from outside a patient's house . Nurse Eileen Remedios was 'gutted' when her beloved bicycle was stolen from outside a patient's house who she had been visiting. But after leaving a tongue-in-cheek note attached to a lamppost begging for its safe return, the 55-year-old had her faith in humanity restored when the thief returned her trusty two wheels along with a humble note of apology. The gesture amazed Ms Remedious, who has now struck up a written relationship with the mysterious, yet 'sweet bike borrower'. Ms Remedios, of Brighton in East Sussex, said: 'I . was feeling quite cross. I thought ""why would someone want to take my . old bike?"" I thought maybe someone was drunk and had borrowed it. 'But I never imagined that someone would bring it back. It really has restored my faith in humanity.' In her frustration, she wrote a note and stuck it to a nearby lamppost saying: 'Please return my bike. It is old but loved and will be frightened without its owner.' When she returned to the patient's home the following day, she found her bike had been returned along with a note of apology from the reformed thief, which had been stuffed under the doormat of the patient she was visiting. The biked had been chained to a lamppost and with the keys left inside the envelope. The envelope was addressed to 'The owner of the old blue bike.' Inside, a note read: 'A great big fat...SORRY! From the reformed bike thief! (I didn’t mistreat it).' Begging: Ms Remedios wrote this note to and pinned it to a lamppost near the home she had been visiting . Amazed: The following day she returned to find her bike chained up and this note of apology . Trusty: Ms Remedios's bicycle had little monetary value, but she was attached to it nonetheless .

She later added: 'The bike hasn’t got much value but it was given to me by an old friend and gets me from A to B. 'It was a real inconvenience when it disappeared. Everyone can relate to having a bike stolen, it’s gutting. 'The note certainly worked and I wanted to share a good story with a nice ending.

"You know how the old saying goes when two people fall in love at first sight...their eyes met across a crowded room. Next they were being seduced by the open wounds all over each other's faces and lusting after the blood dripping from their snarling mouths. Okay, not quite. In fact not all, unless you're Kelly Buckley and her partner Tim Lamb who are planning a fairytale wedding after meeting as they played zombies in a horror movie. Kelly, 30, fell for Tim Lamb, 39 after they were cast together alongside 300 other extras as flesh eating monsters who terrorise a community in a British film called The Eschatrilogy. Scroll down for video . When Kelly Buckley first met her fiance Tim Lamb (left) it was love at first sight even though they were both covered head to toe in blood, mud and deep gashes (right) Initially Kelly suffered a  set back when she forgot to get Tim's phone number. But the pair met by chance again at a ghost hunt earlier this year and realised they had met previously on set. Now the couple are due to tie the knot after Tim popped the question. Kelly, a mother of two from Sheffield, South Yorkshire said: 'We were going to have a zombie themed wedding but as it is going to be in Australia our latex make up would probably melt in the searing heat. Kelly said she loved Tim's sense of humour straight away and the pair share a love of comics and superheros . Kelly and Tim only crossed over on the set of the independent movie for one day, losing contact for months . 'As we both love comics, we're going to have a superhero themed wedding instead with the female guests playing damsels in distress in summer dresses whilst Tim will wear a Batman shirt. But we'll still be having a zombie element to the wedding as that is how we met - so in the vows we'll be saying we promise to save each other from a zombie apocalypse.' Kelly met Tim in 2012 after she saw a Facebook post advertising for extras to appear in the movie which was filmed at a disused warehouse in Wakefield. She was among 300 extras who underwent an hour of make-up before the group were split into separate 'zombie hordes.' She added: 'I had been single for a few years and thought that this zombie extra work would be a great opportunity to make some new friends. 'I arrived at 9am had all my makeup done by 11am and spent the rest of the day high on adrenaline. 'It certainly wasn't the kind of place I thought I would fancy anyone, everyone looked as realistic as the zombies in Walking Dead. After meeting again by chance and adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple . 'I just remember hearing this loud bloke a few meters away from me and remember everyone laughing at his jokes about zombies and about how he looked better with the make-up on rather than off - I liked him instantly. 'We really hit it off, both of us liked computer games and comic books but because the day was so busy I didn't have chance to get his number. Filming was ongoing for another three months so I was sure I would see him again - but I was absolutely gutted when he didn't turn up the next day.' 'The problem was I had no idea what he looked like, I spent a good few months keeping my eyes and ears out for him, but I never saw him after that. I spent hours searching for Tim during the three months of filming but unfortunately he'd finished his stint that day.' Months later, by chance, the pair bumped into each other after she reluctantly went to a ghost hunting night with a friend. It was there she met a man who was also called Tim and they hit it off straight away. The pairs love of dressing up means they will dress as superheros for their wedding in Australia, though unfortunately the heat means the latex zombie make up would have melted . After adding each other on Facebook Kelly realised that he was her mystery zombie and within a few months they became a couple. Tim moved from Leeds with his son Paul, 11, to be with Kelly and her daughters Paige, 12 and Millie, 6. In June 2014 Tim proposed to Kelly at the same spot when they first met as zombies. Kelly said: 'When I met Tim again at the ghost hunting event, I didn't even realise it was him and didn't put two and two together. 'I had never seen Tim without his zombie make up on so for all I know he could have been anyone.' Kelly has since donned her zombie costumes for numerous other events such as Tattoo shows, television work and even for an Alice Cooper. She hopes to continue her zombie work and couldn't think of a better job. She said: 'Tim only did extra work that one time, I think he found it quite long as we were there from 9am all the way up till 7pm. 'For me though I absolutely love it, I look forward to dressing up - I find the whole experience fascinating. Plus it gave me the love of my life, even if I didn't know what he looked like as a human. People have been joking with un-dead happy in love.'","Fell for each other when they were playing zombies as film extras .

She added that recent revelations that the plane was intentionally diverted gave her a 'glimmer of hope… because the alternative is that they're just missing'. She said she is now holding onto hope . that a flight simulator taken from of the pilot's homes might reveal . recorded drills that could show if he had practiced landing on water or . in trees. Wood's brother Tom Wood told NBC Dallas Fort . Worth that he is also thinking positively. 'There might be a . good ending to this,' he said. 'I mean, we're believing there is a miracle in . this.' He went on: 'I know he's strong. He's a strong guy . and he's a smart guy and he can survive things, you know, he can survive . this. He can survive this, he is surviving this.' Happier times: The couple had been together for 2 years and were about to move to Kuala Lumpur . Hopeful: She said she hoped that Wood, who worked in China for IBM, was simply missing . The family has set up a Facebook . page to help gather information, which Bajc says will allow her to 'at least I feel . like I’m doing something useful'. Bajc, who lived in Beijing with Wood, said her faith in . humanity was 'dashed' at the thought that someone might have hijacked . the plane, but is thankful for the support through social media. The couple were about to move to Kuala Lumpur for Wood's new job there with IBM. 'I'm still hoping and kind of making . assumptions that I'll be together with Philip and that we will have a . fairy tale ending, and enjoy many, many years together,' she said. Missed: Wood with his two sons, Chris and Nick, who have said they do not know if they will see him again . Wood, who is divorced, has two sons, Chris and Nick, who said last week that they do not know if they'll ever see their father again. 'I'll . never really give up hope, but that doesn't mean that I won't accept . that he won't come back,' one said. 'We . may not ever see him again, and odds are we won't. I'll be able to come . to terms with that.' Wood was one of three Americans who were aboard the Boeing 777 when it lost contact with air traffic control on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew members. Ten days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel. Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Families vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian ambassador. No clues: Malaysian authorities revealed on Tuesday that checks into the background of all the Chinese nationals on board the missing Malaysian jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism . Support: A woman writes a note for the missing flight MH370 at a mall in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia . 'What we want is the truth. Don't let them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn't life, what's the point? Where is compassion?' asked one middle-aged woman. 'You're always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their heart why we want you to answer us. Because you're always tricking us, telling us lies,' added one man. The plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing less than one hour into the flight. A massive search operation has yet to find any trace of the plane.

"Britain hosts the third biggest  volume of internet pornography in the world and is home to more than half a million sites, according to a shocking survey. There are more than 52million pages of pornographic content in the country, including rape websites registered under the national domain name which ends co.uk. The revelation that Britain is one of the most popular worldwide locations to host adult websites will intensify pressure on the Government to provide an opt-out system for online porn. Porn.co.uk: Britain hosts the third biggest  volume of internet pornography in the world and is home to more than half a million sites, according to a shocking survey . There are no restrictions on pornographers registering their sites under Britain’s domain name, for which a private company called Nominet UK is responsible. John Carr, a government adviser on child internet safety, called on Nominet to ban websites containing certain words like rape and said the ‘free for all’ should end. He said that all porn sites should be under the domain name .xxx and declared: ‘The UK should not provide succour and comfort to porn merchants.’ The policy of unrestricted access means that websites including Asian-rape.co.uk and Incestrape.neuken.co.uk are paying to use Britain’s domain name. One of the available web addresses is rapeher.co.uk – which is being sold by commercial agent GoDaddy for £2.99 a year. The entry on its website reads: ‘Snap it up before someone else does.’ GoDaddy said: ‘We are withdrawing the name while we carry out a review. We have not done this before.’ Taking it seriously: Communications Minister Ed Vaizey is now writing to Nominet to ask what its plans are to prevent 'abusive behaviour' Ed Vaizey, the communications minister, is now writing to Nominet to ask what its plans are to prevent ‘abusive behaviour’. He added that he took Mr Carr’s complaint ‘extremely seriously’. Mr Carr questioned on his blog whether it was appropriate for a not-for-profit company to oversee more than ten million co.uk domain names. He added: ‘Ministers and parliament must be satisfied they are entirely happy with the way that Nominet discharges its responsibilities. ‘Nominet should have a policy that websites registered under the national domain name do not contain depraved or disgusting words. People should not be able to register websites that bring disgrace to this country under the national domain name.’ In other countries, the government controls the national domain name. The evidence that Britain hosts more pornography than any other country apart from the US and Holland will be presented by a web analysis company called MetaCert this week. Paul Walsh, the chief executive of the California-based organisation, said Britain hosted six times as many porn web pages as Germany in fourth place and ten times as many as France in fifth place. The US is home to nearly two-thirds of the world’s pornography. The company claims its analysis is more reliable than other studies as it also checks websites which don’t advertise that they host porn. Nominet said it had referred two of the rape websites to the Internet Watch Foundation and was reviewing its policy on registration. The company also pledged to check its database of .uk names against the IWF’s list of key words associated with illegal content. But it admitted that pornographers could exploit a UK loophole by registering for a UK domain under one name, and later adding a sexual word before the first dot in the address.","52million porn pages are registered with .co.uk domain names .

"Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen stole the show on Monday as a number of stunning revelations were released from their respective must-read autobiographies. In response, Sportsmail's top team of reporters have had a look at their bookcases and picked out some of their favourite sports reads of all time. ROB DRAPER . A Life Too Short: The Tragedy of Robert Enke (Ronald Reng) A Life Too Short is both a desperate tragedy and the most extraordinary piece of writing. It will also act as an antidote to the froth, nonsense and self importance of Kevin Pietersen. Early indications are that Pietersen has confused settling scores in what amounts to a playground argument as a substantial issue. A Life Too Short chronicles German international goalkeeper Robert Enke's battle with mental illness and his eventual suicide. Friend and journalist Ronnie Reng was allowed access to his private diaries to complete the work. I doubt there has ever been a sports book as moving or profound. A Life Too Short tales German international  Robert Enke's battle with mental illness and his eventual suicide . JOE BERNSTEIN . This One's On Me (Jimmy Greaves) Twenty-four years before England's greatest striker released a second glossy autobiography Greavsie, he co-wrote a book that charted his life and career, from sporting icon to helpless alcoholic, with quite remarkable frankness and absence of self-pity. Greaves was between a glittering footballer career and becoming a genuine television star as one half of Saint & Greavsie at the time of publication of This One's On Me in 1979. It was an eye-opener for any fan who wanted to know what it was really like to be top-class player. He wrote about being a golden boy with Chelsea and Spurs, life as an early football expat in Italy, being frozen out of the World Cup final and his friendship with Bobby Moore. And the alcoholism that nearly killed him. Unlike George Best or Paul Gascogine, he refused to blame stardom or the media for his problems, which makes the book all the more fascinating. Jimmy Greaves' first autobiography is a remarkably frank piece into the life of a top-class footballer . MIKE DICKSON . The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro (Joe McGinniss) Like most good sports books The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro provides essential truths far beyond the pure subject matter. In this case it is about a small town football team from an unfashionable part of Italy and their unlikely rise to Serie B. The characters are richly portrayed and it takes you into a part of the world, sporting and geographically, that is rarely touched. Author Joe McGinniss, who died last year, also got lucky in that unexpected events only add to an already extraordinary tale. A very fine book that avoids so many of the usual football clichés. The Miracle of Castel Di Sangro (left) and I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic (right) both make our writers' picks . LAURIE WHITWELL . I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Zlatan Ibrahimovic) Coruscating from the very first words on his fallout with Pep Guardiola, this is a book that burrows into the veins of the football industry as much as life growing up in an immigrant family. Frank, funny, and fascinating to the last, his voice projects from the page and even his agent Mino Raiola is not spared from killer put downs. A real insight into one of the best minds to take to a pitch. CRAIG HOPE . Behind the Curtain: Travels in Eastern European Football (Jonathan Wilson) This is probably the only book I still pick up and reread the occasional chapter. Part history lesson, part travelogue, the subject – previously unchartered territory to my knowledge – and its characters are fascinating, some triumphant, many more tragic. I’ve always been intrigued by football in Eastern Europe, probably because of Red Star’s European Cup win in 1991, and this book feeds that hunger with a brilliant collection of anecdotes. I recently re-read the chapter on Croatia and the fall of Yugoslavia when travelling through the country with the voice of Slaven Bilic depicting the horror of war and subsequent rise of their football team. It’s witty, entertaining and informative. Just a very good read. Jonathan Wilson's 'Behind the Curtain' looks at  Eastern European football during the era of the Soviet Union . MARK ALFORD . Unusual for me that my favourite two football books centre on a man who failed so abjectly as manager of super Leeds United. Provided You Don't Kiss Me: 20 Years with Brian Clough (Duncan Hamilton) Duncan Hamilton’s glorious account working with Brian Clough every single day for two decades. Hamilton was the Nottingham Post’s football correspondent. Hamilton – hands down – had the best and most difficult job in football journalism at the time. Imagine being told one day: ‘You’re f***ing banned forever from this ground. F***ing forever.’ Only for two days later to have Clough on the blower purring: ‘Get you’re a*** down here. I didn't mean it. Spur of the moment thing. Gone and forgotten now. Come down and we'll have a drink. I've got a story for you. Fancy a glass of champagne?’ Duncan Hamilton’s provides a glorious account of working with Brian Clough for 20 years . The Damned Utd (David Peace) David Peace’s Damned United – about Clough’s doomed 44-day tenure following the Don at Elland Road - is hauntingly dark and brilliantly researched. But where Hamilton’s account stands as a journalistic triumph, Peace is a glorious work of fiction that you so hope to be true. It made for quite a film, which you imagine Provided You Don’t Kiss Me would as well. Special mentions, too, for Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream (HG Bissinger’s account following a Texan high school’s American Football team, which inspired the Emmy-award-winning NBC TV series), David Storey’s This Sporting Life (a classic – for anyone daft enough to not appreciate rugby league) and, finally, Hoggy: Welcome To My World (Matthew Hoggard is ‘as mad as a box of frogs,’ according to Freddie Flintoff. Quite). JACK GAUGHAN . Forza Italia: The Fall and Rise of Italian Football (Paddy Agnew) The perfect mix of Italian life and its captivating football culture from the mid-80s, nobody is better placed to tell the inside story of Serie A’s various scandals – and how they were reported – than Agnew. He was in the Mediterranean for over two decades, at the heart of Diego Maradona’s rise at Napoli and the serious match-fixing problems. While Italy has changed immeasurably as a country since Agnew moved over there, the way in which he tells a footballing story paralleled with the state of the country at the time is fascinating. Read in three days on holiday. So too was Soccernomics (by Simon Kuper), although I’m not sure Albufeira was particularly ready for that. Forza Italia (left) and All Played Out (right) are two other recommendations from our writers . ADAM SHERGOLD . All Played Out: The Full Story of Italia '90 (Pete Davies) This all-encompassing account of England at the 1990 World Cup in Italy remains gripping even though we all know how the story turns out. Davies skilfully weaves together a narrative embracing the players, management, fans and opposition and makes it detailed but not at any point dull and simultaneously heart-warming and heart-breaking. The author was blessed with an incredible tale to work with of course - Gazza's tears, penalty pain - but the way in which Davies pulls it all together makes this a must-read. He also enjoyed access to his subjects in a way that will never now be repeated and they were all, to a man, open and honest with him. LUKE AUGUSTUS . Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World (Graham Hunter) A club that reinvented football, and laid down the foundations of Spain's international dominance between 2008-2012, this book provides a brilliant insight into the structure of Barcelona. Graham Hunter beautifully delves into the club's past from the successful Johan Cruyff's 'Dream Team' of the late 1980's and early 1990's and how that all conquering side moulded and defined the club's future from its academy to the first team which saw Pep Guardiola lead Lionel Messi and Co to 14 trophies in four mesmeric seasons. Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography provides an insight to his 26 years as Manchester United manager . Alex Ferguson My Autobiography (Alex Ferguson) Britain's most decorated manager led Manchester United to a period of dominance that English football had never seen before, yet he kept his guard well and truly up when it came to providing any insights into his secrets of success. Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography finally lifts the lid on his 26 years in charge of the Old Trafford hotseat. From his feuds with Roy Keane, David Beckham and Wayne Rooney to his formulae of winning 38 trophies - this book has it all. JONNY SINGER . A Season With Verona (Tim Parks) An English writer spends a season travelling around with a newly promoted Italian team, for their season in Serie A. From life on board the team plane to shockingly racist Ultras, this is a stark and revealing insight into Italian football. Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics (Jonathan Wilson) While autobiographies give you a snapshot of the game at any one moment, a book like this is on a different scale. A tactical odyssey, explaining where it all started, and how we got where we are today, from the days when teams lined up with seven forwards to the current trend of playing one up front. The best history of football you’ll read. A Season With Verona (left) and Craig Bellamy: GoodFella (right) complete our writer's recommendations . SEAN GALLAGHER . Craig Bellamy: GoodFella (Craig Bellamy and Oliver Holt) A misunderstood and controversial figure, this book highlights the true Craig Bellamy. It reveals how especially during his young years as a footballer of his tormented and dark days and how he struggled to cope with life after the tragic death of close friend Gary Speed. Despite all his on and off field problems no one can deny Bellamy’s passion for the game and this book underlines just this. Blessed - The Autobiography (George Best) Unlike other autobiographies you read this one really gets to grip with Best challenging his demons and his future from there on. It is refreshingly open and honest, and particularly poignant, as Best talks about his alcohol problems from the off, his string of female friends, and undisputed success with Manchester United. From a young boy in Belfast to a global super star, this book is one which can’t be missed.","Roy Keane's book The Second Half is published on Thursday .

"A 'disco clam' has been caught on camera partying on the ocean floor near Wakatobi in Indonesia. It can be seen rolling the edge of its mantle - a layer of muscle and tissue that acts like a cloak over the mollusc's body - and producing a strobe-light effect. Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley are now trying to find out what this means. Scroll down to video . The disco clam produces a strobe-light effect by rolling its top lip and reflecting blue light . Lindsey Dougherty from the University discovered that the clams still roll and curl the edge of their mantles at night, when there isn’t any light to reflect. ‘This means there may be some purpose to the movement of the mantle which isn't seen in other closely related species,’ she says. The strobe-light effect is produced when the clam rolls the edge of its mantle to expose a row of reflective cells. When the clams are in a bright area of . the ocean these cells reflect the light, making it look like the its . coming directly from the clam. The clams mainly reflect blue light, which can be seen further away in the ocean than other light wavelengths. Her team is now looking at all the possible reasons why. The glowing clams are filter feeders, which mean they eat by straining matter and food particles from the ocean water through an internal filter. Researchers have therefore ruled out that the reason for the display is to attract food. Lindsey Dougherty's team also thinks it’s unlikely the display is used to ward off predators because it hasn’t found anything toxic or dangerous in the mantle or the light. Instead, they believe it could be a mating call used by female clams to attract a mate. Although, Dougherty believes that the clams might even be hermaphrodites, ‘We think the clams might start out as small males and mature into large females, but we have yet to confirm this.’ VIDEO: Disco clam shows off its built-in strobe light in Wakatobi, Indonesia .","Unique animal spotted on the ocean floor near Wakatobi in Indonesia .

"Public officials could have been behind a ‘deliberate cover-up’ of the Rotherham sex abuse scandal, MPs will warn today. In a damning report, they call for an urgent investigation into the loss of crucial files on the abuse of at least 1,400 vulnerable young girls by mainly Asian men. Their inquiry into the scandal heard evidence from an anonymous council researcher who had gathered evidence of failures to tackle the abuse. Scroll down for video . Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, has called for an 'urgent investigation' into the loss of files . The woman claimed an unknown person stole a draft report from her office in 2002 which had been set to go to the Home Office. There was no forced entry and access was only through key-coded and locked security doors. Her report had contained severe criticisms of the relevant agencies in Rotherham, with the most serious alleging ‘indifference’ by senior managers. Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said: ‘The proliferation of revelations about files which can no longer be located gives rise to public suspicion of a deliberate cover-up. ‘The only way to address these concerns is with a full, transparent and urgent investigation.’ One victim of men in the area, of which there are thought to be around 1,400, fell pregnant twice and tried to end her life . The committee’s report added: ‘This is not the first case in which it has been alleged that files relating to child sexual exploitation have disappeared.’ The influential panel also demands new powers of recall for police and crime commissioners after South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright clung to his position for weeks before finally quitting. The full horror of the scandal over 16 years came to light in August in the Jay Report.","MPs will warn public officials were involved in 'deliberate cover-up'

"There's no question about it: 'Got Milk?' is out and 'Milk Life' is in. Saying goodbye to one of the most recognizable and successful ad campaigns in history, the dairy industry have decided to wipe off the milk mustache after 20 years. The campaign, which debuted in 1993 and has been all-but ever-present since, was designed to make milk look cool, but now marketeers want it to look crucial. 'The reason why we used celebrities at the time was to help improve milk’s image,' Sal Taibi, president of the agency involved in the 'Got Milk?' ads, told Fox 4 News. Scroll down for video . Number one: Naomi Campbell was the first of many celebrities to feature in the Got Milk? campaign in 1994 . One to remember: Steven Tyler in 2002 . David Beckham went shirtless for the campaign in 2006 . It wasn't just celebrities that took part in the ad over the last 20 years ... Incoming: The new 'Milk Life' campaign features regular people, as opposed to celebrities, and pushes milk as being a vital source of protein . While 'Got Milk?' was designed to make milk cool again, 'Milk Life' is designed to make it seem essential . 'Everyday': 'Milk Life' appeals to everyday people . 'The idea was to convey the message that everybody drinks milk, even successful cool people.' The new ads, which roll out Tuesday, have the tagline 'Milk Life' and feature regular people touting the protein richness of milk. 'We want to show how milk can help you power through everyday moments and everyday achievements,' said Taibi, whose agency also conceptualized the Milk Life ads. The ads are commissioned by the Milk Processor Education Program (MilkPEP), which is spending $50 million on the marketing effort. The new campaign comes on the back of figures that milk sales have dropped about 1 per cent for the past two years. Research also shows consumers aren't aware of its nutritional benefits. 'Milk is a rich source of protein,' Julia Kadison, interim CEO for MilkPEP, said. Heidi Klum dresses as a milk maiden with a white moustache for a Halloween-themed version of the campaign .

One ad shows a little girl jumping into a pool. The 'Got Milk?' slogan was created by advertising agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners. The first Got Milk? advert ran on October 29, 1993 and was directed by now-bigshot Hollywood heavy Michael Bay. It featured a hapless history buff receiving a call to answer a radio station's $10,000 trivia question about who killed Alexander Hamilton. Venus and Serena Williams in 1999 . Do you find milk sexy, baby? Kate Moss in 1995 . Beyonce and her mother, Tina Knowles, in 2006 . The man, played by Sean Whalen, has turned his apartment into an obvious museum of the duel between Hamilton and Aaron Burr. But because his mouth of full with a peanut butter sandwich and he has no milk to wash it down, his answer in unintelligible and he misses out. As a result of the commercial, milk sales from 1994 to 1005 totalled 23.3 billion pounds. The ad is still considered to be one of the all-time greatest commercials. Over time celebrities became involved, with Naomi Campbell the first to be photographed with the milk mustache. Elton John, Katie Couric, Bill Clinton and David Beckham and a roll call of other starts have also been featured.","'Got Milk?' campaign launched in 1993 with a hugely successful TV commercial .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves believes Louis van Gaal should not sign  Borussia Dortmund centre back Mats Hummels this summer. Hummels, who has two years left on his contract with Dortmund, has been a long-term target for United with Van Gaal set to break the bank to secure the German in the next transfer window. The Dortmund defender was part of Joachim Low's World Cup-winning squad last summer but has struggled for form since his country's success at the showpiece in Brazil, and Hargreaves insists that Hummels is not the answer to United's central defensive issues.

'He's a super, super ball-playing centre back but I don't think he can defend, he's too slow,' Hargreaves told BT Sport. 'I think he's a nice football player, he's easy on the eye, but United need somebody physical, a presence.

"A suspected looter in this week’s riots and his mother are being thrown out of their council home. In . the first case of its kind, Daniel Sartain-Clarke, 18, and his mother . have been served with an eviction notice as council bosses seek to turf . them out of their £225,000 taxpayer-subsidised flat. Sartain-Clarke . is charged with violent disorder and attempting to steal electronic . goods from the  Currys store at Clapham Junction, South London, on . Monday night. Daniel Sartain-Clarke, pictured with his girlfriend J-Neil Starkei, has been served with an eviction notice after being charged with violent disorder . Under housing rules his mother – as . the tenant – can be evicted from their two-bedroom flat in Battersea if . anyone living there is involved in criminality. There is likely to be a . flood of similar cases as council leaders across England respond to . public demands that looters face the toughest penalties possible. In another day of dramatic developments: . Sartain-Clarke was arrested after . more than 100 looters went on the rampage on Monday night. For two hours, . the mob ransacked mobile phone stores and sports shops such as Foot . Locker and JD Sports. He appeared before magistrates in Battersea on Wednesday and pleaded not guilty to burglary and violent disorder. He and two co-defendants were remanded in custody. Couple: Sartain-Clarke and Starkei are currently both in custody after this week's riots . Should rioters have their benefits taken away from them? Should rioters have their benefits taken away from them? Now share your opinion . Last night Ravi Govindia, the leader . of Wandsworth Council, which issued the eviction notice, said he wanted . the ‘strongest possible action’ taken against rioters and looters. ‘This council will do its utmost to . ensure that those who are responsible pay a proper price,’ he said. ‘Ultimately this could lead to eviction from their homes. ‘Our officers will continue to work . with the courts to establish the identities of other council tenants or . members of their households as more cases are processed in the coming . days and weeks. ‘Most residents on our housing estates . are decent law-abiding citizens who will have been sickened at the . scenes they witnessed on their TV screens this week. ‘As much as anything else we owe it to them to send out a strong signal that this kind of violence will not be tolerated.’ But Sartain-Clarke’s mother said her human rights had been ‘taken for granted’. Spanish-born Maite de la Calva, 43, said: ‘I understand there are people who have got to face justice because all this has been madness and savagery. ‘But, I believe our human rights have been completely taken for granted. Daniel was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. ‘As a mother, I’m not responsible for my son’s actions and they are penalising me for his actions.’ The part-time worker . said the decision had left her ‘very upset’ and she did not know where she and daughter Revecca, eight, would go.

Sartain-Clarke is being held at Feltham Prison, and his mother said he was ‘terrified’ of other prisoners and gangsters. She said: ‘The other prisoners have been threatening the rioters. Daniel doesn’t know how to fight or defend himself. It’s breaking my heart right now. I left him so afraid.’ She claimed her son helped out in the community and had no history of trouble. ‘He’s a staunch member of the church,’ she said. ‘My son didn’t have a hoodie or balaclava. His face was clean and open. He’s very passive. He’s even been diagnosed with depression because he’s too passive.’ She added that his girlfriend J-Niel Starkei, 18, who was also arrested, had a promising career ahead of her. She said: ‘She’s a nice girl, not a troublemaker. She was going to start an apprenticeship this September in event management and work part-time at a casino at Westfield shopping centre.’ Aftermath: A shop damaged by fire in Clapham Junction following Monday night's riots .

Bosses at Manchester City Council . said they are preparing to evict the family of a 12-year-old boy . photographed stealing a £7.49 bottle of wine from a Sainsbury’s store. The boy was charged with burglary and . was given a nine-month referral order on Thursday, which means he must . see a probation ofﬁcer once a fortnight. His 33-year-old mother, who has . a . 14-year-old daughter and a husband . soon to be released from prison, said losing their home was her ‘biggest . fear’ but admitted there was no excuse for his behaviour. On a visit to Manchester yesterday, David Cameron repeated his determination to see looters evicted from council houses. ‘For too long we’ve taken a too-soft . attitude towards people that loot and pillage their own community,’ he . told BBC TV’s North West Tonight. ‘If you do that you should lose your right to the sort of housing that you’ve had at subsidised rates. Obviously, that will mean they’ve got to be housed somewhere else. ‘They’ll have to find housing in the . private sector and that will be tougher for them, but they should have . thought of that before they started burgling.’ And speaking during a visit to riot-hit businesses in Manchester, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made it clear that it was right that local authorities should consider eviction. He said: 'If you go out and trash other people's houses, you burn cars, you loot and smash up shops - in other words, if you show absolutely no sense of respect to your own community - then, of course, questions need to be asked whether the community should support you in living in that community. 'I think that is a perfectly fair question to ask, but how you apply it needs to be done in a case-by-case way. 'The principle that if you are getting some support from the community, you are going to have to show some loyalty to that community is a really, really important one.' Labour leader Ed Miliband, in Hackney, added: 'When council tenants sign agreements they sign up to agreements about behaviour, and local authorities have powers to deal with those things.

"Three British men waging jihad in the Middle East alongside the Islamic State (IS) have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed James Foley in a brutal propaganda video. The men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the IS capital of Raqqa, Syria. They enter the frame as security sources say MI5 are getting closer to discovering who the executioner, known only as 'John', could be. The fighter, who spoke with a British accent, butchered Mr Foley, an American journalist, in front of cameras, claiming it was retaliation for U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State (formerly ISIS).

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, a former rapper from London, Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, have been mooted as identities for 'John'. According to reports in The Sun newspaper, some of the men have similar voices, and even use similar language, to that used in the video. Security forces have revealed that the information contained in the horrific footage has allowed them to 'zero in' on the wanted man. Meanwhile, police are preparing to raid the homes of several Britons in order to help establish his identity, according to a report in The Times. Their drive to find 'John' comes as the Home Secretary announced that she was poised to bring in new . laws to tackle British extremists.

The former musician, whose music was played on Radio 1, left a £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, saying he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. He later boasted online about the battles he had fought. An expert told the Sun that Bary's voice and speech patterns sounded 'the same' as those of the man speaking in the horrific video of Mr Foley's death. According to the Sun, Bary is believed to be the ringleader of the trio. It reports that his two associates call themselves 'lions'. Cyber skills: Abu Hussain al-Britani, 20, whose real name is Junaid Hussain, was jailed for stealing personal information from Tony Blair. He left Birmingham for Syria and is reportedly launching cyber attacks on the West . Abu Hussain . al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing . personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The jihadist, real name Junaid Hussian, later left for Syria, where it has been reported that he is helping mastermind jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell the IS war coffers. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, is a former musician whose music has been played on BBC Radio 1. For more than a decade he lived with his mother Ragaa in a £1million house in Maida Vale, West London, which is owned by Westminster Council. He walked out of the family home in 2013 to fight in . Syria, saying that he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. He later boasted online about the battles he had fought. Friends . said Bary – an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene – grew . increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate . preacher Anjem Choudary. Bary is one of six children of Egyptian militant Adel Abdul Bary, who was granted political asylum in the UK in 1993. In 2012 he was extradited to the US, where he was wanted in connection to the 1998 United States embassy bombings in East Africa which killed hundreds of people. Investigators said that he helped to publicise statements claiming responsibility after the bombings. Bary Snr's eight-year legal battle made him . a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to . the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Investigators . believe Bary Snr was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the . infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network.

In an interview yesterday, Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond said: 'Our intelligence agencies and police are studying the material that we have received. 'You . wouldn't expect me to give a running commentary on that process, but we . are devoting significant amounts of resource to identifying the . individual.' He also ruled out an alliance with the . Assad regime in Syria to combat the Islamic State (formerly Isis), . saying that 'my enemy's enemy is not my friend'.

Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He fled to Syria last year while on police bail. It has been reported that the jihadist, whose real name Junaid Hussian, is helping mastermind cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell IS war coffers. Hussain has not directly mentioned hacking in his stream of Islamist posts on Twitter, but a fellow fighter boasted of being bought pizza using celebrity's credit card details acquired by a jihadist hacker.

"This is the heart-stopping moment a champion rally driver became the first person to perform a 360-degree backflip in a car. French daredevil Guerlain Chicherit, 34, sped towards a 25ft high ramp in his specially built Mini Countryman at an exact 37mph. He then hit the quarter-pipe and took off, soaring 75ft into the air and flipping his car a full 360 degrees backwards. Scroll down to watch . Guerlain Chicherit spent four years training for the stunt that he pulled off successfully yesterday . The first time Mr Chicherit, 34, attempted the stunt yesterday he did so without crowds in case it went wrong . The French daredevil drove towards the ramp in his custom-built Mini Countryman at exactly 37mph . The professional stunt driver then landed rear wheels first on other side of the specially-made snow ramp the French ski resort of Tignes, in the Alps. Chicherit's jaw-dropping stunt yesterday was the result of four years of preparation as he became the first person to successfully backflip a car. He completed the first stunt in private on Sunday morning and then repeated the feat later in front of thousands of fans as a part of event set up by the Monster energy drink. The rally star said: 'Before the jump it was crazy. I was alone in the car before the start and I just had to do it, everything was ready. 'I had to arrive at 60kph [37mph] and be full throttle in the kicker to get the right rotation. 'In the jump, I knew the balance of the car was good and it took me maybe 20 seconds to realise I had landed on my wheels. The Mini Countryman landed rear wheels first in the deep snow after performing an entire 360-degree flip . Tense: After all his years of training, Chicherit said: 'Everything was ready; I just had to do it.' Astonishing bravery: After successfully backflipping his car, Mr Chicherit simply posted on Twitter 'I did it!!! :-))))' This montage of eight photographs show how the car took off and turned through the air before landing safely . 'When you attempt something nobody has ever achieved before, the stress is really high but the only way is to just try it.' He added, teasingly: 'It wasn't the craziest thing I've ever done but for sure it's in the top three. 'It was sick - I just want to do it again.' The backflip had previously been attempted by other drivers but Chicherit became the first person to land safely after flipping the car. Guerlain is a professional action man who is best known to his countrymen as a professional rally driver, skier and champion freerider, or snowboarder. He made a second successful backflip attempt last night in front of a crowd of thousands as the sun went down over Tignes. The car had been specially built and modified for the stunt but no technical details have yet been released. After his safe landings, the modest Mr Chicherit simply wrote on Twitter: 'I did it!!!! :-)))))' Chicherit made a second successful attempt at the backflip in front of crowds in Tignes last night . The man-made snow slope was covered with promotional banners for Mr Chicherit's second attempt . The Mini Countryman flips a second time in front of open-mouthed spectators at the French ski resort . Seen from the slopes the spectators watched from, the death-defying stunt looks even more impressive . Astonishing sight: Straight after completing the backflip, the stunt rider said he wanted to do it all again . Jubilation: The 34-year-old said the stunt was 'not the craziest thing' he'd ever done, but it was in the top three .

"Government scientists have uncovered a bizarre series of  'giant flowers' on the ocean floor while investigating a shipwreck. Researchers say sonar showed a cluster of 'really big structures' at a depth of 1,900 meters in the Gulf of Mexico, which the team thought was a shipwreck. They send a robot submarine to investigate - and were revealed massive rocks splayed out over the seabed in the shape of an enormous flower, with a mystery black substance leaking out of it. Scroll down for video . After documenting the first asphault extrusion, D2 investigated a second sonar anomaly which turned out to be another ""tar lily"". Researchers believe the structures are asphalt volcanoes. Volcanoes form when material expelled from deep within the Earth creates a large structure standing above the surrounding land or seascape. Glowing streams of molten rock are what most people think of when they hear the word volcano. But eruptions of mud, shale, and salt are also known to form volcanoes. The discovery is the first time asphalt volcanoes have been spotted across the Gulf. NOAA explorers steered their remotely operated vehicle, Deep Discoverer (D2), to the structures, and researchers initially thought the forms were rocks. However, parts were rounded like they had been squeezed out of a tube and there were dozens of cracks and fissures revealing a smooth black substance. 'Within a few minutes, the scientists on the dive realized that they were looking at a much unexpected example of an asphalt volcano,' the NOAA said. Volcanoes form when material expelled from deep within the Earth creates a large structure standing above the surrounding land or seascape. Glowing streams of molten rock are what most people think of when they hear the word “volcano.” But eruptions of mud, shale, and salt are also known to form volcanoes. In 2004, scientists on the German ship F/V SONNE reported asphalt volcanoes 3,000 meters deep in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Later reports confirmed similar asphalt volcanoes off the coast of California and West Africa. Today’s discovery expands the number of known examples and confirms the existence of an asphalt ecosystem across the Gulf. After documenting the first asphault extrusion, D2 investigated a second sonar anomaly which turned out to be another 'tar lily'. A 'petal' of the flower - with a the shrimp hiding in it . The asphalt at this site is produced by the same processes that generate oil and gas, but has been transformed by geology and then altered again when it is exposed to cold seawater. The Gulf is full of oil platforms that drill into reservoirs of oil and gas and pump it ashore for energy. Some reservoirs are so old that the oil they contain has been “cooked” for millions of years. Heating causes the volatile components to evaporate, leaving behind a thick, gooey remnant. Think of how you could dissolve grease in gasoline, and what would be left behind if all the gasoline then evaporated. In refineries, the gooey residue that remains after extraction of gasoline and other products is mixed with sand and then mixed with lighter oil and heated up to make it flexible enough to pave roads. At a deep-sea asphalt volcano, the material is squeezed out in huge ropey masses that bend and flow. The massive massive rocks splayed out over the seabed in the shape of an enormous flower, with a mystery black substance leaking out of them. In the cold seawater, the remaining volatiles dissolve and the extrusions shrink in volume. At some critical point, the asphalt cannot flow anymore. Cracks and fractures form. This process would explain the basics of what the NOAA explorers discovered today. A massive plug was squeezed out at the seafloor. It then split into separate extensions that continued to flow until they became brittle and cracked apart. Once the petals of the giant lily were in place, animals that like hard surfaces had a new home. The presence of chemosynthetic tube worms at the site led scientists to believe that there was more to this site than what we could see, and the team now hopes to return tot he area . People following the dive saw beautiful video of corals, barnacles, anemones, and fish. Bacteria that can utilize the oil as food generated a sulfur-based food chain for chemosynthetic tube worms and mats of other sulfur oxidizing bacteria. Although the asphalt volcano appears to be dormant for the moment, the size of the extrusions suggests that there may be more asphalt below that might get squeezed out in the future.","Team thought they had found a large shipwreck .

A new browser add-on alerts Facebook users the instant that someone on their friends list 'unfriends' them - cutting off their link on the social network. It also alerts users when someone rejects or ignores a friend request. The script, called Unfriend Finder, is free, and has been a huge hit worldwide. Unfriend Finder has been downloaded 44 million times. It can be installed in almost any internet browser. Users see a red counter in their menu bar which comes up '-1' the second someone unfriends them - a dig at Facebook's logo for adding friends, which is a '+1'. The news will horrify many Facebook users. Facebook itself does not alert people when you click to 'unfriend' them, and it's become normal for people to do so stealthily. It's a crucial 'get-out' clause from friendships that have grown apart - and useful when relationships go bad. Many users also accept friend requests to be polite, then quietly 'unfriend' the people later if they're not close. Unfriend Finder's page says, 'Unfriends are people who were previously your friend but have either deactivated their account or have removed you from their friend list.' 'Unfriend Finder will also tell you people you have requested friendship with and who has declined your friend request.' 'Unfriend Finder makes identifying unfriends easy by displaying a red counter in the menubar with the amount of unfriends you have.' The script works in browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer, and can be downloaded for free from the official site. There are Facebook apps that also offer the same functionality, but apps that offer such functions have been a hotbed of spam in the past. Several apps for smartphones such as Frienemy for Android also offer this functionality - but many cost money, and none offer the simplicity of watching directly in your internet browser. Unfriend Finder is prone to bouts of down time, though, users say - if Facebook changes its website code, the script will no longer work, and Facebook does so quite frequently.","Instantly shows a '-1' and a name when someone unfriends you .

"A college's upcoming trip to watch Millwall Football Club so sociology students can observe 'working class culture and habits' has been blasted as 'offensive' and 'stereotyping'. Varndean College in Brighton is offering learners the chance to watch Brighton and Hove Albion take on the 'notorious' south-east London club - as well as learn about 'working class culture and habits', 'issues around sexuality, race and ethnicity' and 'women challenging gender norms'. A poster displayed at the college also urges students to enjoy working class fare like pies and Bovril and 'even talk to fans' at their home team’s American Express Community Stadium. Varndean College in Brighton is offering learners the chance to watch Brighton and Hove Albion take on the 'notorious' south-east London club (right)and learn about 'working class culture and habits' It also features a newspaper article about a former Millwall football hooligan. TalkSPORT newsreader Robyn Schönhofer tweeted: 'The words ""offensive"" and ""stereotyping"" spring to mind.' Jon Hatchman added: 'Varndean College using stereotypes against ""working class"" Millwall fans as a sociology experiment. Really not cool.' Pete Bailey, Head of Sociology at the college which has a 98 per cent A-level pass rate, defended the trip, claiming that the Millwall game was the only evening match around this time of year. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'As part of the AQA AS Sociology syllabus on Culture and Identity, students are expected to study the relationship of identity to gender and social class among other things, also the relationship between leisure activities and identity. 'Going to the football provides an opportunity to look at some of these things outside the classroom.' Varndean College is in Brighton and has an impressive pass rate of 100 per cent in arts subjects offered . One sociology student at Varndean College (pictured), who is also a Millwall fan, said the perception of the team and its supporters was 'outdated' and there are 'unjustifiable stereotypes' about the club . One Varndean sociology student and Millwall fan said the perception of Millwall was 'outdated', adding: 'As a Millwall fan I think there are some underlying, unjustifiable stereotypes about Millwall. 'From the college's point of view, and as a sociology student, I understand them using the trip to try to explain some sociological terms but I do feel that ‘women challenging gender norms’ is unfair as women have been attending football games since day dot.' Varndean College is a state-funded sixth form college in Brighton, one of the wealthiest areas of the UK, and has a 98 per cent pass rate for all A-levels, and a 100 per cent pass rate for arts subjects. It runs a number of arts societies such as life drawing and art enrichment, where students are able to go on visits to galleries, studios and meetings with contemporary designers. Millwall has a history of violent disorder, dating back 100 years when fights erupted when the team played long standing rivals West Ham. Its former ground The Old Den became so notorious with fans who would roar for their team from start to finish that clubs did not like playing there because it was so intimidating. It was closed five times by the Football Association. In 1978 a fight broke out in the Den after Millwall played an FA Cup quarter final against Ipswich Town, and dozens of fans were injured. In 2001 Millwall fans clashed with riot police after a draw with Nottingham Forest at the New Den, London . The club became associated with the Millwall Bushwhackers, one of the most well known and violent hooligan groups in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1982 Millwall club chairman Alan Thorne threatened to close the club because of violence sparked by losing in the FA Cup to non-league side Slough Town. The Kenilworth riot in 1985 took place after a sixth round FA Cup match between Millwall and Luton Town. Thousands of fans poured into the small stadium in Luton and violence broke out with fights and missiles being thrown, one hitting Luton goalkeeper Les Sealey. The incident led to Luton Town banning away fans for four years and was one of the most widely reported examples of football hooliganism. After a play off against Birmingham a trail of destruction was left through the city and 47 police injured . A large number of Millwall fans were issued with ten year bans in 2002 after a major riot ensured following a play-off game against Birmingham. Almost 50 police officers were injured during the violence and a trail of devastation was left in the streets, with several cars burnt out. In 2009 a fan at a match between Millwall and West Ham was stabbed as others started to throw bricks and start fires. West Ham supporters invaded the pitch at Upton Park at least three times and the club was later charged with two counts of violent, threatening behaviour and police said it must have been organised beforehand. Millwall was cleared of three charges. In April 2013 several Millwall fans were arrested after an outburst of violence when the team lost the FA Cup semi-final to Wigan at Wembley. Tensions ran so high that fans were reportedly attacking both police and each other. More than 100 fans have of the club, known as the Lions, have been issued with lifelong bans for getting involved in hooliganism and violence. In 2009 officials large crowds gathered at a match between Millwall and West Ham, where a fan was stabbed . Other societies include performing arts, politics and an extended English literature programme. Staff support students who wish to apply for Oxbridge, and students have gone to study at a number of top universities including Cambridge and Imperial College in London. It is the only college designated by the Government to offer the International Baccalaureate in Brighton and Hove and has been running this for seven years. The college takes about 1,500 students a year, with around 70 international students from 15 countries, who are able to come to it to study for three, six, nine or 18 months. It achieved an overall 'good' rating in the last Ofsted report in 2012. This year 76 per cent of students achieved A* to C grades in their A Levels. Students wanting to take four A-levels at the college must achieve at least six B grades in their GCSEs, with C’s in English Language and Maths. To study for the International Baccalaureate students have to have six B grades at GCSE, including in English Language, Maths and Science.","A poster displayed at the Brighton college urges students to enjoy working class fare like pies and Bovril while they study fans at Millwall match .

She said: 'I just shut my eyes as it was so horrible what was happening before me. 'I saw some very ugly guys enter the room and started shouting in a different language. 'My teacher asked me to go and hide behind the table and not look. They are bad people.' Referring to the AK47 assault rifles the terrorists were using and the sounds of gunfire, Eman said: 'I don't know what things they had in their hands but I heard noises like the ones we hear in movies. 'I heard many of the students crying. They were feeling pain.' 'I was hidden behind the table and I was hidden there for a long time.'

'I wish to go back to my studies and become a doctor. If the bad men do it again I will treat my brother and sisters. I am brave like my brother who is in hospital, and my father.' Mr Khan is proud of the bravery his daughter showed in such terrifying circumstances. The 40-year-old said: 'My daughter has proven she is a Pashtun girl, a brave girl.' He also spoke of the hellish four hours he spent with no information about the fate of Eman and his son Ammar, who also attends the school. A protest against the Peshawar school attack. More than 140 people, most of them children, were killed when Taliban gunmen stormed a school in Peshawar on Tuesday . He said: 'At the time the terrorist attack took place I was like a madman looking for my children, I was searching for Eman but there was nobody to tell me about her. 'After four hours an army officer asked me ""Is your daughter's name Eman?"" 'I was so scared to answer. I thought he had bad news about my daughter. But then I answered: ""Yes, Eman is my daughter, tell me what happened to her"". 'He said: ""She is safe and you can take her with you"". I cannot explain how glad I was to know about my beloved daughter.' 'I did not cry because it meant death': Ehsan Elahi survived by playing dead after being shot twice in the arm when Taliban militants stormed his first-aid class, massacring his friends and army instructors . 'Blood, flesh and body parts were scattered every where': Ehsan Elahi (centre) saw the 'lifeless faces of his friends' as he fled the hall during the massacre . But his joy was tempered with pain and fear immediately after. 'Your son is injured and is in military hospital,' the soldier told him. Mr Khan added: 'My son was stable today when I saw him, his mother was crying for the whole night. 'I am a driver and whatever I earn is for my family. I cannot explain to you the pain I experienced for my daughter and son.' The authorities in Pakistan reported that the school was only for boys, but Mr Khan disputed that. saying there is a separate wing for female students. Meanwhile, horrifying accounts from child survivors of the Pakistan school massacre continued to emerge. Student Aakif Azeem, 18, still wearing the green blazer of his unifrom, told the world: ‘You can rip up our school, you can take away our teachers, but you cannot take away our identity. ‘I was in the dining room when the gunmen started firing and one took a shot at me with a pistol, but the bullet ricocheted. There were children screaming and crying and there were bodies everywhere. ‘The corridors were dripping with blood. Even the teachers were terrified. ‘All I could think about was where my little brother was. Later I found out that out of a class of 25 who died, he was the only one who escaped unharmed. ‘We want our revenge. We are all innocent and had absolutely nothing to do with this.’ Devastation: Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up during a nine-hour rampage .

Student Siam Salam, 11, said: ‘I was in the classroom when we heard firing and I was very afraid. I didn’t see the gunman come in, but then I could heard the firing and bombs even louder. ‘I hid under my desk and waited until the army and ambulance arrived. Then I made a run for it out of the school. I didn't look back, I just ran until I got to the gate and escaped from the school.’ Yesterday the Pakistani prime minister lifted a moratorium on the death penalty, as the school reopened to reveal the terrifying aftermath of the atrocity, including Mrs Kazi's office, where a terrorist blew himself up. The masscre led to calls for the death penalty to be restored. 'It was decided that this moratorium should be lifted. The prime minister approved,' said government spokesman Mohiuddin Wan, referring to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's approval of the decision by a ministerial committee.","Eman was forced to listen to her friends die as she cowered behind desk .

"Eifion Howatson, 41, had pleaded guilty to demanding £5,000 with menaces from the unnamed men. One is a well-known sportsman . A paramedic commended on four occasions was last night starting a ten-month jail term for blackmailing two married men when he discovered their sexual relationships with his partner. Eifion Howatson, 41, of Ruthin, North Wales, had pleaded guilty to demanding £5,000 with menaces from the unnamed men, known by their initials when the two charges were outlined. One is a well-known sportsman. Judge David Hale told him: 'No-one must think they can make threats of this nature to anybody because it does cause such enormous upset to those affected.' Caernarfon Crown Court heard that Howatson, who had ended his own marriage, had later become involved with another woman. The judge told him: 'It's apparent you invested more in that relationship than she did. 'When you discovered in June from her mobile phone that she was having affairs you decided to take a remarkable course of action in that you blackmailed these two lovers, seeking £5,000 from each of them. 'They were married family men who probably therefore shouldn't have been involved with your partner when they had been.' One of the victims went to the police. Judge Hale added: 'They spent 40 hours in emotional turmoil.' Prosecuting counsel Wyn Lloyd Jones said Howatson had sent texts and threatened to expose the relationships but no money was handed over. Defence barrister Simon Killeen said Howatson qualified as a paramedic in 1999 but his professional body had indicated they would have to consider his registration. Mr Killeen said the father-of-two had felt the guilt of the impact of ending his marriage 'extremely keenly' and became depressed. In February he was on light duties but it was 'devastating' to him when he discovered his partner's relationships. 'It wasn't simply the fact he discovered she had been having a relationship behind his back but a second relationship, and then the material he found on her phone is relevant to his state of mind,' counsel said. Caernarfon Crown Court heard that Howatson had sent texts and threatened to expose the relationships but no money was handed over . 'We are talking about very serious conduct on his part over 40 hours following the reading of that material and realising everything he thought was in place for him to move forward was all suddenly gone.' He wasn't in his right mind.' The barrister remarked: 'The consequences are he's lost his good character and his employment.' Howatson had been commended four times for his 'outstanding' work and was an 'exemplary' member of the community. He had been a referee and did voluntary and charity work, his defence counsel added. The blackmail victims cannot be identified because of a court order.","Eifion Howatson, 41, pleaded guilty to demanding £5,000 with menaces .

"She has consistently insisted that she won't be running for President in 2016. But a controversial author now claims Hillary Clinton does have the White House in her sights - but only 'if her health holds out'.

The images - in which she was make-up . free, casually dressed and wearing glasses - came as she claimed she had . no desire to make another bid for the White House because she wanted a . rest. In January, she announced that she was ready to step off the 'high wire' of U.S. politics altogether.

"A college dropout has been hailed a unique maths genius - after his brain was damaged in a brutal attack by muggers. Jason Padgett, 41, was left concussed after he was ambushed outside a karaoke club and repeatedly kicked in the head. Now, wherever he looks, he sees mathematical formulas and turns them into stunning, intricate diagrams he can draw by hand. He is the only person in the world known to have the skill and experts say it was caused by his head injury. Incredible: Mr Padgett can produce a visual representation of the formula Pi, the infinite number which begins with 3.14 . Beautiful mind: Jason Padgett sees mathematical formulas and turns them into stunning, intricate diagrams he can draw by hand . They believe the damage to Mr . Padgett's brain has left him with a 'remarkable gift' for figures, much . like the brilliant mathematician John Nash. Mr . Padgett, who works behind the counter at a furniture store in Tacoma, . in the U.S. state of Washington, told ABC News: 'I’m obsessed with . numbers, geometry specifically. 'I literally dream about it. There’s not a moment that I can’t see it, and it just doesn’t turn off.' Mr Padgett does not have a PhD, a degree or even a background in maths. Instead, his talent was born out of a true medical mystery that scientists around the world are still trying to unravel. Ten years ago, Mr Padgett was only interested in two things: working out and partying. One . night he was walking out of a karaoke club in Tacoma when he was set . upon by muggers who beat and kicked him in the head repeatedly. The unlikely genius thought he was going to be killed as his attackers went for his $99 leather jacket. 'All . I saw was a bright flash of light and the next thing I knew I was on my . knees on the ground and I thought, ""I’m gonna get killed"",' he said. At the time, doctors said he had a concussion, but within a day or two, Mr Padgett began to notice something remarkable. Complicated: Mr Padgett draws complex diagrams called fractals, comprising hundreds of shapes which are the same or similar to the whole picture . A college dropout who could not draw became obsessed with producing intricate diagrams, but he had no idea what they were. 'I see bits and pieces of the Pythagorean theorem everywhere,' he said. 'Every single little curve, every single spiral, every tree is part of that equation.' Striking: Mr Padgett became obsessed with drawing diagrams, but had no idea why . Mr Padgett draws diagrams called fractals. He can produce a visual representation of the formula Pi, the infinite number which begins with 3.14. He said: 'A fractal is a shape that when you take the shape a part into pieces, the pieces are the same or similar to the whole. 'So say I had 1,000 pictures of you, . that were little and I put all those little pictures of you in the right . spot to make the exact same picture of you, but bigger.' Much . like Nash, who was played by Russell Crowe in the 2001 film, A . Beautiful Mind, researchers believe Mr Padgett has a remarkable gift. Detailed: Mr Padgett's drawing of a hand is based on a complex mathematical formula . To . better understand how his brain works, neuroscientist and philosophy . professor Berit Brogaard and her team flew Mr Padgett to Finland to run a . series of tests. A scan showed damage that was forcing his brain to overcompensate in certain areas that most people do not have access to. Prof Brogaard, who is based at the Center for Neurodynamics at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said the result that Mr Padgett is now an acquired savant, meaning brilliant in a specific area. Circles of life: Mr Padgett hopes to teach others that maths is as beautiful and natural as the world around them . 'Savant syndrome is the development of a particular skill, that can be mathematical, spatial, or autistic, that develop to an extreme degree that sort of makes a person superhuman,' the professor added. Mr Padgett said his goal was to get out of the furniture store and into the classroom to hopefully teach others that maths is as beautiful and natural as the world around us. Genius: Researchers believe Mr Padgett's brain damage has left him with a 'remarkable gift' for figures, much like the brilliant mathematician John Nash, who was played in a Hollywood movie by Russell Crowe, pictured. When asked if he thought his talent was a burden or a gift, he said it was a mixture of both. 'Sometimes I would really like to turn it off, and it won’t,' he said. 'But the good far outweighs the bad. I would not give it up for anything.' Mr Padgett sells his pictures, which can also be viewed here.","Furniture store worker Jason Padgett suffered brain damage in assault by muggers .

"Actor Christian Bale has upset several Christian writers after he described Moses as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' Christian Bale, who plays Moses in Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, the forthcoming biblical epic directed by Ridley Scott has upset several Christian writers after he described his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic'. Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles last month, Bale said he had undertaken significant research for the role, including also reading the Torah, the Koran and Jonathan Kirsch’s life of Moses. ‘I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life,’ he said. Bale also said he was surprised by the complexity of the Old Testament figure – and his creator. ‘He was a very troubled, tumultuous man and mercurial. But the biggest surprise was the nature of God. He was equally very mercurial.’ Bale’s controversial comments haven't been well received by Christian writers and bloggers who fear the film is tampering too much with the original Biblical text. Influential Christian writer, Brian Godawa, who leaked elements of the Noah script online before the movie was finished, weigh in on Bale’s comments at his blog. 'Yes, Moses murdered a man, and he had a character arc that went from being adopted and raised as a pagan Egyptian to a conversion to his troubled and tumultuous faith. 'He had difficulty trusting Yahweh. He didn’t want to be God’s spokesman because he stuttered. And he even had arguments with God. Scroll down for video . Holy Moses! Bale’s controversial comments haven't been well received by Christian writers and bloggers who fear the film is tampering too much with the original Biblical text . 'But Schizophrenic? Barbaric? Really?' Godawa said that he hoped Bale's comment was ‘a reflection of the actor’s own ignorant bigotry than of the actual movie.’ Chris Stone, the founder of Faith Driven Consumer, said he was surprised by Bale’s description of Moses, reports The Hollywood Reporter. 'There’s nothing in the biblical history that supports that,' he said. 'It’s an indication that there will be a tremendous disconnect between Bale’s interpretation and the expectations of the market.' His organization, which previously campaigned for Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson following the show's suspension, conducted a poll about Exodus. The poll found that 74 percent of Americans were likely to see the film if it was biblically accurate but that 68 percent were unlikely to see it if it was inaccurate. 'It’s our sincerest hope that this movie resonates with our community, so we sent them the results of our poll,' said Stone. 'Their response was, ""we don’t need to have any further conversation.""' Writing for multi-faith website Patheos.com, film critic Peter Chattaway said Bale's remarks went further than simply commenting on the Bible but rather he 'speculates about what was going on inside Moses’ head at the time.' Many of the same commentators drew similar criticism at Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, which starred Russell Crowe and was released earlier this year. Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, which is due out on December 12. Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, out in December 12, tells the story of Moses rising up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses and taking 600,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt .","The actor has upset several Christian writers after describing his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic'

"Thanksgiving Day is no longer all about turkey: It's eating away at Black Friday shopping. U.S. shoppers spent $9.74 billion on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. That's a drop of 13.2 per cent compared with last year, according to data released on Saturday by research firm ShopperTrak. The decline appears to show that more Americans shopped on the holiday itself: Combined spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, which had been considered the official start to the holiday buying season until this year, rose 2.3 per cent to $12.3 billion. Shopping the sales: President Barack Obama speaks to a cashier as he pays for books with daughter Malia (right) and Sasha (left) at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington on November 30, 2013 . The data reflects that Thanksgiving, which along with Christmas was one of two days a year that most stores were closed, is becoming an important day for major retailers. Black Friday is a time when big retailers open early and offer deep discounts, but a few started opening and offering those discounts on Thanksgiving a couple years ago. And this year, at least a dozen did so, with a few opening earlier in the holiday than they did last year.The National Retail Federation, a retail trade group, predicted that 33 million, or almost a quarter, of the 140 million people who planned to shop during the four-day holiday weekend that ends on Sunday, would do so on Thanksgiving. Analysts had questioned whether the holiday openings would steal sales away from Black Friday or result in people spending more overall.'Retailers were pretty successful in drawing the consumers into the stores on Thursday,' said ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin, whose company counts how many shoppers go into about 40,000 stores in U.S. But 'Thursday's sales came at the expense of Black Friday's numbers.' Grey Thursday: Eager shoppers in Bloomington, Indiana rush through the doors of Kohl's for early Black Friday shopping on Thanksgiving . Festive shopping: Randy Thatcher (right) of Martinsville, holds presents, while his grandson Thatcher Anderson browses during Thanksgiving shopping at Kohl's in Indiana . The decline in sales on Black Friday was the second one in a row. Last year, sales on that day dropped 1.8 per cent to $11.2 billion, though it still was the biggest shopping day last year, according to ShopperTrak.Despite the big drop this year, Shoppertrak's Martin said he thinks Black Friday will remain the biggest shopping day of the year for the 10th consecutive year. But if retailers continue to promote Thanksgiving as the start of the holiday buying season, he thinks the holiday will eventually surpass Black Friday in sales. 'We're just taking Black Friday sales and spreading them across a larger number of days,' Martin said. There will be a clearer picture of sales for the first holiday shopping weekend on Sunday when The National Retail Federation releases data. Overall, the retail trade group expects sales to be up 3.9 per cent to $602 billion for the season, which encompasses the last two months of the year. That's higher than last year's 3.5 per cent growth, but below the six per cent pace seen before the recession. Shop til you drop: Americans purchased two million televisions over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday period . Some retailers said the holiday shopping season is off to a good start. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, said it sold 2 million TVs and 1.4 million tablets on the Thanksgiving, while Macy's said 15,000 people showed up to the 8pm opening of its flagship New York City store on the holiday. Edwin Molina, 30, a New Yorker who works in construction, waited with his wife in line for an hour at a Best Buy that opened at 6pm on Thanksgiving. He said he likes the holiday openings. 'It was better, less hectic,' he said. But not everyone liked the earlier start to the shopping season. Workers' rights groups and some shoppers led small protests to decry the way some store employees had to miss holiday meals at home. And as his wife shopped in a mall near Atlanta on Black Friday, Curtis Akins, 51, sat on a bench, lamenting the holiday openings. 'It's taking away from the traditional Thanksgiving,' Akins said.","Black Friday sales have been diminished by 13.2 per cent from last year .

"A Florida Panhandle charged with raping and murdering his 10-year-old stepdaughter just minutes after he killed the girl's mother 22 years ago was executed this evening via lethal injection. Chadwick Banks, 43, was scheduled to die at 6pm Thursday at Florida State Prison in Starke for the 1992 slaying of Melody Cooper, who was found on her knees naked from the waist down and her body slumped on her bed at their Gadsden County trailer home. The body of her mother, Cassandra Banks, was found nearby. Both had been shot in the head. Banks was pronounced dead at 7.27 pm, the office of Gov. Rick Scott said. For his last words, Banks apologized to the 19 people who witnessed his execution, among them the family of the two victims. 'I am very sorry for the pain I have caused all these years,' he said, according to WPTV. 'Year after year I have tried to come up with a reasonable answer for my actions. But how could such acts be reasonable?' Scroll down for video . Executed: Chadwick Banks, 43, was pronounced dead at 7.27pm  at Florida State Prison for the 1992 slaying of Melody Cooper, 10, who was found on her knees naked from the waist down, and her mother, Cassandra Banks, at their Gadsden County trailer home.

Exonerated death row inmate Seth Penalver hugs his fiancee  during the execution of his friend Chadwick Banks. Penalver spent 18 years on death row before being found not guilty of all charges relating to a 1994 home invasion that resulted in three murders during a third trial in 2012 . Banks was served his last meal at 10 am, for which he requested fried fish, homemade French fries, hush puppies, old-fashioned dinner rolls and three desserts - homemade banana pudding, red velvet cake and butter pecan ice cream, according toThe Tallahassee Democrat. To drink he asked for a glass of ice water. Banks, who was 21 at the time of the murders, was serving a life sentence. Outside the prison, The mother and grandmother of the two victims, Annette Black, who was among the 19 people who witnessed the execution, said she hoped what happened to Banks could be taken as a lesson for other people. 'Once you take a precious life, nothing can bring that back again,' she said. It was the 20th execution carried out in Florida since Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, one fewer than under Jeb Bush, who presided over the most executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the state in 1979. It is believed to be the eighth execution in Florida this year. Bush was governor for two terms, while Scott, who was re-elected last week, is finishing his first. 'Maybe the most solemn duty is capital punishment. I take it very seriously,' Scott said. 'I think about the victims. I think about their families. It's what I think about. I'm going to continue to do the job that I committed to do.' Most of the other 19 people executed have been the perpetrators of some of the most horrific cases Florida's seen, and many of them left no doubt that the condemned committed the crime. That includes David Alan Gore, a serial killer who raped and dismembered his victims and was caught with the body of a teenage girl in his car trunk and a live girl bound in his parents' attic. Like Gore, Banks admitted to his crime. Banks' attorneys have asked the federal courts to intervene, arguing Florida's lethal injection process violates the ban on cruel and unusual punishment and that he received ineffective legal counsel. Scene: Banks was scheduled to be put to death at 6pm Thursday and was pronounced dead at 7.27pm . Injection: The 43-year-old was executed in this chamber at Florida State Prison in Starke . Not one but three: For his last meal, Banks specified he wanted three desserts - (left to right) butter pecan ice cream, red velvet cake and banana pudding . Dinner: The convicted murderer and rapist wanted only fried foods for his last proper meal, including hush puppies (left) and fried fish (right) His lawyer, Terri Backhus, didn't return a phone message and email seeking comment Wednesday. Gadsden County Sheriff Morris Young was an officer with the Quincy Police Department in 1992 when he got word of a double murder just a few blocks outside of the city line. He and others responded to the trailer where the bodies of Cassandra Banks and Melody were found, both killed by gunshot wounds to the head. 'It was one of those gruesome things that happened in the community that had everyone in shock. It was a small town and a huge case,' Young said this week. 'They just couldn't believe such a thing could happen in a small town.' Banks was drinking and playing pool at a neighborhood bar called Dut's the night of the slayings. His wife left the bar and went to their home late that night. Banks left less than an hour later and went into their trailer and found his wife asleep. Without waking her, he shot her point-blank in the head then went to his stepdaughter's room. After his arrest, he told investigators he had 'spanked' Melody and molested her for about 20 minutes, but she didn't resist or try to get away. Evidence showed the assault was much more violent. Banks was executed by lethal injection at Florida State Prison (pictured) in Starke on Thursday night. It is the 20th execution carried out in Florida since Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011 . Banks' blood was found under Melody's fingernails and on her pillow, and she had a bruise and cut on her face. She had also been sodomized and Banks' DNA was found inside her. Forensic experts testified that given the position of her body, and that it had not moved after the shot was fired, Banks had to pull her head far back in order to fire the gun through the top of her skull. Young spoke with Chadwick Banks' father, Dennis, and Cassandra Banks' mother on Monday. He said both families accept the execution. 'As sheriff, now I stand with both sides of the family,' said Young, who added he has known Banks' parents for years. Dennis Banks was a longtime corrections officer and ran a security company. 'He and his wife are true believers in God and they've turned this over to him,' Young said, adding that the Banks have visited their son in prison and have prayed with him. 'Their son turned his life over to God and they are content with everything that's going on.'","Chadwick Banks shot his wife, Cassandra Banks, while she slept in their Gadsden County trailer in the early hours of September 24, 1992 .

"The plan to name supermarkets who sell raw chicken with the campylobacter bug was been scrapped . A plan to regularly name and shame supermarkets selling chicken contaminated with the dangerous food poisoning bug campylobacter is set to be killed off following pressure from retailers. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) had promised to carry out regular surveys of chicken sold on the high street and publish the results, including the names of the stores, every three months. The idea was that the public naming and shaming exercise would put pressure on the stores to clean up their chicken and reduce the food poisoning risk to customers. However, the officials at the watchdog now want to scrap this idea and instead only publish data on the number of birds that are contaminated without identifying the stores involved. The move has been condemned by a leading academic, who suggested it was driven by pressure from the industry and Government departments, who are keen support supermarkets, farmers and processors. The changes represent a major victory for the commercial interests of the big retailers, putting concerns for their sales and profits ahead of consumer safety and their right to know what they are eating. The fact that the supermarkets have managed to water down the scheme is just the latest evidence as to how lobbying by big business has driven a change in official policy on food and health issues. Similar lobbying killed off a plan for a blanket ban on junk food snacks and drinks from displays around supermarket check-outs. The FSA recently revealed that more than one million people are falling victim to food poisoning every year with supermarket chicken named as the greatest threat. Campylobacter, which is most often found on raw chicken, is the biggest cause of food poisoning in the country. An official study published in 2009 revealed that two in three of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with campylobacter. More than one in four – 27 per cent – were classed as being highly contaminated. Despite the fact the FSA has asked supermarkets and farmers to make combatting campylobacter a top priority, the situation appears to have shown no improvement since then. An FSA paper on the food poisoning caused by campylobacter warned: ‘In addition to the attendant economic costs, cases cause inconvenience, discomfort and misery to those who become infected and a small proportion of cases result in death or long-term consequences, such as reactive arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome, the latter of which affects the peripheral nervous system.’ Despite the clear threat, the FSA’s executives are now asking its board to redraw the rules for its surveys to ensure the stores selling contaminated chicken are not identified in its quarterly results. A paper prepared by officials states this is in response to ‘legitimate concerns expressed by the industry and other government departments’. The references to other departments relates to the food and farming department, DEFRA, which sees itself as a champion of British farmers, including those producing chicken. The bug, pictured, which is thought to be in two in three of all fresh chickens on supermarket shelves . The FSA paper states: ‘In the last update to the Board in March 2014 it was stated that the FSA intended to release the full results, including the names of the retailers and processors, of testing of around 1,000 samples every 3 months during the survey, with the first results published around June/July 2014.’ However, it says it has now decided to change this approach because there is a risk the results will be incomplete and misleading and it would – in some way – be unfair to the stores. The FSA said: ‘One of the drawbacks of this approach is that no interpretation can properly be placed on interim raw data until the full year’s sampling is complete and fully analysed. ‘There has been legitimate concern expressed by industry and other Government Departments that publication of incomplete data, consisting of the results of a single quarter’s sampling and analysis with retailers and producers identified for each sample, would facilitate misinterpretation of the interim data with the obvious risk of compilation by third parties of ‘league tables’ that would not be statistically valid nor supportive of any conclusions drawn from such tables. ‘Whilst the FSA could and would, obviously, caveat any interim data, we cannot control any possible misuse of the data which may cause unnecessary concern in, or mislead, consumers.’ The watchdog’s board is being asked to approve this new approach at a meeting tomorrow. The FSA recently revealed that more than one million people are falling victim to food poisoning every year with supermarket chicken named as the greatest threat . Erik Millstone, the Professor of Science Policy at the University of Sussex, condemned the move to let the supermarkets off the hook. He said: ‘I am shocked that the staff of the Agency are trying to persuade the board to retreat from its previous undertaking to name and shake the stores on what seem to me to be utterly spurious reasons. ‘The FSA is under intense pressure from industry and ministers not to rock any boats, but to remain invisible and silent. If the FSA deliberately conceals information that consumers want and deserve their credibility with the general public will be seriously compromised.’ He suggested public health could be put at risk if they are denied information on which stores are guilty of selling the most contaminated chicken. The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said publishing the results on chicken, and naming the stores with higher levels of campylobacter, would be ‘meaningless without any form of analysis.’ It said families should take responsibility for protecting themselves against food poisoning. A spokesman said: ‘All the major retailers continue to work with their suppliers to reduce the prevalence of campylobacter – which can also be destroyed through proper cooking.’","Plan would have seen stores selling chicken with campylobacter bug named .

"The huge container port of Zeebrugge was at rest yesterday as church bells called Sunday worshippers to prayer. Under a leaden sky, Belgians huddled against the breeze drinking tea in beach huts, while kite-surfers skimmed across the sea next to the port where hundreds of metal containers – piled like giant Lego bricks and stamped with British company names – waited on the concrete to be lifted on to ferries for Channel crossings next week. This is the port at the centre of a new immigration controversy: where 35 migrants, including children, were crammed into a container on a P&O ship which set sail to Tilbury in Essex on Friday night. On Saturday at 6.15am, when the container was lifted off the boat on to the Tilbury dockside, the exhausted migrants screamed to be let out as their air inside began to give out. Scroll down for videos . Ready to risk all: Migrants from Asia at their makeshift camp in Zeebrugge, Belgium, yesterday . Containers: It is thought between 600 and 3,000 migrants a year slip through the port's security to Britain . One man had died in the horrific conditions, and the others were taken to hospital suffering from thirst, cold and exhaustion. It had been a nightmare journey of nine hours across the Channel in the dark, airless 40ft long metal box. However the terrifying odyssey at least ended in the only country the migrants wanted to reach: the promised land of England. In recent weeks, the eyes of the world have been on Calais, the French port where 1,300 Eritreans and Sudanese migrants have rioted as they battle for control of the best spot to jump on a lorry driving on to a ferry to the UK. Yet over 15 years of mass illegal migration to Britain, other ports along the French and Belgian north coasts have also become targets for migrants hoping to smuggle themselves to England. They come from all over the world, and are mostly not Africans – like those who wait at Calais – but Afghans, Iranians, Iraqis, Chinese, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese. At Zeebrugge, security fences have been put up, and containers are searched with body-heat-seeking devices, machines to detect human breath and sniffer dogs. Fenced off: There are high security fences and containers are searched with devices that seek body heat . Hard to track: The ship on which the Afghan Sikhs hid had 50 other containers on board, all bound for Tilbury . ‘This was a result of the growing numbers,’ a port official told the Mail recently. ‘We had to do something to stop Zeebrugge becoming a target like Calais.’ Whether this has worked is another matter. The scale of the task is daunting. At one stage, the port authority admitted only one container in four could be searched because there are not enough staff. According to monitoring groups, during big waves of illegal migration 3,000 a year have slipped into containers on ferries and made it to England from Zeebrugge. It is thought the number of those getting through is now around 600 a year – but the truth is that no one knows. Grim: In makeshift camps near the port, some migrants have waited for a year or more . There are so many containers and so many ferries crossing the Channel. The ship on which the Afghan Sikhs hid had 50 other containers on board. Most migrants arriving at the Belgian coast live in decrepit makeshift camps hidden among trees dotted along the motorway from France while they wait their chance to get to England. Some have tents bought at the local supermarkets, but the majority exist in squalid improvised huts made from pieces of shed, black tarpaulin, sheets and blankets. I visited two camps on the Belgian border near Zeebrugge yesterday morning. I talked to migrants as they cooked breakfast over open fires. I met a doctor, an engineer and an architect from Iran, two Sikh students from the Indian Punjab, and dozens of Afghans who said they had not had a job in their home countries for years and were running away ‘to your England’. The migrants from different cultures and countries have little in common – except they all have family in Britain, want to get there desperately, and have been put in the ‘holding’ camps by agents who operate along the Belgian and French coasts, and also smuggle them on to lorries for fat fees. The agents are controlled by Mr Bigs in cities such as London and Paris, such shadowy figures that even the agents do not know the names of their bosses. The agents set up the illicit journeys by mobile phone, and they, too, stay anonymous. They give only their first names or even pseudonyms to the migrants, so they cannot be traced if police or border staff catch a stowaway at Zeebrugge or one of the other ports, such as Dunkirk. The British police say they are launching a homicide inquiry into the dead migrant, and hope to catch the traffickers who put him – and the other Afghan Sikhs – into the container. It will, by any standards, be a tough job. Almost certainly, the Afghan Sikhs will not even know the identity of the trafficking agents who fixed their journey, let alone the names of those who pull the strings at the top of the operation. There is one sliver of evidence: a CCTV camera caught a picture of the lorry with the container entering the port on Friday night. It is believed they were smuggled across the 4,000 miles from Afghanistan to Western Europe by truck. Once in Belgium, they were put into an empty container, due to be shipped to the UK, and driven by lorry into the port area and on to the ferry. Whether they were forced to wait in a camp until the ‘time was right’ for the illicit journey is unclear as yet. Certainly, the migrants I spoke to yesterday had not seen any Afghan Sikhs during the past two or three weeks. Ideal: Some will pay another £1,500 to cross the Channel after already paying £20,000 for their journey so far . Increased security 'was a result of the growing numbers,' a port official told the Mail recently. 'We had to do something to stop Zeebrugge becoming a target like Calais’, the official added . There are only 3,000 Sikh families in Afghanistan. They have been oppressed by successive regimes for their religious beliefs. The Taliban were particularly vicious, attacking and ostracising Sikhs for their perceived wealth as successful merchants, and their refusal to convert to Islam. No wonder this particular group has turned its eyes to London in the past decade, where there is a thriving and established Afghan Sikh community, particularly in Southall, West London. Relatives in London raise the large sums of money demanded by the trafficking organisations, often – I have been told – paying the fees into trafficking agents’ bank accounts in England. The cost of a journey from Afghanistan to the Belgian coast is currently £20,000 a person, and then £1,500 per head to be taken across the Channel. A well-used migrant route for Afghans is to head for Turkey by land and then travel over the porous border into Greece by boat, where they make their way to Italy and catch trains northwards to the Channel ports. Challenge: The road to Zeebrugge is a long one, and for many it begins with a tourist visa to Italy . One migrant, 22-year-old Indian Sikh Hara Singh, said: 'I heard what had happened to the Sikhs from Afghanistan. It is terrible news for us, too. We are worried there will be more security on the container ships' However, there is another migrant route which has become a favourite with those who have money. The illegals enter border-free Europe by plane on a tourist visa to Italy via Moscow. ‘A tourist visa into modern Europe means that you can go to any country apart from England without any trouble. Italy is full of tourists and gives the visas out easily, so it is a passport to Europe,’ an immigration official in Rome told me recently. This was just the route taken by Hira Singh, a 22-year-old Indian Sikh I found at a camp in Grande Synthe, a French town near the Belgian border yesterday. He told me: ‘I heard what had happened to the Sikhs from Afghanistan. It is terrible news for us, too. We are worried there will be more security on the container ships going out of the ports now.’ Then, with his toothbrush and toothpaste in hand as he went for a morning wash at the corner of the camp, he added emotionally: ‘I flew by Air India on a tourist visa from Delhi to Moscow, and then to Rome. I got a train here to northern France. I have been here a year and I am beginning to lose hope of getting to England.’ At a camp nearer Zeebrugge, another Indian Sikh, Ranjodh Singh, 22, his long hair tucked into a baseball cap, said: ‘I have relatives in Southall, in Birmingham and all over the north of England. I have been here for two weeks waiting for the agent to find me a place on a container or a lorry. ‘I came into Italy on a tourist visa and caught a train from there. My visa into Italy meant I could come to Belgium because there aren’t any borders in Europe any more, so it was easy. With sincerity shining from his dark eyes, he added: ‘I don’t want to be here, though, only England.’ No doubt the 35 Sikhs from Afghanistan found at Tilbury in such a desperate state felt the same when they set off on their perilous journey. And what is clear from their troubling and tragic story is that they certainly won’t be the last to take their lives in their hands in the hope of making it to their destination.","35 Afghans were crammed into container in huge port of Zeebrugge, Belgium .

"President Barack Obama today urged Americans not to succumb to hysteria over Ebola, warning that travel restrictions between the U.S. and West Africa could 'make the situation worse'. Speaking in his weekly radio and internet address, Obama told listeners: 'Trying to seal off an entire region of the world - if that were even possible - could actually make the situation worse,' He added: 'This is a serious disease, but we can't give in to hysteria or fear because that only makes it harder to get people the accurate information they need. We have to be guided by the science.' It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Most of these cases have been reported in West Africa. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Warning: President Barack Obama today warned that travel restrictions between the U.S. and West Africa could make the Ebola situation 'worse'. Above, Obama speaks during his weekly radio and internet address . Although lawmakers had previously cited a travel ban as a common-sense step to prevent more people with Ebola from entering the U.S., Obama defended his decision. He argued that far from combating the spread of the deadly virus, such a ban would only hamper aid efforts and screening measures. Instead, he said defeating Ebola, which has mainly affected Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, would require a joint effort between citizens, government leaders and the media. On Friday, growing concern about Ebola and the three cases diagnosed so far in Dallas prompted Obama to tap former top White House adviser Ron Klain to be his point person on the virus. Ebola victim: Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan (pictured), 42, who was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S., passed away at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on October 8 .

Liberian Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, who was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S., died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on October 8. Since then, two nurses who cared for him - Nina Pham, 26, and 29-year-old Amber Vinson - have been found to have the virus. Striking a careful balance, Obama said today there is no 'outbreak' or 'epidemic' of Ebola in the U.S., but even one case is too many. 'Fighting this disease will take time,' he said. 'Before this is over, we may see more isolated cases here in America. But we know how to wage this fight.' Speaking at the White House: Obama said today there is no 'outbreak' or 'epidemic' of Ebola in the U.S. Appointment: On Friday, growing concern about Ebola and the three cases diagnosed so far in Dallas prompted Obama to tap ex-White House adviser Ron Klain (pictured) to be his point person on the virus . As Obama sought to reassure anxious Americans, U.S. officials were still working to contain the fallout and potential routes of infection from the Ebola cases identified in the country. so far. The president said he was 'absolutely confident' the U.S. could prevent a serious outbreak at home - if it continues to elevate facts over fear. Yesterday, it was revealed that nearly 100 lawmakers are in favor of placing travel restrictions in order to decrease the odds that someone who is infected with Ebola will be able to enter the U.S. At least 80 members of the House and 20 senators have said they would like the president ban flights that have carrying passengers coming out of West Africa or temporarily rescind the visas of residents of Ebola stricken nations. It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center in Liberia . The White House said on Friday that if the president believed such a move would be in the interest of the public's safety, 'he wouldn't hesitate to do that.' Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said. Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the affected person's bodily fluids.","Obama urged Americans not to succumb to 'hysteria or fear' over Ebola .

"A former senior adviser to the British government has been sentenced to 12 years in a Cambodian jail for sexually abusing three young girls. Michael Leach, who worked closely with ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry, was arrested last September near Phnom Penh, the country's capital. The 51-year-old pervert was found living in a guesthouse where he had been abusing three girls aged 10, 12 and 15 years old. Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, close to where the offences took place. Cambodia has targeted sex offenders in recent years but it remains a magnet for paedophiles because of poverty and poor law enforcement . Leach once attended a Commonwealth Summit with Labour Minister for Energy Stephen Timms, and also represented Britain at trade fares across the globe. He was a senior advisor in the DTI specialising in international communications until 2005. That year he was arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing children at a Phnom Penh orphanage. After 10 hours in custody he was released without charge, the People reported at the time of his September arrest. Returning to the UK in 2006, Leach joined OFCOM, the communications watchdog, which he represented at a major European conference. Today Phnom Penh Municipal Court judge Oeung Seang also ordered Leach to pay 12million riel (£1,840) to one of the victims. Compensation had already been paid to the other two girls. Cambodia has targeted sex offenders in recent years but it remains a magnet for paedophiles because of poverty and poor law enforcement. An aid agency that works with victims of child sex abuse warned that sex tourism remains rife in many poorer parts of the world. Erica Hall, child rights specialist with World Vision UK, said that Leach’s conviction was just the tip of an iceberg. World Vision UK believes that there are many British sex offenders who continue to prey on children abroad with relative impunity,' she said. 'More research needs to be done, but there is evidence to suggest that as South East Asia becomes an increasingly difficult place in which to operate, not least because of convictions of offenders such as Leach, offenders are targeting other countries, closer to home.' Registered sex offenders are still allowed to travel overseas without telling the UK authorities as long as they return within three days. Recent cases have shown British travellers and expatriates have been involved in the abuse of children in countries such as Albania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic – all of which can be reached within the three-day limit.","Paedophile Michael Leach was former DTI adviser .

"Vladimir Putin is as dangerous as Joseph Stalin and much more of a threat to world peace than ISIS, a former defence secretary has claimed. Bob Ainsworth said Mr Putin was more powerful than the jihadists in the Middle East because he had a strong state and military to achieve his ambitions. The senior Labour MP called for the Government to launch an urgent review of its military cuts and take a much stronger line against Russian expansionism. Scroll down for video . Russia's president Vladimir Putin (left) could become as dangerous as Second World War dictator Joseph Stalin (right), according to the former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth . Mr Ainsworth’s remarks come after Prince Charles likened Mr Putin to Hitler during a trip to Canada. The MP made his stark assessment in an article for a Birmingham public affairs website called the Chamberlain Files. He said: ‘No leader of a major power has behaved as overtly aggressively since Stalin in the postwar period, and sadly Putin would be very pleased with the comparison. ‘He has said the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century and he claims the right to act on behalf of Russian minorities in other states. ‘As there are Russian minorities throughout the old Soviet Union and far wider he is in principle claiming the right to interfere in the affairs of all of the independent sovereign states of eastern Europe. ‘Stalin's policies pushed the world into the cold war. Putin has the potential to be equally as dangerous.’ Mr Ainsworth, in remarks published in the Times, said Europe needed to reduce its reliance on Russian energy. He said: ‘The prime minister told the House of Commons recently there is no need to look at the strategic defence review of 2010 despite the fact that large scale cuts are still being imposed on our armed forces.’ The former defence secretary said: ‘We have an army stuffed full of the kind of vehicles best suited to fight a counter insurgency in Afghanistan, not those likely to offer reassurance to our European neighbours facing a Russia that is re-equipping its own forces. ‘These capabilities cannot be altered simply or quickly. All party agreement should be sought for a new review now, this side of the election, to look at what can be afforded and the kind of training and equipment needed in the face of the new scenario.’ Mr Putin - watching the launch of a missile during naval exercises in Russia's Arctic North on board the nuclear missile cruiser Peter the Great - has ramped up military spending, threatening eastern European states . The hard-man president has played up to his macho image to win support. Joseph Stalin rose to prominence as an enforcer for Vladimir Lenin . Mr Cameron slashed defence spending by 10 per cent in 2010 – but has vowed to increase the military budget between 2015 and 2020. Last week, Gerald Howarth, a former coalition defence minister, called for a new comprehensive strategy for dealing with security threats arising from Ukraine, the Middle East and north Africa. He said: ‘Since we completed our strategic security and defence review in 2010, fundamental changes have taken place across north Africa, the middle east and Ukraine. ‘Nothing calls more for a really serious new strategic defence and security review than the state of affairs at the moment. ‘I hope that the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and other government departments will put time and effort into producing a strategy.’","Bob Ainsworth said Russia's president more powerful than ISIS jihadists .

Giving thanks: On Thanksgiving, a Walmart in Sugar Land, Texas is crowded with shoppers who had waited for hours inside the store for the beginning of the sales at 6pm . Dice is also frustrated that the desperate want of discounted goods means that Black Friday has encroached on Thanksgiving, forcing retail associates to work 'bizarre hours' and leave their own families on Thanksgiving.

"A Royal Navy destroyer was scrambled to Scotland in a major security scare after a Russian aircraft carrier came within 30 miles of British shores for the first time in 20 years. HMS York travelled around 1,000 miles from Portsmouth to keep watch as the 65,000 tonne Admiral Kuznetsov and a number of other battleships anchored on the edge of UK waters. Today the Scottish National Party . accused the Russians of dumping waste into the water while moored off . the coast at Moray Firth on Monday. Scroll down for video . Scare: HMS York keeps watch as the Admiral Kuznetsov anchors just outside British waters off the coast at Moray Firth, Scotland, on Monday . Scrambled: British warship sent 1,000 miles to intercept Russian vessel . The vessels did not warn British . authorities they were going to come so close to the coast and are . thought to have blamed bad weather for having to approach. They are believed to be still in the area today while they avoid poor sea conditions but are no longer anchored. Previously defence chiefs would have . scrambled Nimrod aircraft from RAF Kinloss in Moray but because the base . has been scrapped in cutbacks and a new fleet of planes cancelled, the . Navy had no choice but to send HMS York. Although the Russian fleet was . outside UK waters it was within the exclusive economic zone which . Britain has the sole rights to exploit. The Admiral Kuznetsov is en route . to the Mediterranean from its northern base at Severomorsk for exercises . with the Russian Black Sea Fleet. A spokesman for the Ministry of . Defence said: 'The Admiral Kuznetsov, with other warships and support . vessels, is thought to be en route to the Mediterranean on exercise. 'The . aircraft carrier anchored outside British territorial waters some 30 . miles off the Moray Firth where she was thought to have taken advantage . of the relative shelter to avoid the worst of current bad weather in the . North Sea.' Westminster SNP leader and Defence spokesman Angus Robertson has . condemned the 'marine fly-tipping' and is asking the British Government what . it has done about the incident. Mr Robertson said: 'Given the bad . weather conditions the Russian vessels are very welcome to shelter off . the Scottish coast, but it is more than bad manners to dispose of waste . by simply throwing it overboard. 'This is in contravention of agreements and normal practice and I think we need answers from the Russian and UK Governments. Although two decades may have passed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Britain faces a new Russian threat as Vladimir Putin flexes his military muscle. RAF Tornadoes are regularly scrambled to intercept supersonic invaders approaching UK airspace. In 2009 alone, jets were sent up 20 times to repel Russian warplanes. After a gap of 15 years, Putin resumed the intrusions in 2007. On one occasion, an eight-strong force was detected heading this way from the Barents Sea. They're not infringing any law while they stay in international airspace, but they cannot be ignored. However, until now the false battle has been consigned skies. The Admiral Kuznetsov was the first Russian vessel to get so close to British shores for 20 years. British military aircraft are on standby 24 hours a day and can be scrambled in minutes to respond to threats. 'Have the appropriate authorities been informed? What was disposed of? Why was it not done properly?' In a series of parliamentary questions Mr Robertson is asking the UK Government about the incident. He . wrote: 'Will the Ministry of Defence confirm that Russian personnel . aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov have been observed disposing of waste into . the sea off the Scottish coast?' 'Was the UK National Maritime Intelligence Centre informed about the waste disposal? 'Has the Scottish Government and Marine Scotland been informed about the incident by National Maritime Intelligence Centre?' A Royal Navy spokesman added that Russia was 'almost certainly' acting in accordance with international rules. He said: 'Russia is signed up to the International Maritime Organisation's maritime pollution rules, of which they are very strict followers. If they are doing it, it's almost certainly in accordance with the regulations and is most likely going to be low-level food waste.' Although . aircraft carriers have not got so close to British waters for 20 years, . jets have been scrambled to intercept Russian planes. RAF Tornadoes have been sent up 20 times in 2009 alone after the foreign aircraft got close to British airspace.

Beautiful spring day: Student Chloe Kirkpatrick, 20, enjoys the warm weather in the Isabella Plantation in Richmond Park . Lunch outside: City workers relax in the sunshine in London yesterday as temperatures rose to 21C. Although it was warm in the south, the weather was far more overcast in many areas . Park life: A group of people enjoy a picnic in the warm weather in Regent's Park today as temperatures hit 21.1C . Today is set to be the warmest day of what, for the South at least, has been a week of warm sunshine.  The mercury could reach up to 22C (72F) in some parts of the South, although it will remain considerably cooler in the North. But tomorrow even the hardiest of souls would struggle to sunbathe, with temperatures set to plunge to 13C (55F). And by Saturday a band of damp and mild weather will cover much of the country, making it a far chillier 11C (52F).  Although temperatures are expected to recover early next week, forecasters say the unsettled conditions will remain until after the early May bank holiday weekend, when warmer air is set to sweep in from the East. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘If you are lucky enough to get out today, then you should enjoy the warm weather, as it’s set to become much milder over the weekend. ‘People in the South and South East have been particularly spoilt in the last few days, with sunny and dry conditions, so the change in temperatures and return of showers will be noticeable. ‘But although the weekend will be a bit of a mixed bag and closer to the seasonal average, it will still be pleasant enough for many.’ Warm: Lunch time for city workers in London yesterday as they made the most of some unseasonably warm weather . There will be sunshine along with the showers, and temperatures will edge up to 14C (57F) on Sunday.

Temperatures are expected to start recovering on Monday and Tuesday, with the mercury gradually rising through the week. Meanwhile, hay fever sufferers have had some good news after experts predicted a shorter hay fever season this summer. Cold weather over recent months is thought to have delayed the release of silver birch and grass pollen. Beverley Adams-Groom, pollen . forecaster at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit, said: . 'The most important tree pollen type is silver birch which triggers hay . fever in approximately 25 per cent of sufferers. 'The cold weather of the last few . months will delay the release of birch pollen which, in an average year, . starts to be emitted from around the beginning of April in the south of . the country. This year it could be at least two weeks later.' Ms Adams-Groom added: 'Grass pollen affects around 95 per cent of hay fever sufferers in the UK.

"Andy Parthum spends his workday 60 feet below ground awaiting the order he hopes never arrives: to launch the most powerful weapon ever devised by man. He is a nuclear 'missileer' - an airman who does his duty not in the air but in a hole in the ground. On both counts - the possibility of firing weapons that could kill millions, and the subterranean confinement - a missileer lives with pressures few others know. It's not active combat, although the Air Force calls them combat crew members. 2nd Lt. Oliver Parsons, left, and 1st Lt. Andy Parthum check systems in the underground control room where they work a 24-hour shift at an ICBM launch control facility near Minot, N.D. The crew is responsible for controlling and launching the 10 nuclear-tipped Minuteman 3 missiles located in remote launch sites under their command . An inert Minuteman 3 missile is seen in a training launch tube at Minot Air Force Base . Yet no one can exclude the possibility, remote as it may be, that one day a president will deliver the gut-wrenching order that would compel a missileer to unleash nuclear hell. 'Absolutely, it weighs on your mind,' Parthum, 25, said on a recent afternoon at Juliet-01, a Minuteman 3 missile launch site near Minot Air Force Base, whose 91st Missile Wing controls 150 of the nation's 450 Minuteman missiles. It may come as a surprise to some that the Air Force still operates intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. A fleet of seven of the aging helicopters are used to support the 150 Minuteman missiles carrying nuclear warheads which are deployed in the countryside surrounding Minot Air Force Base . The work can be tedious, but the men must remain on high alert deep in their compound in the unlikely event of an order . And therein lies part of the problem for missileers, who feel underappreciated in a military that has long since shifted its main focus to fighting small wars, striking with unmanned drones and countering terrorism and cyberattacks. Parthum, however, says he takes pride in his role. 'It's sobering. It's not something that's taken lightly by anybody,' Parthum said as he and his crewmate, 23-year-old 2nd Lt. Oliver Parsons, showed visitors around the small launch control center where they were several hours into a 24-hour watch over a group of 10 missiles. It's a sometimes tedious duty the Air Force calls 'standing alert.' Some say their biggest challenge is staying alert. Lt. Andy Parthum waits for his co-worker 2nd Lt. Oliver Parsons, left, to check identities of visitors before entering the underground control room where they work a 24-hour shift . Missileers, typically 22- to 27-year-old lieutenants and captains, work in pairs, with a relief crew arriving every 24 hours. A missileer generally does two 'alerts' a week. It was Parthum's 118th. (He keeps track.) It's not hard to see why some missileers find it hard to adjust to life there. An 8-ton blast door seals their launch control center from a potential incoming nuclear detonation. Twice last year, launch officers were disciplined after admitting they left the blast door open while a crewmate was asleep - a security violation. That and other lapses in discipline, training and leadership were documented by The Associated Press over the past year, prompting Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to declare that 'something is wrong.' The ICBM launch control center is actually two separate structures. An outer protective shell is made of reinforced concrete lined with a steel plate. A smaller, box-like enclosure where the missileers work, eat and sleep is suspended inside the protective shell by pneumatic cylinders called ""shock isolators"" attached to the shell's ceiling by heavy chains; the isolators are designed to keep the space stable in the event of a nuclear blast. The launch center is accessible only from an above-ground building that resembles a small ranch-style home . These underground command posts have . changed relatively little since they were built in the early 1960s, . although the Air Force recently committed to refurbishing them to make a . missileer's life a bit easier. Juliet-01, the command post an AP reporting team was permitted to visit, had just been repainted and spruced up to remove corrosion caused by water intrusion, giving it what one officer called ""that new car smell."" The launch center is accessible only from an above-ground building that resembles a small ranch-style home. An access shaft descends from a vestibule inside the building, which is controlled by a security team and surrounded by alarms and a chain-link fence. The U.S. has never fired an ICBM, other than for flight testing. Their stated purpose is to help deter nuclear war by convincing a potential attacker that it would have more to lose than to gain. The possibility, remote as it may be, that one day a president will deliver the gut-wrenching order that would compel a missileer to unleash nuclear hell 'weighs' on the men's minds . ICBM duty is far removed from the glamour, guts and glory associated with the Air Force. It not only falls short of the image of a fighter or bomber pilot streaking across enemy skies, it requires sitting, unseen and largely unappreciated, in a stuffy capsule to baby-sit missiles. Upward of two-thirds of missileers were 'volunteered' for the job after gaining their officer commission. Once they complete basic ICBM training, they are sent on four-year tours to one of three missile bases: Minot, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, or F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. The responsibility is enormous, the cost of mistakes potentially colossal, ranging from environmental damage to inadvertently triggering a nuclear war. Over time, with the passing of the Cold War, the Air Force lost focus on its nuclear mission. It also lost a good deal of what remained of the allure of serving as a missileer. 2nd Lt. Oliver Parsons, left, and 1st Lt. Andy Parthum go through a checklist in the underground control room . 'Even during the Cold War while facing down the Soviets, it could be difficult to convince bright young airmen that what they were doing was worthwhile,' Robert W. Stanley II wrote in a research paper in 2011 before becoming vice commander of the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom. Last year he was promoted to commander there but resigned in March 2014 amid a scandal over exam cheating among his missileers. In his paper, 'Reviving a Culture of Disciplined Compliance in Air Force Nuclear Operations,' Stanley called for missileer incentive pay. The Air Force is heeding that advice. Starting in October, it will offer entry bonuses to newly trained missileers, as well as 'duty pay' for security forces, missileers and others who operate in the missile fields.","Missileers, typically 22- to 27-year-old lieutenants and captains, work in pairs tending man's most destructive weapons in bases far below ground .

"Parents who give their children small amounts of alcohol in the belief they are instilling a sensible attitude to drinking may unwittingly be giving them a taste for booze, a psychologist has warned. Aric Sigman said adults needed to realise that alcohol was more damaging to the young brain and body. Studies showed the earlier a child was introduced to drink, the greater their odds of becoming an alcoholic, he added. Many parents believe introducing a small amount of alcohol at mealtimes teaches responsible drinking, but leading psychologist Dr Aric Sigman says that it can do quite the opposite . In a report to an EU think-tank on . childhood and adolescence, Dr Sigman said it was  ‘imperative’ that . parents delayed the age at which they introduce their children to . alcohol. He said that ‘even in small amounts’, . alcohol may have long-lasting effects on the young brain, which . continues developing long after the body matures. Under current rules, it is illegal for under-18s to buy alcohol or for someone to buy it for them, with the exception that 16 and 17-year-olds can drink beer, wine or cider with a meal out with an adult. Dr Sigman, a fellow of the Royal . Society of Medicine, said parents were wrong if they believe that by . giving their children small amounts of alcohol at home, they were . teaching them to drink responsibly. In fact, research suggests that . early exposure to alcohol primes the brain to enjoy it more. Dr Sigman’s review of medical . literature also raised concerns that girls who drink may be raising . their odds of infertility and breast cancer in later life. The new EU commissioned study has said that drinking even small quantities of alcohol in youth can have far-reaching consequences . He said that in an ideal world, no . one would touch alcohol before the age of 25. However, he acknowledged . that 16 was a more realistic age for parents to first allow their . children to drink at home. For instance, a US government-funded study found that that those who had their first drink before the age of 18 ran a ‘far greater’ risk of becoming dependent on alcohol as adults. And the World Health Organisation has stated: ‘The longer the onset of consumption is delayed, the less likely it is that alcohol-related problems and alcohol dependence will emerge in adult life.’ Official advice in Britain is similar – but few parents realise, says Dr Sigman. Others may fear that stopping youngsters from drinking at home risks will simply increase alcohol’s appeal. He also uses his report to call for the legal drinking age, at which youngsters can buy alcohol in pubs and shops, to be harmonised at 18 across Europe. Dr Sigman, who has previously called for TV to be banned for toddlers, concludes: ‘Adults need to be fully aware that their favourite substance may have new-found consequences when young people consume it. ‘Protecting our young people from the harm of drinking means that now, in the light of new information about the effects of alcohol, it is necessary to review the way the entire EU views concepts of adulthood and drinking age.’ Experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics. Rather they are apparently normal people who are unwittingly drinking too much. Eric Appleby, of charity Alcohol Concern said: ‘It may feel that introducing children to alcohol in a safe and controlled environment at home is the right thing to do, but all the research indicates that the younger someone starts drinking, the more likely they are to have problems with alcohol in later life. ‘The Chief Medical Officer advises that an alcohol free childhood is the safest option and that those under 15 year olds, ideally, should not drink at all.’ Dr Sigman’s warnings come amid concerns about soaring rates of liver disease. Recent figures show that alcohol-related liver damage is becoming increasingly common in the under-30s, with the number of hospital admissions in this age group more than doubling between 2002 and 2012. Across all age groups, an extra 1,000 people with alcohol-related liver damage are being admitted to hospitals in England each year. Experts say few of these would be regarded by other members of the public as alcoholics. Rather they are apparently ordinary people who are unwittingly drinking too much. This includes middle-aged, middle-class women who enjoy a bottle of wine a day, or successful businessmen who have working lunches.","Many parents believe small quantities of alcohol teaches responsible drinking .

"The nuclear missiles hidden in plain view across the prairies of northwest North Dakota reveal one reason why trouble keeps finding the nuclear Air Force. The 'Big Sticks,' as some call the 60-foot (18-meter)-tall Minuteman 3 missiles, are just plain old. The Air Force asserts with pride that the missile system, more than 40 years old and designed during the Cold War to counter the now-defunct Soviet Union, is safe and secure. None has ever been used in combat or launched accidentally. But it also admits to fraying at the edges: time-worn command posts, corroded launch silos, failing support equipment and an emergency-response helicopter fleet so antiquated that a replacement was deemed 'critical' years ago. Scroll down for video . In plain view: An ICBM launch site located among fields in the countryside outside Minot, North Dakota. on the Minot Air Force Base . The Minuteman is no ordinary weapon. The business end of the missile can deliver mass destruction across the globe as quickly as you could have a pizza delivered to your doorstep. But even as the Minuteman has been updated over the years and remains ready for launch on short notice, the items that support it have grown old. That partly explains why missile corps morale has sagged and discipline has sometimes faltered, as revealed in a series of Associated Press reports documenting leadership, training, disciplinary and other problems in the ICBM force that has prompted worry at the highest levels of the Pentagon. Analysis: Master Sgt. Tad Wagner (left)  looks over an inert Minuteman 3 missile (left and right) in a training launch tube at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota . Deterrent: The Minuteman can deliver mass destruction across the globe . The airmen who operate, maintain and guard the Minuteman force at bases in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming came to recognize a gap between the Air Force's claim that the nuclear mission is 'Job 1' and its willingness to invest in it. 'One of the reasons for the low morale is that the nuclear forces feel unimportant, and they are often treated as such, very openly,' says Michelle Spencer, a defense consultant in Alabama who led a nuclear forces study for the Air Force published in 2012. She said in an interview that the airmen - they're called Missileers - became disillusioned by an obvious but unacknowledged lack of interest in nuclear priorities among the most senior Air Force leaders. Spencer's study found that Air Force leaders were 'cynical about the nuclear mission, its future and its true - versus publicly stated - priority to the Air Force.' Several key leadership posts have since changed hands, and while Spencer says she sees important improvements, she's worried about the Air Force's commitment to getting the nuclear forces what they need. This is no surprise to those responsible for nuclear weapons policy. An independent advisory group, in a report to the Pentagon last year, minced no words. It said the Air Force must show a 'believable commitment' to modernizing the force. 'If the practice continues to be to demand that the troops compensate for manpower and skill shortfalls, operate in inferior facilities and perform with failing support equipment, there is high risk of failure' to meet the demands of the mission, it said. Robert Goldich, a former defense analyst at the Congressional Research Service, said the ICBM force for years got 'the short end of the stick' on personnel and resources. 'I honestly don't think it's much more complicated than that,' he said. 'When that happened, people lost sight of how incredibly rigorous you've got to be to ensure quality control when nuclear weapons are involved.' That may be changing. Air Force leaders are making a fresh push to fix things. When Deborah Lee James became Air Force secretary, its top civilian official, in December, she quickly made her way to each of the three ICBM bases and came away with a conviction that rhetoric was not matched by resources. Safety measures: Lt. Phil Parentrau opening the blast door leading to the underground control room at  an ICBM launch control facility on the Minot Air Force Base . 'One thing I discovered is we didn't always put our money where our mouth is when it comes to saying this is the No. 1 mission,' James told reporters June 30 during a return visit to F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. James says the fixes will require money - and a lot more. They will take more people and a major attitude adjustment. 'I happen to think the top thing that really drives an airman is feeling like they're making a difference ... protecting America,' she said earlier in June. Missileers ought to feel that way, she said, but she is not convinced they do. 'And so, over time, we've got to change that around.' James said the Air Force will find $50 million in this year's budget to make urgent fixes, and will invest an additional $350 million in improvements over the coming five years. Even that, she said, is unlikely to be enough and more funds will be sought. Old: A Vietnam-era Huey helicopter taking off at Minot Air Force Base on June 25, the aircraft being one in a fleet of seven  aging helicopters used to support the 150 Minuteman missiles carrying nuclear warheads . Her words are resonating with some, including Maj. Steve Gorman, a maintenance operations squadron commander at Minot. He already is seeing signs of change. He points to a recent decision to add 13 new maintenance positions here. 'That's a huge thing for us,' Gorman said. Since its initial deployment in 1970, the Minuteman 3 missile itself has been upgraded in all its main components. But much of the rest of the system that keeps the weapon viable and secure has fallen on hard times. One example is the Huey helicopter fleet, which escorts road convoys that move Minuteman missiles, warheads and other key components.

The seven Hueys flown daily at Minot were built in 1969. The yearly cost of keeping them running has more than doubled over the past four years, according to Air Force statistics - from $12.9 million in 2010 to $27.8 million last year. 'Obviously we need a new helicopter, based on the mission,' said Maj. Gen. Jack Weinstein, who as commander of 20th Air Force is responsible for the operation, maintenance and security of the full fleet of Minuteman missiles. That's what the Air Force has been saying since at least 2006. A 2008 Air Force study cited a 'critical need' to replace the Hueys 'to mitigate missile field security vulnerabilities' and said this need had been identified two years earlier.

In an Associated Press interview June 25 while visiting Minot, Weinstein said he was trying to persuade his superiors to buy a new fleet of more capable helicopters, but he said it was unclear whether that would happen before 2020. Weinstein is more optimistic about other opportunities to fix his missile corps. He is implementing a 'force improvement program' that was developed from hundreds of recommendations by rank-and-file ICBM force members. It is intended to begin erasing the perception that the nuclear mission is not a top priority, and to give the nuclear missile corps more people, money, equipment, training, educational opportunities and financial incentives. Lt. Col. Brian Young, deputy commander of the 91st Maintenance Group at Minot, said he senses a turning point as top brass reach out to enlisted airmen and non-commissioned officers to solicit ideas about how to fix the force. 'This feels completely different than any initiative I've been associated with in my 22 years' in the Air Force, he said.","The Air Force asserts with pride that the missile system is safe and secure .
It also admits to time-worn command posts and corroded launch silos .

"Once, he was the epitome of decadence. A mischievous charmer  I last saw resplendent in a maroon crushed- velvet smoking jacket and Gucci slippers. Now, the self-styled ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport sits on the ‘wrong’ side of the table in a prison visiting hall, a uniformed guard behind him. Davenport’s perma-tan has faded to a pallid grey. His hair and figure are thinner, the dancing blue eyes are now rheumy and bloodshot. The socialite charm has been replaced by wariness – his gaze darts around the room  to point out murderers, armed robbers and rapists. His only thought is to survive one of Britain’s toughest jails unscathed. 'Fast Eddie': Edward Davenport pictured with his Thai girlfriend Monthira Sanan-Ua . The man who was one of London’s most colourful men-about-town is now known simply as Wandsworth prisoner number AA6697AB. Twelve months into an eight-year sentence for his part in a multi-million-pound fraud, 46-year-old Davenport says he deeply regrets causing so much pain to his mother and his girlfriend. But there appears to be little remorse for those who lost their homes and livelihoods. In an exclusive interview inside the prison, Davenport accepts what he did was wrong but tells me he is planning an appeal against his conviction – and claims he is  a poor businessman rather than a crook. Those he stole from might think of him less charitably. ‘Yes, I did receive £773,000 as the courts say and I accept what  I did was wrong,’ he says. ‘But it  is such a waste of time and public money for me to be in here. It would have been far more beneficial for all concerned if I had been made to repay the money.’ For two decades, Davenport – the ‘Lord’ refers to a manorial title he bought – was a central  figure in London’s most hedonistic circles. In the late Eighties,  his black-tie ‘Gatecrasher Balls’ became notorious for the drunken debauchery of public school- educated teens before they were brought to an abrupt end when he was convicted of tax fraud. Undeterred by spending nine days in Brixton Prison before his sentence was suspended, Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in Portland Place in 1999 for £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war. Today, it is said to be worth £30 million. Davenport bought the Sierra Leone High Commission in 1999 for £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war . The magnificent historic house is familiar to millions as the set of the Oscar-winning film The King’s Speech. Davenport’s parties there proved hugely successful. The most notorious events were sex parties where Viagra and  condoms were freely available. He admits he regularly participated in orgies. ‘Fast Eddie’ was soon a fixture in . gossip columns, with homes in London and Monaco, a wardrobe full of . Savile Row suits, a fleet of exotic cars, and a host of celebrity . acquaintances. But his . glamorous lifestyle disintegrated when he was accused of fleecing . businessmen crippled by the credit crunch. Davenport and his . co-defendants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen, were last year convicted . of advance-fee fraud at Southwark Crown Court. The . men formed a company, Gresham Ltd (whose name bore a remarkable . resemblance to an unconnected City firm of 50 years standing) and . offered loans to companies desperate for finance. More . than 100 clients were asked to pay non-returnable ‘due diligence fees’ for loans that never materialised. Altogether, Gresham Ltd charged fees . of more than £4  million – of which Davenport personally received . £773,000. The judge . claimed Davenport was the ‘ringmaster’ who was  careful not to leave . ‘footprints in the snow’. Davenport, meanwhile, continues to stretch . credulity by claiming he was a dupe who was unaware of the bigger deals . his partners were negotiating abroad. ‘I’m . keeping my head down pending my appeal,’ he said. ‘Prison can be a . dangerous place. I want to just get on with it, though having been . institutionalised in boarding school helps.’ He has witnessed a fellow prisoner running around naked covered in blue paint, and another attempting suicide by slashing his wrists. He says: ‘I was thrown in the deep end from the start when I had to share a cell with a heroin addict. He managed to get hold of drugs in prison and he kept trying to pick a fight with me.’ His cellmate’s possession of drugs cost him his prison privileges. Davenport says: ‘I had to give back my laptop. But the worst thing was that when my mother came to visit, I had to talk with her from behind glass. I could see she was upset.’ He smiles admiringly as he recalls the way Jean, 78, coped with the indignity of a body search. ‘She shouted, “Do you really think  a woman like me is smuggling drugs in here?” ’ Another regular visitor is Davenport’s Thai girlfriend of eight years, nightclub promoter Monthira Sanan-Ua, 28. ‘He is putting a brave face on it,’ she says. ‘Sometimes he gets a bit jealous because he knows I’m having a good time outside. Whether we get married,  I don’t know. Like Eddie, I take each day as it comes. Nothing has changed the way I feel about him.’ Jail time: Davenport has swapped his Portland Place mansion for the confines of Wandsworth Prison . As a low-risk, category-C prisoner, Davenport is able to wear  his own clothes – a Sloaney ensemble of William Hunt shirt, True  Religion jeans and Gucci loafers – under prison outerwear, today a luminous overall. And his good behaviour means he now has his own cell with a television (his favourite shows are Made In Chelsea and the new Dallas), a lavatory and a supply of tinned groceries. ‘One thing about being in here is that I’ve realised how lucky I am,’ he says. ‘I was loved and well brought-up.’ 'I was thrown in at the deep end from the start when I had to share a cell with a heroin addict' However, the root of his craving for company and attention may stem from his comfortable upbringing in West London. An only child, Davenport’s late father, Ormus, was a restaurateur who ran a fashionable Chelsea bistro in the Seventies. ‘I was left to my own devices a lot as my parents always seemed to be working.’ He was sent to fee-paying Frensham Heights School in Surrey, chosen because it had a lively drama department. ‘My dream then was to be an actor, but I realised I wasn’t any good. I under-achieved because I was dyslexic. Maybe that’s why I always want to prove myself.’ He left school with a single O-level in law. He knew from his experience as a boarder that privately educated teenagers were desperate to meet the opposite sex. His riotous Gatecrasher Balls became an overnight sensation, making him a millionaire before the taxman caught up with him. Yet by far Davenport’s biggest coup was  buying the 24-bedroom Portland Place property, complete with billiard room, ballroom and Jacuzzi. He put the house to lucrative work as a set for fashion and film shoots and, unrelated to his sex parties, it was the venue for glitzy events attended by Kate Moss, Mick Jagger and Paris Hilton. Lucrative: Davenport's riotous Gatecrasher Balls became an overnight sensation and made him a millionaire . Davenport has never been able to resist a get-rich-quick scheme, a weakness that has twice put  him behind bars. ‘I can assure  you that being locked up is no holiday camp, it’s hell,’ he says. ‘The prison is often short-staffed, which means we can be banged up in our cells for long stretches.’ He is studying information technology and Buddhism. ‘I like to think it makes me a better person. When I get out of here, I will be a more responsible businessman. ‘I haven’t given up yet. I am banned from being a company director for ten years, but I will start all over again somehow, probably by organising parties. ‘I miss the fun. Not being able to be with a woman is also hard – all the guys feel it. They all want to know about the orgies. They were classy and sensual, with masks, candles, velvet cushions. Outside, . I mixed with everybody from Hugh Grant to Prince Albert of Monaco, in here I’m just one of the lads.’Davenport’s next challenge is his appeal next month. ‘I am mentally prepared to pay up,’ he says. ‘My appeal gives me hope that there may be light at the end of the tunnel. That and the dream that one day I will be back in Portland Place having fabulous parties.’","Self-styled 'Lord' Edward Davenport is 12 months into an eight year sentence for his part in a multi-million-pound fraud .

"Designer vaginas are ruining our idea of what real vaginas look like, researchers have warned . Women are getting increasingly distorted ideas of what their genitalia should look like, with many wrongly thinking their bodies are 'abnormal'. New research has found that those who looked at 'designer vaginas' were more more likely to consider them 'normal' and 'ideal' when . later comparing them to unaltered genitalia. Airbrushing and waxing are two of the main reasons why women are becoming unhappy with their appearance, the researchers say. Many also don't realise how much appearances can vary, they add. The . number of labiaplasties performed by the NHS has . risen five-fold since 2001, according to the study's Australian authors. The surgery involves reducing the size of a woman's . labia minora to make them more symmetrical and smaller than the labia majora. 'The rise in genital cosmetic surgery for women is a very . worrying trend,' the study's lead author, Claire Moran, from the University of Queensland said. 'There seems to be massive misconceptions around . perceptions of normal genital appearance and I wanted to explore this . further.' Generally, . there are no health reasons to have the surgery - it is only for the sake . of appearance. So the researchers wanted to know what drives women's . perceptions of what looks good. Ms Moran added: 'There . are misconceptions around normal genital appearance. 'This is due to . airbrushing, lack of exposure to normal women's genitals, greater . genital visibility due to Brazilian and genital waxing and the general . taboo around discussing genitals and genital appearance.' The results of the new study were published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology. Ninety-seven . Australian women ages 18 to 30 years old were divided into three . groups. In the initial stage of the study, one group was shown . almost three dozen images of modified female genitalia; another group . was shown images of unmodified genitalia. A third group was not shown . any images. Next, all . three groups were shown a mix of images of modified and unmodified . genitals and asked to rate them for the degree to which the vulva 'looks . normal' and 'represents society's ideal.' Researchers found that women who looked at 'designer vaginas' were more more likely to consider them 'normal' and 'ideal' when comparing them to unaltered genitalia . All three groups rated the images of the 'designer vaginas' as more like society's ideal than those which hadn't undergone surgery. Women . who had viewed the images of the modified genitalia first also rated the modified vulvas as more . 'normal' than the unmodified genitals. But women who had seen the photos . of unmodified genitalia first tended to rate them as normal in the . second stage.The researchers suggest that young women may not realize that normal genitalia vary considerably in appearance. 'The . reality is that when it comes to women's genitals, as with other body . parts, diversity is what is normal. The results demonstrate that . exposure to one kind of image impacts women's perceptions of normal,' Ms Moran added. Vanessa Schick, co-author of 'Read My Lips: A Complete Guide to the Vulva and Vagina', told Reuters Health: 'It's important to understand whether women are seeking elective genital . surgeries because they want their vulvas to appear ""normal"" or because . they want them to be consistent with an ""ideal"". Airbrushing and waxing are two of the main reasons why women are becoming unhappy with their appearance, the researchers say . 'If they want to change . their labia color, shape or size because they find them to be abnormal, . concerns about potential variation may be addressed by showing women a . variety of genital images,' she added. 'There . a number of books, websites, posters and projects devoted to helping . women ""normalise"" their genital appearance. If women are electing to . have surgery in order to match a genital ideal, it may be more difficult . to counter those women's concerns. Sarah Calabrese, a clinical psychologist at Yale University, added: '[These findings are] especially disconcerting given that for many women, the narrow and . unrealistic range of vulvas presented in mainstream U.S. pornography may . be the only images that they see,' she said. 'The . vulva is unlike most other body parts, which remain visible even when . clothed; while a woman can look around and see the size and shape of . other women's waists, breasts, and so on, they don't have the same . opportunity to view other women's vulvas and therefore are less likely . to have a realistic sense of the natural diversity of vulvas in the . female population.' Labiaplasty involves reconstructing the shape and size of the inner labia - and it's now the third most popular procedure in the UK, according to surgery search engine Whatclinic.com . The company has recorded a 109 per cent rise in enquiries about labiaplasty surgery over the last 12 months. Paul Banwell, a BAAPS spokesperson and surgeon at his practice Banwell Clinic in East Grinstead, said: ''About half of the patients I see in my practice want the operation for . function, due to discomfort and problems with exercise, cycling and . riding. The other 50 per cent want it purely for aesthetic reasons and . to boost their self-confidence.' He added: 'I think these statistics reflect general trends in cosmetic surgery. In particular, they reflect a trend in my own practice. I have seen an even higher increase - one of more than 200 per cent in last 12 months. 'In terms of ethics, people have to realise there is a rise and it's difficult to determine why. I don't think it has anything to do with the glamour industry.'","Women who looked at 'designer vaginas' were more more likely to consider them 'normal' and 'ideal' when .

"The auction of an alleged sex-tape starring Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert, will not go ahead. The tape was supposedly seized by police in Tulare County, California after its owner, a former Hollywood bodyguard-turned-memorabilia collector defaulted on a debt to the courts. However, the auction, which was due to take place today, has been cancelled after owner William Castleberry settled the $200,000 debt, Tulare County Sheriff's Department said. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Marilyn Monroe stands between Robert Kennedy (left) and John F. Kennedy at a May 19, 1962, house party just hours after she infamously sang 'Happy Birthday' to the president . Mr . Castleberrry owed $200,000 for a previous court judgement against him, . however someone covered his costs after the auction was announced, his attorneys told TMZ. The . gossip site reported that Mr Castleberry’s representatives do not know . who paid the debt for him, but that his belongings, which include the . 8mm home movie, will be returned to him. Last week, Mr Castleberry claimed to RadarOnline . the 8 mm film shows Monroe and the Kennedy brothers engaging in . intercourse, but says it was not made public out of respect for Marilyn Monroe's former husband, baseball player Joe DiMaggio. 'It’s real. I had it for years and I never released it out of respect for Joe DiMaggio… I’m just sick about it and I’m desperately trying to raise money to get it back,’ he told the site. Castleberry, 56, said he lost the tape after lawyers demanded a $90,000 balloon payment while he was paying off a $200,000 judgement for selling a fake statue. Secret recording: The owner says he never published the contents of the tape out of respect for Monroe's ex-husband . Robert F. Kennedy, left, and President John F. Kennedy, pictured with brother Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in 1962, are both said to appear on the 8mm film with Monroe .

Attorney . Ryan Sullivan added that he heard of the tape’s existence and even . personally found an 8 mm canister while Castleberry’s house was . ransacked by repo men. ‘I . was able to locate a 8 mm film in a canister at the house, which was . turned over to [authorities],’ said the lawyer, who is representing the . plaintiffs ripped off by the phony statue. Sullivan noted that he has not viewed the tape and cannot verify its contents. ‘I . have no idea what is on the tape, it could be what Mr. Castleberry . says, or it could be a Disney cartoon,’ said Sullivan. ‘The only way . anyone will ever know is if they buy it and view it.’ Castleberry’s valuables was supposed to be auctioned off with a minimum bid of $200,000 for the whole collection, in order to cover his debt.

"William is following in the trail blazing footsteps of his father when it comes to the birth of his first child.

Fear: Passenger video shows the panic on board the ferry from Cape Cod after it was hit with a wave  that disabled the engines . From above: Water was streaming in from the roof when this passenger video was taken . Passengers say the ocean was not unusually choppy Wednesday afternoon, when a green sheet of water hit the boat - causing the most damage on the captain's level, 20 feet above water. The ferry was nearing Boston, and just north of Scituate, around 4pm when the incident happened, . 'People started getting life vests on, and people were crying and throwing up,' Ariel Shrum, 22, told NECN. The wave broke seven windows on the Providence IV ferry, operated by the Bay State Cruise Company, and even caused the boat's control systems to go off line. Seven windows on the vessel were also broken by the wave and the captain sustained a minor injury to his hand . The ferry pictured above, back in Boston Wednesday evening . 'When the wave broke the windows, the vessel's control systems went off line for a period of time. The captain was able to bring the starboard engine up to speed but not the port engine,' the Bay State Cruise company said in a statement. The ferry contacted the Coast Guard which sent out two vessels to aid the stranded ferry. While the passengers waited for Coast Guard to arrive, Shrum, a Berklee College of Music student, soothed tensions by playing his trumpet. (He also plays in a band called The Interlopers.)

"A sex shop entrepreneur is raking in a fortune by turning out of business Little Chefs into sex shops. Sex shop boss Graham Kidd has now turned his fourth  roadside cafe into a couple-friendly sex superstore, in South Cave, East Yorkshire. Managing director of Pulse and Cocktails Graham Kidd said: 'The remote location is perfect for us.' Sex shop boss Graham Kidd has now turned his fourth Little Chef restaurant into a couple-friendly sex superstore, in South Cave, East Yorkshire . 'Our sexy superstores are all about creating a fun, safe, couple-friendly environment. 'Recently, we have found a bit of niche by redeveloping redundant roadside diners. 'This will be our fourth Little Chef conversion.' The firm already operates at two former Little Chefs in Lincolnshire and is currently converting a third on the A1 near Wakefield. Only two official objections were submitted to the council's licensing subcommittee over the application by the company. Neither objector agreed to be named but both claimed the location on the main western approach road to Hull was not a suitable location for a sex shop. One also objected on moral grounds. But councillors were told rules surrounding sex shop licence applications prevented moral grounds being put forward as a reason for refusal. The former Little Chef premises at Beacon Service Area on A63 westbound between South Cave and Newport, with a remote location which is 'perfect for the stores' according to Mr Kidd .

Mr Kidd admitted he was aware there had . been some criticism of the location but believed there will be no . repercussions once locals realised the benefits. There were no objections from either Humberside Police or any nearby parish councils against the application . Mr Kidd said: 'We already have a very large store at Mount Pleasant in Hull, which has been successfully trading for eight years without receiving any complaints. 'The people of Hull seem very happy with what we offer there, even though it's only 100 yards away from an Asda supermarket and a busy retail park. 'This is a very different location but we have found our new roadside locations trade very well.' Mr Kidd said the new store would include CCTV coverage both inside and out for security purposes. He told the committee the shop would also operate a strict admission policy, with no one under 18 being allowed in. In addition, he said staff would also ask anyone who looked under 25 to produce proof of their age. The new store is expected to create five full-time jobs. Graham said refurbishment work at the site would also create employment opportunities for local firms.

Frank Cramp, 94, handed the prized headgear back along with the rest of his kit when he left the armed forces in 1954. The ex-corporal only discovered afterwards he was allowed to keep it and spent six decades regretting his mistake. A proud Mr Cramp puts on his second green beret, (left) the 94-year-old veteran had been given his first beret as a Royal Marine in WWII (right) but had given it back along with the rest of his kit when he left the armed forces in 1954. But when Navy chiefs heard about his plight they decided to reward brave OAP Frank with a replacement green beret - the official headdress of the British Commandos of WWII and still worn by Royal Marines today. Londoner Frank emigrated to Edmonton, Canada, in 1957 but travelled to France for a tour of the Normandy beaches. The former commando landed ashore there on Sword Beach in 1944 with pals from 45 Commando - but he soon found himself alone when his landing craft had to retreat, along with all his comrades. Undeterred, he went on a one-man surprise mission to take out a German machine gun sentry and managed to take out the enemy with barely a scratch. Lt Col Richard Cantrill, 42 Commanding Officer, re-presents Mr Cramp with the famous headdress at the Dewerstone beauty spot on Dartmoor where current Royal Marines receive their first green beret on completion of training . When Frank decided to mark the 70th anniversary of the landings his daughters and the Royal Marines Association arranged for him link up with 42 Commando at Bickleigh Barracks in Devon - where Frank was once an instructor. Navy brass then whisked him to Dewerstone, a remote beautyspot in Dartmoor in Devon, where Royal Marines are awarded their green berets after finishing training at nearby Lympstone Commando Training Centre. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cantrill, commanding officer of 42 Commando, said it was a pleasure to give the hero his prized hat back. He said: “It was a great pleasure for me to host Frank. Hearing his extraordinary recollections of his landing on Sword Beach, and beyond, was fascinating and served as a reminder as to why commando forces were first raised, and how they were employed.

"Humans have long been obsessed with the idea of machines being able to self-replicate and a number of experts believe they will play an important part in shaping how Earth is in the future. One artificial intelligence engineer believes that robots could have sex with each other to . evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be . closer than we might imagine. Another cybernetics expert told . MailOnline that mating robots could exist in just 20 to 30 years while . another robotics authority suggested that machines could print off their . offspring, a little like how a 3D printer works today. AIrtificial intelligence expert George Zarkadakis believes robots could have sex with each other to evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be closer than we might imagine. He predicts that humans could even breed with machines to create new hybrid species (illustrated) Opinions differ as to how robots could breed and reproduce in the future. Mr Zarkadakis said robots that are both silicon and carbon based, could have sex at a molecular level to produce offspring - although how this could happen is unclear. Professor Noel Sharkey said that there might not be any need to look at molecules as robots can be 'bred' by swapping software so that the code used to make robots perform certain tasks particularly well, can be combined to create a 'child'. He believes that robots of the future will be able to print their offspring, a little like a 3D printer, but could assemble them too. Mr Zarkadis said if robots could have sex, it would defend them from computer viruses and  make them more robust. Professor Warwick said breeding with each other could mean robots could evolve at a fast pace, while Professor Sharkey thinks the process could take millions of years. George Zarkadakis, who is a novelist as well as an engineer, believes robots could have sex with each other to evolve and produce superior offspring and this scary new world could be closer than we might imagine. Mr Zarkadakis even predicts that humans could even breed with machines to create new hybrid species. Writing for The Telegraph, . he said: ‘Perhaps cyborgs of the future may involve human participation . in robot sexual reproduction and the creation of new, hybrid species.’ Noel Sharkey, professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at Sheffield University, however, thinks the future could be simpler and not as 'hands on'. While he believes that the future of artificial intelligence could be silicon and carbon-based, with digital brains in charge of organic molecular structures, he told MailOnline that robots would probably print off their offspring, much like a 3D printer can currently be used today. He believes the robots might not be particularly intelligent and could be 'bred' by swapping software so that the code used to create robots that are particularly good at a certain task, can be combined to produce a superior offspring, which they would print out and possibly assemble. If robots were able to mate with each other, Mr Zarkadakis believes that sex would defend them from computer viruses, just as sex between humans defends us against parasitical attacks. Mr Zarkadakis also said that sexual activity between robots would make them more robust and accelerate their evolution so that new machines could develop faster to suit life on Earth in the future. If robots were able to have sex, it could defend them from computer viruses, (illustrated) just as sex between humans defends organisms against parasitical attacks . Professor Kevin Warwick from the Institution of Engineering and Technology told MailOnline that robots are already good at producing new robots, which are often better than themselves. Machines breeding with each other - mixing genetically and technologically - could ensure that their ‘good bits’ come together. This evolution could happen much faster than with humans, as multiple machines could breed together to produce a ‘super’ offspring and there is no need to wait for their ‘children’ to grow up before they could reproduce. Professor Warwick, who works at the University of Reading, said that ‘just about anything is possible’ and that there are already robots with biological brains that mix biological and technological parts. ‘This is not science fiction,’ he said. He believes that robots capable of breeding with each other could be produced using current research and technologies but it will likely take 20 to 30 years before they could be used on Earth – and there are questions to be asked about whether this is a good idea. As to whether humans could have sex with robots, he said it is not out of the question but it is 'scary' and currently 'a sci-fi scenario'. However, he thinks that small steps will be taken in that direction. Currently a lot of people have technology inside them, so research into a human/robot hybrid could had the scope to help a lot of humans. Such research could be used to give people extra abilities and help scientists understand a lot more about the human body, such as how Alzheimer’s disease takes hold of the brain, he said. Research into creating cyborgs (illustrated) as a result of 'breeding' with robots, and creating robots that breed with each other, depends on social acceptance, Professor Warwick said. He believes that we have to face ethical issues about the use of such technology in just 20 to 30 years time . But research into creating cyborgs as a result of ‘breeding’ with robots, and creating robots that breed with each other, depends on social acceptance, Professor Warwick said. ‘Over the next 20 to 30 years the question will be on the table and we have to face ethical issues.’ ‘This technology is not just science fiction – we have to start thinking about it and the ethical and social consequences,’ he said. While research could help humans, Professor Warwick warned that if a robot can self-replicate, evolve and improve more rapidly than humans, we really could end up in a nightmare future scenario. ‘Why bother with humans then?’ he asked, adding, ‘Do we want to get to that point?’ The idea of self-replicating robots has been popular in sci-fi, from William Paley’s thoughts about machines producing other machines in 1802, to the popular Matrix films. Self-replicating machines have been around since the 1940s when mathematician John von Neumann showed how a ‘universal constructor’ machine could replicate itself. Scientists today are working on create self-replicating machines and physicist George Dyson thinks they could be used to cut and move ice from Saturn’s moon Enceladus to Mars, where it could be used as a building material.","Artificial intelligence engineer George Zarkadakis thinks robots could have sex to produce superior offspring .

"The brave Pakistani doctor who helped the CIA to capture Osama Bin Laden is still rotting inside jail two year's after the terrorist's death. Dr Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison in June last year after a Pakistani court found him guilty of treason for conspiring against Pakistan. Denied access to his family and legal team, Dr Afridi  is now on hunger strike - he stopped eating days after an April 25 court date. Jailed: Dr Shakil Afridi is now a hunger strike. He was sentenced to 33 years in prison in June 2012 after a Pakistani court found him guilty of treason for conspiring against Pakistan by helping the CIA to capture Osama Bin Laden . Dr Afridi’s next court hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed again to a date in June, according to Fox News. He helped the CIA by running a fake . vaccination programme that allowed him to collect the DNA of Bin Laden’s . children from the family compound in Abbottabad. Sample analysis confirmed the terror leader was probably there and triggered the deadly mission by US Navy SEALS in May 2011. The successful mission sparked a rift between the US and Pakistani leaders who were embarrassed that Bin Laden had been living in a major military hub close to the capital. Angry Pakistani officials felt the covert operation was a violation of its sovereignty and implied the US was unable to trust its key partner in the war on terror. Speaking out: Dr Shakil Afridi helped the CIA track down bin Laden and turned down an opportunity to leave Pakistan and . resettle overseas with his family . Shortly after the raid which killed Bin Laden, Dr Afridi was arrested for conspiring against the state of Pakistan. The physician said he has been subjected to torture and harsh questioning since his arrest days after Bin Laden’s death in May 2011 as he tried to flee Pakistan. And he also claimed that he did not know that the information he provided to the CIA had led to the assassination of the reclusive Al Qaeda leader. Afridi's brother Jamil told Fox News year that Shakil Afridi had suffered torture while in custody ahead of his sentencing and previously appealed for U.S. Embassy help to fight his legal case. Mission: The Al Qaeda leader was killed at this compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Special Forces . The compound, within which al Qaeda leader Osama . bin Laden was killed, is seen in flames after it was attacked in . Abbottabad in this still image taken from video footage from a mobile . phone May 2, 2011 . In an interview with Fox News from his Pakistan jail cell in September Dr Afridi says he has been told: ‘You helped our enemies. 'They said ""The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians.""' Dr Afridi said he tried to defend the U.S. as allies and supporters of Pakistan. He told Fox news: 'I tried to argue that America was Pakistan's biggest supporter - billions and billions of dollars in aid, social and military assistance - but all they said was, ""These are our worst enemies. You helped our enemies.""' Dr Afridi also warned that any cooperation by Pakistan is just a front for the country to collect billions of dollars in aid from the U.S. Tense: The moment President Barack Obama and his . team watched the mission to find bin Laden in the Situation Room of the . White House on May 1, 2011 . “It is now indisputable that militancy in Pakistan is supported by the ISI… Pakistan’s fight against militancy is bogus. It’s just to extract money from America.' The U.S. has insisted there is no basis to imprison Afridi on treason charges and secretary of state Hillary Clinton said in May 2012 that she regretted 'both the fact that he was convicted and the severity of his sentence'. Officials from the United States have revealed in the past that they attempted to extricate Dr Afridi from Pakistan in the weeks after the bin Laden raid. Unnamed U.S. officials said the resettlement offer for Afridi came around the time of the May 1, 2011, raid in which U.S. Navy SEAL commandos killed the al-Qaeda chief at his complex in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 'Dr. Shakil Afridi betrayed the country,' the military official told the network. 'He should have informed the Pakistani intelligence agencies instead of helping foreigners.'","Dr Shakil Afridi was sentenced to 33 years in prison .

"A Danish chat show where women silently undress as the male host and a guest critique their bodies has been branded humiliating and sexist by viewers. The women walk on in a bath robe and then stand in front of the two men who are seated on an empty set with one harsh light. Each model then removes her robe as host Thomas Blachman, who also created the concept, and his guest appraise  their figures. Scroll down for video . The degrading TV show sees women stand there in silence while two men appraise their bodies - with often humiliating comments . The women walk on in a bath robe, then undress in front Blachman and a studio guest, who critique the women . Some of the most puerile moments have included comments such as 'How's that p****' working out for you?' and 'Very animated nipples.' Blachman, who is a Danish X-Factor judge, today defended his idea insisting he was actually doing women a favour as the 'female body thirsts for the words of a man'. He also said his show - which has the eponymous title Blachman - was the work of a genius and had a higher objective of 'discussing the aesthetics of a female body without allowing the conversation to become pornographic or politically correct'. He said: 'I told them the entire idea . of the show is to let men talk about the bodies of naked women while . the woman is standing right in front of them. 'The female body thirsts for words. The words of a man. And they went for it.' He added that he wanted to 'revise women's views of men's views of women.' Blachman claims it is the work of a genius and argues it has a higher objective of 'discussing the aesthetics of a female body' 'Artistic debate' Blachman (right) and his guest look like giggling schoolboys as they critique a woman's body in the vile show . Critics rubbished his claims highlighting an example on one show in which he said: 'I've . always been an a** man. Even before Blachman aired, it received massive media attention and has been widely criticised as being both sexist and humiliating for women. Author Knud Romer said: 'The programs so-called intention of breaking down taboos or challenging stereotypes is rubbish. 'It's more like a claustrophobic strip club which only serves to cement classic concepts of male dominance. 'Basically, things like this should have been able consigned to the scrap heap of history years ago.' One of the country's top bloggers and opinion-makers, Lotte Hansen, was also scathing, describing the show as 'an unsuccessful attempt to intellectualize the Roskilde County Show – the only difference being that the young fillies on view in Roskilde have been replaced by naked women.' Hansen has started a campaign demanding DR cancel the show 'before this goes any further'. Martin Lyngbo of the Mungo Park Theater said Blachman’s show 'institutionalizes already run-of-the-mill malechauvinistic thinking.' An unrepentant Blachman, who has since retreated to his home in New York in the face of all the controversy, said: 'Ungratefulness is the only thing that can really wear down the few geniuses who reside in our country. 'Remember, I am giving you something that you have never seen before. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.' DR producer Sofia Fromberg, who defended the project, said the show must go on and does not think that the TV critics should have the final say about what is good for men and women. She added: 'We have a program that reveals what men think about the female body.  Quite honestly, what is wrong with that?' The programme is aired on public service channel DR2.","Creator Thomas Blachman claims that the female body 'thirsts for the words of a man'

"It could be one of the oldest bugs in the computer world. Microsoft today issued a patch for a major security hole in its Windows software that it admitted has been  there for 19 years. Experts at IBM spotted the bug - and found it was even present in the code for Windows 95. Bill Gates in 1995  during rehearsals for the August 24 launch of Windows '95. Researchers have found a serious security flaw in the software remained in Windows systems until this week, when the firm finally patched it. The bug, which is present in every version of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 onward, allows an attacker to remotely take over and control a computer. Typically, attackers use remote code execution to install malware, which may have any number of malicious actions, such as keylogging, screen-grabbing and remote access. IBM's cybersecurity research team discovered the bug in May, describing it as a 'significant vulnerability' in the operating system. 'The buggy code is at least 19 years old and has been remotely exploitable for the past 18 years,' IBM X-Force research team said in its blog on Tuesday. The bug, which is present in every version of Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 onward, allows an attacker to remotely take over and control a computer. 'We reported this issue with a working proof-of-concept exploit back in May 2014, and today, Microsoft is patching it,' they said. 'It can be exploited remotely since Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0. 'This complex vulnerability is a rare, 'unicorn-like' bug found in code that IE relies on but doesn't necessarily belong to it. Microsoft finally fixed the flaw this week with a security patch it urged all users to download .

"The feet have been revealed to be the least appealing part of the anatomy by neuroscientists studying the links between sex and the brain. A study conducted jointly by Bangor University and the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg found that feet were the lowest ranked of all 41 body parts in terms of sexual attractiveness, closely followed by kneecaps. The results, which debunked the commonly held theory that the feet have a sensual connection to the genitals, were published in neuroscientific journal Cortex and a number of newspapers, including the Observer. Urgh! Feet were revealed to be the least appealing body part by neuroscientists in the UK and South Africa . Other findings included a male penchant for the backs of the legs (although women were less impressed) and also the hands - another body part that left the female sex drive unmoved. Men were also revealed to have almost as many erogenous zones as women - a departure from the commonly held perception that they have just one (the genitals). 'A lot of people assume that women's bodies are just full of erogenous zones and that men only have one - the obvious one,' Professor Oliver Turnbull of Bangor University's School of Psychology told the Observer. FEMALES . A woman's mouth and lips was voted the most erotic body part with the highest rating of 7.9 out of 10. The nape of neck scored 7.5 out 10. Nipples and breasts came in joint third with a rating of 7.3. Bottoms came fourth with 4.5 out of 10. Hips scored 3.5 and feet received a rating of just one out of 10. MALES . The mouth and lips received the highest rating of seven out of 10. A man's inner thigh received a rating of 5.8 out of 10. The nape of the neck scored 5.6. Nipples received 4.8 out of 10. The lower back was rated as the fifth most erotic body part on a man with 2.8 out of 10. While the least erotic part of a man's body was the forearm with a score of one out of 10. 'But this is clearly not the case. It's pretty equal, with just perhaps a modest advantage to women - but certainly nothing like the way sex differences have been so hugely exaggerated.' According to scientists, the results, which were collated from questioning 800 people in the UK and South Africa, were also remarkably consistent and held true regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation. The most popular body part was, inevitably, the genitals, followed by lips, ears, inner thighs, and the shoulder blades. 'We . have discovered from this that we all share the same erogenous zones in . at least two very different continents, whether we are a white . middle-aged woman sitting in a London office or a gay man living in a . village in Africa,' added Professor Turnbull. Popular: Lips topped the list after genitalia while the shoulder blades were found attractive by both sexes . 'It suggests it is hardwired, built in, not based on cultural or life experiences.' Thanks to the findings, scientists now suspect that sexual response is controlled by a different part of the brain to the sense of touch. Turnbull added: The Cosmopolitan magazines of this world have been running half-baked surveys on this for years and years. 'But we wanted to look at the question of why the side of the neck is interesting if nibbled but not the forehead or the head, which both have the same sensory receptors. As a result, Turnbull thinks that the sexual response may be controlled by the insula [cortex], although he says that confirming his suspicions could be difficult. 'There are a few ethical issues in trying to take the next step and measure that, as it obviously means that someone has to be stroking someone else whilst the brain is monitored,' he added. It is highly unlikely, however, that feet will be involved in the process.","Research conducted by neuroscientists from Bangor University .

"The Government has suffered a massive defeat over plans to outlaw ‘annoying’ behaviour which could have outlawed noisy children, carol singers and nudists. Dozens of Tory and Lib Dems peers in the House of Lords struck out the plan to impose new injunctions on people accused of creating ‘nuisance and annoyance’. Critics said the legislation would have had a ‘chilling effect on lawful conduct’ and insisted the British public must show ‘tolerance and forbearance’. Nudists groups warned parks and beaches could be out of bounds for naturists under the new laws aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour . The row centres on the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill which includes power for the courts to grant an injunction against someone who ‘has engaged in, or is threatening to engage in, anti-social behaviour’. The Government wants to replace anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) with injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance (Ipnas). Under the new rule, an injunction could be granted if a person has ‘engaged in conduct which is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person’. But opponents warn people behaving perfectly legally like street preachers, trick-or-treaters, church bell ringers and clay pigeon shooters could fall foul of the law just because some people are annoyed by their hobbies. It was warned bell ringers and carol singers would be silenced under the law if someone claimed they were being annoying . Scotland Yard was warned that Gordon Brown and John Reid would be ‘annoyed’ about a man wearing a Union Jack suit outside Downing Street, the Lords was told. Lord Blair, a former Met Police chief, revealed that he was warned the Labour Chancellor and Home Secretary would be angered by a publicity stunt on Budget Day in 2007. He branded the proposed Ipnas law ‘a piece of absolutely awful legislation and we should seek to avoid it’. The independent crossbench peer said that in 2007 when Gordon Brown came out of Number 11 Downing Street to deliver a Budget there was a man standing ‘amid the cameras dressed in a full Union Jack outfit with a notice saying ""John Reid for Prime Minister"". ‘It was reported to me as commissioner that the Chancellor was likely to be annoyed,’ Lord Blair said. ‘It was reported to me in very firm terms that (Home Secretary) John Reid was going to be extremely annoyed. ‘As the commissioner I was annoyed because the Home Secretary was annoyed, but nobody used the words harassment, distress or alarm.‘The difference between the words about annoyance and how that will be interpreted on the street by housing officers, by police officers and so on is so important. ‘This isn't a matter for judges, people will be told to move on to get out of the way by people who are in authority because that is the easiest thing to do when they have got somebody complaining.’ Crossbench Lord Dear, a former chief constable of West Midlands Police, was backed by several prominent Tories and Lib Dems to strike out the phrase ‘nuisance and annoyance’ in the legislation with ‘harassment, alarm or distress’ - the same wording used for Asbos introduced by the Labour government. Peers defeated the government by 306 to 178, majority 128. Lord Dear said Ipnas could be used for anyone over the age of 10, only required proof ‘on the balance of probability’, could last for an indefinite period of time and result in a prison term if breached. He warned a power which had worked for dealing with housing issues would be inappropriate to be used in the ‘public environment’. He insisted the current wording of the legislation would result in practitioners leaving it to the courts to decide, which would cause a ‘chilling effect on lawful conduct’. He told peers: ‘It risks it being used for those who seek to protest peacefully, noisy children in the street, street preachers, canvassers, carol singers, trick-or-treaters, church bell ringers, clay pigeon shooters, nudists. ‘This is a crowded island that we live in and we must exercise a degree surely of tolerance and forbearance. ‘Because I shall continue to be privately annoyed at those who jump the bus queue, those who stand smoking in large groups outside their office, drinkers who block the footpath outside a pub on a summer's evening, those who put their feet on the seats on public transport, those who protest noisily outside Parliament or my local bank, but none of that surely should risk an injunctive procedure on the grounds of nuisance and annoyance. Baroness Mallalieu, a leading QC and Labour peer, said: ‘My main concern is the extent to which lowering the threshold to behaviour capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to any person has the potential to undermine our fundamental freedoms and in particular the way in which the proposed law might be used to curb protest and freedom of expression.’ Peers were told that under coalition plans the police, British Transport Police, the Environment Agency, local authorities, Transport for London, the health secretary and housing providers would be among the bodies able to apply to use Ipnas. Conservative Lord Mackay of Clashfern, a former Lord Chancellor, also opposed the Government, telling peers: ‘One of the fundamental freedoms is the freedom of speech and it is surely clear that in exercising that one may annoy other people, one or more.’ Former Attorney General Lord Morris of Aberavon criticised the Home Office for bringing forward ‘ill thought out’ proposals with ‘little regard for the consequences’. Home Office minister Lord Taylor earlier tried to placate opponents by offering to put forward an amendment which he said would address the ‘concerns of the breadth of the nuisance or annoyance test’. The Government amendment would have changed the wording of the legislation so that it covered behaviour ‘that could reasonably be expected to cause nuisance or annoyance’ instead of behaviour ‘capable of causing nuisance or annoyance’. He denied the Bill would create a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech. But the government was still defeated on Lord Dear’s amendment, which was backed by 25 Tory rebels and 16 Liberal Democrat rebels.","Injunctions could be imposed on anyone causing 'nuisance or annoyance'

"Foul-mouthed: Comedian Frankie Boyle has prompted complaints once more by posting a series of controversial messages on Twitter during the Paralympics opening ceremony . Outspoken comedian Frankie Boyle has again courted controversy after he joked that the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team were 'mainly thieves'. The comment - a reference to how Saudis have amputated criminals' hands as punishment for stealing - was one of several provocative messages posted on twitter by the Scottish comic during the Paralympics opening ceremony. He faced a backlash from other people who accused him of trying to undermine the sports extravaganza. Boyle has appeared frequently in programmes shown on Channel 4, the broadcaster covering the Paralympics. But his sketch show Tramadol Nights was axed by the station in January after a flood of complaints. Boyle, who has almost 1million followers on Twitter, tweeted last night: 'Apparently the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team is mainly thieves #c4paralympics'. Minutes earlier, he had written: 'Wow, Austrian Paralympians seem a lot more able-bodied than most regular Scottish people'. And turning to his attention to the Queen, who opened the Paralympics at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, he tweeted: 'The Queen hasn't cracked a smile since Diana died #c4paralympics'. Boyle later told his followers that he was feeling 'horny' as he watched the ceremony and added: 'I'd love to have the skill and dedication of some of these Paralympians, almost as much as I'd like to have their meds'. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe was also lampooned by Boyle, who wrote: 'After all the trials they've gone through, these paralympians face their greatest challenge in trying to not look bored by Seb Coe'. Controversial: Frankie Boyle joked on Twitter that the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team were 'mainly thieves' Provocative: The comedian made a joke about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales . The comment about Lord Coe was retweeted more than 300 times, but some found his brand of humour offensive. One person wrote: 'Great work by @C4Paralympics bring on the games shame you have idiots like frankie Boyle undermining it with tweets poking fun #clueless'. Another said: 'Frankie Boyle is flogging a dead horse on here tonight. Turn it in Frankie, we got it the first time.' While a third had this to say: 'Had to unfollow Frankie Boyle. He can be hilarious but he's just uncalled for during the Paralympics'. Causing offence: Boyle tweeted a series of controversial messages while watching the Paralympics opening ceremony, which was held in the Olympic Stadium in east London . Divisive: Frankie Boyle's detractors said he was 'flogging a dead horse' with his comments during the show . Backlash: Boyle's comments offended some Twitter users, one of whom accused the comedian of trying to undermine the Games . Boyle is no stranger to controversy, having mocked the appearance of Britain's Olympic gold-medal winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington on Twitter and television. He tweeted: 'I worry that Rebecca Adlington will have an unfair advantage in the swimming by possessing a dolphin's face.' In January Channel 4 pulled the plug on a second series of Tramadol Nights, as well as a planned chat show starring the comedian. A pilot episode of the chat show, called Frankie Boyle’s Rehabilitation Programme, was filmed last year but the channel decided not to proceed with it. The Tramadol Nights series prompted more than 500 complaints from the public after the comedian made controversial remarks last year about model Katie Price’s disabled son Harvey.

"A 22-year-old Danish man interning at a New York preschool that caters to the children of international diplomats and UN employees has been accused of sexually abusing 13 children in his care. Malthe Thomsen, who arrived in Manhattan in February to work at the International Preschool at 45th Street, has been in jail since last Friday, charged with 15 counts of first-degree sexual abuse. Prosecutors say Thomsen placed the hands of nine different children on his genitals over his clothing and that he pressed the head of a 10th victim against his clothed genitals. He also allegedly touched several children on the buttocks. Disturbing allegations: Malthe Thomsen is being held for sexual crimes against 13 children at a Manhattan preschool . Yesterday, a judge ruled he be kept in jail longer after hearing evidence from prosecutors that established 'probable cause that the defendent committed a felony.' Thomsen's alleged crimes were witnessed by only one person - an assistant teacher named Gigi who has since been dismissed from her position for unrelated reasons, reports The New York Times. The assistant teacher told colleagues at the school that she had seen Thomsen interact children 'in a way that she believed bordered on inappropriate touching.' In a letter to parents on June 29, school director said the school had taken action as soon as Gigi made her claims, launching a full investigation, interviewing Thomsen's colleagues and monitoring him without his knowledge. In addition, she wrote, school policy dictates that interns are not left alone with the children, and the school had found no evidence that Thomsen had ever been alone with any of the students. The school found that the accusation was without foundation, she said. None of the children have come forward with allegations of abuse. Investigation: School officials say an internal investigation was conducted that found accusations against Thomsen had no basis - but say the school is cooperating fully with the criminal investigation . However, the school, founded in 1963 to cater to the children of UN families, is cooperating fully with the criminal investigation, she added. It's unclear how police became involved, but Thomsen was arrested on June 27. In court yesterday, proscutors played an hour-long video of a police interview with Thomsen from the day he was arrested in which they say he confessed to the crimes. Defense: Thomsen's attorneys say the confession he made to police was coerced and no children have come forward with allegations of inappropriate behavior on Thomsen's part . Prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked that the recording not be played in open court to protect the identities of the children mentioned, so headphones were used. Thomsen's lawyers say the assistant teacher Gigi had a history of complaining about her coworkers, reports The New York Times. The alleged confession was coerced, they say, because Thomsen only conceded that he could have touched the children innappropriately because detectives told him they had video of him doing so, untruthfully. 'This is another false confession case,' lawyer Jane Fisher-Byrialsen said. 'You’re telling me you have a video, he says, so I guess it happened but I have no memory of it.' Thomsen's mother Birgitte Thomsen has flown to New York from Denmark to support her son. She told the New York Daily News that Thomsen comes from a family of preschool teachers. 'In Denmark, we don’t have this fear of touching. It’s normal and common if a child is sad, you put him on your lap,' she said. 'He’s a very loving, caring guy. He’s not a child abuser.'","Malthe Thomsen, 22, is accused of sexually abusing 13 different children .

"While waxing and grooming of pubic hair has long been de rigueur, the increasing popularity of  labioplasty and other cosmetic procedures for women's private parts suggests that the appearance of the nether regions is becoming something of an obsession for appearance-concious women. However the latest product to hit the market aimed at the transformation of 'greying' feminine areas may be a step too far for some. My New Pink Button is a cosmetic genital dye that claims to be able to restore women's labia to a 'youthful pink'. My New Pink Button is a temporary genital dye designed to correct 'greying' and restore a 'youthful pink' to a woman's nether regions . Available to buy on Amazon for £23 ($36.95), My New Pink Button comes in four shades, 'Ginger', 'Marilyn', 'Bettie' and 'Audrey' all packaged in a Fifties-style tin. The dye is temporary and is applied with an applicator to the area where it takes effect immediately. While one may question where the idea for such a product came from, the website states that the 'patent pending formula' was designed by a certified Paramedical Esthetician after she discovered her own genital colour loss. While looking online for a solution the website says she discovered 'thousands of other women' asking the same questions regarding their colour loss. After much research she could unearth no solution and, after a discussion with her gynecologist, she decided to create her own. 'Now there's a solution!' the website crows, as if it were they had found the answer to some question we'd all been asking. Each so-called Dye System Kit includes 20 disposable applicators, a mixing dish, the labia colourant and an instructional guide. The four shades of dye mean you can pick the level and intensity of change - ranging from Marilyn at the lighter end to Audrey at the darkest. Three of the four shades are currently out of stock on the website, with only 'Ginger' still available . Each Dye System Kit includes 20 disposable applicators, mixing dish, the labia colorant dye of your choice and an instructional guide . The darkest shade is described as for the 'woman who wants to be daring' to give a 'bold burgundy pink colour'. 'Perfect for everyone, and your own base colour will determine the depth of this shade. Tonight it's Show time!!' the website states. However for those less willing to make a statement with their lady-parts there is Marilyn 'for beginners'. Many of the top rated customer comments are decidedly tongue-in-cheek . Marilyn is described as perfect for those 'who want to make a slight, fresh colour change in their appearance or those who are very fair skinned' while Bettie prompts a more exciting description. The website says: 'Think of that favourite lipstick you wear for . those dressy black tie affairs and think ""Bettie"". This shade blends . with a woman's own skin tones to bring out that ""sexy hot pink, I am fired . up, look"". Go dancing this weekend and remember to bring ""Bettie"" along!' But those who have discovered the product for sale on Amazon have had mixed reactions, with most of the top rated customer reviews taking a slightly tongue-in-cheek attitude to the existence of My New Pink Button. Despite the understandable cynicism surround the necessity of labia dye, nearly all the shades of the dye have sold out, with only two pots of 'Ginger' remaining in stock.","My New Pink Button is a temporary cosmetic genital dye .

"Repercussions? In 2005, Barbara Butcher was accused of taking a morbid momento from Ground Zero. She has since been promoted to Chief of Staff at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner . A high ranking official at New York’s medical examiner’s office is accused of taking a piece of the September 11th plane wreckage as a morbid souvenir, but instead of a punishment she’s recently received a promotion.

"Hard-working New Yorkers appear to be yearning for their carefree youthful days, with 'college' being the most often searched for term when looking for porn clips on the Internet. While other states look for more kinky footage, New Yorkers appear to be playing it safe with college as the number one search in the state, followed closely by massage, according to adult website PornHub. The website compiled a list last week of the top three search terms in each state. Mapped out: An adult website has listed the top porn search terms for each state . Data: The average American user logging in to the adult website spends 10.51 minutes there . One New Yorker tried to make sense of the tame search for massage in a city where nearly everything goes. 'We’re around a lot of people but not actually getting touched ... It’s hard to have a relationship in New York,' Nora O’Hara, 24, told the New York Post. In the Bible Belt popular searches included hot moms or 'Milfs', 'Big Gals' or 'big beautiful woman' and other terms not fit to print in a newspaper. 'Teen' was a popular search in several states, including Texas, Oregon, South Carolina and Missouri, according to the study. Other states, including California and Washington, opted for 'Asian' while those in Kentucky favored the more specialist hentai, based on Japanese cartoon pornography. In Nevada, the research showed the website's users to be more faithful, with searches singling out one particular star of adult movies - Anita Queen. League tables: Research shows how long people in each state look at the site . Another more unusual search was highlighted in Wyoming, where 'smoking' was the most popular search term. The adult website that carried out the research also released information on how much time the average user spends on the site. Those in Missouri liked to take their time, spending an average of 12 minutes looking at the site but while it wasn't quite a New York-minute, those living in the Empire State were among those who spent the least amount of time on the site, at 10 minutes.","Study reveals most popular fantasies across the U.S.

"An all women rowing club whose charity snaps were banned from Facebook have overcome their previous disappointment to launch their third nudist calender. The university of Warwick rowing society were left devastated earlier this year when photos from their previous calender were branded 'too pornographic' by Facebook and were removed from the site. The 2014 calender was a huge success selling over 1,500 copies and raising thousands of pounds for Macmillan Cancer Support. The University of Warwick rowing society are to release their 2015 nude calender despite heavy controversy surrounding their shoot last year which sure the images banned from Facebook . However the social networking site said that the photos breached their 'pornographic and nudity' laws and removed the black-and-white nude photos - claiming it contained 'explicitly sexual content'. Despite last year's controversy the women have remained undeterred and have released images from their 2015 calender containing even more naked images of the rowers claiming it is their best calender yet. Featuring 12 members of the university's rowing club, the girls - aged between 18 and 21 - can be seen frolicking in their boat house on the River Avon in Barford, Warks. Last year's calender shots were dubbed 'too pornographic' by the social networking site, so this year the images will not be added to Facebook . Sophie Bell (left) says that last year's setback has not deterred them and they have produced their best calendar yet for 2015 . This will be the Rowing Society's third nudist calender in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support . The young women are hopeful that their third naked calendar will be met the same success of their previous efforts having raised a whopping £5,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support over the years. Although January is still a little way off the girls have already received 200 pre-orders from across the globe for their 2015 calendar, including from the Gay and Lesbian Rowing Federation in Boston, USA. Third year history and politics student Sophie Bell, 20, from Upminster, Essex, who helped organised the 2015 calendar, said the girls have not held back with their latest efforts. The girls have raised over £3000 for the charity with their previous calendar sales . 'We were all disappointed when the page was removed because we are students so social media is one of the main ways we market and advertise the calendar. 'It really hurt us when it was branded as porn because that is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. 'We are all strong-minded women and our first thought is to make sure the shots are tastefully done so it makes a calendar we can all be proud of.' Despite not being able to market the calendar on Facebook the girls have received 200 pre-orders from around the globe . Sophie admits that they did have their concerns regarding marketing the calendar without the help of social media, but says that they have already received a phenomenal response. 'We have raised over £3,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support and thought we might struggle to sell as many of the 2015 calendars without Facebook. 'Thankfully, due to the support of our loyal fans, they saw sense and put the page back up again and the girls are really looking forward to selling as many as we can to our fans all over the world.' The society have received an order all the way from Boston USA from the Gay and Lesbian Rowing Federation . Sophie added that the warm weather really helped the girls to relax in their photographs and produce some of their most successful images yet. 'This year's shoot was done in June at our boat hose at Barford along the beautiful River Avon when we had some amazing hot weather. 'The girls really got into the spirit and I think the final images make this our best ever calendar.' And the girls hope they can raise even more money with their latest more risque version, which is priced at £8.99, and is released 14 October.

"The NHS Cancer Drugs Fund has done more harm than good by paying too much for new drugs, health economists have warned. Experts claim that paying over the odds for cancer drugs means the health service is being starved of money to spend on patients with different diseases. The money spent on expensive drugs would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the NHS, they claim. New research says the drugs rationing body is also approving drugs that are too expensive for the NHS to afford – despite rejecting dozens of other drugs on grounds of cost. The research found the 'threshold' used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) when gauging the cost-effectiveness of new drugs is too high. Waste: The money spent on expensive drugs cancer would have done five times more good if spent elsewhere in the NHS, a damning report has claimed . Many believe the high prices of new drugs are justified because pharmaceutical companies need to recoup the cost of years of investment taken to develop them. But researchers at the Centre for Health Economics at York University say NHS patients are losing out because the money could be better spent elsewhere, such as filling staff shortages or buying new radiotherapy machines. Co-author Professor Karl Claxton said 'The increasing pressure to approve new drugs more quickly at prices that are too high will only increase the harm done to NHS patients overall. 'The political pressure to support a multinational pharmaceutical sector cannot justify the real harm that has and will continue to be done to NHS patients.' The research comes as critics argue that cancer drugs have been given unfair priority in a cash-strapped NHS. The Government's aim, which was a Tory election pledge, was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug if they believed a cancer patient could benefit. It has led to around 55,000 patients in England getting drugs banned by Nice or awaiting approval since April 2011. The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) bill this year will be £280 million. Patients not being given the expensive drugs are missing out, it has been claimed. Instead, the money could be better spent filling staff shortages or buying new radiotherapy machines (file image) However, research by health economists at the University of York has, for the first time, estimated the impact of the drugs fund on other areas of the NHS. It found NHS outcomes would be better if it refused to fund any drug that cost more than £13,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). The QALY is a complex formula used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of a drug – so-called quality adjusted life years (QALY). This determines the cost of a new treatment by working out how much it improves and extends a life compared with existing treatments. Nice uses a threshold between £20,000 and £30,000 per QALY, but on average it approves drugs that cost £40,000 per QALY and sometimes as high as £50,000, according to the research. For every £10 million spent on a new drug that costs £40,000 per QALY, 250 QALYs would be gained but 773 lost because the money spent would not be available for other services. The net harm would be 523 QALYs. The Cancer Drugs Fund spend this year will buy 4,098 QALYs for individual cancer patients but the health lost elsewhere will be 21,645 QALYs – five times greater, say the researchers. Professor Claxton said he did not blame drug companies, which were responding to a demand for innovative and expensive therapies, mostly driven by the US market. Instead he said the NHS should refuse to pay excessive prices and either cut prices unilaterally or bring in a rebate scheme under which companies would reimburse the NHS for drugs that cost more than £13,000 per QALY. Professor Claxton added: 'We need to find a way of setting prices that reflects the real value in the market. The key is to find a mechanism that can allow that to happen. 'If for political reasons we have to have the Cancer Drugs Fund, at least we should be confronted with the results of that decision,' he added. Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive of Nice, said of the issue: 'The question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care' The research was funded by the National Institute of Health Research and Medical Research Council. Sir Andrew Dillon, Chief Executive of Nice, said: 'The NHS has a choice about whether to use some of its money to adopt new things. It always has done. 'The question is how to balance investing in the cutting edge of medicine with more routine care.' 'Unless you think that drug companies will be prepared to lower their prices in an unprecedented way, using a threshold of £13,000 per QALY would mean the NHS closing the door on most new treatments.' 'At the other end of the spectrum, we obviously can't just say yes to anything and everything. 'We don't have enough money and anyway, not everything is worth having.

"The number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double to reach 30 million in the next two decades as rising pollution levels trapping pollen in the atmosphere, experts have warned. The affliction already means a miserable summer for 15 million people in the UK. One in five battle streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat and deep in the inner ear. And while the soaring temperatures and bright sunshine is the most welcome of sights, for many it is a double-edge sword bringing with it the dreaded clouds of invisible pollen. Scroll down for video . Experts have estimated the number of hayfever sufferers in the UK will double in the next 20 years, reaching 30 million in two decades . Research carried out at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at Worcester University has found two factors - weather and pollution - are inextricably linked with the summer allergy. Hayfever is twice as common in towns and cities as in the countryside, largely, scientists say, because of higher levels of traffic pollution. Fumes from cars, vans and lorries create a 'photochemical smog' which traps pollen, preventing it from escaping into the upper atmosphere. The effect is to concentrate the troublesome spores at ground level, within reach of hayfever sufferers. Beverley Adams-Groom, chief pollen forecaster at the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit said weather is also a contributory factor. 'Weather and pollen are closely linked,' she said.  'Since 2007, poor weather has meant average pollen seasons. 'The mild, wet weather of the late winter and early spring is responsible for increased pollen levels this year. 'This year there has been good grass . growth as a result of the pre-summer climate and we are increasingly . experiencing longer, more intense pollen seasons. 'With a dry British summer predicted there is potential for a severe hayfever season in 2014.' Experts say rising pollution levels is part of the reason for an increasing number of people suffering hayfever. The smog acts as a barrier, preventing pollen from escaping into the upper atmosphere and triggering allergic reactions as temperatures rise . While hayfever may loom ominously on the horizon for millions as summer gathers pace, experts say there are remedies and treatments available to ease the symptoms. Boots UK Pharmacist Angela Chalmers, said the glorious weather encouraging more people outside, could explain the rise in hayfever sufferers. She said: 'With the sun starting to shine we're more likely to be having fun outdoors which could mean we become more sensitive to pollen, but there is no reason for hayfever to stop you enjoying the summer. 'Approximately 12.5 million of us over 20 years old now experience hayfever symptoms in the UK - thought to be because of environmental factors such as urbanisation and air pollution. 'With a dry British summer predicted there is potential for a severe hayfever season in 2014' - Beverley Adams-Groom, pollen forecaster . 'With a range of options available to help you stay in control of your hayfever you do not have to let a tingly nose or watery eyes keep you from making the most of the outdoors. 'You can get great tips and guidance from your local pharmacist to help you feel in control this summer if hayfever triggers your asthma symptoms. 'From inhaler techniques to reducing your exposure to the allergens which can affect your asthma, speak to your pharmacist early on so you can make the most of the warmer weather.' Ms Chalmers added: 'Sunglasses not . only provide UV protection for your eyes - they can also help keep . hayfever symptoms at bay when the pollen count is high. 'Pollen can . also stick to clothes and hair so brushing and washing both regularly . are easy ways to ensure hayfever does not hold you back this summer.' Ms Chalmers advised speaking to a pharmacist to make the most of the wide range of options available to tailor treatment plans. ANTI-HISTAMINES . Anti-histamines treat hayfever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine. The body releases the chemical when it thinks it is under attack from an allergen. Anti-histamines can be effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they do not clear the blocked nose most those with hayfever will suffer. The drugs, which are available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays, can be used as an 'as-required' treatment as well as a preventative one. Anti-histamines treat hayfever by blocking the chemical histamine, which is produced by the body when it senses it is under attack from an allergen . CORTICOSTEROIDS (steroids) When pollen triggers an allergic reaction, the inside of the nose becomes inflamed. Corticosteroids can reduce this inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever. GPs can prescribe corticosteroid nasal sprays or drops if a person has persistent hayfever that does not respond to anti-histamines or the main symptom is a blocked nose. The steroids can be more effective than anti-histamines, especially if started about two weeks before symptoms usually begin. NASAL SPRAYS AND EYE DROPS . Nasal sprays can help prevent hayfever symptoms and reduce congestion by acting as a barrier to airborne allergens. Decongestants delivered via a nasal spray reduce the swelling of the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier. Redness, itchiness and watering of the eyes can all be eased with eye drops. Write caption here . NUTRITION AND HAYFEVER . Eating foods rich in sources of Omega-3 can reduce coughs and wheezes, by reducing inflammation.Omega-3 is commonly found in oily fish, including mackerel and sardines. Garlic can also help battle the seasonal sniffles. It is a natural anti-histamine, combating the histamine chemical produced by the body in response to inflammation triggered by pollen. And a cup of tea, either English Breakfast or green, is known to take the edge of symptoms. A cuppa contains an antioxidany known as quercetin, which prevents the inflammation caused by hayfever. HONEY . A well-known remedy for beating hayfever is a teaspoon of honey each day. The theory is that local honey is contaminated with local pollen, which can help desensitise a sufferer. Eating honey from within 10 miles of home, two months before the pollen season is said to help sufferers build up a tolerance and take the edge of the symptoms. The Met Office monitors pollen levels, publishing pollen forecasts up to five days in advance. The map shows the average pollen levels across the UK . LIFESTYLE TIPS . Ms Chalmers said there are a range of lifestyle tips that can help to ease the symptoms of hayfever. There is a link between stress and the onset of symptoms, as stress levels drop the sneezing, itching and congestion is thought to become milder. Regular exercise can also improve hayfever, with those who are regularly active commonly complaining of less severe symptoms. Ms Chalmers said it is also important to get a good night's sleep, to help the body re-charge and deal better with the symptoms. Closing windows at night can also help, stopping pollen from invading the home. She added that alcohol is known to worsen the effects of pollen. Beer, wine and other spirits contain histamine, the chemical which triggers an allergic reaction in the body. When itching at the back of the mouth becomes unbearable, chewing gum can also help releive the irritation. Tiny grains of pollen measure about one millionth of an inch across, and are released by flowering plants in spring and summer. They are little bundles of DNA, each enclosed in a tough protein coat which protects the genetic material inside. This . protein coat can, in some people, trigger a violent allergic reaction. It appears to cause the body's immune system to mount an attack, similar . to when the body is invaded by harmful bacteria and viruses. Tiny grains of pollen, seen under the microscope, measure about one millionth of an inch across and are released by flowering plants in spring and summer. The body releases histamines into the bloodstream, and this causes the inflammation in the sinuses, eyes and airways. As few as 50 pollen grains per cubic yard of air is classified as a 'high' pollen count, and is enough to trigger hayfever. The pollen count begins to rise in March and stays high throughout the summer, usually tailing off in August. Some years though levels can rise as early as January, with sufferers experiencing symptoms as late as November. The season is separated into three main sections: .

"She's the grandmother who shocked the world after revealing that the secret behind her youthful looks is semen facials and now 67-year-old Stella Ralfini is back to offer more sex advice. The OAP sex therapist is using her expert knowledge between the sheets to give sex tips to frustrated twenty-somethings. Stella Ralfini may nearly be 70 - but she's still youthful when it comes to what goes on in the bedroom. Scroll down for video . Remember me? Stella Ralfini may be 67-years-old but she's a teenager when it comes to the bedroom. Since becoming a Tantric sex expert in the 1980s, she has proved a huge success - and even claims her youthful looks are thanks to semen facials . Since becoming a Tantric sex expert in the 1980s, the mother-of-one from London has proved a huge hit with her clients. But it's not just jaded middle-aged couples looking for her help to spice things up. In fact, she's actually more popular with lovelorn under-25s, she says. Yoga instructor Stella claims online dating and 'lads mags' have bred a generation looking for 'fast-food' romance. Now she is urging the younger generation, especially men, to read the Kama Sutra for sex inspiration - rather than Zoo magazine. Alternative approach: Since becoming a Tantric sex expert in the 1980s, Stella has been helping clients spice up their bedroom antics . Will YOU be taking her advice? Stella, who is also a yoga instructor, says online dating and lads mags have bred a generation looking for fast-food romance and now she's hoping to truly educate them in the art of making love - insisting they should be reading the Karma Sutra instead of Zoo . Education: Stella, who has a grandchild, has travelled the world, including to Greece and India, picking up sex tips to share with her devoted clients . Stella said: 'A lot of my clients are young people and students looking to learn about lovemaking and relationships, or they are looking for a way to keep their relationship going. 'My clients range from early 20s to mid 60s. But it is the young ones who are often the most lost when it comes to love and they're are coming to see me in their droves. 'Today's 20-somethings are running around on internet sites like Tinder and Grinder, sites geared up around the hunt for sex and are surprised when they fail to fall in love. 'I am simply teaching a way of connecting with people.' Stella, who grew up in Finsbury Park, makes her own potions, runs Tantric sex therapy classes in her home - and most controversially advocates the use of 'semen masks' to help keep her looking youthful. She has travelled the world, including to Greece and India, picking up sex tips to share with her devoted clients. Helping hand: Stella says her clients are young people and students looking to learn about lovemaking and relationships, or they are looking for a way to keep their relationship going - and that's where she can help . Back to basics: Stella believes that 20-somethings are running around on internet sites like Tinder and Grinder, sites geared up around the hunt for sex and are surprised when they fail to fall in love and should turn to ancient arts . Wishing to share her wisdom and improve the sexual relationships of young people, Stella said relationships should be stripped back to traditional courtship. She said: 'Young people today have a very fast food approach to love making, sex becomes like the rest of their lives busy, quick and when they can fit it in. 'Tantric love making doesn't have to be penetrative sex it can be about touch, eye contact, the exchange of saliva - we are about cuddling. 'Young boys and girls are exposed to so much sexual content, we need to do away with the lessons of pornography and stop young people learning bad sexual behaviours. 'They learn a horrible sense of urgency and a selfishness which means the act falls flat. 'In the home young people should be exposed to a copy of the Kama Sutra instead of the easy access to lads mags.' Advisor: Speaking about her work, she said: 'Over the years I've taught hundreds of workshops, helping hundreds of people improve their sex lives, including some lessons over the internet' Comparing her Tantric lovemaking skills with the 'unconscious love and blind passion', which characterise everyday sex today, Stella admitted unfortunately her pool of potential suitors is limited. She added: 'Over the years I've taught hundreds of workshops, helping hundreds of people improve their sex lives, including some lessons over the internet, but sadly not all men are interested in me, because not a lot of men want to follow the Tantric path. 'We're all different, but I've never wanted to be with the same person all my life. 'I have relationships and they last sometimes four years, sometimes five, sometimes less but I have a positive experience and we stay on good terms because of the trust learnt through the Tantric mantra. 'A lot of relationships today are unconscious, fast blind passion which is limited and makes lovers insecure. 'It is difficult to find partners who are willing to have a deep or sensual connection of the heart not mind. 'I was with my most recent partner for three years, he was 73, however I needed a more vigorous lover and partner so we've remained great friends and I'm debating which of the men presently interested in me would most easily convert to practice Tantric.' Stella first trained as a Tantric workshop teacher at the Multi university in Puna, India, and later furthered her studies at a Tantric school in Mumbai. As well as spiritual training, she has completed accredited courses in psychology, psychotherapy and clinical hypnosis at the International College of Natural Health Studies in London. For the last 30 years the sex therapist has been teaching seminars and workshops in forms of Tantra and yoga, and in 1989 opened a Tantra seminar centre in Athens - the first of its kind. Ever since Miss Ralfini has practiced as a tantric guide and practitioner, running couples workshops and sessions across Europe. She has also written two books 'Three Faces of Sex' and 'Sex As The New Religion' - both of which offer insight into the art of Tantra. Looking for love: Sadly, she says, not all men are interested in her, because not a lot of men want to follow the Tantric path . Seeking romance: She was dating her most recent partner for three years, he was 73, however she needed a more vigorous lover and partner, she explains .","Stella Ralfini says that her key to eternal youth is semen facials .

"An admin worker at Burton Albion who sent racy pictures to one player is also rumoured to have had a fling with a goalkeeper who went on to become a WWE wrestler, a tribunal has heard. Kerry Miller, 46, is accused of repeatedly barging into the changing rooms while players were getting dressed after post-match showers. A tribunal heard how she entered the dressing room on 15 occasions and also sent pictures of herself wearing underwear to striker Billy Kee, 23. Rumours: Allegations of a fling between Kerry Miller (left) and former Burton Albion FC goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson (right) have emerged on the third day of her employment tribunal . Keeper: Ms Miller was rumoured to have been seeing Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012 . She confessed to having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, 29, who has since left the League Two club. On the third day of her employment tribunal today, the hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012. Leicester Employment Tribunal heard she posted a picture on Facebook of herself with the model on a night out just hours after a crucial match. The following year Tomlinson turned his back on football after suffering a bad knee injury to pursue a career in WWE wrestling in America. Giving evidence the club’s chairman Ben Robinson said Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team. Racy: A tribunal heard how Ms Miller (left) entered the dressing room on 15 occasions and also sent pictures of herself wearing underwear to striker Billy Kee (right) Asked if he was aware there were rumours of a relationship between the pair by her barrister James Bruce, Mr Robinson said: 'I was aware that it was suspected. I was aware of the discussion that Kerry might have been having a relationship with Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas. 'He was a male model and a male escort. I’ve had no problems with that.' Burton Albion’s club secretary and commercial director Fleur Robinson said she had spoken to Ms Miller after she posted an image of the pair together in a Chester nightclub . Giving evidence Ms Robinson, who is also the chairman’s daughter, admitted she had 'raised an eyebrow' when the picture emerged on October 27, 2012 - just hours after a crucial game. Leaving date: Ms Miller has confessed to having a 'casual' relationship with former defender Ryan Austin, who has since left the League Two club . She told the tribunal: 'It was a Saturday and we had a home game against Bradford. 'Kerry had asked if she would be able to leave earlier than expected because she had to go out in Manchester. 'I said that was fine as long as everything was done by that time. I had no issues with her leaving an hour early. 'I remember sitting at home on the Saturday evening with my partner. I had a message off my brother saying, ""Have you seen this on Facebook?"" 'I thought it was a bit strange she had asked to go early to go to Manchester and seeing that picture I admit I raised an eyebrow. 'Kerry came to see me on the Thursday and said she wasn’t very happy about the way things had been dealt with over the weekend. Scantily clad: Ms Miller, pictured in a bikini, has appeared at a tribunal claiming constructive dismissal . 'I said being seen out in a nightclub with an injured player probably wouldn’t be perceived very well by our supporters and sponsors and people connected with the club. 'I know Kerry was friends with other colleagues and one of the second major sponsors was a friend of hers on Facebook at the time. 'I asked her to be careful in future as to what she was doing in terms of any connections with any staff that could be in the social arena. 'I think we regret that we didn’t deal with things in a more formal manner.' Evidence: The club's chairman Ben Robinson (pictured) said Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team . Ms Robinson, who has worked at the club for 18 years and was Ms Miller’s line manager, also told the hearing she warned her after manager Gary Rowett complained about her bursting into the dressing rooms. She added: 'I had a conversation with Kerry and I said I had a conversation with the manager and a phone call with the chairman that a complaint had been made by a senior player about her entering the dressing room. 'I asked her if this was the case and she said it wasn’t. 'As the conversation developed Kerry admitted she had entered the dressing room. 'It was certainly on more than one occasion and the manager said to me it was on several occasions. 'It’s something I’ve never had to deal with in 18 years at the club. 'A female member of staff or any member of staff entering the players’ dressing room when they were in states of undress is completely unheard of. 'I was told by the manager that she had gone in unannounced.' The widow started working in a sales and support role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in Burton-upon-Trent, Stafforshire, in September 2011 before she quit in February 2013 after a row with the chairman. Ms Miller, who lives in Marchington near Uttoxeter, denies bursting into the players’ dressing rooms before knocking. She is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment against the club who she is accusing of forcing her to quit. Burton Albion deny all her claims. Going for a Burton: Albion players celebrating after beating Middlesbrough 2-1 in January 2011 . The tribunal today heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs. Veteran defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all over' the club chairman. Giving evidence, Mr Webster - who made 589 appearances and scored 101 goals for the club in 16 years before he left last summer - said: 'Kerry likes male attention. In my opinion she would flirt very directly with male staff and players on a regular and daily basis. 'She came around the dressing room and the physio room in the morning. During lunchtime she would be around the players. Threat: The tribunal heard Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs . 'At one period we did see her quite frequently. I'm not 100 per cent sure why she would be there. 'Some of the girlfriends saw Kerry as a bit of a threat. She was all over the chairman on one occasion. 'If I'm honest I felt it was a little bit desperate from her at times. According to me I think she liked the male attention so if there was any whistles or noises from the players she would like it. 'That's why I personally think we saw her on a daily basis. I thought she thrived on that. I've seen pictures on two players phones - Ryan Austin and Billy Kee. 'I heard she had a thing for him [Stuart Tomlinson] but I never heard a rumour they had slept together.' Burton striker Kee told the tribunal on Wednesday afternoon how Ms Miller sent him  pictures in which she was topless. The 23-year-old, who still plays for the club, admitted he also sent two naked pictures of himself to Ms Miller after a night out in 2012. He told the hearing he didn't remember how they started texting but he remembered the messages started getting sexual after he 'drank a few pints'. Asked if he had sent two naked pictures, both not including his face, to Ms Miller by the club's barrister Sarah George, the striker simply answered 'yes'. And then asked if he received one snap of Ms Miller in her underwear and then another of her topless Mr Kee again replied 'yes'. Giving evidence he told the hearing: 'I remember I was on a night out and I don't know how we got texting but we ending up exchanging pictures. I think it was two from each side. 'I don't remember what words were used but if I was going to do it with someone else I would say ""you send me one and I'll send you one back"". 'I know it started as just innocent chit-chat. I think after a few pints it may have got sexual but I honestly don't remember.  The next day I received a text from her. 'I think she said ""I'm silly for sending them and I would appreciate it if you deleted them because it could cost me my job"". 'I showed them [the photos] to a few players, four including the physio. A couple of other players said ""come on mate, you shouldn't be doing that"".' Burton Albion's accounts manager Angela Lawley also told the tribunal Ms Miller was texting another married player from another professional club. She said the player - who was not named - also had children and would keep the phone he used to text Ms Miller hidden in his car's glove-box. The hearing, which is expected to last another two days, continues.

"The 'art of pole dancing used to be confined to gentleman's clubs and bars. More recently it has been adopted by the fitness industry as a fun way to tone up and build strength. And now street pole dancing is the latest fitness craze set to take the UK by storm. For street pole dancers, lamp posts, road signs and even trees are the perfect stage for this dynamic new dance trend. Combining elements of free running and street art, the discipline sees participants showing off impressive moves on pieces of street furniture. Tobi-Jayne Lloyd, who runs pole dancing workshops in Abergavenny, Wales said: 'Once you start street pole dancing, you can never look at a lamp post in the same way again.' Tobi-Jayne Lloyd of Ewyas Harold, Abergavenny practises street pole dancing on lamposts, trees and street signs . Tobi-Jayne, who also works as a model, admitted some classes still encourage their pupils to work in strip club . The 26-year-old first encountered the concept when she completed a pole dancing course in Bristol earlier in the year. She said: 'All the girls were really into it. I was a bit embarrassed to start with, because I didn't want anyone to see when I fell flat on my face. 'You do get a bit of a crowd around you. I had an elderly couple watching me recently, but I think they were more intrigued than disapproving. I could see them wondering what on earth I was doing.' The movement started in Bristol five years ago, when a group of pole dancers started to meet for regular 'jams', which involved sharing moves outside. A spokesman for the group said: 'It took us many years to realise that mediocre street furniture has great joys to offer. 'Street pole dancing can be practiced by anyone. You can do it on your own, but it really makes more sense and is safer when people jam together, swapping moves, encouraging and inspiring each other.' The 26-year-old first encountered the concept when she completed a pole dancing course in Bristol earlier in the year . Combining elements of free running and street art, the discipline sees participants showing off impressive moves on pieces of street furniture . Taking her inspiration from the Bristol scene, Tobi-Jayne decided to set up a group in Abergavenny last month and already has more than 80 regular members. She said: 'Pole dancing has really taken off in Wales over the last couple of years. People are starting to hear about how great it is fitness-wise. More and more groups are springing up in smaller communities. 'Anyone of any size, shape or age can get involved. You don't need to be strong. I am quite small, but you start to build up strength so quickly.' The dancer, from Ewyas Harold, who is mostly self-taught, first became interested in the discipline when she got bored of going to the gym two years ago. Keen to distance pole dancing from its bad reputation, she said: 'Pole dancing is no longer associated with sleazy strip clubs, but is now seen as a popular form of recreational and even competitive sport.' After beating more than 100 competitors to win an international street pole dancing competition last month, Tobi-Jayne will be jetting off to America in August to the Pole Dance Academy in South Carolina.= . But Tobi-Jayne, who also works as a model, admitted some classes still encourage their pupils to work in strip clubs. She said: 'When I first went to a class, they were pushing us towards working in bars.

"They have watched everything from hippies drinking their own urine to Kerry Katona slurring. But today the presenters of ITV’s This Morning struggled to articulate some rather hair-raising questions while talking to a man who has sex with cars. Edward Smith told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden that although he has made love to 700 cars in his lifetime, he has now settled down with the ‘love of his life’ - a Volkswagen Beetle he calls ‘Vanilla’. Scroll down for video . Edward Smith, 63, is a mecaphile, meaning he is sexually interested in machines . Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden questioned Mr Smith about his love affairs with cars on ITV's This Morning . Mr Smith lost his virginity to his neighbour's Volkswagen Beetle at age 14, and this awoke a voracious sexual appetite for cars which took him to car parks and car showrooms for threesomes . Mr Smith, 63, is a mecaphile, which means he is sexually interested in cars and believes he is in a relationship with one. While presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden managed to ask probing questions about the details of his sexual history with four wheeled machines, there were clearly moments when it was difficult for the pair not to crack up. Mr Smith boasted he has bedded Jaguars, Mustangs, had threesomes in car parks and car showrooms, and has even had brief flings with helicopters and planes. Mecaphilia is considered a crime in the U.K., with perpetrators put on the sexual offenders register. As a teenager, Mr Smith began to look at car magazines in the same way some men devour pornography, before finally losing his virginity to his neighbour’s Volkswagen Beetle at age 14. He said: ‘I got tempted one night to step outside to gently caress the car. ‘It did something for me, woke something up inside of me.’ Once this desire had been awakened,  he began to seek out cars that he was attracted to. He said: ‘I look back at that thinking that was really risky business. That’s the history, yes, in fact, I cannot deny that there were a number of neighbourhood car lots. I would go over to visit.’ When asked how he makes love to a car, he clarified that he is not attracted to any kind of penetration. He said: ‘It’s hugging and holding the shape of the car close to me and talking to it a little bit. ‘The rest is just physical satisfaction... hat’s done next to the car.’ He added that he always kept his clothes on. ‘I basically just unzipped. I’ve never got naked on a car – in public’ he said. Mr Smith did have human girlfriends in secondary school and university, and one who he met as ag grown adult living in San Francisco in 1971, although he was never able to consummate the relationship. He said: ‘It was not a thoroughly satisfying experience. To have sex with a car, he holds the body of the car, strokes and caresses it, and then masturbates . While his libido has calmed as he grows older, he has a 'deep love' for his favourite cars, Vanilla, Cinnamon and Ginger and worries he may crash or they may break down . Mr Smith boasts he has had sex with 700 cars, as well as helicopters and planes, but has now settled down with a white 1969 Volkswagen Beetle called Vanilla who he says is the 'love of his life' ‘I never got so involved like my brothers did and spent the night with them.’ Now, he says his white Volkswagen Vanilla is his girlfriend and the love of his life. ‘She certainly has become special. I got her in 1982 so it will be 30 years on December 23rd' he said. The pair ‘met’ when Mr Smith was involved in a relationship with another Volkswagen Beetle called Victoria. But when he laid eyes on Vanilla, it was love at first sight. He said: ‘I first met her, before I got her, when I lived here In Yelm, they had the local Jehovah’s witness church driver around in a white Beetle handing out literature. ‘ . ‘There was something about that white ’74 beetle when they pulled up to hand out their literature, that while they were talking, I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.’ Years later, he saw an advert for a similar white beetle available to buy. When he went to the dealership he was shocked to find it had the same numberplate and was indeed the same car. He now greets Vanilla every morning. They 'get intimate'  on his own private property, but he is mindful not to be seen in public. Mr Smith also is involved with a 1973 Opal GT, named Cinnamon, and 1993 Ford Ranger Splash, named Ginger, but Vanilla is ‘very forgiving’ and doesn’t get jealous. Although he says he understands that cars are not conscious beings, he feels strongly about them and truly believes they are in a long-term relationship. He is the only one who is allowed to wash his cars, which is like giving them a bath, he says. He likes to talk to them, play music and 'suds them all up' ‘I realise that “Edward, in your heart and soul you know that these are cars” - but when I hold them in my arms I do feel an energy that comes from each one of them. ‘Lately at my age, the libidinal energies have calmed. Beyond that, there’s a very deep love that I wouldn’t want anything to separate us after 32 years.’ His feeling are so strong he says he would be ‘devastated’ if there were ever to be a mechanical problem or a crash involving Vanilla. He says his fear means he drives extremely carefully, almost to the point of paranoia. Once he became livid after a mechanical engineer did a shoddy job and Vanilla broke down during a long road trip. While he allows mechanics to fix cars, he has a strict rule: he is the only one allowed to wash them. ‘I prefer to do that myself,’ he said. ‘It’s like giving her a bath. I talk to her, play music, suds her all up.’ Professor Craig Jackson, head of psychology at Birmingham City University, told MailOnline: . Professor Craig Jackson says mechaphilia is not strictly seen as a mental health problem . Mechaphilia is quite rare and unusual, and not much is known about how the prevalence of mechaphiles within society, other than they do seem to occur everywhere around the globe, and the cause is not specific to specific cultures. Although mechaphilia is an extremely unusual and rare behaviour, the sexual attraction to objects and mechanical equipment is not strictly seen as a mental health problem. The Diagnostic Statistical Manual (which acts like a physician’s recipe book for diagnosing health conditions) states that mechaphilia is a non-specific paraphilia, with a paraphilia being a type of sexual attraction or predilection that runs alongside 'conventional' sexual behaviours. Paraphilia are only seen to be viewed as such when the sexual feelings or behaviours become problematic, often leading to depression or anxiety within the individual, or when the behaviour itself (or the attempted avoidance of such behaviour) causes serious problems with day to day functioning. There are literally dozens of other forms of unusual paraphilia running from A-Z including Apotemnophilia (attraction to amputees) and Zoosadism (an attraction to seeing animals in pain). Some of these paraphilia are more psychiatrically concerning than others – especially if they involve the pleasure of witnessing or inflicting pain or suffering in other adults, children or animals, such as Anthropophagy – a pleasure derived from eating human flesh. In comparison then, mechaphilia (sometimes known specifically as autophilia, when an individual develops either sexual or emotional attachments to vehicles – most commonly cars) seems quite innocuous and harmless – with many mechaphiles explaining that they do not hurt anyone by their behaviours. Indeed Edward Smith has spoken quite openly, and at times graphically, about his behaviour, going to great lengths to point out that he has had relationships with humans before and that he is not homosexual, but that he just prefers cars. Ever since Fritz Lang’s Metropolis was released in 1927, some have been concerned that the sexualisation of robots – maschinenmensch as it was in the movie – could result in mecaphilia becoming a commonplace occurrence. Some mechaphiles may find only vehicles arousing, while some may find both humans and vehicles stimulating and can try to combine both of them into their sexual activities. What does seem quite common in many mechanophiles, of which approximately 8590% are male, seems to be an extreme form of relationship avoidance and failed romances in early formative years. But that is also true for the 'normal' non-mechanaphile population too. While such romantic failures are part of many peoples’ growing up experiences, some find it just too painful and develop alternative feelings and emotions for other objects (even animals) that cannot hurt or reject in the way that humans possibly can. Although some mechaphiles do possess the insight to say that they found 'human relationships' too difficult or painful, just as many are often in denial about such difficulties in their pasts. Mechaphilia, like most other paraphilia, can best be viewed as the result of a disturbance in the psychosexual development, whereby healthy sexual and emotional feelings are subconsciously transferred to objects that are safer or less 'emotionally risky' than other people. If this occurs at a crucial time on the formative developmental period, the reward the mechaphile gets (sexual / emotional release without fear of rejection) can be quite powerful and addictive, which will reinforce future mecaphilic behaviours.","Edward Smith, 63, is a mecaphile - he is sexually interested in machines .

"Up for the cup: Jennifer Aniston shows off marks left by cupping . As she posed for the photographers on the red carpet, Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston looked every inch the A-lister. Shiny hair, immaculate make-up, a glowing tan — not to mention revealing shorts that showed off her perfectly toned legs. But having paid such attention to her appearance, why did Aniston choose a low-backed top that succeeded only in showing off a series of unsightly circular marks on her back? Peculiarly, Aniston was modelling the latest celebrity must-have. Forget Kabbalah bracelets and coconut water: every Hollywood star worth her salt knows that their health routine must include cupping. For those round marks on Aniston’s back are a tell-tale sign of cupping, an ancient Asian therapy where heated cups are placed onto the skin, creating suction that supposedly improves blood flow. Practitioners claim it helps everything from muscle pain to cellulite and depression. Inevitably, it was Gwyneth Paltrow — that well-known proponent of anti-gravity yoga and elimination diets for her children — who set the trend for cupping when she attended a film premiere in 2004 with the distinctive circular welts clearly visible on her back. Victoria Beckham was recently spotted walking through Heathrow Airport with the trademark bruises, and tennis star Andy Murray has also declared himself to be a cupping devotee, even though his girlfriend Kim Sears said it made him ‘look like a reptile’. So — apart from leaving you looking like a well-used coaster — how does cupping actually work? Dating back 5,000 years, the therapy is a form of acupuncture, and is based on the idea that suction from the cups draws the skin up and mobilises blood and energy around the body. ‘If someone is under stress, or they’ve suffered a physical trauma like a pulled shoulder, the energy in their body can become stagnated,’ explains Ian Stones, an acupuncturist in Farnham, Surrey, and member of the British Acupuncture Council, who has been practising cupping for six years. Miracle cure or celebrity fad: Practitioners claim it helps everything from muscle pain to cellulite and depression . ‘Cupping enables the blood and energy to move again and travel to the area to begin the healing process. ‘It can also have good results if someone is coming down with a cold. The suction can help to stop the cold penetrating further into the system.’ Typically, a flame is first placed inside a glass or rubber cup, so the heat can create a partial vacuum, before the flame is removed and the cup held to the skin for about three minutes. Although the resulting marks can look alarming, they are temporary, and this kind of cupping should not hurt in any way as the cups used are thick-rimmed and do not heat up. Other forms of cupping — which costs around £50 per session — involve using a sort of suction kit, so no flame is needed. The UK’s leading cupping practitioner is Dr Nish Joshi, a Harley Street holistic doctor who was held in high regard by the late Princess Diana. Fan: Actress Gwyneth Paltrow made an appearance at a film premier in 2004 sporting large circular marks . His website recommends cupping ‘to aid the lymphatic flow, reduce fluid build-up, increase the blood circulation which will help give the skin a healthier appearance and reduce cellulite’. It was Dr Joshi who was responsible for Gwyneth Paltrow’s introduction to cupping (‘Joshi is truly special. I love him,’ she has said), and other patients include Sadie Frost, Patsy Kensit and Ralph Fiennes. The photographs of Aniston sparked speculation she may be trying for a baby, as some supporters of cupping say it can be a useful aid to fertility. Cupping specialist Saud Hadi says: ‘There are a number of cupping points on each side of the spine which correspond to organs. The most important organ for fertility is the kidney — it’s the source of life according to Chinese medicine. ‘From the look of [Aniston], she’s had cupping in the right spots for fertility treatment. The marks are likely to extend right down to her lower back. If the patient is in good health and has a good diet — like Aniston — then cupping fertility treatment can work within about five days. It also complements IVF treatment.’ But Mr Stones is doubtful. ‘I do a lot of fertility treatment and cupping wouldn’t be my first port of call,’ he says. ‘The location of the cupping marks on Jennifer Aniston would indicate some kind of musculoskeletal injury, such as back pain.’ And he adds that while cupping is perfectly safe, he would not generally use it on pregnant women. ‘It can be a fairly strong treatment, and in pregnancy we like to keep things gentle and light.’ In China, cupping is such an integral part of mainstream medicine that it is practised at hospitals for a variety of conditions. The country’s hugely successful Olympic swimming squad are regularly photographed with cupping marks, as it is thought to be helpful with muscular pain. But while Gwynnie and Jennifer are clearly fans, there are plenty of people who think cupping is simply hogwash. After the author Arabella Weir underwent a series of cupping treatments at the Joshi Clinic, she reported: ‘It feels like 20 14-year-old boys giving you love bites, but not as much fun. I had three or four sessions and I didn’t feel any different — apart from the fact that I wore a burka for two weeks afterwards to hide the unsightly marks. Why would anyone [who’s had cupping] parade around in a backless dress?’ Dating back 5,000 years, the therapy is a form of acupuncture, and is based on the idea that suction from the cups draws the skin up and mobilises blood and energy around the body . Many medical experts are scathing, and warn that fads such as this can become dangerous if people start to use them in place of seeing their GP. ‘Cupping doesn’t make any sense at all,’ says David Colquhoun, professor of pharmacology at University College London. ‘Bleeding was part of mainstream medicine in the 18th century, until they found out it was harmful rather than helpful. ‘Putting a suction cup on the body may cause the skin to constrict and there could be some increased blood flow, but the idea that this could treat any medical condition is laughable. ‘It’s utterly implausible and just another ingenious way of relieving the rich and gullible of their money.’ Unfortunately, he continues, too many people expect every ailment to be curable. ‘There are many medical conditions — back pain being one of them — that we can’t do much about, or even find out what the cause is. That’s sad, but spending thousands on something as daft as cupping won’t help.’ A review of 135 studies on cupping therapy, published last year in the journal PLOS ONE, found that cupping may be effective on conditions such as acne, facial paralysis and herpes when combined with other treatments such as acupuncture. However, the researchers acknowledged that some of the studies in their review may have contained bias, and said more research was needed. Acupuncturist Ian Stones says he has seen significant results from cupping, adding that the technique is almost always used as part of a larger package of acupuncture treatment, which could explain why there may not be substantial research on its effects as an isolated therapy yet. However, Edvard Ernst, a leading professor of complementary therapy, has little time for such claims. In his book Trick Or Treatment? Alternative Medicine On Trial, he found that despite cupping’s long history, the only controlled trial on this treatment showed no reduction in pain. He added that the fact the skin appears to be sucked into the cup as if ‘by magic’ means cupping is likely to generate an ‘above-average placebo response’. Put simply, people are fooled by the seeming wizardry of the suction action into thinking that cupping must be doing something for them. Professor Ernst says: ‘There is no good evidence that cupping helps any condition — except the dreaded condition of celebrities craving attention.’","Forget Kabbalah bracelets and coconut water, every Hollywood star knows their health routine must involve cupping .

"One young woman is giving Miley Cyrus a run for her money as she has found the singer's iconic dance moves to be somewhat lucrative. Jessica Vanessa works as a professional twerker and claims to be earning a six-figure income by shaking her bottom. The 22-year-old social media star captivates audiences from around the world with her hypnotic gyrating. Scroll down for video . Jessica Vanessa earns a six-figure income by recording videos of herself twerking for social media site Vine . Formerly working as a teaching assistant Jessica, from Florida, quit her job after advertisers discovered her dance moves through her Vine videos. The large companies had noticed the attention that Jessica's assets were drawing in and offered to pay her large amounts of money in exchange for her mentioning their products to her two million strong following. For Jessica quitting her role as a teacher was a no-brainer when she did the maths and realised that she could earning more twerking than she could ever have dreamed of working in a school. She said: 'What I make in six seconds would take me  four months to make as a teaching assistant. Jessica has over two million Vine followers so advertisers are willing to pay her thousands of pounds to mention their products during her twerking films . Jessica quit her job as a teaching assistant in order to pursue her twerking career . 'It's definitely a blessing. I bought a new car, paid it off in full and I was able to get out of debt from the school that I graduated from.' Jessica says that she has her loyal fans to thank for her sudden turn of fortune. 'It's quite simple really, the more followers you get, the more advertisers want to pay you for mentioning their products - and I've got lots.' Jessica describes herself as a normal girl from Florida before her first viral Vine put her on the road to social media fame. Jessica now earns in six seconds what she would have earned in four months of working in a school . Jessica says that she is fortunate enough to have had lots of support from her family . She mixes comedy sketches with twerking videos to keep her legions of fans entertained - and it was when she saw the popularity of her short videos growing that she finally decided to give up her previous occupation. 'Quitting my job was definitely a risk because I knew once I quit there was no turning back. Either I make money doing these videos or I'm going to be broke and jobless.' Although Jessica appears to be brimming with confidence now the 22-year-old admits that she was once quite shy and hated dancing in front of others. 'When I was younger I was very shy and I didn't like dancing in front of anybody. The 22-year-old says that she wasn't always this confident and was very reluctant to dance in front of others as a child . 'Then I kind of fell in with a different crowd and got more confident. By the time I hit high school I was definitely a party girl.' Jessica appears to be living a dream life however she admits that she has found some aspects of her fame difficult to cope with. 'I do get plenty of rude and mean comments. I've even had two breakdowns over them - where I have literally locked myself in my room and considered taking down all of my social media accounts. She says that some aspects of her new found fame have been very difficult to deal with, including strangers criticising her looks and calling her both 'fat' and 'ugly' 'I'm not a celebrity but I do get a taste of what they have to go through - I have strangers calling me a whore, people calling me fat, people calling me ugly, people saying just about any mean thing you could say.' Jessica says that the nature of her dancing attracts a lot of misconceptions and causes people to make assumptions about her. 'People like to define you as a whore for twerking but it's just a type of dance, that's it, if people were open-minded they would understand that.' But Jessica has found strength from the support of her family who have overcome their own prejudices about twerking. 'They're very open-minded people - they don't look at it in any type of sexual way, they don't look at it as degrading, they're very supporting. Jessica says that the cruel comments she has received have caused her to have two 'breakdowns' where she considered deleting all of her social media accounts . 'I would have no problem showing my grandmother my twerking videos - she is wild and crazy and would probably want to join in with me.' Jessica's dad Rafael De Leon, 46, has struggled with her career choice in the past but now supports Jessica wholeheartedly. Rafael, who works as pawn broker, said that it was hard to accept her profession at first as it was difficult to get used to the fact that she had grown up. Jessica says that twerking is just another form of dancing and that she wants people to be more open-minded about it . 'As a parent I still see her as my little girl, I don't see her as an adult. She could be forty years old and she'll still be my baby. 'It just keeps expanding more and more, no matter what she does I'll just keep supporting her 100 per cent - I love everything she does.' Jessica added that she feels as though she is finally doing what she was born to do. 'As a little girl I always wanted to be somebody big, I always wanted to entertain people, I would sing, I would dance, I would do whatever it took and if I got a laugh out of people I knew I was doing something right. 'I always enjoyed doing random crazy stuff so when I got a day job it was not something I enjoyed doing. Now I look at Vine as an outlet to many different opportunities which I enjoy doing now.'","Jessica Vanessa works as a professional twerker .

"A feminist speaker has canceled a speech at Utah State University after learning the school would allow concealed firearms despite an anonymous threat against her. Anita Sarkeesian was scheduled to give a presentation on the portrayal of women in video games on Wednesday evening. She made the decision to cancel on Tuesday night. University staff members had received a threat earlier on Tuesday from an unknown person who vowed to carry out a mass shooting if the event was held. Anita Sarkeesian has canceled her scheduled speech at Utah State University on Wednesday after learning the school would allow concealed firearms despite an anonymous threat against her . University spokesman Tim Vitale says the FBI told school officials the threat is consistent with ones Sarkeesian receives when she gives speeches elsewhere. The university consulted with federal and state law enforcement and had determined it was safe to go ahead with the presentation. But Sarkeesian pulled out after learning from university officials that concealed weapons would be permitted, as long as attendees have a valid concealed firearm permit in accordance with Utah law. In an email received by a number of staff, the unknown person promised 'the deadliest school shooting in American history', and declared that he was inspired by an infamous Canadian anti-feminist shooting in 1989. Sarkeesian tweeted about the incident and made it quite clear that she blamed the police for refusing to take steps to prevent concealed firearms at the event . Sarkeesian is the creator of Feminist Frequency, a video webseries that explores representations of women in pop culture (above a still from Final Fantasy VII) Marc Lepine separated out and killed 14 women at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, before committing suicide. His suicide note stated 'I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker.'

"If you have a virus on your machine, there is a very real risk you will get kicked off the internet on Monday. Web-users are being warned to ensure their computers are clear of the nasty 'Alureon/DNS Changer bot'. This piece of software found its way onto hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide late last year. The software was designed to re-direct you away from trusted websites, towards spoof websites in a bid to steal financial and personal information. When the attack was noticed, the FBI took the unusual step of setting up a 'safety-net', routing infected machines through their server to stop the 'spoof' attacks. But these servers will be taken down on Monday, and when this happens, people still infected are likely to lose their internet connection without warning. Internet shutdown: Software called Alureon/DNS Changer attempts to change the website you visit - and those infected may get cut off on Monday . The warnings about the problem have been splashed across Facebook and Google. Internet service providers have sent notices, and the FBI set up a special website. Despite repeated alerts, the number of computers that probably are infected is more than 277,000 worldwide, down from about 360,000 in April. Of those still infected, the FBI believes that about 64,000 are in the United States. If you are worried about this, and want to put your mind at ease, follow these steps: . 1) Visit this FBI-approved site - http://www.dns-ok.us - and see if you get an 'all-clear' green background or an 'at risk' red background. 2) If you have a red background, visit http://www.dcwg.org/fix which lists free virus scanner and removal software. Our personal recommendations from the free range are Microsoft Windows Defender and Avira. For more information, visit here: http://www.dcwg.org/detect/ . Users whose computers are still infected on Monday will lose their ability to go online, and they will have to call their service providers for help deleting the malware and reconnecting to the Internet. The problem began when international hackers ran an online advertising scam to take control of more than 570,000 infected computers around the world. When the FBI went in to take down the hackers late last year, agents realised that if they turned off the malicious servers being used to control the computers, all the victims would lose their Internet service. In a highly unusual move, the FBI set up a safety net. They brought in a private company to install two clean Internet servers to take over for the malicious servers so that people would not suddenly lose their Internet. But that temporary system will be shut down at 12:01 a.m. EDT (4.01am GMT) on Monday, July 9. Most victims don't even know their computers have been infected, although the malicious software probably has slowed their Web surfing and disabled their antivirus software, making their machines more vulnerable to other problems. But popular social networking sites and Internet providers have got more involved, reaching out to computer users to warn of the problem. If you wish to check if your computer is at risk, visit http://www.dns-ok.us (linked above) and hopefully you will see the 'all clear' sign . According to Tom Grasso, an FBI supervisory special agent, many Internet providers are ready for the problem and have plans to try to help their customers. Some, such as Comcast, already have reached out. The company sent out notices and posted information on its website. Because the company can tell whether there is a problem with a customer's Internet server, Comcast sent an email, letter or Internet notice to customers whose computers appeared to be affected. Grasso said other Internet providers may come up with technical solutions that they will put in place on Monday that will either correct the problem or provide information to customers when they call to say their Internet isn't working. If the Internet providers correct the server problem, the Internet will work, but the malware will remain on victims' computers and could pose future problems. In addition to individual computer owners, about 50 Fortune 500 companies are still infected, Grasso said. Both Facebook and Google created their own warning messages that showed up if someone using either site appeared to have an infected computer. Facebook users would get a message that says, ""Your computer or network might be infected,"" along with a link that users can click for more information. Google users got a similar message, displayed at the top of a Google search results page. It also provides information on correcting the problem. To check whether a computer is infected, users can visit a website run by the group brought in by the FBI: http://www.dcwg.org. The site includes links to respected commercial sites that will run a quick check on the computer, and it also lays out detailed instructions if users want to actually check the computer themselves.","Hundreds of thousands of PCs still at risk worldwide .

"Around 100,000 Christians are killed every year around the world because of their faith according to a top Vatican official. Monsignor Silvano Maria Tomasi, a Catholic archbishop, cited the Middle East, Africa and Asia as the worst places for the deaths. On Vatican radio, he was quoted on Tuesday saying the figures were 'shocking' and 'incredible'. An Iranian female Christian kisses a cross held in a ceremony at the Qara Kelisa in Chaldran, 510 miles northwest of the capital Tehran . Tomasi said Christians were also forced to leave their homes and see their churches destroyed in some parts of the world, and were often subjected to rapes, kidnappings and discrimination. He made particular reference to the kidnapping of two Orthodox bishops near Aleppo in Syria last month. Religious freedom is beset by 'sectarianism, intolerance, terrorism and exclusionary laws,' he said, while also pointing to exceptions like Bangladesh where he said rights are protected. Another senior Vatican figure, the secretary of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, Mario Toso, said recently that discrimination against Christians 'should be countered in the same way as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia'. It comes as Iran's largest Persian-language Pentecostal church was closed down just one week after one of its pastors was arrested and taken away during a service. Central Assemblies of God church in Tehran is the latest example of the Islamic Republic cracking down on Christian faith. Authorities grabbed Pastor Robert Asserian on May 21 while mass was underway. They have still not revealed to worshippers where he is being held. According to BosNewsLife, a news agency that specialises in the plight of Christians in Middle Eastern nations, Christians fear their faith is being stamped out in Iran. It is believed there are about 100,000 Christians in Iran in a national of 75 million. Other pastors known to be detained in Iranian prisons include Behnam Irani, who is held in Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj City, one of the toughest jails in the country, some 12 miles west of the nation's capital, Tehran. George Wood, Assemblies of God in the U.S., said: 'These incidents appear to be an attempt to stop worship services from being conducted in Farsi, the language of the majority of Iranians.'","Monsignor Silvano Maria Tomasi made the remarks on Vatican radio .

"International flight security concerns have been raised as passengers on board a flight from London to New York's JFK were left to bypass immigration when the plane arrived at the wrong terminal. Passengers on the Delta Air Lines fight were let out into a section of the airport where they did not have to pass through immigration or customs. They were only stopped when airport employees realised they were in the wrong part of the airport. Passengers would usually be shuffled through the arriving immigrations and customs desks upon arrival to JFK, but on this flight they were allowed to bypass them . Plane crazy: The passengers were dropped off at a baggage claim terminal at JFK (stock picture of the airport), which could have allowed some with carry-on luggage to just stroll out of the airport . The passengers aboard the flight, Delta 3, which took off from Heathrow, found that instead of their expected customs and immigration check, they instead departed inside a domestic baggage claim. CBS was alerted to the news by a passenger on the flight, Andrew Rostron, whose wife is a CBS News employee. Rostron, 42, is originally from Bolton but now lives in New York, and was as flying back from UK after visiting his mum. According to Rostron, the plane only had about 54 people aboard, and was by no means full. Passengers on the Delta flight were eventually rounded up and put through immigration and customs, but not before they were let out at the baggage claim . Passengers were left next to the Delta baggage claim terminal of JFK upon arrival in the U.S. Rostron said: ‘When we arrived at JFK we pulled up to the gate and the door opened, we got off and walk off the jet bridge. 'We didn’t really think about it but we were basically in the main part of the terminal where the passengers were preparing to board. ‘We kept walking past shops and duty free and restaurants and then we realised it was a bit strange. 'We just kept going. Terminal 4 at JFK is pretty big so you just go and go. 'The only place to go to eventually was domestic baggage, so we went to the baggage counter and we explained what happened and they just asked us “Why are you here?"" 'It was just weird, very unusual.' JFK Airport is the 17th busiest airport in the world and the 6th busiest in the U.S. Rostron said: ‘I could have just left the airport and kept going, no question about it. 'I was practically out the front door of the airport but realised I have to go get my bag. ‘If you didn’t have checked luggage you could have just left, got in a cab and been gone. They had no idea.’ He said that eventually officials rounded them up, escorted them into main . immigration arrivals hall and security officials took their name. The entire processing of the passengers, from the gate to leaving the airport, reportedly took about just over an hour. Delta Airlines told CBS News it is aware . that 'a small number of customers off Delta flight 3 from London to New . York's Kennedy International Airport were able to bypass customs . screening. They said: 'Delta is working with the Port Authority as well as Customs and Border Protection and is looking into the matter. 'Customer security is of vital importance and Delta makes every effort to follow appropriate procedures.'","Delta Air Lines flight from Heathrow took passengers to the wrong gate .

"Forget flash cars, expensive restaurants and lavish bouquets - the way to impress the nation’s women is to fasten on a tool belt and get drilling. High maintenance females have voted DIY skills sexier in a man than sporting prowess and cooking capabilities. A new study has revealed women’s top turn ons - and turn offs - when it comes to a man's skill set, taking in everything from assembling furniture and unblocking drains to scoring on the football pitch or cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Handy man: 74 per cent of women revealed that a sexy trait in a man is an ability to DIY - including putting up shelves . In at number one, 74 per cent of women revealed that a sexy trait in a man is an ability to DIY - including putting up shelves, basic building, putting up blinds and laying decking in the garden. A staggering 61 per cent claimed they would actually be put off a potential partner if he wasn’t practical around the house. Furthermore, despite there being a big increase in recent years of the number of women willing to try their hands at DIY, a massive 68 per cent believe that it is a man’s job and they would find it unattractive if they were better at it than their partner. The second sexiest skill to have is sporting prowess, with 69 per cent of women finding sporting ability a key factor when looking for the ideal man. Sexy skills: While DIY was voted the sexiest skill, athletic abilities and culinary skills (as demonstrated by David Beckham and Jamie Oliver) were also voted in the top five . Any budding Jamie Olivers out there will be pleased to know that capacity to cook comes third on the list of attractive qualities. Proficient driving and managing finances complete the set. Jon Gough from Spaceslide.co.uk, who commissioned the research, said: 'When men's skill sets came under scrutiny, it seems men who are willing to get their hands dirty are those deemed the most attractive. 'It's interesting that women also judge a man’s ability to score on the football field alongside his ability to score in the bedroom.' Money makers and top gear: Women also like men who can handle their finances like entrepreneur Alan Sugar and men who are good behind the wheel like Jeremy Clarkson .","74% of women say most .

"It is no secret that male animals will go to great lengths to pursue a female and can take to extreme measures to hold on to her even if their affection is unrequited. But Canadian scientists have discovered that the innocent-looking male guppy fish has evolved barbs on its penis to force 'unreceptive females' to mate with it. University of Toronto research found that claws are used by the male fish to treble the amount of sperm transferred to females who resisted advances. Canadian scientists have discovered that the innocent-looking male guppy fish has evolved barbs on its penis to force 'unreceptive females' to mate with it . The evolutionary biologists believe the species has evolved to benefit males at the expense of females, especially when their mating interests differ. Lucia Kwan at the university studied the bizarre clawed genitalia of the fish. Genitalia differ greatly in animal groups, even among similar species and the research for these difference have baffled scientists for years, although there is a school of thought that says sexual conflict between males and females might be the reason. Sexual conflict occurs when the fitness . interests of males and females differ, which is rooted in differences in . egg and sperm sizes. Males invest less than females in reproduction because sperm is cheap to produce, and larger eggs are most costly to make. This difference results in a conflict in . which males are interested in mating with as many females possible while . females are more selective with their mates. Ms Kwan's research shows the male guppy grows claws on its genitals to make it more difficult for unreceptive females to get away during mating. The researchers examined the role of a pair of claws at . the tip of the gonopodium of the male guppy (Poecilia reticulata) – . essentially the fish’s penis. Ms Kwan said: 'Our results show that the claws are used to increase sperm transfer to females who are resisting matings.' A Canadian scientist surgically shaved the barbs off of the penises of some male guppies to investigate the relative advantages of claws for mating with 'unreceptive females'. She compared the amount of sperm transferred. Pictured left is the penis with claws and right the modified guppy genitalia . 'This suggests that it has evolved to benefit males at the expense of females, especially when their mating interests differ.' The scientists tested two ideas for the function of the claws:one for their role in securing sperm in place at the tip of the . gonopodium just before it is inserted into the female and the other for . grasping unreceptive or resistant females during mating to aid in sperm . transfer. Ms Kwan surgically shaved the barbs off of the penises of . some male guppies to investigate the relative advantages of claws for . mating with ‘unreceptive females'. She compared the amount of sperm transferred by the male fish with a group of males who hadn’t been declawed after they had all mated with receptive or unreceptive females. Ms Kwan said: 'Clawed males transferred up to three times more sperm to unreceptive females compared to declawed males. 'The claw has evolved to benefit the males at the expense of females, and implicates sexual conflict between the sexes in the diversification of the genitalia in this family of fish. 'This provides support that this important selective force is behind an evolutionary pattern that evolutionary biologists have been trying to unravel for over a century.' The research was published in Royal . Society Biology Letter.","Canadian evolutionary scientists say claws are used by the male guppy fish to treble the amount of sperm transferred to reluctant females .

"Forget love and companionship, for one in six men a relationship is dependent on performance between the sheets - and they would leave a partner who failed to satisfy them in bed. Hitting the spot is so important to one in four men and one in five women that they rate having regular orgasms more highly than being in love. But despite how important their sex lives are to their relationships, less than half of Britons admitted they were 'very happy' with how often they orgasm in a recent survey conducted by online retailer bondara.co.uk. It's over: 39 per cent of Brits said failing to reach an orgasm with their partner would be a contributory factor in a break-up . They quizzed 3800 British men and women and found that 16 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women would end a loving relationship if they failed to reach an orgasm with their partner, with a further 39 per cent of men and women stating it would be a contributory factor. Although 60 per cent said they were 'very happy' when asked to rate their relationship in general, this figure fell by 17 per cent for men and 6 per cent for women when asked to rate the sexual side of their relationship. When asked what affected their ability to reach orgasm, tiredness was the most common cause . with 20 per cent of women and 23 per cent of men. Self-esteem . issues ranked second for women followed by 'lack of sexual . desire'. For 15 per cent of men, hitting the booze caused a problem in the . bedroom as being drunk prevented them from climaxing, while job worries affect 12 per cent of men. One in four of those surveyed stated they felt under pressure to reach orgasm every time they have sex. As a result 27 per cent of men and 69 per cent of women have at some point faked an orgasm. Under pressure: One in four said they felt they had to reach an orgasm every time they had sex, leading to 69 per cent of women faking it at least once . Joanna Coker, sex expert for Bondara.co.uk, said couples should try not to get so 'hung up' on achieving an orgasm. She said: 'While having an orgasm is a wonderful part of sex, making love can still be enjoyable without the big 'O'. 'Try not to get too hung up on it as this will only make the situation worse. The ability to have an orgasm is affected by many factors as this survey shows, to be at your sexual peak keep healthy, try not to get overtired and avoid too much alcohol.' Ms Coker added that the old adage of 'never going to bed on an argument' is true if you want a fulfilling sex life and couples shouldn't be afraid to talk to one another about issues between the sheets. 'Misunderstandings . and conflicts can all affect your sexual life; it is hard to feel . carefree and orgasm when you are conflicted or angry with your partner. If you're having difficulties talk about them and try to resolve them, . leaving you freer to relax and enjoy your sex life,' she said. Bondara conducted their research to mark next week's 'National Orgasm Day' and asked respondents worked for them in the bedroom. Relax: Sex expert Joanna Coker said couples should have more fun and not get hung up on achieving the 'big O' For 47 per cent of women, spending more time on foreplay made a difference as well as more oral sex (38 per cent) and introducing sex toys (35 per cent). For men, more oral sex (54 per cent) was a must, followed by spending more time on foreplay (43 per cent), introducing sex toys (42 per cent) and changing sexual positions (38 per cent). A separate survey by Ann Summers revealed how the sex lives of Brits varies around the country. They found that men from the South East, aged between 25-34, who are in a relationship and have sex several times a week, fake an orgasm more regularly than sexually active, male singletons. Men from the South East (17 per cent) are also most likely to fake it compared . to Welsh men (8 per cent) and those who reside in the North East (2 per cent). Meanwhile, women who live in Northern Ireland (6 per cent), Yorkshire (6 per cent) and the North . East (5 per cent) are less likely to fake an orgasm than their southern . counterparts, as the survey revealed that women from South East (18 per cent) and South West (10 per cent) are the biggest fakers. Their poll of 500 people found that when it comes to having the most orgasms – single . men have it the best, with only 14 per cent admitting to faking it compared to . 50 per cent of those in a loving relationship. In contrast for women, married life equals more orgasms, as only 12 per cent pretend in bed compared to 28 per cent of singletons.","For 39 per cent of Brits, inability to orgasm with their partner would contribute to a break-up .

"The mutilated body of an albino toddler has been found in Tanzania with his limbs hacked off, just days after he was taken by machete wielding kidnappers looking to make money from a sick black market trade fueled by a belief in witchcraft. Yohana Bahati's body was found on Tuesday afternoon in a forest area near to his home in the Chato district, in northern Tanzania. His arms and legs had been hacked off, no doubt to be used in potions and charms made by witch doctors for wealthy buyers who believe they will bring luck and riches. Horrendously, some believe the louder the scream when the body part is removed, the more powerful the potion will be. Yohana's mother Ester Jonas, 30, remains in hospital, recovering from the machete blows the kidnappers reined down on her as she desperately tried to protect her son late last Saturday. Horrific: Yohana Bahati's body was found on Tuesday afternoon near to his home in the Chato district, in northern Tanzania, days after machete-wielding kidnappers stole him from his home (stock picture) Albino body parts are worth thousands of dollars in Tanzania, with an entire body being said to fetch up to $75,000 - about £50,000. The lure of the money - a fortune for the average person in the east African country - has left Tanzania's albino population in fear for its life. Indeed, both adults and children are being made to live in special compounds to keep them safe from criminals hired by the witchdoctors to chop off their highly-prized body parts to be used in these potions. Eighteen-month-old Yohana was the latest victim of a string of attacks. Two months ago, four-year-old Pendo Emmanuelle Nandi was taken from her home in Mwanza, which, like Chato, is also on the shores of Lake Victoria. She has never been seen again. Hunted: Tanzania's albinos are being hunted down by people who want use them in potions and charms . In both cases, the fathers of the children were arrested in the wake of the kidnappings - suspected by police of being in some way involved. Police have now stepped up security in the wake of this latest killing 'to ensure no one else is hurt', Geita police commander Joseph Konyo said. Albinos are seen as curses, or 'ghosts' who can be wiped off the face of the earth, in many part of Tanzania, and across Africa. Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, albinism affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. Families are often told to kill the children at birth. Yet, conversely, their body parts are highly prized. But Josephat Torner sees the two as being intrinsically linked. 'The killings and attacks is the outcome of the stigma and discrimination. If you respect me, you won't think of me as a commodity,' he said. Witch doctors claim albino body parts are capable of bringing riches, power and success, if used in potions, while a UN report report into the trade revealed miners used the bone as amulets, or would bury them where they are drilling for gold. Fishermen are said to weave the hair into their nets to help them catch more fish. Children are particularly vulnerable: their innocence is highly valued, and they are not as strong as the adults attacking them. Most of the time, limbs are taken - but the report notes there have been cases where victims were beheaded, genitals, ears, and bits of skin were removed; tongues were cut out and the eyes and the heart gouged out. Other types of attacks reported included rape for healing purposes. Possibly most shockingly, some believe the louder the screams while the limb is removed, the more potent the charm. 'Unfortunately this family resides in a protected forest . area ... so it was extremely difficult for the police to . immediately arrest the suspected robbers,' Konyo said. The added protection will hopefully keep Yohana's two siblings safe, as both are said to have albinism. However, charities  warn the upcoming presidential election is likely to mean attacks and killing increase as people may turn to witchcraft to boost political campaigns. UN country chief Alvaro Rodriguez said he was 'deeply concerned by the abductions of these two young children,' saying that at least 74 albinos have been murdered in the east African country since 2000. 'These attacks are accompanied by a high degree of impunity, and while Tanzania has made efforts to combat the problem, much more must be done to put an end to these heinous crimes and to protect this vulnerable segment of the population,' he added. 'This is the year of elections in Tanzania and, as some analysts have suggested, it could be a dangerous year for people living with albinism.' The Tanzanian government recently announced a crack down on witch doctors who practise this particular kind of 'magic' in an attempt to stop the attacks. But Vicky Ntema, of charity Under The Same Sun, which works to help people with albinism in Tanzania, is skeptical. 'There's absolutely no political will among leaders to end . these macabre killings ... what is so special with these . (traditional) healers to the extent that our leaders ignore . albino killings?' she said. 'Albinism is not a disease. 'People must understand albinos . are normal people like everyone else and the government has a . role to play to ensure this education reaches many people since . most of the killings involve members of the family.' Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000.","18-month-old Yohana Bahati's body found near his home in Tanzania .

"It might not look out of place in a private gym – but for the various straps to keep the occupant in place and the hospital drip stand looming ominously behind. Pictured is the notorious restraint chair at Guantanamo Bay, where former inmates claim they were subjected to long hours of agonising forced feeding. The US military is still using the chair to cope with a hunger strike by 104 of the 166 prisoners which has lasted more than three months. Force-fed: The restraint chair used to force-feed detainees on hunger strike at the detainee hospital in Camp Delta which is part of the U.S. military prison for 'enemy combatants' in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba . Strike: A military doctor holds a feeding tube used to feed detainees - a hunger strike which started with a handful of prisoners, has now become a mass protest with 104 detainees taking part . Legal black hole: The detainee hospital's operating room - Guantanamo, a US military base in Cuba, has previously been criticized as being a legal black hole where inmates have fewer rights than those who are held on mainland US soil . Each day, up to 40 of them are strapped down and kept alive with a liquid nutrient mix fed through a nasal tube. Medical experts have described the . practice as unethical and dangerous, and even Barack Obama has condemned . it, saying in his national security address: ‘Is this who we are? Is . this something that our Founders foresaw?’ But officials insist ‘enteral feeding’ is considered safe and its use has been upheld by the courts. Under the procedure, an inmate who . refuses nine successive meals or whose body weight drops significantly . is offered a twice-daily can of a nutritional supplement, Ensure, whose . flavours include butter pecan. If he refuses, guards shackle him into . the chair by his arms, head and feet, and a nurse inserts the tube up . his nose, down the back of his throat and into his stomach. Necessity: The feeding tube and other items used in the forced feeding of detainees -  the images provide an insight into the conditions that hundreds of detainees have been kept in since the facility opened in 2001 .

Guantanamo, recently described how he wanted to vomit when the feeding . tube was first stuck up his nose. ‘There was agony in my chest, throat . and stomach,’ he said. Ahmed Zuhair, a 47-year-old former . inmate, recently described how four years of being regularly strapped to . what he dubbed the ‘torture chair’ had damaged his back and nasal . passages. Brick wall: Calls for the doctors who force-feed hunger striking prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to refuse to perform the practice on ethical grounds have gotten no traction, a spokesman for the prison said earlier this month . Checks: A U.S. Army Military Police officers check in on detainees during morning prayer at Camp V. Camp V and VI,  are where most of the detainees are held. There is also a third, top secret detention facility called Camp VII or Camp Platinum where 'high-value detainees', including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, are kept . Zuhair, a Saudi former sheep trader . who was never charged with any crime during a seven-year stretch at . Guantanamo which ended in 2009, said his nose would bleed during each . force-feeding. He claims he would be forced roughly into the chair and . left there much longer than the official two-hour maximum. ‘The pain . from each force-feeding is so excruciating that I am unable to sleep at . night because of the pain in my throat,’ he said in a sworn statement.

"Tipple: John Smith's costs just £2.30 in Commons bars, but some MPs say it's too much . MPs want taxpayers to subsidise the cost of their drinks in the bars of Parliament. Prices at the four Palace of Westminster bars are already cheap, especially for central London, as they are linked to those in a nearby Wetherspoons pub. But some MPs, who have a salary of £65,738, feel the £2.60 they pay for a pint of John Smith’s bitter, or £3.20 for premium Becks lager, is too much. Senior MPs have even suggested prices should be tied to a cheaper venue outside of the centre of the capital. The Sun claims to have seen a record of the Administration Committee’s meeting that states: 'Several Members suggested that the House should not benchmark against central London pubs: those had to pay Central London rent, rates and utility charges, which House services did not pay.' Commons catering managers recently asked for prices to rise for the first time in three years due to food inflation. Food and drink are already subsidised with £5.8million a year of public money. The House of Commons operates four venues: the Strangers’ Bar, the Members’ Smoking Room, the Pugin Room and Moncrieff’s. Cheap drinks: MPs enjoy a summer drink on The Commons terrace in this 2002 picture . A Government Freedom of Information website states: 'Selling prices in the House of Commons bars are kept broadly in line with the prices charged in nearby pubs operated by a well-known high-street chain and, in this sense, the prices are not subsidised.' The row broke out after Commons catering managers asked for prices to rise for the first time in three years due to food inflation.

"Former Pakistan cricket star Imran Khan said aid money was being used to make the wealthy wealthier . British aid money is being used to line the pockets of wealthy Pakistanis with links to the country's corrupt regime, minsters have been warned. Former cricket star Imran Khan said Pakistani politicians were syphoning off cash from the multi-million pound budget handed over by the Department for International Development. Mr Khan, head of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party, said the cash was going to those who did not need it and 'never reaches' deserving people. The remaks, to the Sun on Sunday newspaper, come after a report revealed aid spending had done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which get the cash. It examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by British taxpayers and found that the money 'does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries'. The report produced by the TaxPayers' Alliance found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving British aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens. Mr Khan's remarks are likely to further deepen suspicion of aid spending among Tory right-wingers who are unconvinced by David Cameron's commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. The pledge pushed aid spending close to £12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years. The Prime Minister has given his personal support to a LibDem-backed private member's bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means Mr Cameron faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him. Pakistan is one of the biggest recipients of UK aid. Up to £310million is being handed over in the next year, dwarfing last year's £253million. But Mr Khan warned that in Pakistan, corrupt politicians 'have made millions through kickbacks'. The country is rated 37th out of 174 countries on the corruption index. The former cricket star told the Sun on Sunday: 'They are filling their own pockets. DFID and others have played a big role for us but the money has to be used honestly. The British Government and other donors must have a major say in the implementation of proposed projects. 'When I say the DFID money is misused, I mean our system is not using it rightly. The money must be used for welfare projects rather than making billionaires even more rich.' Thousands of Pakistanis took to the streets this year calling for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to step down amid anger over corruption. But Mr Sharif's government continues to receive millions of pounds in UK aid money . Countries: . Afghanistan . Nigeria . Kenya . Somalia . Sudan . Mexico . Russia . Aid spend 2012/13: . £265million . £218million . £111million . £85million . £57million . £5.6million . £1.3million (2010/11) Mr Khan added: 'This is the most corrupt government we have ever had so whatever they get from donors they will try to distribute among their family members or favourites. 'We want more schools, hospitals, small businesses and employment opportunities. This government has to go if we want any change. 'Otherwise the money provided by the DFID and others will only help the rulers and never reach deserving people. They even bribe the media with this money.' Billionaire Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is facing accusations he stole from public coffers, while former president Asif Ali Zardari was twice jailed for corruption — yet remains Pakistan's second-richest person. Less than one per cent of the population pays income tax and only 30 per cent of MPs contribute. A DFID spokesman said Mr Khan's allegations were 'unfounded'. He said: 'Strict financial checks and close monitoring mean aid money only goes to those who need it. 'UK aid is changing Pakistan for the better — for example, 400,000 girls in the Khyber Pakhtunkwa region alone can now go to school because of it. 'Ultimately, this work is in Britain's interest. A thriving, stable Pakistan will help safeguard against terrorism and be a trading partner for the future.'","Khan said Pakistan was abusing multi-million pound UK aid budget .

"It’s easy to lose track of time perusing the planet from the air using Google Earth. From mysterious markings in the Nevada desert, crop circles, religious messages and even corporate logos etched into fields and rocks in Chile, strange sites that only reveal themselves from a birds-eye-view are scattered across the world. Natural phenomena including a heart-shaped lake in Ohio and the ‘Badlands Guardian’ – a strange rippling in the land that looks like a face – in Alberta Canada, are clearly visible from the air. Is this Batman's secret headquarters? A building in Okinawa, Japan seems to show the super hero's symbol on its roof . A collection of the ‘strangest’ sites found on the massive interactive map include man-made wonders such as giant animal carvings in rock and a psychedelic guitar-shaped forest planted in Argentina . A farmer called Pedro Martin Ureta planted 7,000 cypress trees to create the shape in the fertile agricultural region of Argentina's 'Pampas' in memory of his wife. Markings of concentric circles on fields and strange geometric patterns in the desert might have alien believers and conspiracy theorist scratching their heads and looking for information about how the artworks were created. It appears as if people are trying to take advantage of Google Earth as a way of spreading messages, as one site shows that people have carved ‘Jesus loves you’ into the landscape of Idaho, while a Turkish flag is painted onto a hill in Cyprus to make a political point. The 'Badlands Guardian' in Walsh, Alberta, Canada looks a little like a face if viewed from above. A website called Twisted Sifter has collected what it claims are the strangest sites seen on Google Earth . A message from above: People in Boise National Forest, Idaho have used Google Earth to spread the word . Someone in Chile must really love Coca Cola. The logo seems to be sculpted in sandy soil in Arica, Arica y Parinacota, Chile . Corporate logos for Mozilla Firefox and Coca Cola have also been spied from high above the clouds. The sites were curated by website Twisted Sifter, which also collected views of less mysterious locations, such as giant airplane parking lots, a swastika-shaped building in California and huge herds of animals on the run in Tanzania. In the past week it has been revealed that a distinctive circular pattern made from sand in the Egyptian desert is an environmental art installation. Town planners seem to have made a feature of this heart-shaped lake in Columbia Station, Ohio . Presumably not the work of aliens with a penchant for surfing the Web, this Firefox logo is etched into a corn filed in Dayton, Oregon . Is this a human or a cat? This 'big friendly giant'  guards Huara, Tarapacá in Chile . It was spotted from above and some people thought it could be anything from a landing strip for alien spacecraft to an ancient monument to the gods. It appeared in 1997 and has been baffling tourists and users of Google earth ever since. The design, which measures over one million square feet, was created by artists Danae Stratou, Alexandra Stratou and Stella Constantinides to celebrate 'the desert as a state of mind, a landscape of the mind’. This strange pattern can be found in a desert in China and might have alien believers and conspiracy theorists scratching their heads about what it might be and how it was created . This guitar is located in the fertile agricultural region of Argentina's 'Pampas'. The guitar-shaped forest was planted by a farmer called Pedro Martin Ureta in memory of his wife and is made up of 7,000 cypress trees . ‘Desert breath’ features two interlocking spirals, one with vertical cones and the other with conical depressions in the desert floor. It was originally designed with a small lake at its centre, but recent images on Google Maps, show the lake has since emptied. A giant swirling design etched into the Egyptian desert could trick the eye into thinking an alien spacecraft has landed. But the mesmerising pattern is, in fact, the work of three artists . Making a political point: This giant Turkish flag is painted so that it can viewed from the air in Kyrenia, Cyprus .

"The nine skydivers who stared death in the face after two planes they were on collided 12,000 feet in the air said today it hasn't put them off the extreme sport because it is a 'part of who they are'. What was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying jump-for-your-life situation when one Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top of the other - and it was all captured on camera. The experienced skydivers, from Wisconsin, appeared on the Today show as the incredible footage from their helmet cams was played. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders . Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.' Brave: This skydiver describes how me made his way over to the plane that was on fire (while free falling) to see if the pilot was OK . Calm under pressure: Blake the pilot describes flying his plane after the collision and landing it safely which, they joked, was one of his better landings . In one shot, tiny black figures can be made out free-falling through the sky as one of the planes fireballs in the distance, with large chunks of it breaking off. When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders that jumping. 'It's what we do. It's just part of who we are,' they explained. Barry Sinnex revealed he tried to chase the plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the pilot was OK and when he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute. 'Everybody else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said. 'We chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a student.' Patricia Roy said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Obviously not a very funny or appropriate one. But it was all so surreal. 'I thought oh my God they're getting closer. I expected the other plane to move away.' Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash on Saturday fall from the sky after the aircraft accidentally collided, causing one to erupt in flames . Impact: The skydivers were perched on the edge of the plane ready to jump as the other one hit, causing a massive fire bomb . Exact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending two divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft . Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound . behind me, I'll never forget. 'And that's all I could do was try and stay . forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I . was, or thought I could.' Amy Olsen could not contain her . emotions while recounting the collision. Through tears she said she . remembers the pilot screaming at them 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream. It's pretty raw.' Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred. 'Everything was as it should have been,' he said. 'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane. 'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.' Both wings came off the lead plane in the collision and the pilot had to abandon the plane using a parachute on board. He was the only one with reported injuries, suffering from cuts as he exited the burning plane. Watch video here ... Falling: One of the divers tumbles out of the plane just after impact . Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris. 'We're . in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically . down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all . of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody . kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).' All . 11 on board the two planes survived the collision. The only person . injured was the pilot of the lead plane, who was taken to the hospital . for minor injuries. 'He may need some stitches, but he's not seriously hurt,' Mr Robinson said. Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces . Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris . Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground. Mike Plaunt lives in the area and often hears and sees the skydivers, but he noticed something was off about yesterday's jump. 'I . went outside and looked and could see parachuters and a drop plane, and . then there was something spiraling down. I couldn't identify what it . was..it had a trail of smoke and I had never seen that before,' he said. Happy to be alive: Two people hug after all 11 aboard the two planes landed safely . Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well . While . Mr Robinson still doesn't know why exactly the two planes collided, he . believes the lead plane may have created unstable air for the tracking . plane. The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash today. It's . still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they . only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway. Mr . Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of . his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime. 'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.","Footage emerged from the Wisconsin plane crash on the weekend that saw nine skydivers make emergency jumps from their planes after a collision .

"Warning: Mr Fox said Britain was powerless to prevent some 'very unsavoury individuals' entering the country . Liam Fox last night sparked a row with Russia after claiming that the Kremlin was planning to use next year’s London Olympics as cover  to flood Britain with spies. The former Defence Secretary warned that Britain was powerless to prevent some ‘very unsavoury individuals’ entering the country under the guise of protecting Russia’s athletics team. Dr Fox – privy to highly classified material from the intelligence services before he was forced to resign from the Cabinet in October – is one of the most senior political figures to speak publicly about the threat to Britain from Russia’s resurgent espionage activity.  Last night, the Kremlin accused Fox of ‘paranoia’. And in further controversial remarks, Dr Fox criticised the cost of the Games, arguing that the Trident nuclear programme was better value for money. Dr Fox told an audience of Hammersmith and Fulham Conservatives: ‘We face a very large number of FSB agents [Russia’s successor organisation to the KGB]  coming to London during the Olympics, including some very unsavoury individuals. Aerial view of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London. It is thought Russian spies will use the event to collect information about Britain . ‘There’s no way we can do anything about that.

Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian  prime minister Vladimir Putin, . said: ‘We are not concerned about his opinion.

Third best: Dahl, far left, now ranks third in the world of competitive eating as determined by All Pro Eating rankings . Food galore: The student from Wisconsin has already made $18,000 from eating contests . His next competition is scheduled for Saturday where Silo will try to win $1,000 at a national pizza-eating contest on Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dahl has earned more than $18,000 in prize money or merchandise to help pay for his education. ‘I'm eating for my education,’ he told the NY Daily News. ‘It helps me get through.’ Dahl was drawn to competitive eating in 2011 when he went to the former Big Red's Steakhouse in Madison. He didn't want to pay for his meal, so he signed up for a challenge: eat a three-pound cheesesteak sandwich in less than 10 minutes and skip the bill. He finished in 5 minutes, 50 seconds. The first paycheck he got from eating came from Dickey's Barbecue Pit in suburban Minneapolis, where he earned $250 for inhaling nine pulled-pork sandwiches in six minutes.

"President Obama voiced his growing frustration over his administration's handling of the Ebola crisis in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday. Convening his top aides in the Cabinet room after clearing his schedule for the day, the President let it be known how angry he was about how the government had handled key elements of the response. This anger no doubt stemmed from the news earlier that day that not only did a second nurse, Amber Vinson, contract the disease while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan in a Dallas, Texas, hospital, but that she had also been able to board a plan and travel back and forth to Cleveland, Ohio, that weekend, while showing symptoms of a fever.

Big trouble: President Obama berated his aides over their botched response to the Ebola crisis in a metting on Wednesday (above) Not protected: This meeting came after a second nurse who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, Amber Vinson (above), was revealed to have contracted the disease and traveled with a fever . 'This Frontier thing took it out of the abstract thing and to this level where people could identify with and made them scared,' a senior official told the New York Times. The President put things more bluntly in the meeting, telling his aides, 'It's not tight,' while discussing their response efforts. He then placed a majority of the blame over the botched handling of the crisis on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who he felt did not adequately train doctors and nurses at hospital as to proper protective procedures when dealing with a patient who has the disease and who he feels has been providing shifting information about the threat categories certain individuals who may have the disease are in. In an attempt to coordinate the efforts of his administration, it was confirmed on Friday that Obama had appointed Vice President Joe Biden's former Chief of Staff Ron Klain to serve as Ebola czar. And while Klain is a seasoned crisis-response operative, many are hesitant about his new role as he has no actual healthcare experience. Getting serious: Ti step up efforts, Obama has appointed Ron Klain (above), a former Chief of Staff for Joe Biden, as Ebola czar, a role that will have him coordinating the administration's efforts . At the same time, national security adviser Susan Rice is working with other countries including Britain, Germany and France, to try and get them to do more to respond to the outbreak.

She had flown out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 alongside 132 other passengers on October 10 to plan her upcoming wedding. She had then returned on October 13.

Barry Biffle, president of Denver-based Frontier Airlines, emailed employees on Friday to inform them of the CDC's findings. He said the center had assured him crew members are at low risk of exposure. Following Miss Vinson's diagnosis, the airline put the pilots and flight attendants on leave for 21 days, which is considered the longest it would take someone exposed to Ebola to become sick. Mr Biffle added that passengers on both of the nurses' flights have been notified of the latest development. They have been told to monitor themselves for signs of Ebola for the next 21 days. Symptoms include a high fever, vomiting, a headache, joint and muscle aches, a sore throat and general weakness. However, Mr Biffle stressed the risk to passengers was minimal.

"For more than a century, various doctors have put forward the idea women are capable of having two different types of orgasm - clitoral and vaginal. In particular, the differences between what the two types are, as well as the reasons why, have been heavily debated. In a bid to get a definitive answer, French gynaecologists used sonography machines to measure tiny changes in blood flow during external and internal stimulation. The research revealed external clitoral . stimulation does not involve the internal root of the clitoris, but, . vaginal stimulation does involve both the root and the external clitoris - suggesting the two-orgasm theory may be true. Gynaecologists tested the two-orgasm theory using sonography machines. They found external stimulation was not involved with the root of the clitoris, but, vaginal stimulation involved both the root and external clitoris. This suggests different types of stimulation create different sensations, stock image pictured . During the tests, researchers Odile Buisson and Emmanuele A Jannini connected three women to sonography machines. These machines were used to visualise the movements of the clitorourethrovaginal (CUV) complex - the system of clitoral nerves - during both external, direct stimulation of the clitoris, and vaginal stimulation. These measurements were taken use flat and vaginal probes during manual self-stimulation of the . external clitoris, and during vaginal penetration with a wet tampon. As the women stimulated themselves, the researchers used the probes to measure tiny changes in the flow of blood in the area using pulses known as the Doppler signal. The belief that females experience two types of orgasm - clitoral and vaginal - is known as the 'two-orgasm theory.' It was first suggested by Sigmund Freud (pictured right) in 1905 in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. Freud argued clitoral orgasm was an 'adolescent phenomenon', and as women mature and reach puberty, this changes to vaginal orgasm. Freud didn't provide any evidence for his theory and they have been heavily criticised and debated ever since. It is not to be confused with multiple and sequential orgasms. Women can experience more than one orgasm during sex or masturbation. Multiple orgasms are orgasms that occur one after the other, almost immediately. Sequential means orgasms that occur in sequence, but usually minutes apart. The sonography machines and probes, stock image pictured, were used to visualise movements of the clitorourethrovaginal (CUV) complex - the system of clitoral nerves - and blood flow . This revealed external clitoral stimulation did not involve the internal root of the clitoris, but, vaginal stimulation involved both the root and the external clitoris. This affected the flow of blood and therefore was linked to the difference in sensation. Buisson and Jannini said: 'The scans obtained during external stimulation and vaginal penetration demonstrated the root of the clitoris is not involved with external clitoral stimulation. In contrast, during vaginal stimulation - because of the movements and displacements - the whole CUV complex and the clitoral roots in particular were involved. This shows 'functional differences depending on the type of stimulation,' explained the researchers. While 'the [Doppler] signal indicating flow speed in the veins mirrored these anatomical changes.' The researchers concluded that based on these findings, the different reported perceptions from these two types stimulation can be explained by the different parts of the clitoris. The researchers concluded that based on their findings, the different reported perceptions from the two types stimulation can be explained by the different parts of the clitoris, highlighted .","Previous research suggested clitoral orgasms differ from vaginal arousal .

"Hillary Clinton has earned $12 million since departing the State Department last year, according to an analysis of her finances released today. Bloomberg estimates that Clinton has made $6 million from speaking fees and received at least a $6 million advance for her book Hard Choices, putting the former Secretary of State in the top one-hundredth of the 1 percent of earners in America. Clinton's advance is not public and her spokesman did not respond to the news agency's response for a comment, but Bloomberg believes her advance to be close to that amount based on 'industry standards and public records.' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the Starkey Hearing Foundation's 'So the World May Hear' Awards Gala on Sunday, in St. Paul, Minnesota. Clinton gave this speech on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative, of which Starkey is a member . Clinton welcomes Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was honored at the gala. Clinton is back in the media today after an analysis of her fiances found that the former Obama administration official made $12 million since leaving the State Department last year . News outlets have previously placed the advance for Clinton's memoir as high as $15 million - the amount her husband Bill was paid for his 2004 autobiography My Life - and not lower than the $8 million she received for her 2003 memoir, Living History. Bloomberg's review of the presumed presidential candidate's known speaking gigs and usual fee led the organization to determine that Clinton has received approximately $6 million for 27 appearances. That amount includes money Clinton has been paid by eight universities but now claims went to the Clinton Foundation. 'All of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it . to continue its life-changing and life-saving work,' Clinton told ABC News after coming under scrutiny last month by students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for charging the school $225,000 to have her speak. 'So it goes from a . foundation at a university to another foundation,' she claimed. Clinton has not offered evidence to support her claims but a copy of her $275,000 contract with the University of Buffalo for an October 23, 2013, speech that was obtained by the Washington Post last week specifically called for the 'net honorarium' to be directed to the Clinton Foundation. Bill Clinton's has received approximately $106 million to give remarks in his post-presidency. Together, the power couple has earned more than $160 million in the decade after Bill's second presidential term came to an end. Hillary and Bill's finances have been the subject of speculation since Hillary claimed in June that the two were 'dead broke' when they left the White House because of legal fees, mortgages and their daughter Chelsea's schooling. The Clintons have spent the summer trying to explain the comment away but have had little success.","Clinton reportedly earned $6 million in the last year off of speakings gigs .

"The three Afghanistan National Army officers who vanished during a training exercise in Massachusetts on Saturday have been found trying to cross the border into Canada. Major Jan Mohammad Arash, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada and Captain Noorullah Aminyar were stopped at the Rainbow Bridge, which spans New York and Ontario near Niagara Falls, on Monday, sources told NBC News.

Major Jan Mohammad Arash, left, Captain Mohammad Nasir Askarzada, center, and Captain Noorullah Aminyar have been caught trying to cross into Canada after vanishing from a base in Massachusetts . Crossing place: They were caught on the Rainbow Bridge near Niagara Falls as they tried to enter Canada . Before they were found Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick said that they may have been seeking to defect to the United States. The trio, who had been reported missing from Joint Base Cape Cod, were not considered a threat to the public, Massachusetts National Guard spokesman Lieutenant Colonel James Sahady had said. They had been due to take part in U.S. Central Command's Regional Cooperation exercise, which is held every year to foster better cooperation and military readiness between participating countries. The men, who were cleared by the US State Department to participate, had been free to 'come and go' when they weren't taking part in exercises, and on Saturday, they had a free day. 'If they were off-duty, they could go to McDonald's or the mall,' he told Cape Cod Online.

Ed Davis, a security analyst, told CBS it was an 'unusual incident and it needs to be checked out'. 'The only cause for concern is the fact that there have been Afghan soldiers who have turned on their United States counterparts and I'm sure that's on most of the minds of the people doing the investigation,' he said. The Regional Cooperation training exercises have been held annually since 2004 to promote cooperation among forces, build functional capacity, practice peacekeeping operations and enhance readiness.

The men, who are all housed at the base, were taking part in a joint exercise that focused on working on collaboration and tactical strategies with civilians, officers and senior enlisted personnel, Sahady said. Military officials from Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Mongolia - as well as the U.S. - are also at the base as part of the training.

"It's every Harry Potter fan's dream - a real-life Hogwarts is currently being built in China. The enormous new university building in Xinle City, Hebei Province, features a giant clock tower, castle walls and turrets.

But designers say the university is modelled on the architecture of the castles of medieval Europe, rather than Harry Potter's school but the resemblance is startling.

"The Eurozone was back on the brink last night as Spain edged towards a financial disaster that could tear the single currency apart. Analysts said Spain’s huge economy was at a ‘tipping point’ and would inevitably need international aid. In a sign that Europe’s debt crisis is deepening, Italy’s borrowing costs edged higher, Greece was was facing a 1930s-style depression and its austerity measures were said to be faltering. Look of concern: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy attends a plenary session in Madrid . to debate the country's spiralling borrowing costs . Additionally, ratings agencies . threatened to strip Germany of its gold-plated credit rating because of . the risk of the crisis spreading. Treasury officials refused to discuss whether British taxpayers could be dragged into a bailout of Spain. While the Coalition has extracted the . UK from the Eurozone’s bailout funds, a full-blown crisis will probably . mean Spain will also need a loan from the International Monetary Fund, . of which Britain is a leading member. David Cameron is pushing Eurozone . leaders to agree that Germany and other wealthy countries in it, such as . the Netherlands, should stand behind the debts of other countries. Spain has already required an . emergency loan package of up to £80billion to bail out its banks but . that has done nothing to quell concerns about its ability to pay its . way. The country is crippled by a property crash and recession and the . highest rate of unemployment in Europe. Spain’s crucial ten-year bond yield – . the interest rate the government pays to borrow and a key indicator of a . country’s financial health – hit a new euro-era high of 7.6 per . cent. That is deep in the danger zone and well above the 7 per cent level . that triggered bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Despair: A trader during afternoon trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Dismissing worst case scenarios: Mario Draghi said that the eurozone will require greater integration in the long term . Spain is now . paying more to service its debt over six months than countries such as . Slovakia and the Czech Republic pay to borrow over ten years. Sources close to the government were . reported as saying that Spain would need a loan to avoid ‘imminent . financial collapse’ facing the country when it has to cover a further . £22billion of debt in October. The Eurozone was further shaken by . ratings agency Moody’s threat to downgrade the AAA credit ratings of . Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Factory output in Germany and France fell at the fastest rate for more than three years. The euro tumbled against the pound and shares from Madrid to Milan went into reverse. Borrowing costs in Italy also soared as the financial markets bet that it will be the next domino to fall. City analyst Gary Jenkins said. ‘The market is just saying Spain is a done deal, they are going to need a proper full bailout. ‘The danger is if Spain requires a bailout, the market will say Italy is next. And if that happens you have a major problem.’ Europe can ill-afford to rescue Spain – . the fourth largest economy in the single currency bloc – and Italy is . widely seen as too big to save. In Greece, inspectors from the . European Commission and the IMF returned to examine the country’s . finances amid fears that austerity measures being demanded are simply . not achievable. ‘Greece is hugely off track,’ one of the officials said. The Greek prime minister said yesterday that the outlook for the country’s economy is even worse than feared. Antonis Samaras said output could . shrink by more than  7 per cent this year – a far steeper decline than . the 5 per cent fall forecast. The slump will bring the cumulative . economic contraction to a punishing 20 per cent over the past five years . in an echo of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The premier insisted the country will . return to growth ‘at the beginning of 2014’ and said he would seek a . deal ‘as soon as possible’ to water down the cutbacks and reforms . demanded in return for bailout funds.

"Sex tapes have just been given a 21st century makeover thanks to the new Sex with Google Glass app. Forget mirrors on the ceiling or handheld cameras, couples can now use the wearable technology to record their most intimate moments. The app also lets couples see sex through their partner’s eyes by streaming the view from their respective device. Scroll down for video . The Sex with Google Glass app was created at the Wearable Tech Hackathon in London. During intercourse, each partner can stream what their other half is seeing while wearing the headset. A video is recorded throughout and can be replayed for up to five hours before being deleted automatically . Google has previously taken a firm . stance on apps that feature explicit content, and most famously banned . the pornographic app ‘T*** & Glass’ by developers MiKandi. The . app was downloaded from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass . owners on its debut day, while the site was visited by some 10,000 . people before Google pulled the plug. ‘T*** . & Glass’ let viewers browse adult content and, with Glass’s . capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly let . users record and upload their own intimate content – similar to the Sex . with Google Glass app. Maktabi claims people at Google are aware of the project but he has not had an official word from the firm. Sex with Google Glass was developed by Lebanese product design student Sherif Maktabi during the Wearable Hackathon event in London in November. Explaining why he created the app, Maktabi said: ‘We want to change the way people experience things. ‘We love using design and strategy to disrupt at scale. So when we asked ourselves the question ""How can we make sex more awesome with Google Glass?"" We came up with Sex with Glass.' The app is controlled via voice commands. For example, saying ‘Ok glass, it’s time’ begins the recording and streaming process. Wearers can then either film their partner during sex, or swipe the side of the device to change the view and perspective. This includes streaming the footage being recorded by the camera on their partner’s device.

"Drunken: Daniel Cooper, 24, from Holywell in North Wales admitted indecent exposure after he was caught having sex with a Land Rover Discovery . A father who was caught having sex with a Land Rover while on a night out has been banned from going out at the weekend. A court heard how drunken Daniel Cooper, 24, stripped off while out with friends. The father of three was seen urinating in the street before walking down the High Street in Holywell, Wales, with his trousers round his ankles and his t-shirt pulled above his head. He then shocked fellow revellers by walking into a kebab shop and simulating sex with the counter of the takeaway. Married Cooper, described as being a 'caring family man', then dropped to the floor and began doing the same. He then left the shop and gyrated against a Land Rover Discovery that was parked nearby . Cooper says he was so drunk he could not remember what happened - until he was shown the CCTV pictures of his actions. Police arrested jobless Cooper in Holywell town centre on the night of the August 18 following his shocking actions. He told officers he was not used to drinking and had gone out with only £13 in his pocket.

He . was given a three-month community order which bans him from going . outdoors between 7pm and 7am on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights for . the next three months. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs. Speaking in court, prosecutor John Wylde said: 'First of all he was seen to be urinating.

"Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an Orthodox Jewish author and father-of-nine famed for his uniquely progressive approach, has claimed that in Jewish law, 'a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does.' Rabbi Boteach, 47 and based in New Jersey, acknowledges that people tend to see Orthodox Jews as 'frigid and inhibited' but told New York Magazine: 'It’s absolutely not true. Among us religious Jews, sex is a big deal.' He added: 'Oral sex is fine. Anal? Yeah, why not? Sex toys are great. She wants S&M? Sure. What’s wrong with S&M? There’s nothing un-kosher about it.' Scroll down for video . Ladies first: Rabbi Shmuley Boteach (pictured), an Orthodox Jewish author famed for his progressive approach, has claimed that in Jewish law, 'a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does' The controversial Rabbi who released his latest book, Kosher Lust, in May - pointed out that although our 'single years' are generally supposed to be our wildest, marriage should be about 'swinging from chandeliers.' In regards to the rule Rabbi Boteach mentioned about women being required to orgasm before their husbands, its origins trace back to centuries ago, and its motive is not primarily concerned with pleasure. The rule is mentioned in the Gemarra - a compendium of discussions had by Jewish scholars between 200 and 500 A.D. - and was a sex tactic believed to encourage the birth of a boy. Family: Rabbi Boteach, 47, says that although people tend to see Orthodox Jews as 'frigid and inhibited... it’s absolutely not true.' Pictured with his wife Debbie (right) and five of his nine children . Racy: He remarked, 'Oral sex is fine. Anal? Yeah, why not? Sex toys are great. She wants S&M? Sure. What’s wrong with S&M? There’s nothing un-kosher about it' Rabbi Boteach also suggests the missionary position as being the most intimate way for married couples to have sex, although he notes that 'all positions are great.' According to him, Jewish law, as written in a kabbalistic text called The Zohar, requires full-body contact during sex, and for both men and women to keep their eyes open throughout. One line from the Book of Genesis - the first book of the Hebrew Bible - has been interpreted as reading that man and woman were initially created as one body to be split into two. When they were fused, the man and the woman were understood to be facing away from one another. Thus when a man and woman face each other during sex and look into each other's eyes, they perfect creation. Passion: The controversial Rabbi pointed out that although our 'single years' are generally supposed to be our wildest, marriage should be about 'swinging from chandeliers' Playing Cupid: Rabbi Boteach  suggests the missionary position as being the most intimate way for married couples to have sex, although he notes that 'all positions are great' Rabbi Boteach also touched on the Orthodox law that forbids couples from having sex for 12 days every month; five days of menstruation and seven days after. This 'sexual unavailability' apparently drives Orthodox men crazy with 'lust,' which stokes the fires of a passionate marriage. He also argues that because whatever body parts women cover up in public become 'erogenous' by default, Orthodox women, who wear wigs to cover their natural hair, have more of these 'zones.' 'Hair is one of the sexiest things around,' he remarks. 'My wife has beautiful hair, thank God. She wears a wig, in public. But not around me. It’s ours.' Friends in high places: The Rabbi, pictured with former-friend Michael Jackson, says, 'Hair is one of the sexiest things around. My wife has beautiful hair, thank God. She wears a wig, in public' Va va vroom: Rabbi Boteach's use of ancient texts and lesser-mentioned Jewish wisdom to discuss modern sex  has attracted praise as well as criticism. Pictured in 2011 on his motorbike . In Kosher Lust, Rabbi Boteach also advises that couples keep an air of mystery between them to keep their chemistry intact, as too much information can erode at their desire for one another. For example, he recommends that couples shut the door when they go to the bathroom, as ‘obstacles create greater desire.’ Writer: Rabbi Boteach is the author of over 30 books, including this, his latest . He also advises against walking around naked, especially when the other party is engaged with another object - like the TV. Being naked too often will cause the other party to lose interest, and makes it less of a special occasion, he suggests. Rabbi Boteach's use of ancient texts and lesser-mentioned Jewish wisdom to discuss modern sex and marriage has attracted praise as well as criticism. Talking so openly about sexual matters, for example, is not considered to be 'tznius' - which means modest - and thus contradicts an important Jewish value. Rabbi Boteach argues that he is doing the Jewish community a service by encouraging healthy intimate monogamous unions, and doing so in a way that modern people can relate to. The outspoken Rabbi has now authored over 30 books, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show on numerous occasions, and during the 1990s, became a close friend and 'unofficial spiritual adviser' to the late Michael Jackson. He lives with his wife Debbie Boteach and his nine children.","According to ancient Jewish scripture, ensuring women climaxed before men was believed to spark the birth of a boy .
