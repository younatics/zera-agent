"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A surgeon has been stood down after allegedly cutting out a patient’s healthy testicle and removing the wrong kidney from another. Urologist Antonio Vega Vega was suspended from operating at Rockhampton Hospital in central Queensland after authorities were alerted to four separate cases of surgical malpractice since late 2011. Rockhampton Hospital’s acting director of medical services and director of surgery were also suspended, Queensland Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said. Suspended: Urologist Antonio Vega Vega was stood down from Rockhampton Hospital in central Queensland after allegedly botching four operations since 2011. Pictured is a file photo of a surgeon in an operating room . Tough penalties: Dr Vega Vega, as well as Rockhampton Hospital's director of surgery were suspended following the cases of malpractice . The Health Service Board became concerned by comments made by a coroner about local health services and commissioned a review by Vanguard Health. That review highlighted three cases of negligence by Dr Vega Vega –including him removing a healthy testicle in one patient, the wrong kidney in another, and nicking an artery in a third. Board chairman Charles Ware said one of the patient’s involved had to be transported to Brisbane for follow-up care after surgery by Dr Vega Vega. ‘It would appear that an artery was nicked during surgery but not detected, and (the patient) later re-presented to hospital with quite substantial blood loss,’ Mr Ware told Fairfax Radio. A fourth case occurred late last month, before the urologist was stood down. Dr Vega Vega has also voluntarily stood aside from his private work at the Mater Hospital following the allegations. He could not be contacted by the MailOnline. Malpractice: Dr Vega Vega allegedly cut out a man's healthy testicle and the wrong kidney in another patient. Pictured is a stock photo of a man holding a surgical instrument . Mr Springborg said an independent inquiry had been launched into the four cases, while Rockhampton Hospital and the Health Service Board would undertake another review. ‘Systems to protect patients from botched surgery are fundamental to clinical practice,’ he told parliament. Dr Vega Vega graduated from a Spanish university in 1988 and completed specialist training as a urologist in 1996. A year later, he obtained European registration. He also acquired a PhD with honours in 2001 and attained his Australian qualifications in 2011 after two years of follow-up training. Dr Vega Vega had previously worked at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital and Nambour Hospital.

"By . James Chapman . The controversial scheme to make mortgages cheaper is expected to be reined in within months amid concerns that the housing market is in danger of overheating. Chancellor George Osborne said the Bank of England was vigilant about the rising cost of property in many areas and would intervene if needed. He was responding to an international report that Britain's booming housing market was becoming a threat to economic recovery. Scroll down for video . Overheating? New figures have revealed house prices increased at the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis last month . With prices rising at up to 10 per cent a year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was a danger that people were borrowing more than they could ever pay back. The OECD – a respected international think-tank – also said housebuyers should be required to put down larger deposits. House prices increased at the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis last month, though they remain below their pre-crisis peak in some areas. The Bank initially dismissed the suggestion that the market was overheating. But last week one of its deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe, hinted it was time to address the impact of Help to Buy on the sharp rise in prices. The OECD urged the Bank to tighten access to Help to Buy funds, which provides guarantees for mortgages in an attempt to help first-time buyers into the market. Cutting the maximum purchase price under Help to Buy to £300,000 from £600,000 would address concerns that it is fuelling a house price bubble, senior figures believe. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said the Bank of England was vigilant about the rising cost of property in many areas and would intervene if needed . It is feared under Help To Buy there is a danger that people were borrowing more than they could ever pay back . The latest figures show that the average cost of a house bought using the scheme's mortgage guarantee is £148,048. The North West and Scotland are the  most popular areas for Help to Buy, and the scheme is overwhelmingly benefiting first-time buyers. Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed that backing purchases of up to £600,000 risks overheating the property market, and is understood to be planning to discuss the issue with Bank governor Mark Carney in the next few weeks. The scheme guarantees £130billion of mortgages and is available for loans of between 80 and 95 per cent of the property's value. So for someone able to muster a five per cent deposit, the Government is putting in up to 15 per cent, enabling the homebuyer to access an 80 per cent mortgage. If a property is repossessed, the Government will bear a proportion of the losses, with the lender taking the rest. Ministers insist there is no evidence that Help to Buy is fuelling the rise in house prices, though several lenders, including Nationwide and Halifax, report higher demand triggered by the scheme encouraging the housing market recovery. Senior Liberal Democrats claim that the Chancellor is prepared to see the housing market overheat in the run-up to next year's General Election, boosting economic confidence and increasing the chances of a Tory victory. Mr Osborne, said in Brussels yesterday: 'I've said we should be vigilant about the housing market and this government has given the Bank of England the powers, the tools to do that in an independent way.' The Chancellor added: 'That didn't exist before but we've learnt from the mistakes of the last Government and the Bank of England has the tools and independence to do what it feels it needs to do to help to  contribute to building that resilient economy.' The OECD also suggested another possibility was to require homebuyers to once again put down larger deposits, suggesting 'the introduction of higher capital requirements or low maximum loan-to-value ratios for mortgages'. The new financial watchdog created by  the Coalition, the Financial Conduct  Authority, has already introduced  tougher questions about the lifestyle of  mortgage applicants. Forensic questions about customers' regular outgoings – including childcare costs, gym membership and even haircuts – could be included in affordability checks. Lenders should also test the ability of the family's finances to withstand a rise in interest rates. Brokers have warned that the changes could lead to delays and unfair rejections of applications.","Chancellor George Osborne said the Bank of England was vigilant .

"By . Leon Watson . A teenage girl whose family claimed she was bullied to death by cyber-bullies after she committed suicide probably trolled herself, an inquest heard today. Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged in her bedroom by her older sister at her home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on August 2 last year. Her father David Smith, 45, maintained that his daughter was driven to suicide by internet bullies posting vile messages on social networking site AskFM. Detectives believe troubled Hannah Smith, 14, sent herself abuse messages on ask.fm, before hanging herself last August at the family home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire . Dozens of abusive anonymous messages were found on Hannah's Ask.fm profile following her death - raising fears she had been targeted by trolls . But a police investigation into the . death uncovered no evidence that she was the victim of internet . bullying, an inquest has been told. Asked . by Leicester and South Leicestershire coroner Catherine Mason if there . was 'any evidence' that Hannah Smith was subjected to cyber-bullying, . Detective Sergeant Wayne Simmons said: 'No, there isn't.' Det . Sgt Simmons, of Leicestershire Police, added that on the 'balance of . probabilities' the 'vile' messages about Hannah on the social media site . were posted by the teenager herself in the run-up to her death on . August 2 last year. The inquest heard that Hannah had been attacked at a party in the months leading up to her death. At the hearing at Leicester Town Hall, her father David Smith said his daughter had been bullied for some time and that he believed her eczema had been the reason she was targeted, adding that she would try to avoid getting changed in front of classmates. Describing his daughter as 'self-confident', he said that after attending a party in March 2013, she was attacked by a former friend and afterwards 'her behaviour seemed to change' from that of a 'bubbly, happy' person to a more introverted young girl. The coffin of Hannah Smith being carried by father (Blue polo shirt) Dave at her funeral . Mourners were asked to wear onesies at Hannah Smith's funeral . Flowers outside the family home where Hannah Smith was found dead . 'She went to a party and had her head smashed against a wall, twice,' Mr Smith told the coroner. He . said his daughter, who attended Lutterworth High School, had also taken . to spending more time in bed and was late for class about once a week . but he put this down to her being what he jokingly referred to as 'a . lazy teenager'. Mr Smith . said he had also spoken to his daughter about self-harming, but she had . never raised the subject of wanting to take her own life. Hannah's older sister Joanne Smith said on one occasion she had 'ripped out the hair' of a person she believed was bullying her sister at school and said her younger sibling had been targeted throughout years seven, eight and nine. She added that whenever there was trouble, Hannah or her friends would alert her and she would 'deal with it'. Describing the night of her sister's death, Miss Smith, 17, said she had been out late with friends and on arriving home had invited them all in. David Smith, father of Hannah Smith, with his daughter Jo, outside their home in Lutterworth . They then decided to go and wake Hannah as a prank. 'My friend opened her bedroom door and said the little light was on but he couldn't see her,' said Miss Smith. 'We thought 'she's got to be around, and she'll probably jump out around the door and scare us'. 'Then I turned around and saw her.'

"By . Steph Cockroft . It's a remote-controlled machine which drives like a normal truck - but takes off and lands like a helicopter. Now the Black Knight Transformer, a 'multicopter' designed for the U.S. military, has been seen in action for the first time. Advanced Tactics, the company behind the machine, has released a video showing the unmanned transformer flying through the desert. Scroll down to video . The Black Knight Transformer, which is capable of both flying and driving, has been show in action for the first time . Advanced Tactics, which were commissioned by the U.S Army to design the machine, released the video showing the transformer on its first flight . The 'multicopter' is seen driving through the desert before the rotors are sprung out for take off . The machine is designed to fly up to 150mph in the air and can be flown using a remote control . In the clip, the eight rotor blades are sprung out for take off, allowing the machine to cruise at up to 150mph in the air. The blades then fold back in while the truck is used for off-road driving. The transformer was built as part of a U.S. military desire for a . 'multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air . vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle', according to Pop Science. Essentially it meets the need of an automobile that can adapt to a variety of situations. An American government study on medical evacuation concluded that the use of robots in military missions would allow for casualty evacuations in areas and times that manned platforms should not operate in, such as 'zero-zero' weather and contaminated environments. Once the Black Knight reaches its target, its also possible for the controls to be switched and for it to be driven by a human. Overall, it reduces the risks involved with many missions. The Black Knight is also designed for cargo delivery. The video shows the view from inside the remote-controlled vehicle . It also shows how the machine is driven like a normal off-road vehicle . The transformer was tested by the company in February and the video clip showing it in action has now been released . The transformer was built to create 'a multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle/unmanned ground vehicle' Advanced Tactics, based in El Segundo, tested the remotely-operated, transforming, flying, driving evacuation vehicle earlier thsi year. 'The U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is interested in using the Black Knight vehicle for unmanned cargo resupply missions,' Advanced Tactics chief engineer Rustom Jehangir tells Popular Science. 'They've done work on this in the past with other platforms, such as the Lockheed Martin K-Max, but our platform will be much less expensive.' The driving components were tested in late 2013, while the flying aspects were tested in February. The video has only just been released. The U.S. military commissioned the creation of a vehicle that can drive and fly remotely so it can be sent on missions unmanned . 'Multicopter' takes flight on a test run . It utilizes the vertical take off and landing of a helicopter and couples it with the off road driving capabilities of a truck . This artist's impression by the developer Advanced Tactics showed what they intended the AT Transformer to look like . The Black Knight Transformer would allow the military to enter and exit dangerous areas without having to send in soldiers . In November, it was reported that U.S. soldiers in combat had made a request for drones that could be launched by hand. It prompted the Pentagon to commission three dozen micro-drones that resemble birds. Prioria Robotics of Florida announced at the time the US Army Rapid Equipping Force, or REF, awarded them $4.5 million in federal contracts to deliver to the Department of Defense 36 models of the company’s Maveric unmanned aerial vehicle by December. The Advanced Tactics Black Knight Transformer - reportedly the world's largest 'multicopter' - has been designed for autonomous casualty evacuation and manned or unmanned cargo resupply missions . Creators Advanced Tactics tested the transformer's flight earlier this year . Each Maveric can soar through the sky at speeds up to 55 knots and has the ability to offer soldiers an array of advantageous features. Each aircraft weighs roughly two-and-a-half pounds, and according to the Army News Service, the Maveric's flexible wings help enable the UAV to blend into its surroundings. Then in December, the army successfully tested a futuristic laser weapon capable of shooting football-sized mortar rounds. In November, the Pentagon ordered 36 drones known as 'Mavericks' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions . During tests, a 'quarter-sized' invisible . laser beam successfully targeted and destroyed more than 90 incoming . mortar rounds and six to seven unmanned drones. The truck-mounted weapon, known as the High Energy Laser Mobile Demonstrator (HEL MD), gives a hint at what a weapon of the future could look like. Using an invisible laser beam to exact targets, the rounds are capable of taking down drones from the sky and even missiles. In November, the Pentagon ordered 36 drones known as 'Mavericks' that could be hand launched and were fitted with cameras for reconnaissance missions . Terry Bauer, the project manager for the laser program, told ABC News the test results were 'above and beyond' what they had expected going into the testing. 'We had no thoughts that this 10-kilowatt would be as successful in doing that as it has been,' he said. Mortars are common battlefield weapons that are hard to protect against because they can be fired from short distances. The mortars used in the test were standard 60 millimeter rounds – the length of a football — fired from a distance of less than two kilometers in salvos of two to three mortar rounds each. The laser’s success rate against incoming mortar shells indicates that battlefield protection from the small explosive rounds could be possible in a few years.","The Black Knight Transformer is capable of both flying and driving .

"By . Ted Thornhill . She may be a heavyweight politician, but Angela Merkel has never looked so lightweight. Her noticeably slimmer figure is apparently down to observance of a strict new diet. The result is that she has lost around one and half stone, with pictures of her taken this year and last highlighting the difference her perseverance has made. Now and then: Angela Merkel looking much slimmer in 2014, left, compared to October 2013, right . The previously favoured cheese and sausage sandwiches and biscuits are now strictly off limits, with the German Chancellor, 59, now munching on fruit and vegetable snacks instead, according to Germany's Bild newspaper. A story it ran this week asked why Mrs Merkel was looking so slim – and quoted White House correspondents who said that she was looking ‘much more fresh and sporty’ during her visit to the U.S capital last week. She has reportedly asked for any tempting sandwiches and biscuits to be put beyond arm’s reach. Bild said: ‘At meetings, she now has a bowl full of raw chopped carrots, red and green peppers and leeks sitting in front of her. She has given instructions that the plates full of sandwiches for other members of her party should be taken out of her reach.’ Go figure: Mrs Merkel's look in September 2013 in Berlin . Her will power drew praise from Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner, who guided Mrs Merkel on a South Tirol hiking trip last summer. He claimed that she could walk for six hours without stopping for food. During Mrs Merkel's visit to the White House she and President Barack Obama put their differences over the U.S.'s spying program aside and threatened tougher and broader new sanctions against Moscow if it doesn't quickly change its disruptive behavior in Ukraine. 'We will not have a choice but to move forward with additional more-severe sanctions' if Russia disrupts a presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for May 25, Obama said at a news conference with Merkel outside the White House early Friday afternoon. This was the first time the two world leaders had met since the Edward Snowden document leak that revealed the U.S. National Security Agency had been listening to Merkel's personal cell phone calls for more than a decade. In October, Obama promised that the U.S. was no longer hacking her personal calls. That courtesy does not apply to other residents of Germany, including other German officials, however.","White House reporters noted that Merkel looked 'sporty and fresh'

"By . Lizzie Parry . and Anna Hodgekiss . The family of a five-year-old who died of a rare blood disorder just weeks after suffering flu-like symptoms are today urging other parents to learn more about the condition. Violet Mornington first fell ill on her fifth birthday. Within weeks she died, after doctors diagnosed the extremely rare Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which leads to too many white blood cells attacking the body. Doctors prescribed her antibiotics fearing she had tonsillitis, but were left baffled when her condition continued to deteriorate. By the time medics discovered Violet was suffering from the rare condition, it was too late. Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday. Just weeks later, she had died from a rare blood disorder called Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) Kerry Mornington and her husband Ivan have urged other parents to be aware of the signs and symptoms of the rare blood condition that claimed their daughter's life . Today her parents Kerry, 47, and . Ivan, 37, have urged other parents to learn more about the disorder . which claimed their young daughter's life. Mrs Mornington, from Fradley, Staffordshire, described the all-consuming grief after losing Violet. She said the family have established a charity in her daughter's name to help others facing similar bereavement. Violets . in Bloom, which Mrs Mornington says has given her 'something to live . for', aims to help other parents who have lost children, raise awareness . of blood disorders and encourage more standard testing. 'When . a child dies there are no positives to come from it,' said Mrs . Mornington. 'There is no reasoning ‘why?’ - it shouldn’t happen. 'It is . against the natural order of things. 'It is not like any other grief. It is like being lost at sea and the waves keep smashing you against rocks.' She added: 'She’d always been a fighter and had a strong and determined personality. Violet's parents Kerry and Ivan said they assumed she was simply suffering from a cold. She was later diagnosed with tonsillitis but her symptoms continued to deteriorate . Mr and Mrs Mornington described their daughter as a' fighter' with a 'strong and determined personality' 'She was a real tomboy, too, and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas. 'She refused to wear dresses from the . age of three and she loved unusual music - we played Depeche Mode’s . Just Can’t Get Enough at her funeral as it was one of her favourite . songs.' Violet's parents, who both work as benefits officers, first became worried about the youngster on the day she turned five. The rare disorder baffled doctors, who diagnosed tonsillitis and suspected leukaemia. Her father recalled: 'It was a Monday . and Violet went to school as normal but when she came home, she said . she didn’t feel too well. 'We went for a quiet meal but throughout she looked pale. We thought she was exhausted from celebrating her birthday at school. 'But over the next couple of days you could tell she wasn’t herself. She was still pale, tired and had a temperature. We put it down to a cold. 'We had a party planned for her on the Saturday. It was the first time we’d decided to throw a big do and had booked the local village hall, with a DJ and bouncy castle. 'We were debating whether to cancel it, but by the Friday, she had picked up so decided to go ahead. 'For the first half of it she was . really energetic and jumping on the bouncy castle. But then she got all . shivery and we gave her some Calpol. She did pick up a little bit later . on.' After repeated GP visits, Violet's desperate parents took her to A&E, where doctors suspected she had leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital . Mrs Mornington said her family are determined to do something positive to celebrate Violet's memory, revealed they have started a charity, Violet in Bloom, to help other families facing similar bereavement . That day, Violet's father took her to see the nurse at their GP practice as she was too unwell for school. He . was told she had tonsillitis and Violet was given antibiotics. But . instead of improving, she got worse and later that week she saw the . doctor. Again, her parents were told it would probably clear up. The family went back and forth to see their GP over the next three weeks, but still there was no diagnosis. In desperation, the couple took her to A&E. More tests and scans were carried out and the next day the couple were told the youngster had suspected leukaemia. She was transferred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital where a bone marrow biopsy was done. 'Violet . was becoming more and more distressed because of all the tests being . done,' said Mrs Mornington. 'She was very upset and it was heartbreaking . to see her like that. 'She . would suffer from raging temperatures which was one of the symptoms of . HLH, but of course we didn’t know at that point it was the disorder.' Eventually . doctors ruled out leukaemia, and finally, tests found that she had the . Epstein-Barr Virus, which had led to Hodgkins Lymphoma. Mr Mornington, who has a daughter Beth, 19, from another relationship, said that Violet was given steroids - but her condition deteriorated. Violet as a baby with mother Kerry (left) and right, shortly before she died. Her mother said: 'She was a real tomboy - and when she passed away at the hospital we dressed her in her favourite Spiderman pyjamas' Hemophagocytic . Lymphohistiocytosis was finally diagnosed but, although Violet started showing some signs of improvement after going through three lots of chemotherapy, it was short-lived as she started suffering from serious respiratory problems. Doctors were then forced to put her into an induced coma. 'It was like a whirlwind,' added Mrs Mornington, who has twins Molly and Caitlin, aged 16, and Matt, 26, from her first marriage. On July 20 last year the couple were told to get some rest and were staying in the hospital’s nearby facility for relatives. But they were woken at 5.55am the next day by a call telling them Violet had deteriorated. Mrs Mornington added: 'We rushed to . the hospital and saw Violet hooked up to so many machines. Doctors told . us that she was very poorly and didn’t think she would get through it. 'Later . that day, we were told she wouldn’t pull through and that they could . take away all the machines so that we could spend some time with her to . say goodbye. 'At this point . she wasn’t suffering, but it was heartbreaking to watch her go through . this. 'We decided to spend time with her, and we had 30 precious minutes . giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped . away.' Violet, here with father Ivan, . was finally diagnosed with HLH, and underwent three rounds of chemotherapy. But she began to suffer from serious respiratory problems and doctors were forced to put her into an induced coma . Since Violet’s death the couple, along with their other children, have been trying to raise more awareness about the condition. Her father explained: 'We want people . out there to know about HLH and what it can do and how quickly it can . strike. GPs don’t seem to be aware, and if it is something they are . taught about then it can only help other sufferers. 'I’ve . read up on the condition and if it’s treated within four weeks of being . detected, then you can save the person’s life. When we first took . Violet to the doctors, she probably had it then. But because they didn’t . know about the disorder it went undetected.' In April they came up with the idea to create a memorial garden, under the banner of their Violets in Bloom charity. The initial project will cost up to £15,000 and will allow families who have lost their children to use the garden to remember them with their own space or plaque. 'This is trying to find something positive from what has happened,' Mrs Mornington said. 'We want a lasting memorial to her legacy - something that will be there forever. 'In the beginning it was soul-destroying trying to find the perfect place for her. Violet's mother said: 'Before she died, we had 30 precious minutes giving her cuddles and telling her we loved her before she slipped away.' The family are now trying to raise more awareness about Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) 'And then we thought if we are going through this then there are other bereaved parents in North Birmingham and around Lichfield going through the same. 'We didn’t want it in a church yard, as we didn’t want it to feel like a grave. And we didn’t want religion coming into it - we just wanted it to be about kids and parents.' Having faced losing their treasured daughter, Mrs Mornington says she hopes her experience will help others. She said: 'In the first few weeks after Violet passed away we were literally on our own. 'I am sure it is the same for other parents. In the hospital you are surrounded by a network - people looking after your children, psychiatrists, MacMillan Cancer Nurses, all kinds of support. 'Then you get home and you’re all alone. That feeling is so frightening. The counselling starts a few weeks later, but suddenly you have to cope. 'Even things like finding money for a funeral. A lot of ours was paid for and we had some savings for the rest, but what if you don’t have savings? 'Those are the kind of people we want to be able to help, and we have lots of ideas about how we can.' Mrs Mornington added: . 'There isn’t a minute that goes by where we don’t think about her. Her . legacy for us is to help others and stop this happening again. We want . to do this to keep her memory alive. It was too late for us but . hopefully it won’t be for other families.'","Violet Mornington first began suffering from symptoms on her fifth birthday .

"By . Sam Webb . Jordan Blackford amazed medics with his miracle recovery after he was almost killed in a car crash. But five months after the smash the teenager, from Walker, Newcastle, is still in hospital because of a mystery condition. The 14-year-old's hopes of returning home hit a setback when he was diagnosed with a liver problem while being treated for his injuries. Brave: Jordan Blackford was lucky to escape an horrific car crash with his life - but is being forced to stay in hospital by an unrelated mystery liver condition . Survivor: Jordan fights for life in intensive care after getting knocked over by a car . But while the youngster may be frustrated at not being able to go home, the family who came so close to losing him are just delighted he is still with them. His father Terry, 47, said: 'He's been doing great. He's absolutely fantastic now. He talks and walks and everything. 'Of course he's bored and frustrated and wants to get out but we are over the moon. It's like a huge weight has been lifted off our shoulders. 'We just take one day at a time now.' Jordan with his mother Shellie, sister Naomi, 9 and brother Jake, 6. The family says they are just taking each day as it comes . Jordan's family feared they had lost him after he was hit by a car near his home on December 21. He was flung into the air and suffered a serious head injury in the incident.

The family had hoped that they would have him home by now. Adults have 50 and 80 milligrammes of copper in their body, mostly in muscle and the liver. Copper helps make melanin, bone, and connective tissue and helps with many other processes in the body. It is absorbed through the diet, in foods like liver, seafood and beans. Various medical problems can disrupt normal copper levels, causing the sufferer to have too little copper, a condition called copper deficiency, or too much copper, called copper toxicity. With certain conditions, copper builds up in the liver, brain, eyes, and other organs. Over time, high copper levels can cause life-threatening organ damage. However, doctors treating his injuries at the Royal Victoria Infirmary have now discovered a problem with the levels of copper in his liver. 'He's got a problem with his liver that actually had nothing to do with the accident, but if that hadn't have happened we wouldn't have know about it,' Mr Blackford said. 'The consultant said it's not life-threatening. But they need to know exactly what it is before they can treat it and he can go home.' With no discharge date in sight the Jordan is now beginning lessons at the hospital in a bid to help him catch up with the work he has missed. Terry added: 'He's going to go to a residential school which is part of the hospital now as because of his head injury he won't learn as well as other people will. Once he gets there they think he will come on even quicker.' A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He is currently on police bail.","Jordan Blackford made amazing recovery after life-threatening smash .

"By . Damien Gayle . Dennis Rodman has denied reports that North Korean despot Kim Jong Un had his own uncle executed in a purge. The former NBA star, known in the past for his tattoos, piercings and wild behaviour, and now for his bizarre friendship with Kim, insisted in an interview the uncle was still alive.

"By . David Mccormack . Prince, once the undisputed king of sleazy pop, has vowed that he will no longer use rude words in his music. The singer, who turns 56 next month, features on the cover of June’s Essence and told the magazine that he had decided once and for all that it is disrespectful to use bad language in front of women and children. ‘Did you ever hear Muhammad Ali curse?’ he said. ‘Would you curse in front of your kids? To your mother? Marsha [Ambrosius], Lianne [La Havas], Janelle [Monae] … They’re all my sisters. We shouldn’t curse at them. We need to treat all of them, and all people, like royalty.’ Mind your language: Prince has vowed that he will no longer use rude words in his music because it is disrespectful to women and children . In his 80s heyday Prince was notorious for using fruity language in a host of sexually explicit songs including Erotic City, Head, Darling Nikki, Come, ***y Control and Scarlet ***y. His 1992 single Sexy M.F. caused controversy with its chorus line ‘You sexymotherf****r’ and an edited version, ‘Sexy Mutha,’ had to be created for radio and the music video. But since becoming a Jehovah's Witness in 2001, Prince has avoided playing any of his old songs that feature dirty words. The singer recently signed a deal with his old label Warner Bros. Records to digitally re-master and re-release his classic albums. In his 80s prime, left, Prince was renowned for his sexually explicit songs and liberal use of swear words, but he has told Essence, right, that that is all in the past . A 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of Purple Rain is expected later this year and it isn’t known if the singer will go as far as bleeping the swear words on it. Album track Darling Nikki was about a young girl masturbating in a hotel lobby, while Erotic City - the B side of Let’s Go Crazy - featured liberal use of the F-word. It was hearing her daughter listen to Darling Nikki in 1985 that prompted Tipper Gore, wife of then Sen. Al Gore, to go before Congress to urge warning labels for records marketed to children. The industry developed the Parental Advisory labels as a result. Prince is scheduled to release his 33rd album, Plectrum Electrum, later this year. A 30th-anniversary deluxe edition of Purple Rain is expected later this year and it isn't known if the singer will go as far as bleeping the swear words on it . Despite burying the hatchet with his old record company, Prince still has some strong feelings about record company executives. In Essence, dubbed the Prince After Dark issue, Prince criticizes the heads of major labels, who he says are always at the beach. 'Middle of the afternoon. What are you doing? ""Oh, I’m at the beach with my kids,'"" he told the magazine. 'So we’re working to send their kids to college. And to the beach. We’re not supposed to accept that.'","The singer has vowed that he will no longer use rude words in his music because it is disrespectful to women and children .

"By . Associated Press . Four men have been indicted on charges alleging they kidnapped and tortured two men they suspected of stealing drugs and money from a St. Paul 'stash house,' federal prosecutors announced Tuesday. The kidnappers released their victims, but not before nearly severing one victim's finger while interrogating him in the house, court papers allege. State prosecutors say the house was controlled by a Mexican drug cartel, though court documents don't say which one and federal prosecutors declined to comment. The kidnappers released their victims, but not before nearly severing one victim's finger while interrogating him in the house, court papers allege . All four were indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. One was also indicted on one count of using a gun during a drug crime. 'The allegations in the indictment are a frightening reminder of the violent capabilities of drug traffickers,' U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said in a statement. The indictment unsealed Tuesday and other court papers say the four men suspected the victims stole or knew who stole about 30 pounds (13 kilograms) of methamphetamine and $200,000 from the stash house last month. It names Jesus Ramirez, 31, of Los Angeles; Jonatan Delgado Alvarez, 22, of Los Angeles; Juan Ricardo Elenes Villavazo, also known as Chapo, 32, of St. Paul; and Antonio Navarro, also known as Tony Sanchez, 19, of St. Paul. The defendants released the victims after determining they didn't know what happened to the drugs, the documents say. Navarro and Alvarez were arrested outside the house April 15. Ramirez was arrested after a police chase in the Los Angeles area April 17. Villavazo remains at large, the U.S. attorney's office said. The indictment alleges Navarro and Villavazo ran the stash house, and that Ramirez and Alvarez flew from Los Angeles on April 14 to try to recover the stolen meth or enough cash to cover it. It alleges they kidnapped two men from behind a Minneapolis residence and beat them, held a gun to their heads, and threatened to kill them and their families. Court papers allege Villavazo tried to cut off one victim's left little finger with scissors, causing him to pass out, while the others held him down. The documents say the victim later underwent surgery but that it was unclear if he would regain the ability to move his finger. State kidnapping and other charges filed last month against Navarro, Ramirez and Delgado are on hold pending the outcome of the federal case, said Dennis Gerhardstein, spokesman for the Ramsey County attorney's office. Attorney Anthony Deutz represented Ramirez on the state charges. He declined to comment specifically on the federal charges but added 'I think he got caught up in this and that he was not involved.' It wasn't immediately clear if Delgado or Navarro had lawyers. All four defendants face a potential maximum of life in prison if convicted on the drug count, while Ramirez also faces a potential a minimum of seven years for allegedly using a gun to kidnap and threaten the victims, according to the U.S. attorney's office.","Two men suspected of stealing drugs were kidnapped and tortured .

"By . Mark Duell . Let off with a fine: Jeremy Sutton with his Saluki dog Clement, which attacked a seven-year-old boy . The mother of a schoolboy whose face was savaged by a dog today criticised the ‘soft’ court sentence given to its Labour activist owner. Jeremy Sutton’s Saluki dog Clement attacked the seven-year-old child on the street near his home in Levenshulme, Manchester. It left the boy with serious wounds to his face and lip and a lost front tooth - putting him in hospital for a week and leaving lifelong scars. But appearing at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, 64-year-old Sutton was given a conditional discharge after admitting having a dog dangerously out of control last July. Sutton was chair of Levenshulme Labour Party, but resigned on the day he pleaded guilty. He was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to the youngster and £500 to his parents. The court imposed a raft of conditions that saved Clement from being put down. Now, the boy’s mother has spoken out against the sentence. She said: ‘I do think the dog should be put down so it doesn’t happen to other children. I’m not bothered about compensation - this is about my son and other children. ‘My son has not been the same since the accident. He seems to have lost confidence. He used to be very outgoing about playing outside but ever since the attack he won’t go beyond the garden. ‘He still gets very panicky around dogs and he often sees the dog that attacked him in the park. Often in the morning he’s very shaky, so I think he’s having nightmares about what happened. Attack: The youngster was playing outside when he approached Sutton and his dog, a Saluki - a hunting breed. His mother said the first she knew was the sound of her son's scream . ‘He talks about not wanting it to happen to other children.’ The boy, who can’t be identified for legal reasons, added: ‘I am okay with puppies but I don’t like big dogs any more. I’d like the dog that bit me to go away.’ The youngster was playing outside when he approached Sutton and his dog, a Saluki - a hunting breed. His mother said the first she knew was the sound of her son’s scream. She added: ‘When you hear the scream and you just know that’s your child it’s terrifying. There was blood everywhere, all over his face. He was in hospital for a week.’ The boy, who needs ongoing dental treatment, may also need a further operation on his lip. 'My son has not been the same since the accident. He seems to have lost confidence. He used to be very outgoing about playing outside but ever since the attack he won’t go beyond the garden' Boy's mother . At the hearing, Sutton’s solicitor Patrick Regan said the dog had been on a lead and had acted completely out of character and Sutton could not have foreseen the incident. The court heard that a behaviour expert described the dog as a ‘well-balanced animal’. The conditions Sutton will have to adhere to include the dog being muzzled and on a lead in public, and muzzled in the house when children under 16 are present. The dog can also not enter the area used by the boy. If Sutton fails to comply with the conditions, then the dog can be put down. Passing sentence, Chairwoman Catherine Beavis said ‘This was a very nasty incident which has left the boy with distressing and continuing injuries’. After the hearing, Mr Sutton said: ‘It was a horrible, horrible accident. The dog did not approach the child, the child approached him. Unfortunately I was distracted at that time and was looking at my other dog, which children were petting. 'I have apologised in person to the boy’s mother, I accept responsibility as I was in charge of the dog. He’s sweet-tempered. He’s never done anything like that before or since' Jeremy Sutton, dog owner . ‘Clem doesn’t like being stroked when he’s out on his lead and I didn’t see or hear the boy come up, partly because I’m deaf in one ear. It was one quick snap as a warning but it got the boy’s lip. It was awful and I still think about it all the time. ‘I have apologised in person to the boy’s mother, I accept responsibility as I was in charge of the dog. He’s sweet-tempered. He’s never done anything like that before or since. And since that day he’s never been outside the house without a muzzle.’ He added: ‘I resigned from the party on the day I pleaded guilty. I’ve been involved in the Labour Party for 30 years, it was important to me but it did not seem right to still hold that position after I had pleaded guilty. ‘This was a one-off and I will do everything necessary to make sure nothing like it happens again.’","Jeremy Sutton's Saluki dog Clement attacked boy on Manchester street .

"By . Jill Reilly . Michael Wheatley, 55, a violent armed robber dubbed 'the Skull Cracker' A violent armed robber dubbed the 'Skull Cracker' is believed to have travelled to London by train after going missing from an open prison in Kent, police revealed today. Officers said Michael Wheatley boarded the 9.20am high speed Javelin train from Sittingbourne, which was heading to Stratford International station. He was seen in Twickenham at 19.55 last night, but when police arrived at the address which is believe to be associated with the 55-year-old prisoner, he had disappeared. Despite an extensive search of the area he could not be found and today the Metropolitan Police warned residents in the area not to approach him if they see him again. Wheatley went missing when he was temporarily released from HMP . Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey. The prisoner was handed 13 . life sentences at the Old Bailey in 2002. Wheatley raided 13 building societies and banks over 10 months in 2001 and 2002 while on parole from a 27-year sentence for other robberies. He earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids. Ministers have been urged to reconsider moving violent offenders to open prisons following Wheatley's disappearance. Violent Wheatley, caught here on CCTV pushing a gun into his belt, raided 13 building societies and banks over 10 months in 2001 and 2002 while on parole from a 27-year sentence for other robberies . Conservative former minister Nick Gibb . warned there had been a 'pattern of absconding' at HMP Ford in his . constituency, including two men convicted of murder. Mr . Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) told Policing Minister Damian . Green in the Commons: 'When considering a sentencing policy for those . guilty of observing or engaging in violent behaviour, will you . reconsider the department's policy of moving violent offenders, such as . Michael Wheatley, to open prisons like Standford Hill in Kent. 'You will be aware of the pattern of absconding that has taken place in Ford Open Prison in my constituency. 'In . particular, Derek Passmore and Paul Flint, both of whom were convicted . of murder and one of whom had already absconded from an open prison.' Mr Green replied: 'I am sure across the House many of us will share your concern at people absconding. Wheatley earned his notorious nickname after pistol-whipping victims - including a 73-year-old woman -  during the raids. Pictured is one of the raids captured on CCTV . 'As . we've heard today, the number of people absconding from open prisons . has of course gone down, but I hope you are reassured we are already in . the process of making conditions for those sent to an open prison . tougher, both in terms of those qualifying to go to open prisons and . also the punishments received for those who break the terms.' Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said there will be a . full review of the case, including an assessment of the release on . temporary licence (ROTL) process. Mr . Wright said temporary licence can be an important tool to help . offenders reintegrate into communities but that 'it should not be an . automatic right'. Ministers . have said there will be a toughening up of the licence scheme so that . prisoners are subjected to stricter risk assessments and tagged. Mr . Wright said: 'We are not prepared to see public safety compromised, the . system has been too lax up to now and we are changing that. 'In . future when prisoners are let out on temporary licence they will be . tagged, more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under . strict conditions before being released. 'Temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but it should not be an automatic right. 'There will be a full review of this case which will look at the ROTL process.' Conservative backbencher Philip . Davies said that whoever had allowed Wheatley out of prison was 'a berk' and questioned why he was in an open prison in the first place. The . MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire said: 'It is completely ludicrous that . a serving life sentence prisoner is even in an open prison where they . can simply walk out. 'As far as I am concerned whoever allowed him to be in an open prison should be sacked, it is a complete disgrace. An immitation black Bruni 8mm pistol which Wheatley used to terrorise people during his string of raids . A silver and black immitation Bruni 8mm pistol used by Wheatley during his raids on banks and building societies in 2001 and 2002 . 'The . top priority for the prison service should be the protection of the . public. (Justice Secretary) Chris Grayling needs to put in charge of the . prison service someone who will see protection of the public as a top . priority.' Police have warned the public not to approach Wheatley if they see him. A . Kent Police spokesman said: 'Anyone with any information or who sees . Wheatley is asked to not approach him and to instead contact police by . calling 999.' The spokesman said Wheatley, originally of Limehouse in east London, has links across south east England. Wheatley admitted 13 charges of robbery and 13 of possessing an imitation firearm - a blank firing semi-automatic pistol - in October 2002. The robberies between June 2001 and April the following year were mainly on small branches in areas he knew, ranging from Southampton in Hampshire to Royston in Hertfordshire. The first was just three weeks after he was paroled from his first prison term. As the robberies continued, so did the violence he used towards staff and customers. In March 2002 he pistol whipped a 73-year-old woman and a building society manager. The . Old Bailey heard at the time he would often grab a female customer, . putting the pistol to their head, leaving many mentally anguished. His raids netted him more than Â£45,000. Michael Wheatley, 55, who was sentenced at the Old Bailey in 2002, has failed to return to HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Police said . He was given a five-year sentence on each of the firearm offences to run concurrently with the life sentences on each of the robbery charges. He was ordered to serve a minimum of eight years before being eligible for consideration for parole. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'This is now a matter for the police and we are supporting them in their investigation. 'We are toughening up the release on temporary licence scheme so that prisoners will be subject to stricter risk assessments and tagged.' Clare Townsend, who had a gun held to her head by Michael Wheatley . A terrified woman victim of a . fugitive armed robber known as the 'Skull Cracker' lashed out at . officials last night for putting him in an open jail as he was prepared . for release. One . of Wheatley's victims Clare Townsend, 70, said she was 'shocked' to . find he was in an open prison and said he is almost certain to rob . again. The retired . headteacher said she will never forget the day he held a gun to her . temple while holding up a branch of the Halifax bank in Raynes Park, . South West London. 'Having . been on the end of his violence, I would not have thought he was the . sort of person that should be in an open prison,' she said. 'I . thought he had escaped from an ordinary prison. When I realised he was . in an open prison and he had permission to be out, I was very shocked.' Recalling . her ordeal at Wheatley's hands, the retired headteacher said: 'Suddenly . he swung round, grabbed me by the neck, put a gun to my temple and . started screaming at the cashiers. 'In . that instant I thought he was going to kill me, because he just seemed . so angry. It was almost as though I had personally done something and if . he didn't get his money, I would personally be thwarting him. 'He . was an extremely frightening and threatening, character. I know they . [the police] felt he was an exceedingly dangerous person. 'That's why it's astonishing that all . their hardwork in arresting him and sentencing him appropriately has . somewhat been lost by allowing him to go to an open prison.'","Michael Wheatley, 55, failed to return to HMP .

"By . Nick Constable . and Martin Beckford . and Russell Myers . Collapse: Masked gunman Alan Levers died during a botched armed robbery at a Plymouth bookmakers . Two betting shop punters were hailed as heroes by police last night for disarming and restraining a masked gunman, who then collapsed and died. The customers tackled violent career criminal Alan Levers when he burst into a branch of Ladbrokes brandishing a pistol and wearing a gas-mask. But despite risking their lives there was speculation that the two, as yet unnamed, men could face charges over the death. Detectives are studying CCTV images from inside the Plymouth shop to find out how the robber – who had recently been released from jail for carrying out another armed raid – was brought to the ground and held down before the police arrived. Today it was reported that Levers was wearing the gas mask while being restrained and was dead by the time police arrived. But by last night Devon & Cornwall Police had neither arrested nor interviewed under caution the two men, and instead commented on their courage. Chief Superintendent Andy Bickley said: ‘The actions taken by members of the public in the shop were brave and showed a disregard for their own safety.’ Levers, 50, who had a criminal record for offences including assault and burglary dating back to when he was 13, was jailed for four years in 2010 after he pointed an imitation handgun at the head of a terrified assistant in a corner shop as he stole £600 from her till. He was understood to have only recently been released from prison for that offence when he carried out Friday’s raid in the Honicknowle area of Plymouth near his home. Death: Police officers outside the betting shop in Crownhill Road last night, where the robber burst through the doors wearing a gas mask and brandishing a gun . Levers went into the branch of . Ladbrokes in the early evening armed with a replica gun and wearing the . Second World War-style gas-mask. He is thought to have been restrained . for about ten minutes after he was disarmed by the men. Eyewitness David Walker saw the two customers holding the robber on the floor when he walked into the shop at 6.45 pm. The only others present were the counter assistant and an older man. Mr Walker said: ‘I don’t think you can . blame the customers for what happened. They were just holding him down . and making sure he could not get up.’ Regular punter Ivor Green, 67, . said there would be anger locally if charges were laid. Dead: A relative of Alan Levers said his uncle had been trying to move on from his criminal past after a spell in prison . ‘I don’t know who the punters were but they would have been very protective towards the Ladbrokes assistant,’ he said. ‘He is in there, undefended, on his . own and facing an armed robber. Of course they’re not going to just . stand by. If charges are placed against people trying to defend a shop . worker, then that would be a terrible miscarriage of justice.’ A police armed response unit arrived to find the armed robber unconscious, arrested him and attempted resuscitation. Paramedics then took over but Levers was certified dead minutes later in hospital. Scene: The shop was closed today as police launched an investigation into the 'very serious' incident last night . Gunman: Police officers and paramedics performed CPR on the robber inside the Plymouth Ladbrokes, but he was declared dead at the scene around 20 minutes later . Last year Conservative Ministers . pledged to allow the use of any level of force by members of the public . against assailants as long as it was not ‘grossly disproportionate’. But critics say their ‘bash a burglar’ rhetoric risks encouraging vigilantism. Michael Wolkind, QC, who defended Tony . Martin, the farmer jailed for shooting dead a teenage burglar at his . Norfolk home in 1999, said the two men in the betting shop acted within . the law in restraining Levers. ‘The robber chose to come in wearing . some sort of breathing apparatus, he chose to have a gun so people would . be in fear, so it would be unreasonable to suggest the people who . restrained him should stop and check he is all right in an evolving . situation such as this.’ Alison Seabeck, Labour MP for Plymouth . Moor View, said: ‘It’s very important that what happened is properly . investigated, not least because the person who died also has family and, . whatever the rights and wrongs, his family will want to know what . happened as well.’ The case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Levers was described by relatives as a ‘generous’ father of three who was trying to go straight. His nephew Peter Levers, 28, said: ‘He . had recently been reunited with his family, he was back in touch with . his kids, he had a great missus. I can’t understand why he would do this . now when he had everything to live for. Right now we want answers. We . need to know exactly what happened.’ VIDEO: The scene at the Ladbrokes betting shop where a masked gunman died .","Man was thought to have been wearing a gas mask and holding a gun when he stormed into a Ladbrokes betting shop in Plymouth, Devon .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Plea: Gary Boote admitted assaulting police constable Michael Corner when he hit the policeman with his car before driving away with the officer clinging on . A driver ploughed into a policeman before speeding off with the officer still clinging to the bonnet of his car during a terror ride through a town centre. Police constable Michael Corner was trying to get motorist Gary Boote to pull over and approached the car, only for the 23-year-old to drive into the officer and then reverse as the police man grabbed the bonnet. Boote then headed through the centre of Bolton, Greater Manchester - with Pc Corner holding on to the Toyota Corolla for dear life. Boote had been driving through the . town with false number plates, and appeared to be obeying Pc Corner's . instruction to pull over when the incident happened, Bolton Crown Court heard. Ian Metcalfe, prosecuting, told the court that at one point the Toyota with Pc Corner still holding on, came close to another vehicle, before the officer released his grip and fell off. Pc . Corner was taken to hospital and treated for knee injuries, but was not . seriously injured in the attack, which was caught on CCTV. Boote had been seen driving dangerously through Bolton before the incident on September 9 last year, but Pc Corner and his colleague were unaware of that when they attempted to stop him. Boote admitted assaulting Pc Corner with intent to resist arrest, having previously admitted dangerous driving on the same day. Judge Timothy Stead told Boote, of Halliwell, Bolton, that his case was being adjourned for sentencing to take place on June 6. He was granted bail until then. 'That is not to be taken, by you, as an indication of what will happen on the day of sentence,' said the judge.

"By . Louise Boyle . A 61-year-old man has been charged with murder after a decade-long feud with his neighbor resulted in a fatal shooting. Robert Moulton was charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of his neighbor Sergey Chepchugov, 41, on Sunday. Moulton and his wife Deborah have been warring with neighbor Mr Chepchugov and his wife for ten years, residents in the quiet suburb said, with police called to the homes 46 times in that period. Scroll down for video . Robert Moulton, 61, was arrested on Sunday for the second-degree murder of his neighbor after a long-running feud with the man who lived next door. His wife Deborah (right) was charged with obstruction and is out on bail . Robert Moulton appeared in court with his attorney for a preliminary hearing on Monday after he was charged with second-degree murder . Deborah Moulton's sister, Darla, told WINK News that the fight started over the Moultons' dog with Chepchugov leaping over the fence into his neighbor's yard. According to Naples News, Mrs Moulton told a police dispatcher on Sunday around 9pm: 'I told you you'd have a bloodbath.' She said that Chepchugov had come into their yard and her husband had shot him. After the shooting, the Moultons barricaded themselves in their home for several hours before a  SWAT team managed to coax them out. Chepchugov, who owned a handman business with his wife, was pronounced dead at Naples Community Hospital. Moulton is being held on half a million-dollars bail. He appeared in court on Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit. Chepchugov's wife, Olga Kolesnikova, had previously said that she feared for her life and took out a restraining order against Mrs Moulton in 2010. Ms Kolesnikova claimed that her neighbor went 'ballistic' over the Russian couple's boat that they planned to store in their backyard. The warring neighbors' homes in the quiet Tampa suburb. A boat is circled - one of the couples' many arguments was reportedly over the Chepchugovs' boat on their property . A police car blocks the way to the quiet neighborhood in Naples where a 61-year-old man shot his neighbor dead on Sunday night . Ms Kolesnikova wrote in the petition that Deborah Moulton brandished a stun gun at her, according to Naples News. The court rejected the restraining order petition saying that there was not enough evidence. In April 2010, the neighbors were embroiled in a dispute after two palm trees in the Moultons' front yard were cut down - and they suspected that those next door were behind it. At other times, the two women said they were sprayed by the other's garden hose and filmed across their fences. Moulton was treated at hospital on Monday before being charged with obstruction at Naples jail. She was later bailed out by her sister. Crime scene teams had blocked off both properties on Monday and were carrying out extensive investigations. The warring couples home sit next to each other in a quiet suburb in Naples, Florida.

"By . Helen Pow . An emotional father has described the unimaginable moment he watched his 16-year-old daughter plunge 3,500ft to the ground after a skydiving accident Saturday. 'I didn't know until I got to her and saw the body on the ground (that) it was her,' Joe Wethington said of his daughter, Makenzie, in a Tuesday press conference. 'The whole way over there, from the time that I knew (the skydiver was) going to hit the ground... it was ""please God, don't be Makenzie, please please please God, don't be Makenzie."" And it was.' Miraculously, the Joshua, Texas, teen survived the horror fall, baffling doctors at the OU Medical Center where she has now been moved out of intensive care. Scroll down for video . Incredible: Miraculously, the Joshua, Texas, teen, pictured, survived the horror fall, baffling doctors at the OU Medical Center where she has now been moved out of intensive care . Emotional: Joe Wethington, pictured, has described the moment he watched his 16-year-old daughter plunge 3,500ft to the ground after a skydiving accident Saturday . She suffered a major fracture in her . liver, broke her pelvis, shoulder blade, several ribs, a lumbar vertebra . in her lower spine and a tooth but is now in good condition, is talking . and has feeling back in her extremities. 'I . wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she . survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who . treated Makenzie, said in the news conference. 'When I saw her in the emergency . department, I would have predicted she was not going to survive all of . this. But I'm always happy to be wrong about these things.' Within . 12 hours of arriving at OU medical, Makenzie's internal bleeding had . stabilized and she began regaining consciousness, Bender said. She is expected to be fully recovered after six to eight weeks of rehabilitation. Makenzie's parents have slammed the skydiving company, Pegasus Air . Sports, for failing to properly train their daughter ahead of the jump, and claim they offered her only a solo jump rather than tandem with an instructor. 'She . wasn't prepared,' Joe Wethington said. 'We weren't walked through the . steps for the malfunction that did take place, at all.' Miracle: Doctors in Oklahoma are baffled at how 16-year-old Makenzie Wethington, pictured, survived plunging 3,500ft to the ground after her parachute didn't open properly Saturday . Alive: Makenzie Wethington, 16, fell approximately 3,500 feet to the ground when her parachute apparently malfunctioned . Confusion: Joe Wethington, pictured here with his daughter, expected Makenzie to jump tandem with an instructor but he said the company made her go solo . He added in the news conference: 'I . don't think she should have been allowed to go up there and I find it . very hard to believe the rules and regulations in Oklahoma are that lax. I think it is the company...' Wethington drove to Pegasus Air . Sports in Chickasaw, Oklahoma for the jump after Makenzie said it was . her dream to go skydiving on her 16th birthday. In Texas, the legal age to sky-dive is 18 but Oklahoma allows 16-year-olds to jump with parental permission. Wethington, who was also in the . airplane, successfully jumped before watching from the ground as his . daughter tumbled through the air and landed with a thud. 'She was screaming real bad and . acting like she had the wind knocked out of her, wheezing,' the . emotional father recalled. 'Then . she started screaming, ""Get off me, get off me,"" and nobody was on her. Then she told me to rub her back and she'd start screaming real loud.' Emergency crews arrived in 15 minutes and began administering aid. Shocked: 'I wasn't there, but if she truly fell 3,500ft I have no idea how she survived,' Jeffrey Bender, the OU Medical Center trauma surgeon who treated Makenzie, said in a news conference Tuesday . Pegasus . owner Bob Swainson said Makenzie and her father went through about . six hours of training before they jumped, which is standard for new . jumpers at Pegasus. But Wethington said it was closer to two or three hours. According to its website, the registered company requires four hours of training for first-time static line jumpers. During training, Swainson said jumpers are taught how to respond in emergency situations and deploy backup chutes. As Makenzie was falling, a radio operator on the ground instructed her to deploy her backup chute, but she didn't do it. Her . parents, who are considering a lawsuit, said she wasn't trained . properly to respond to the emergency situation mid-air and she wasn't . strong enough to deploy the second parachute. They also suspect her equipment may have been faulty. According . to Swainson, who was in the plane with the father and daughter, Makenzie's chute opened . fully but took a left turn after opening and spiraled to the ground. Not so sweet: Makenzie was with her dad Joe, who took her to Oklahoma to skydive for her 16th birthday . Excited: In most places and in Texas where the Wethingtons live, you must be 18-years-old to skydive. To get around the rule, the father and daughter drove to Oklahoma, where 16-year-old Makenzie could jump with her father's consent . 'All . I'm going to say is it had a bit of a turn, and it wasn't corrected, . the 46-year skydiving veteran said. 'It probably could have been . corrected.' Meanwhile, her father described his daughter as the 'toughest kid I ever met.' 'She never shed one tear,' he told reporters. Makenzie's mother, Holly Wethington, said she was talked into signing the permission slip because she thought her daughter would be jumping tandem. 'They talked me into it because of course they said it was safe, she'd be on somebody's back, it wasn't going to be her responsiblity to do anything, so I did give her permission because she was very excited,' she recalled through tears. 'God's hand caught her,' Makenzie's older sister Meagan told KDFW earlier this week. Things looked grim after the jump but the teen exuded joy and excitement beforehand. Makenzie and her father were there to fulfill her dream to go skydiving. 'You can be 16 with a parent consent. My dad is jumping with me,' Makenzie tweeted leading up to her perilous fall. 'She's still alive and really she shouldn't be': Makenzie's sister Meagan (right with Makenzie at left) says her sister's survival is nothing short of a miracle . It was one of many ecstatic dispatches she'd send out Friday. Makenzie's . dad jumped first and Makenzie followed thereafter. Another man decided . he didn't want to do it and the instructor stayed behind. Joe . Wethington landed safely on the ground and watched helplessly as his . daughter spiraled down, her parachute apparently jammed. 'My dad said that the guy on the ground was talking to [my sister] through the radio,' Meagan told NBCDFW.com. 'They had a radio in their ears. And my dad just heard him keep saying, . ""Reach up. Pull the chute out. Reach up. Pull the chute out. You need . to calm down, calm down.""' The family believes Makenzie must . have panicked and it kept her from fixing her chute or engaging the . backup. She was rushed to an Oklahoma City hospital. 'Her . vertebrae broke in half,' Meagan said. 'Her pelvic bone completely . split in half. She has more broken bones in her back. She has two broken . ribsâ€¦her teeth.' Survivor: According to Meagan, Makenzie has several broken vertebrae, a shattered pelvis, smashed teeth and serious internal bleeding. She was on a breathing machine, but miraculously she was breathing on her own after two days . Makenzie also had serious internal . injuries including bleeding in her brain, lungs and liver according to a . Facebook account the family set up to keep loved ones updated on . Makenzie's well-being. She was on a breathing machine at first. But miraculously, after two days, she improved enough to start breathing on her own. Meagan says her sister is able to wiggle her toes and can even speak a little. 'She honestly keeps saying is, she just thinks it was her fault, because she couldn't reach up and pull the shoot,' said Meagan. Who's fault it is remained unclear Monday. Makenzie jumped with her father's consent, but more often than not a jumper's first skydive is done tandem--that is, while strapped to the back of a more seasoned jumper. This is what her father expected to happen, however, Pegasus Air Sports Center only offered solo jumps. But Makenzie is now focused on her recovery. 'The whole thing that's keeping us going is because she's still alive and really she shouldn't be,' Meagan said.","'The whole way over there, from the time that I knew (the skydiver was) going to hit the ground... it was ""please God, don't be Makenzie,"" ...And it was,' Joe Wethington, from Joshua, Texas, said Tuesday of his daughter .

The security footage looks unassuming at first: a Hawaiian Airlines jet parked at a gate at the Maui airport under overcast skies, and workers going through their regular routine. Then, the 15-year-old's legs dangle briefly from the plane's belly and he drops to the concrete. Hawaii transportation officials today released video of a California teen hopping from a jet's wheel well on April 20 after stowing away for a 5 1/2-hour flight. The video largely confirms previous accounts given by FBI and airport officials of Yahya Abdi's seemingly unbelievable story: that he ran away from home, hopped a fence at Mineta San Jose International Airport and climbed into the wheel well of the closest plane. Abdi survived the flight at 35,000 feet despite low oxygen and freezing temperatures. Scroll down for video .

Abdi walks up to an airport worker driving a cart, and the two chat for about three minutes before walking away together. The boy stays standing the whole time. Hawaii Department of Transportation spokeswoman Caroline Sluyter said the footage was released after the state attorney general's office reviewed media requests.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . More than 500 people were attending a memorial service for a 17-year-old German exchange student who was shot dead a week ago in the United States. Friends, family, the mayor and American diplomats on Sunday assembled at a mosque in Hamburg to wish farewell to Diren Dede, who was fatally shot in Missoula, Montana. The coffin was put up on a table in the park of the mosque and draped with German and Turkish flags. Dede is the son of Turkish immigrants and will be buried on Monday in Bodrum, Turkey. Grief-stricken: The father, relatives and friends stand at the coffin of Diren Dede during a funeral in Hamburg, Germany on Sunday . A community mourns: Relatives and friends gather to remember Diren Dede, 17, who was shot in the head by an American homeowner while on exchange in the U.S. Germany has demanded justice following the senseless shooting. Dede, from Hamburg, was killed when 29-year-old Markus Kaarma fired four shotgun blasts into his garage after Dede set off home intruder alarms inside. It is not clear what Dede was doing inside the garage. Julia Reinhardt, spokesman for the German consulate in San Fransisco, said the investigation should make it clear it is illegal to kill an unarmed juvenile just because he is trespassing. Trip of a lifetime: Diren Dede was killed by a homeowner while he was in the U.S. on exchange from Germany . Celal Dede, the father of Diren Dede, flew out of Missoula after securing the release of Diren Dede's body. Before he departed, Celal Dede told the German news agency dpa that he had never imagined his son could be shot for simply entering somebody's property. ""America cannot continue to play cowboy,"" Celal Dede said. ""I didn't think for one night that everyone here can kill somebody just because that person entered his backyard,"" Dede said, adding that he would never have allowed his son into the country if he knew there was such callous disregard for human life. Court records obtained by KPAX said Kaarma and his wife, Janelle Pflager, had set up sensors outside their garage, a video monitoring system in the garage and left the garage door open. Pflager said she put personal items that she had cataloged in a purse in the garage 'so that they would take it.' Early Sunday, the sensors went off, and Kaarma and Pflager looked at the video feed and saw that someone was in the garage. Kaarma went outside with his shotgun. He told investigators he heard a noise that sounded 'like metal on metal,' and he was afraid the intruder would come out and hurt him. He said he did not see anyone in the darkened garage and did not communicate with anyone before sweeping the garage with four shotgun blasts. Dede was struck in the head and arm and died at a Missoula hospital, court records said. Unspeakable loss: Celal Dede, father of Diren Dede mourns during his son funeral in Hamburg, Germany . School soccer star: Diren was an exchange student in Missoula, Montana, USA and was shot there last week after entering a stranger's garage . Fired without warning: Markus Kaarma and his wife set a trap in their garage for Dede, leaving the door open with a purse in plain view and trip wires to alert them to his presence . Kaarma told police he fired high to avoid hitting the car in the garage - but court records showed that three of four shots were aimed low. He also told investigators 'wanted him [Dede] to be caught' because 'police can't catch burglars in the act.' Plager's testimony shows a different version of events. She told police she heard Kaarma say 'Hey hey' at the garage door and put a shell into his shotgun. She then heard someone say 'Hey' or 'Wait' right before Kaarma fired two shots. As she went to turn on lights, two more shots were fired, according to court records. Pflager told police that they had been burglarized two times within the last three weeks, Kaarma's attorney Paul Ryan said. They were frustrated, on edge and felt someone in their neighborhood was watching them, Ryan said. The couple called police 'and nothing was done,' he said. Pflager had made a list of the items in the purse so if it was taken she could attempt to track the thief, Ryan said. Despite the recent burglaries, they left the garage door open, prosecutors noted.

Dede was a junior at Big Sky High School, where officials set up brief support for students.

'He was a very loved student, especially in the junior class,' she said. 'When he landed... first thing he asked was when are we practicing for soccer.'

"By . Hannah Ellis-petersen . A titled music teacher has been jailed for sexually abusing a ten-year-old boy 30 years ago – after the former pupil broke a lifetime’s silence. Sir Peter Newson-Smith was found guilty of two charges of indecent assault while head of music at a prestigious boarding school, Clayesmore Prep, in Dorset. He received a five-and-a-half-year sentence after victim John Cartwright flew from his home in Australia to give evidence against him. Caged: John Cartwright, left, former pupil of Peter Newson Smith, right, gave evidence of sexual abuse that saw the latter jailed for five-and-a-half years . A court heard how Newson-Smith, the 3rd Baronet of Totteridge, lured the ‘vulnerable and isolated’ pupil into a cupboard on ten separate occasions, before making him strip naked and molesting him. Newson-Smith – who was described by his neighbours as a ‘pillar of the community’ – had also denied taking photos of the naked ten-year-old on a polaroid camera in 1981. The 66-year-old retired from the £7,500-a-term school in 2003 after 24 years. Victim Mr Cartwright, now 40, chose to waive his anonymity to speak to The Mail on Sunday in the hope that other victims of abuse will come forward. The property developer said: ‘I just feel relief now that he has been jailed. I still don’t know whether I have fully come to terms with what happened to me but at least, for the first time, I have justice.’ Mr Cartwright, who has a eight- year-old daughter, said he decided to make his complaint in 2010 after he ‘thought about how I would react if the same thing were to happen to her’. ‘I never told anyone because it is extremely humiliating and embarrassing. I felt ashamed. It took 30 years for me to be able to say it. It’s not something that’s easy to mention. ‘It always stopped me from trying to do really well at anything because after those experiences, I never wanted to stand out, and that takes a long time to overcome. ‘At the time, I didn’t understand what was happening to me. Even now, I haven’t told my wife everything. But, when I saw how many pastoral awards the school had won, it made me angry, so I emailed the headmaster and told him what I’d gone through.’ Mr Cartwright also revealed how testifying in court was ‘without question the  scariest thing I’ve ever done’. He added: ‘I don’t think there is anything more harrowing than having to stand up and talk openly about those kinds of experiences.’ Mr Cartwright’s sister Susan Callaway, 40, said: ‘I was also at that school and I understand how this could happen. You didn’t have anybody you could turn to. It is horrific. ‘He had his innocence taken away from him and that’s just not right.’ Sentencing Newson-Smith at Dorchester Crown Court, Judge Roger Jarvis said: ‘There is scarcely a greater breach of trust, when a young boy is entrusted to the care of a  boarding school, and that very considerable trust is abused.’ As the guilty verdict was read out, Newson-Smith’s wife Mary-Ann, with whom he has four children, broke down in tears. ‘It can’t be true,’ she said. ‘What will I tell the children?’ Neighbours in Marnhull, Dorset, also expressed their shock. Margaret Bulford, 87, a family friend, said: ‘It is absolutely unbelievable. I’ve always known him as a good man and an upstanding member of our village. I would describe him as a good and quiet gentleman.’ In a statement yesterday, Clayesmore Prep School said it had responded to Newson-Smith’s conviction ‘with the utmost shock and sadness’.","Sir Peter Newson-Smith jailed for five-and-a-half years for indecent assault .

"By . Ap  Reporter . A south Georgia funeral home broke no laws when it used newspapers to stuff the body of a teenager found dead last year inside a rolled up gym mat at his school, state regulators concluded in a report sent to the teen's parents. The family of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, filed a complaint with the Georgia Board of Funeral Service last year after newspaper was found in the place of his missing organs when the body was exhumed for a second autopsy. Johnson's parents, who are still fighting to have their son's death declared a homicide after authorities concluded it was a freak accident, said they were outraged and found the funeral home's use of newspapers to be disrespectful. Write caption here . Second autopsy: Kendrick Johnson had already been buried when his death was officially ruled a freak accident, so his parents had his body exhumed for a second autopsy, at which point they discovered his body had been stuffed with newspaper . The funeral home that prepared Kendrick Johnson's body for public viewing and burial by reportedly stuffing his body cavity with newspapers and other filler material to replace internal organs removed during an autopsy did not break state law, the Georgia Board of Funeral Service has concluded . Attorneys for the Johnson family released a letter from the board saying it found Harrington Funeral Home broke no state law. However, the board also noted that using newspaper to fill a body cavity is not considered a 'best practice' and that other materials are usually 'more acceptable than newspaper', The Valdosta Daily Times reported Saturday. Roy Copeland, an attorney for Harrington Funeral Home, said its owners were 'certainly happy' with regulators' finding that it did nothing illegal. Students at Lowndes High School discovered Johnson's body on January 11, 2013, inside a rolled up gym mat propped against the wall beside the bleachers. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation medical examiner concluded he died from positional asphyxia, meaning his body was stuck upside down and he was unable to breathe. Warning: Graphic image . The body of Kendrick Johnson was found upside down inside a large gym mat that been stacked against the wall of the high school auditorium. He wasn't found until the day after he is believed to have entered the mat, with his face swollen and disfigured from the blood running to his head . Kendrick Johnson is seen here in a photo from Facebook. His death is still being investigated . Sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson got trapped in the mat while reaching for a gym shoe that had fallen inside. Johnson's friends said it was typical for them to hide belongings in the large stacked gym mats rather than pay for a locker. When Johnson was found, one sneaker was on the ground near some of his things, while the other was pressed up against his head inside the mat. His body was not found until the following day, with the people coming and going from the gym not knowing there was a body inside the mats against the wall of the auditorium. However Johnson's parents insist someone must have killed him and have pushed to reopen the case. Kendrick Johnson's family continue to protest the ruling that his death was an accident, one year after his body was discovered in a gym mat . Kendrick Johnson (right) was described as shy and quiet but an excellent football player . Neither parent has returned to work following the discovery of their son's body and they spend each weekday outside their local court house protesting and pleading their son's case. The U.S. attorney for middle Georgia is reviewing the investigation with help from the FBI. It's still unclear what happened to Johnson's internal organs after the GBI autopsy. The GBI has said it returned the organs to the body before sending it to the funeral home. But the funeral home has said the organs were missing when the body arrived. Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson has said many of Johnson's organs were deemed too badly decomposed to be preserved and had to be disposed of before the body was embalmed.","The body of Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found inside a gym mat at his Georgia high school in January 2013 .

"By . Damian Ghigliotty . A Pennsylvania teenager slept for 64 days from Thanksgiving into January -- her longest sleeping episode yet. Nicole Delien, 17, struggles with a rare sleep disorder called Kleine-Levine, or ‘Sleeping Beauty' Syndrome, which affects an estimated 1,000 people around the world. During her sleep spells, which began when she was six and a half, Nicole will wake up in a confused state for small periods of time to eat, drink and use the bathroom and then fall back to sleep. 'I don't remember what happens (during that time),' she told the Today Show on Tuesday. 'It's hard for me to talk about it, because I've missed so many days of my life. I just don't like when people call it a fairy tale, because it's really not.' Scroll down for video . Rarely awake: Nicole Delien, 17, is afflicted with Kleine-Levin Syndrome, a rare disorder that causes her to sleep 18 to 19 hours a day . Family care: Nicole with her younger sister and brother, who do not have the same condition as her . Nicole’s mother, Vicki, says her . daughter will sleep 18 to 19 hours a day, and when she eventually wakes . up to eat she is in a ‘sleepwalking state which she doesn’t remember,’ KDKA in Pittsburgh reported last week. The Delien family also recently appeared on Jeff Probst’s syndicated talk show to make sure other families become aware of the rare disorder. Vicki Delien told reporters that it was very frustrating trying to get a diagnosis for her daughter. She said it took several hospital trips to figure out what has been afflicting her. Eventually, Dr. Michael Rancurello, a psychiatrist at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was able to pinpoint the disorder and offer some suggestions on how to manage it, including medication. 'It's really not sleeping,' he told the Today Show, calling Nicole's unconscious state a 'delirium.' 'I think it's a manifestation of some brain malfunction,' he said. On television: Nicole with her mother, Vicki Delien, and her psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Rancurello, on the Today Show . Individuals affected with the disorder may go for a period of 'weeks, months or even years without experiencing any symptoms, and then they reappear with little warning’ the Kleine-Levin Syndrome Foundation website states. In addition to excessive sleeping, . those symptoms include disorientation, hallucination, child-like behaviour, . binge-eating and periods of hyper-sexuality when awake, according to an Oxford Journals report. That report says the disorder predominately affects young males. Raising awareness: Nicole with her parents on the Jeff Probst Show . Symptoms may be related to malfunctions in the parts of the brain that govern appetite, sleep and sexuality, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders . and Stroke. The cause of Kleine-Levin Syndrome is unknown, both medical sources indicate. Eric Haller, a young college student with the disorder, told ABC News in February that he gets sick and falls into a sleeping episode about eight to 10 times a year. He still shows an aptitude for working and learning. The 21-year-old from Placentia, California, maintains a 3.5 average at Fullerton . State University and interns for the Los Angeles Clippers. However, his abilities decline when he slips into a trance. On the verge of sleep: Video footage of Nicole before she fell asleep for 64 days .

She also missed out on an opportunity to meet pop singer Katy Perry. But when Perry later learned about Nicole’s disorder she made sure Nicole was able to visit her backstage at a performance in Connecticut. As she grows older, Nicole says she hopes to have 'more good memories like that one.' Nicole’s last sleeping episode was in March.

"By . Paul Scott . Even at the best of times, it is hard to tell from Simon Fuller’s strangely taut, perma-tanned face exactly what he is thinking. It is a mask of inscrutability that, no doubt, comes in handy during the negotiations the management Svengali conducts on a daily basis for his roster of sporting and showbusiness stars. But there was no hiding his unadulterated glee as Fuller watched from the players’ box as his client Andy Murray became the first British man since 1936 to reign supreme at Wimbledon. Simon Fuller arriving at 10 Downing Street ahead of a reception with Andy Murray following his Wimbledon win . Indeed, look closely and it was almost possible to see the pound signs in Fuller’s eyes. Because for Murray — and his delighted manager — the tills are set to start ringing like never before. Already big-money offers are coming in. And they could boost the tennis player’s fortune from its current £32 million to upwards of £200 million, say experts. ‘It is on a par with winning the World Cup — it’s very exciting,’ Fuller says of the 26-year-old Scot’s historic win. ‘Andy will hopefully achieve all the things that come with success.’ By that, of course, he is talking about oodles of cash — a sizeable chunk of which will boost Fuller’s £375 million fortune for providing his expert advice. Such vast wealth has been achieved through the savvy marketing of his  A-list clients, who include David Beckham, Jennifer Lopez and Lewis Hamilton. And Fuller rarely misses an opportunity to promote those he represents. Just look at the Royal Box during the men’s final. There, stealing attention in a skimpy black negligee dress from her own collection, was Victoria Beckham — another signed to Fuller’s company, XIX Entertainment. There was no hiding his unadulterated glee as Fuller watched from the players¿ box as his client Andy Murray became the first British man since 1936 to reign supreme at Wimbledon. Murray broke down in tears after he won the final at last, but he is set to make millions following the event . Kim Sears happened to wear a dress designed by Fuller client Victoria Beckham as she watched her boyfriend win Wimbledon . It seems her appearance — and all the free publicity it brought her clothing line — had as much to do with puppet-master Fuller’s string-pulling as it did with Posh’s love of tennis. Indeed, she spent much of the match on her mobile phone. Likewise, Murray’s girlfriend Kim Sears, whose roller-coaster of emotions during the match was beamed to millions of television viewers around the world, just happened to be wearing a green lace dress designed — you’ve guessed it — by Victoria Beckham. Last year, 25-year-old Miss Sears sported a succession of dresses by French designer Roland Mouret — who is also a client of Fuller. None of which is surprising, perhaps, given that Miss Sears, like Murray’s mother, Judy, and brother, doubles tennis player Jamie, is advised by Fuller as well. Such corporate symbiosis might seem from the outside to be more than a little cynical, but it is undoubtedly good for business. Yesterday, Fuller arrived in a Bentley to attend a reception at 10 Downing Street, hosted by David Cameron, to celebrate Murray’s win — a victory that is the culmination of five years’ hard work from Fuller and his team as they have assiduously gone about trying to mend the Scotsman’s dour image to make him more appealing to sponsors. Stars David and Victoria Beckham are both clients of Simon Fuller . Lewis Hamilton (left) and Jennifer Lopez (right) are both clients, helping Fuller generate his massive fortune . It has not always been an easy sell. Indeed, last autumn when Murray’s contract with XIX was up for renewal, there was speculation in the sports management industry that he was planning to dump Fuller because his on-court success — winning Olympic gold and the U.S. Open last summer — had not translated into significantly increased earnings away from the sport. All that is about to change. Fuller, who persuaded Murray to stay on his roster, is already fielding calls from eager brands who want to have their names associated with the Wimbledon champion. Among them is Adidas, who have already opened talks about renewing Andy’s five-year, £15 million deal, which expires at the end of 2014. His new contract, which is likely to more than double in value, is set to make him a global brand ambassador. His deal with the sportswear giant is joined by a three-year deal with Swiss watchmaker Rado — signed last June — and worth £9.9 million. He also gets £2 million a year from RBS as well as contracts with racquet maker Head and Jaguar cars. All of which brings Murray in around £10 million a year. In recent months, Fuller has held off signing up Murray to any new sponsorship deals, gambling on the fact that a win at Wimbledon would massively inflate his future bankability. That is set to sky rocket thanks, in part, to a deal Fuller negotiated this year to form a partnership with Indian doubles player and entrepreneur Mahesh Bhupathi. A new company, XIX Globosport, will focus on developing Murray’s commercial interests in the highly lucrative Asia and the Middle East markets. Fuller planned on softening the Scotsman's personality by allowing the documentary Andy Murray: The Man Behind The Racquet . In the programme, the normally reserved Murray broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by Thomas Hamilton in his native  Dunblane in March 1996. Viewers were given a more personal insight into the character of Andy Murray . It is just part of the strategy to turn Murray into a global money-making machine. Pivotal to the campaign have been the concerted attempts by Fuller and his team to soften his client’s outwardly less than sparkling personality. Hence the decision to allow BBC fly-on-the-wall cameras to follow the player for the recent documentary, Andy Murray, The Man Behind The Racquet. In the programme, the normally reserved Murray broke down in tears as he discussed the killing of 16 children by Thomas Hamilton in his native  Dunblane in March 1996. Murray, who was eight at the time and a pupil at the local primary school which was the scene of the massacre, escaped the gunman by hiding in the headmaster’s office. Such manipulation of the media has long been 53-year-old Fuller’s stock in trade. He managed the Spice Girls, created teen band S Club 7, and launched Pop Idol in 2001, which went on to be sold to 46 countries around the world. But he fell out with his former business partner Simon Cowell, who acted as a judge on the British and U.S. versions of the shows, after Cowell launched his own rival show, The X Factor, in 2004. The feud has hardly dented Fuller’s bank balance. In 2005, he sold 19 Entertainment for £130 million and later launched XIX Entertainment. Unlike the stars he promotes, Fuller likes to keep his private life below the radar. In 2008, he married blonde interior designer Natalie Swanston, who is 18 years his junior, and the couple now have a two-year-old daughter. His reticence, does not however, extend to his assessment of his own talent. ‘My business is creating fame and celebrity, and I’m one of the best in the world,’ Fuller says.  ‘I understand popular entertainment better than anyone. I want to have the world’s No.1 tennis player, the hottest movie, the biggest artist.’ One thing that seems certain is that thanks to his Wimbledon success, Andy Murray and the man pulling his strings are about to get even richer.","Andy Murray's delighted manager Simon Fuller may be set to cash in .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Hillary Rodham Clinton has declared that America's gun culture has gotten 'way out of balance' and the U.S. needs to rein in the notion that 'anybody can have a gun, anywhere, anytime'. The former secretary of state and potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate today told a gathering of mental health professionals that the idea that anyone can have a gun is not in the 'best interest of the vast majority of people.' But she said that approach does not conflict with the rights of people to own firearms. Gun control: Hillary Rodham Clinton told a gathering of mental health professionals she believes US gun culture has to be reined in . Bold: Potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said at a National Council for Behavioral Health Conference today that the idea that anyone can have a gun is not in the 'best interest of the vast majority of people' Clinton bravely waded into the polarizing issue of gun politics during an appearance at the National Council for Behavioral Health conference in Oxon Hill, Maryland. She pointed to recent shootings that involved teens who had been playing loud music and chewing gum and a separate incident involving the typing of text messages in a movie theater. 'I think again we're way out of balance. I think that we've got to rein in what has become an almost article of faith that anybody can have a gun anywhere, anytime,' Clinton said. 'And I don't believe that is in the best interest of the vast majority of people. And I think you can say that and still support the right of people to own guns.' The Democratic-controlled Senate voted against legislation pushed by President Barack Obama last year that would have expanded background checks for firearm purchases to gun shows and online sales. The legislation came in the aftermath of the deadly Sandy Hook elementary school shootings in Connecticut. If Clinton runs for president, her views on gun control would clash with Republicans, who have largely opposed efforts to tighten gun laws.

During a recent National Rifle Association conference in Indianapolis, for example, GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, a potential 2016 candidate, said Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden considered the Second Amendment to be little more than 'a phrase from a speech writer'. Clinton told attendees at the mental health conference that 'at the rate we're going, we're going to have so many people with guns everywhere, fully licensed, fully validated' in settings like movie theaters where shootings have arisen over seemingly mundane things like loud gum chewing or cellphone use. 'That's what happens in the countries I've visited where there is no rule of law and no self-control and that is something that we cannot just let go without paying attention,' she said. During a question-and-answer session, Clinton was asked about the 1993 suicide of Clinton White House lawyer Vince Foster. Referring to him as 'our friend in the White House', she said he had been depressed and 'filled with anxieties'. Like other men she has known who killed themselves, Clinton said, 'they did not want to be seen as weak, they didn't want to admit their problems'. Her appearance coincided with the release by Vanity Fair magazine of excerpts from an article by Monica Lewinsky, who as a White House intern had an affair with Clinton's husband when he was president.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman whose daughter died during a police shooting is asking a judge to order authorities to diclose the name of the officer who accidentally shot her daughter. Nella Rebello, whose daughter Andrea, 21, died in May 2013 home invasion, said in a court affidavit filed on Wednesday that she has yet to be told the killer's identity. 'As of today, no one from the Police Department has ever told me who shot the bullet that killed my daughter, who was in charge when she was shot or how it came to be that they did not wait for a hostage negotiator to come and try to save her,' Rebello said. Andrea Rebello, left, was killed in May by a police officer who fired eight times at Dalton Smith, right, who had Rebello in a headlock. Seven bullets hit Smith and one hit Rebello, killing both . Tragic: Andrea's boyfriend, Brad Wilson, parted ways with her after partying at a bar near the Hofstra University campus on Thursday night. He never got to say goodbye to his sweetheart before she was killed . The filing is part of the Rebello family's effort to get more information from authorities, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Nassau County, Newsday reports. In the suit, the family alleges 'wrongful death, civil rights and negligence actions against the County of Nassau and its police officers and possibly other defendants to be named after discovery,' CBS New York reported in June. Rebello also said in the affidavit that while waiting to identify her daughter's body, she was led to believe 'it was the person who had taken her hostage that had killed her,' Newsday reports. She said police came to her home the next day, telling her a police officer killed her daughter, with no name or photo -- while giving her a picture and the name of the home intruder.

Smith reportedly had pointed a gun at Andrea Rebello's head, while holding her in a headlock and using her as a human shield when facing the responding officer. The officer fired eight shots at Smith, hitting him seven times -- with the eighth bullet hitting Andrea Rebello in the head. Both were killed, CBS New York reported. MailOnline reported earlier this year that Smith, 30, was wanted on parole violation and had a nearly 15-year arrest history prior to the May shooting.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Controversial Hollywood director Oliver Stone has announced his involvement with the new Martin Luther King biopic has abruptly ended, claiming producers 'won't go with' the story he wrote about the civil rights activist. The three-time Oscar-winning filmmaker - whose has built a reputation for transforming politically-minded issues and stories into big screen hits, as seen in films Platoon and JFK - said he is saddened by the creative differences that brought about the end of his work on MLK, for which Jamie Foxx was attached to star as the title character. While producers Dreamworks and Warner Bros. are yet to comment on the new development, film pundits are reporting they feared the movie would seem like a 'smear campaign' against King. Stone - who wanted to deliver a more humanized story about King, dealing with his alleged infidelities and flaws - took to Twitter Friday to confirm the news. Saddened: Hollywood director Oliver Stone has had his involvement with an upcoming Martin Luther King biopic ended amid reports his version of the story would appear like a 'smear campaign' against the slain civil rights activist . Oliver Stone said he wanted to deliver a look at Martin Luther King that was less saint-like and more humanized, dealing with his flaws and infidelity . ‘Sad news. My MLK project involvement has ended. I did an extensive rewrite of the script, but the producers won’t go with it,’ he wrote. ‘The script dealt w/ issues of adultery, conflicts within the movement, and King’s spiritual transformation into a higher, more radical being’ ‘I’m told the estate & the ‘respectable’ black community that guard King’s reputation won’t approve it. They suffocate the man & the truth.’ ‘I wish you could see the film I would’ve made. I fear if ‘they’ ever make it, it’ll be just another commemoration of the March on Washington’ ‘Martin, I grieve for you. You are still a great inspiration for your fellow Americans—but, thank God, not a saint.’ Stone and Foxx were announced as attached to the project three months ago, Variety reported. Jamie Foxx was set to take on the part of Martin Luther King, after recently portraying a young Obama-like president in White House Down (center) alongside Channing Tatum (left) Film blog FIMO is reporting the screenplay Stone produced was too contentious. 'You want to present MLK in an honorable and truthful light,' the site reported. 'You want to emphasize the good the man did for the world. 'You don’t want to create a smear campaign.' Political biopics have enjoyed a resurgence following the popularity of 2013 Oscar favorite Lincoln, starring Daniel Day Lewis. The MLK project is likely to continue without Stone, as the left-wing director suggested in his Tweets. The story was expected to follow the slain Civil Rights hero from his rise all the way to his assassination in 1968. While Stone seemed an obvious choice to man the movie, he is notorious for igniting controversy and debate through his work by challenging ideas. His JFK film, which was released in 1991 and starred Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones, created a new wave of conspiracy theories surrounding the president's assassination in 1964. In the film, Stone suggests that there were a number of witnesses along the Dallas parade route who thought that they saw someone on the ground - and not Lee Harvey Oswald, who was on the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository- who fired shots from a inconspicuous spot near a fence. Controversial: Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK created a new wave of conspiracy theorists after presenting a different angle of the president's 1964 assassination . Stone has continually debunked the government-backed 'single bullet theory' used to explain Kennedy's death. It's said that one bullet hit Kennedy in the back and exited his body through his throat, before hitting Governor John Connally in the front seat and breaking two different bones in Connally's body. 'Now, I've been in the infantry and I've seen enough combat to tell you that in all the craziness of war, this Alice in Wonderland scenario defies physics and common sense,' Stone, who served in the Vietnam War, wrote in an editorial for USA Today in November. 'The American people are not stupid.' More recently Stone hit headlines with The Untold History of the United States, a 10-part Showtime series. Starting with World War I and ending with the first Obama administration, the series was lauded by some but slammed by others as 'mendacious' and 'misleading'. Stone has won three Oscars. The films he has directed have been nominated for 31 Academy Awards, including eight for acting, six for screen writing and three for directing.","Three-time Oscar winning director Oliver Stone confirms the biopic he was writing and directing about Martin Luther King will not be made because producers Dreamworks and Warner Bros.

Today doctors said the minister's wife suffered 'certain injuries' and an 'unnatural death'. Sudhir Gupta, head of forensics at the All India Institute of Medical . Sciences, spoke after medics carried out an initial autopsy on her body. 'It is a case of unnatural, sudden death,' he said. 'We will conclude our report and opinion within a couple of days. 'Since the investigating agency is now working on the case there are certain issues relating to the injuries that cannot be revealed now. But there were certain injuries on the body'. However, it is unclear who or what could have inflicted the injuries referred to, or whether they are believed to be the cause of death. A news agency, Press Trust of India, reported yesterday that Mrs Pushkar Tharoor was believed to have taken her own life. And one doctor involved with the post mortem, Dr Adarsh Kumar, told the Daily Mail's Indian edition Mail Today: 'The injuries didn't contribute to her death. We suspect that she might have died due to a drug overdose.' She also had underlying illnesses, it was reported. Earlier this week, messages on Twitter said Mrs Pushkar Tharoor would expose a 'rip-roaring affair' between her husband and the Pakistan-based journalist Mehr Tarar. She reportedly hacked into her husband's Twitter account to publish private messages between the pair to his two million followers. One of the messages, allegedly sent from Ms Tarar's account, was reported to have said: 'I love you, Shashi Tharoor. And I go while in love with you, irrevocably, irreversibly, hamesha [always]. Bleeding, but always your Mehr.' The tweets were deleted and Mr Tharoor, 57, said his account had been hacked. Journalist Ms Tarar also denied claims that she had any involvement with the minister. Then on Thursday, a day before her death, Mr Tharoor and his wife released a joint statement on Facebook saying they were still happily married and intended to stay together.

"By . Nick Craven In Paris . France's First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler, is 'fooling herself' by clinging to the hope that her relationship with President Francois Hollande can survive his affair with actress Julie Gayet. The claim came just hours after Ms Trierweiler left hospital for ‘a bad case of the blues’ following revelations of the affair. A close friend, who asked not to be named, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She wants to forgive him and believes things can return to the way they were, but it’s impossible. Scroll down for video . First lady Valerie Trierweiler left hospital after an eight-night stay having 'taken one too many pills' in the scandal's wake. A close friend says she is 'foolish' to think things can continue as they were . ‘Now we have learned this affair was going on even when Hollande took office two years ago, Valerie is fooling herself if she thinks he will return to her.’ The friend said he did not think French public opinion would stand for a straight swap of ‘first girlfriends’ for Hollande, who has always rejected marriage as ‘bourgeois’. ‘I cannot see Julie Gayet moving into the Elysee Palace as a new First Lady. ‘It would look wrong. I think she will continue to live outside as she had her own career as an actress, but perhaps she will appear at the President’s side from time to time and on foreign visits. But first Valerie must be handled, and she won’t go quietly.’ The source has known Ms Trierweiler for 20 years and spoke to her by phone several times during the ten days she spent in the Pitie- Salpetriere hospital, Paris, where Princess Diana died in 1997. Ms Trierweiler left hospital in an official limousine shortly after 3pm yesterday. Sources at Paris Match, where she has worked since 1989, confirmed she was heading for a property on the Versailles estate to continue her convalescence, as she had requested. President Hollande has been accused of having an affair with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet . The leader is due to reveal whether Ms Trierweiler will continue in her role as the First Lady next month . The friend’s comments came as Ms . Trierweiler’s family spoke for the first time about the affair, with her . uncle condemning the President’s behaviour as ‘disgraceful’. Retired . engineer Florent Massonneau, told The Mail on Sunday from his home in . Angers, western France: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded is . disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’ According . to some reports, Ms Trierweiler, 48, took pills when 59-year-old . Hollande broke the bombshell news to her that he had been photographed . getting a lift on a police bodyguard’s scooter to a flat where he . enjoyed secret liaisons with blonde mother-of-two Ms Gayet, 41. The . next day, France was rocked by the pictures which were  splashed across . seven pages of the magazine Closer. Hollande argued that his privacy . had been invaded, but failed to deny the affair. Ms Gayet has since sued . Closer for breach of privacy. The French President greeted constituents in Tulle as the scandal surrounding his alleged infidelities continues . Happier times: The couple are pictured in celebrating Hollande's election win in Tulle in 2012, with the leader offering his girlfriend a rose . Friends of Ms Trierweiler denied suggestions that she had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose, but admitted she was suffering from stress and exhaustion. The source who spoke to The Mail on Sunday said Ms Trierweiler had been aware of the rumours linking Hollande and Ms Gayet – but that confirmation of their affair had still come as a huge shock. ‘There are always rumours in French politics that someone is sleeping with someone else,’ said the friend. ‘But when you see photographic evidence, it’s another thing entirely, and it really knocked Valerie sideways. Valerie is a very bright woman but love has made her blind. She thinks her relationship with Hollande can be patched up, but everyone around her knows it  is beyond repair.’ Plans to hold an Anglo-French summit between David Cameron and Francois Hollande at historic Blenheim Palace have been scrapped – to avoid upsetting the French, writes Brendan Carlin. The Prime Minister wanted to welcome the French President to the sumptuous 18th Century stately home later this month. But the idea has been dropped after Mr Cameron was told that Mr Hollande would regard the choice of venue as a huge insult. The palace was built as a gift for John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough and commander of the Allied forces in one of the nation’s greatest victories over ‘old enemy’ France – the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. The January 31 meeting, which ironically is due to include talks on greater Anglo-French military co-operation, has now been moved to the windswept airfield of RAF Brize Norton. Blenheim Palace, a World Heritage Site at Woodstock, north of Oxford, was the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill and has an imposing sculpture of an English lion savaging a French cock as a symbol of military triumph. A well-placed Government source said last night: ‘Cameron came up with the bright idea of staging the meeting at Blenheim. But given what it celebrates, the PM was politely but firmly warned that he would be rubbing Hollande’s nose in it a bit.’ A Tory MP last night added: ‘Maybe Cameron was just feeling a bit sorry for Hollande given all the fuss about his private life. ‘At least tucked away on a military base, he may not have to worry about which First Lady he brings with him.’","First Lady supposedly wants to forgive French President for alleged affair .

"By . Glen Owen . Tony Blair’s friendship with Wendi Deng is set to light up the West End when a satirical new play about Rupert Murdoch opens later this year. The stage show Rupert will chart the 82-year-old press baron’s career in cabaret style, covering his turbulent private life, his proximity to powerful politicians and the toxic fallout from the newspaper hacking scandal. British producers have signed a deal to turn the Australian play, which had a sell-out run in  Melbourne last year, into a UK hit – and promise that it will be ‘updated to take account of recent events’. Key players: Details of the feud between Murdoch, Deng and Blair revealed by Mail on Sunday will hit the stage . It means the writers have licence to feature the sensational revelations by The Mail on Sunday that the mogul had discovered that his wife had spent weekends with Mr Blair at Mr Murdoch’s homes. Their closeness brought problems in the 14-year Murdoch marriage to a head and causing a ‘terminal rift’ between the two men. Mr Blair denies that he had an affair with Ms Deng. Rupert, created by award-winning playwright David Williamson, tells Mr Murdoch’s life story in his ‘own words’, including via supposed messages sent by the Twitter-savvy octogenarian. In the version seen by Australian audiences Ms Deng, played by HaiHa Le, is at one point seen  pouting on all fours, dressed in a miniskirt, in what one critic described as ‘a jaw-dropping orientalist portrayal’. Mr Blair appeared fleetingly as a caricature in the Australian version of the play, which ran before news broke of the Blair-Deng friendship, but there was no mention of his closeness to 45-year-old Ms Deng. Script: The British producers developing the Australian play are seeking legal advice as they reconstruct the relationships in the media mogul's life, based on allegations revealed last year about the former Prime Minister . The producers – who say they are taking careful legal advice on how to update the play for British audiences – have plenty of new material they could introduce about the former Prime Minister. Our revelations included the discovery of a note written by Ms Deng to herself in which she said she had a ‘crush’ on Mr Blair, and the fact that they met on a superyacht owned by music billionaire David Geffen without Mr Murdoch’s knowledge. Mr Murdoch, who divorced Ms Deng four months ago, could be shown ‘raging’ at the news of the friendship. The producers could also highlight Mr Blair’s presence at the baptism of the Murdochs’ daughter, Grace, on the banks of the River Jordan in 2010: Mr Blair, who was dressed in flowing white robes for the ceremony, is the girl’s godfather. Two different actors will play  ‘junior Rupert’ and ‘senior Rupert’, who interact together on the stage. According to one West End agent, Sir Ian Mckellen or David Morrissey could be approached to play  Mr Murdoch at the different stages of his life, while Michael Sheen could reprise his Tony Blair impersonation. Stars: Sir Ian McKellen has been tipped for a role in the show, hitting UK stages later this year . Michael Sheen, left, and David Morrissey, right, have also been named as potential cast members . Last night, Daniel Sparrow, the producer who has secured the rights to mount the production in the UK, said that the script would be ‘localised’ with ‘some more UK specific plot points’. Asked if he would be updating the play to include the Blair-Deng relationship, Mr Sparrow said: ‘My solicitors are advising on these aspects, so I cannot confirm which plot points we are considering. ‘It is too soon to speculate what updates will or won’t be incorporated, especially related to Blair, or on the casting. ‘We need to act upon the advice of our lawyers. We will address such updates later on in the production process.’ ‘I am confident that UK audiences will find David Williamson’s new play fast-paced, humorous, enlightening and a wholly riveting evening of theatrical entertainment.’ The play will also cover the Murdoch family’s in-fighting, the arguments over whether he exerts undue influence over politicians and the reverberations from the phone- hacking scandal at his now-defunct News of the World.","Based on Australian show about Murdoch which had sell-out run last year .

"By . Damien Gayle . Nintendo has admitted that it's latest console, the Wii U, has flopped, causing serious problems for the company behind such iconic games franchises as Mario Brothers and the Legend of Zelda. The Japanese video games maker had been counting on the new console to revive its fortunes amid cut-throat competition from Microsoft's new XBox One and Sony's recently released PlayStation 4. But despite the highest U.S. spending on consoles for three years in the run up to Christmas, the company has been forced to slash its sales forecast for its flagship device by 70 per cent. Flop: Nintendo has announced that sales of its Wii U tablet have been abysmal, forcing it to slash its sales forecast by 70 per cent and issue a warning of a ¥35billion ($336 million) operating loss in the year to March . 'We failed to reach our target for hardware sales during the year-end, when revenues are the highest,' the Osaka-based company said in a statement. 'As a result, the sale of high-margin software fell far short of our projections.' Nintendo now says it expects an operating loss of ¥35billion ($336 million) for the year to end-March, after poor sales of its Wii U and 3DS game machines during the crucial holiday season. The move reverses its previous forecast of a ¥100billion profit and would mark the third consecutive year of operating losses for the embattled company. The warning comes just three months . after Nintendo stood by its sales projections for the Wii U, and amid a . general spring back in consumers' demand for new video games consoles. Sales . of video games hardware in the U.S. last December were up 28 per cent . compared to the previous year, with shoppers taking him $1.37billion . worth of the technology in the run up to Christmas, Bloomberg reports. 'Far short of our projections': Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata holds up one of his company's tablet-style Wii U consoles . 'The newest consoles from Microsoft and Sony are off to a tremendous start,' said NPD Group analyst Liam Callaghan. 'Xbox One led consoles sales in December, while PS4's two-month total makes it the best selling console during the two-month launch window.' The Wii U's dismal sales are a major blow to Nintendo president Satoshi Iwata, who has repeatedly had to scale back sales projections for the console as it failed to emulate the success of its hugely popular predecessor, the Wii. Mr Iwata told a briefing a year ago, when the company warned of its second consecutive year of operating losses, that he had 'made a commitment' to achieve an operating profit of ¥100billion or more in the year to March 2014. 'The fact that the 'Wii U strategy' has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,' said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. 'The company appears to have failed to differentiate the Wii U from the Wii,' he said, adding that his own 10-year-old son, who owns a Wii and DS, had shown no interest in the Wii U. Despite the surge in U.S. sales of rivals' machines, commentators are warning that the whole industry faces fierce competition from non-specialist hardware like smartphones and tablets boasting thousands of inexpensive games apps. Ownership of such devices, dominated by Google's Android OS and Apple's iOS, has mushroomed in the past five years and shifted the gaming goalposts into consumers' pockets. Nintendo on Friday also warned of a net loss of ¥25billion for the year ending on March 31, a substantial reversal from its prior projection of a ¥55billion profit. It now expects revenues of ¥590billion, down 36 per cent from its prior forecast. It cut its full-year dividend to ¥100 from ¥260. The company slashed its global Wii U sales forecast for the business year by almost 70 per cent, to 2.8 million units from 9million, and its 3DS sales forecast to 13.5million units from 18million units. Nintendo shares have fallen almost 10 per cent since hitting a two-and-a-half year high of 15,880 yen on January 10. The stock climbed 55 per cent in 2013, in line with a 57 per cent rally by the benchmark Nikkei average but underperforming a 91 per cent surge by rival Sony.","Nintendo had been counting on the Wii U to revive its fortunes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, has released an additional 400 pages of once-secret security documents in response to changes laid out by President Obama on Friday relating to the nation's polarizing surveillance practices. The declassification of the spy documents is part of a move by Obama to make public as much information as possible concerning the controversial bulk telephone-data-collection program that has angered many Americans over the six months. The documents were posted on the DNI's website. Going public: James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, has declassified a raft of documents, at the request of President Obama, relating to the nation's controversial cell phone surveillance program . In a speech about the National Security Agency (NSA) on Friday, President Obama trimmed the powers of the secretive US eavesdropping agency . Furor: Protests erupted after the extent of the US cellphone surveillance program were exposed by Edward Snowden last year . Obama issued the order in response to an international firestorm over the sweeping nature of the nation's spying that kicked up last summer when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden began disclosing details of the surveillance programs, according to Fox News. In his speech Friday, Obama said the NSA will need approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court each time it searches the trove of phone data. Under the current system, cleared NSA analysts have had ready access to the phone records in an online archive since 2006 when the court first approved the FBI's request to begin the bulk phone records collection. One of the newly-released documents, dated Aug. 18, 2006, details how the FISC court approved a request from then-FBI Director Robert Mueller for 'all call-detail records' or 'telephony meta data'. In the document approving the metadata collection program, the court said the data requested includes 'comprehensive routing information, including but not limited to session identifying information (e.g., originating and terminating telephone number, communications device identifier, etc.), trunk identifier, telephone calling card numbers and time and duration of call'. It also specifies that the data will not include 'substantive content of any communication' or the name, address or financial information of a subscriber or customer. In brief, phone numbers and call durations are stored, but the conversation and communication itself is not. Former CIA technical assistant Edward Snowden revealed details of top-secret surveillance conducted by the NSA regarding telecom data . A protester in a mask depicting U.S. President Barack Obama calls for the U.S. eavesdropping on the leaders of close friends and allies to be stopped . The latest declassification and release of intelligence agency records brings the total of documents made public to 2,300 pages, including orders and opinions of the FISC and pleadings before it, documents the intelligence community provided to Congress, training slides and other internal memos describing the legal basis for the programs and how they operate. Obama has been under pressure since Snowden took an estimated 1.7 million documents from the NSA and gave them to journalists around the world. The U.S. public, Congress and allies overseas were shocked to learn the extent of the NSAâ€™s post-9/11 surveillance. Soon after Snowdenâ€™s disclosure in June, Obama promised to review the system that has changed rapidly as technology improved. On Friday, Obama defended the work of the U.S. spying apparatus as necessary to protect Americans and international allies. He left the programs mostly intact, but added restrictions .","In a speech about the National Security Agency (NSA) on Friday, President .

"By . Wills Robinson . When it was first manufactured in 1948, the Citroen 2CV was seen as an innovative car that could be driven by a peasant. Nicknamed the 'Tin Snail', it has now become a classic, known for being easy to drive, cheap and simple to maintain. That's why a group of motoring enthusiasts have clubbed together to modify 16 of the vehicles and race them in some of the world's most stunning locations. Their first excursion, the Marrakech Express Rally, was a 2,000 mile, 12-day trip around Morocco, encompassing the Atlas Mountains, a number of souks, the Torda Gorge and the magnificent sunsets. The cars have a measly 29 brake horse powers and can reach speeds of up to 75mph, but were still able to tackle the gruelling terrain. John Brigden, 60, from Cranleigh, Surrey, who organsied the trip, said: 'They are iconic cars. They are not fast, but people still love seeing them on the road. We just wanted to do something different. They are easy to drive and they hold onto the road well.' The race, held over numerous stages, was won by former McLaren Team Manager, Alistair Caldwell, who helped James Hunt win the F1 title in 1976. Scroll down for video . Cruising: The group drove the modified Citroen 2CVs 2,000 miles over 12 days from Malaga on the south coast of Spain and all over Morocco. The French classic, also known as a 'Tin Snail', has a measly 29 brake horse powers . Held up: A convoy of the 2CVs slow down as a local walks his two camels across the desert. Their journey took in various terrains including sand, gravel, mud and tarmac . Surface: The team, who wanted to do something 'completely different', aimed to visit the roads less travelled . Snow-covered mountains: The fleet of 16 cars, which were modified using parts bought off eBay, were set different tasks on different days of the race. They included time trials and average speed tests . One draws out the name of the car in letters as the sun sets over the desert . The first design by Pierre Boulanger in the early 1930s was for a low-priced, rugged 'umbrella on four wheels'. The aim was that two peasants would be able to drive 100kg of farm goods to market at around 40mph, wearing clogs and across muddy unpaved roads if necessary. But when it was first manufactured in France in 1948, it was considered technologically advanced, innovative and stood out with its unconventional appearance. It featured four-wheel suspension, front wheel drive, inboard brakes, and even detachable body panels. Car Magazine journalist L.J.K Setright described it as: 'The most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car.' The 2CV also became a huge commercial trimpuh . After just a couple of months on sale, there was a three-year waiting list. Production was increased from four units per day in 1949 to 400 units per day in 1950. Some of the early models were built at CitroÃ«n's plant in Slough, England. After nearly 50 years, the last was produced in 1990 and driven out of a Mangualde, Portugal where manufacturing had moved. More than 5 million were produced. Upgrade: The group of motoring enthusiasts and former racing drivers installed roll cages into the cars which have a top speed of around 75mph . After dark: Drivers park one of the 66-year-old cars on a hill in order to watch the sunset over the desert . Rubble: The cars took on narrow roads surrounded by rocks. The route included passes over the Atlas Mountains and the Torda Gorge . Cliff: The cars, which are nearly 70 years old, had to navigate sharp turns surrounded by steep drops . Spectators: Locals greeted them as they wove through a remote village. A support crew followed the vehicles to make sure they stayed on the road . Difficult terrain: The cars are parked up as the team climb to the top of a sand dune in the middle of the desert. The team carried wheel-rims - 102 in total - tyres, engines and gearboxes during the trip . Overtake: On the tarmac roads they covered during the trip, they passed other forms of transport, including a donkey being led by a local . Wildlife: The team met companions during the trip, including a monkey on the side of a road. The team said they had limited mechanical problems during the journey . Entrance: One of the cars passes through a gate outside the desert town of Tazzarine, en route to the sandy roads of Morocco . Architecture: Another vehicle passes through the archway of a desert town. Special stages tested the cars' abilities to maintain an average speed over a distance . Causing a splash: A lead car drives through a puddle on one of Morocco's rural roads. The race was won by former McLaren Team Manager, Alastair Caldwell, who helped James Hunt to an F1 World Championship victory in 1976 .

"By . Associated Press . Jurors in Cheyenne are set to begin deliberating in the trial of a 75-year-old Missouri woman accused of killing her husband in Wyoming in the mid-1970s. Alice Uden, of Chadwick, Missouri, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Ronald Holtz. Jurors heard closing arguments Tuesday and the judge dismissed them for the day after they got the case Tuesday evening. Actions of the past: Alice Uden listens to the judge during jury selection last week. Uden faces one count of first-degree murder for allegedly killing her husband nearly 40 years ago. The jury are about to begin their deliberation . Prosecutors allege Alice Uden, 75, and husband Gerald Uden, 71, each murdered their spouses before later marrying each other, though the cases have not been officially linked . Uden testified she shot her 24-year-old husband at their Cheyenne home to stop Holtz as he was set to attack her 2-year-old daughter. Prosecutors say Uden shot her husband as he slept. Uden met Holtz when she was a nurse at a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan, and Holtz, who'd been a helicopter gunner in Vietnam, was a psychiatric patient. Uden's attorneys say Holtz became abusive soon after they married in September 1974, and Uden shot him in the back of the head when he was about to attack the little girl. Last week, prosecutors called Uden's . daughter, Theresa Twyford, 55, of Naples, Illinois, to testify. Twyford . said Friday her mother once told her, too, she shot Holtz as he slept. The 'matter of fact' conversation happened in Illinois, she said, where Twyford was living at . the time in the 1970s. Both she and her mother had been drinking, she . said. Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 11, right, were shot in the back of the head by their stepfather Gerald Uden. He is now serving life in prison for their murders . Last fall, authorities arrested Alice Uden and her fourth and current husband, Gerald Uden, 71, in Missouri. Gerald . Uden subsequently pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison for . killing his ex-wife and her two children in central Wyoming in 1980, . however investigators haven't linked the two cases. Mr Uden's ex-wife Virginia Uden, 32, and her two sons, Richard, 11, and Reagan, 10, went missing in September 1980. A couple of months later, sheriff's deputies found the family's Ford station wagon, with blood stains in it, abandoned off the side of a mountain road. Uden told a courtroom in Lander he shot the three with a .22-caliber rifle before dumping their bodies first in an abandoned mine, then in Fremont Lake north of Pinedale in western Wyoming. Investigators spent a couple of days searching the 600-foot-deep lake last fall before calling off the search for the winter. The search for the bodies remains suspended. He is serving a life sentence, the same penalty Mrs (Alice) Uden could face.","Alice Uden, 74, and her husband Gerald Uden, 71, were both arrested at their home in Missouri and charged with murder last fall .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . NRL coach Craig Bellamy today led tributes to his former teammate Ryan Tandy at his funeral, as the tragic rugby ace's mother told mourners she was 'proud to be his mum'. Ryan Tandy, 32, was found dead at his parents’ home in Saratoga, New South Wales, last week after a suspected drug overdose. Bellamy led the tributes at today's funeral service, telling mourners Tandy would always be remembered as a ‘larrikin’ who had a good sense of fun. Final farewell: Pictured is the order of service for the funeral of Ryan Tandy who was laid to rest on Wednesday . Heartfelt eulogy: Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy led the tributes during the service . 'Will never be forgotten': Bellamy described Tandy as a 'larrikin' with a good sense of fun during his speech . The Melbourne Storm coach added that he will ‘never forget’ the front-rower during his eulogy in Palmdale on the Central Coast on Wednesday afternoon. According to the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘He told you exactly what he was thinking and I liked that about him. ‘When he got into first grade he was telling me who should and shouldn’t have been in the team. I was Origin coach at the time and he told me who should and shouldn’t have been in that team too.’ A host of sports stars attended the service for former Ireland national player – who also played for Melbourne Storm and the Canterbury Bulldogs as well as five British teams. Former Bulldogs captain Andrew Ryan, Brett Finch, Michael Sullivan and Roosters playmaker James Maloney also attended the service. They were joined by Tandy’s Central Coast Storm teammates Alex Moore and Alan Munro. Tandy’s mother Carol, who was supported by his brothers Ben and Scott, told the gathering she was proud of her son. ‘I stand before you with my head held high and can proudly say I’m Ryan Tandy’s Mum. There wasn’t a day he wasn’t loved and I’m thankful for every day I had with him,’ she was quoted as saying in a Daily Telegraph report. She added that her son had been trying to turn over a new leaf when he died after several brushes with the law following his life ban from the NRL for match-fixing in 2012. The former journeyman front-rower had been living at his parents' apartment as part of his bail conditions after he was charged with allegedly kidnapping a man on January 16. Talented: Ryan Tandy played for five British clubs as well as five NRL clubs. He also played for Ireland in the Rugby League World Cup . 'Proud': Carol Tandy (pictured right) told mourners she was thankful for everyday she had with her son Ryan . Paying their respects: Numerous sports stars who played with Tandy over the years also attended the service . Teammates: Melbourne Storm player Brett Finch was among the mourners at the service . Tributes poured in from across Australia following the news of his death. A statement from Rugby League Ireland, for whom Tandy played in the 2008 World Cup, said: ‘Rugby League Ireland would like to pass on our condolences to the family and friends of Ryan Tandy. ‘Ryan was a larger than life character and we would like to express our thanks for the commitment during the World Cup.' Hull's Kingston Rovers rugby league club said in a statement: 'The club are shocked and saddened by the news of the death of former player Ryan Tandy. 'Ryan served Hull Kingston Rovers with distinction during his time with the club and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.’ ‘It's important that people know who the real Ryan Tandy was ... he was a generous man with his time,' Tandy's former coach Keiran Dempsey told Triple M. Over the course of his tumultuous career, Tandy featured in 36 NRL games across five clubs. Born in Wollongong in 1981, he began playing for St George Illawarra in 2003 before joining South Sydney midway through that season. Tandy, whose father was born in Birmingham, spent time in Britain where he played for five clubs including Doncaster and then Hull KR in the English Super League in 2007. He also played five matches for Ireland in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.","Ryan Tandy, 32, was found dead at his parents' home last week .

"By . Dan Bloom . It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. Eight colonies each about the size of a tablet computer have been set up to teach experts how to build robots which interact with each other. Welcome: Nasa astronaut Rick Mastracchio greets 800 new friends aboard the International Space Station. Scientists will study how ants work together in low gravity and copy their methods to develop robots . Small steps: Each of the eight colonies is the size of a tablet computer and can be expanded to examine how the insects work together in different-sized environments . As the colonies are expanded, the ants move from small circles to straight lines to cover more ground . Houseguests: The colonies were delivered alongside Christmas presents for ISS astronauts . It is because ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell. Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies. When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground. But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work. These flexible principles could then be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building. Video cameras are trained on the experiment and images of the pavement ants, as they are known, are being beamed back to Earth. Close-up: The images will be beamed back to Earth. Pictured: Nasa flight engineer Mike Hopkins . Significant: The experiment could help develop robots which search disaster zones or burning buildings . These will be monitored by students at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and compared to a similar colony in their classroom. Stefanie Countryman, a professor at Bioserve Space Technologies, the private firm which launched the mission, told Bionews Texas: 'When ant densities are high, each ant thoroughly searches one small area in a circular, â€˜randomâ€™ walk. 'When ant densities are low, each ant searches by walking in a relatively straight line, allowing it to cover more ground.' The unusual cargo was delivered by an unmanned supply rocket this week which also included 28 mini-satellites known as Doves. Each less than 2ft across, they contain ultra high definition cameras which could track crop harvests, climate change and natural disasters like wildfires and floods. The cargo also included Christmas presents for those aboard the International Space Station - which were supposed to be delivered last month. The ants' launch had to be delayed several times after emergency repairs, America's 'polar vortex' of cold weather and a strong solar storm all intervened.","800 common pavement ants are now living on International Space Station .

"By . Wills Robinson . A talented football coach has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering a man during a 'horrific scene of complete bedlam' at Westfield Stratford shopping centre just weeks before the 2012 Olympic Games. A thrown yoghurt pot sparked the mass brawl between two gangs in June 2012, during which Liam Woodards, who had been out celebrating his 24th birthday, was stabbed, the Old Bailey heard. Nii-Azu Kojo-Smith, 19, lunged forward and knifed him in the chest in front of horrified shoppers. Nii-Azu Kojo-Smith, 19, has been jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years after he stabbed Liam Woodards to death at Westfield Stratford Shopping Cenntre in London, just weeks before the 2012 Olympic games . As the victim lay dying, the fight moved on to Stratford Tube Station where one of Mr Woodards’s friends stabbed one the opposing gang members. Following a three-month retrial, Kojo-Smith, 19, of Hackney, east London, was found guilty of Mr Woodards’s murder and was told he would spend at least 18 years in prison. The Old Bailey heard that Kojo-Smith had a previous conviction for battery and threatening behaviour in 2010 after he was involved in a group attack on a passenger at Finsbury Park Tube station. In mitigation, the court heard he was a talented young footballer who was involved in coaching. 'Bedlam': The court heard horrified shoppers had to run for cover as the brawl broke out (file picture) His lawyer Philippa McAtasney QC said: 'He was a talented footballer. He had obtained an FA1 coaching certificate and his future was set - all of that thrown away in a second of his behaviour.' She said he knew what he did was 'very wrong' and saying sorry to the victim’s family was not enough. Detaining Kojo-Smith for a minimum of 18 years, the judge Richard Marks QC said: 'The shopping centre at that time was full of men, women and children going about their business. 'It was a horrific scene of complete bedlam as many members of the public ran for safety into shops which swiftly closed their doors. Centre: The shopping centre is next to Stratford International Station and  opened just a short time before the Olympic Games. The Old Bailey heard it was busy at the time of the 'horrific fight' (file picture) 'It was readily apparent that those caught up in those appalling events must have been and were absolutely terrified.' The court heard much of the fight was captured on CCTV which was shown during the trial. Co-defendant Tony Caton, 22, of Stratford, was convicted of two counts of violent disorder and Anselm Legemah, 19, of east London, was convicted of one count of violent disorder. Caton was handed three years in jail while Legemah, whose girlfriend was heavily pregnant at the time, was sentenced to two years in a young offenders institution. The judge praised the victim’s parents for their dignified conduct throughout the trial. He said: 'The parents of Liam Woodards have attended every day of the trial. They have earned the respect of the court by the fact they have conducted themselves with dignity throughout in what must have been a shocking ordeal. 'I express hope the conclusion of the trial will bring them some closure.'","Liam Woodards was murdered during scenes of 'complete bedlam'

"By . Harriet Arkell . Royal Naval Air Service pilot William Sambrook, 22, told in his diary how German pilots helped the British in WW1 . British and German airmen went to astonishing lengths to help each other in the First World War, warning each other where they were about to drop bombs and sending photographs of graves when they buried the other side's dead. The extraordinary level of cooperation has been uncovered during research for an exhibition commemorating the conflict’s outbreak. Diaries kept by a young pilot from Pembrokeshire reveal how camaraderie sometimes took precedence over hostilities, particularly amongst British and German pilots. Notes taken by Royal Naval Air Service pilot William David Sambrook, 22, suggest German pilots warned their British enemies of where they were planning to drop bombs. Posted to Coudekerque airfield near Calais in 1916, Mr Sambrook's diaries tell of almost daily bombing raids on German-held aerodromes, as well as the docks, and Zeppelin sheds at Bruges and Zeebrugge. One day in May 1916, according to his diary, one of their number failed to return from a raid on Ostend aerodrome, and there were rumours that the missing aircraft had been picked up from the sea by a Belgian trawler. A few days later, with still no news of the missing man, one of Mr Sambrook’s colleagues flew over the German airfield and dropped a message asking if they had information about his fate. The British pilots received a prompt reply, also dropped from the air, confirming that the aircraft had indeed been shot down over the sea. Sambrook wrote in his diary: 'They said attempts had been made at rescue, but when the machine was brought in,the pilot was already dead. 'He was buried with full military honours alongside two comrades at Marrakerke cemetery, Ostend. The message was accompanied by two photos of the funeral and the grave.' The diary went on: 'There was also a message in German stating the name and place in German territory where our machines could land if they had engine trouble.' Alan Wakefield, head of photographs at the Imperial War Museum, said such cooperation was much more common among pilots than among those fighting the war on the ground. He said: 'I know of cases where German pilots dropped notes and photographs of a crashed aircraft and its occupant, saying they’d buried him and asking for his name so they could make a headstone,' he said. 'In one instance, a German pilot dropped a note saying he was about to bomb an airfield and suggesting that those on the ground should get out of the way'. But he said the tip-off giving details of a safe landing place was probably no more than a German joke. Mr Sambrook flew a Sopwith Camel plane like this - such planes shot down more than 1,200 enemy aircraft in WW1 . Mr Wakefield said: 'I think it’s more likely to have been an example of German humour - they wouldn’t have expected the British to take them up on it.' Mr Sambrook was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for gallantry in the air in 1917. Towards the end of the war, he went on to become one of the first pilots to engage in ‘deck flying’, taking off in Sopwith Pups and Camels from short platforms built on gun turrets on what were to be the forerunners of aircraft carriers. He survived his time in France and, after a career working in the public health department of Westminster City Council, he returned to Pembrokeshire to live with his sister in Deerland, Llangwm. His nephew, Richard Palmer, still lives in the same house and has kept his diaries and logbooks safe. 'He was a lovely man' said Mr Palmer.  'But he never spoke to us about his war record.' At the outbreak of hostilities, warring nations had limited air forces which flew slow and unarmed reconnaissance planes into enemy territory. But aerial warfare was quickly developed by both sides, initially with bombs being dropped by hand and pistols being used on occasions. Machines guns were mounted to the front of planes as well as being fitted to observers’ platforms on two-seaters and intense battles commenced. The German air force pioneered the use of ‘flying wings’ – large numbers of aircraft patrolling into enemy territory together. Legendary German fighter ace Manfred Von Richtofen, aka the Red Baron, flew this Fokker Triplane . Manfred von Richtofen, the celebrated ace known as the Red Baron because of the colour of his Fokker triplane, led such ‘flying circuses’ and became a hero among German soldiers. In Britain, the Royal Flying Corps, which was the Army’s flying service and the Royal Naval Air Service were amalgamated in 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. By this stage of the war, advanced planes such as Bristol Fighter were flying as high as 18,000ft achieving speeds of 123mph. In October 1918, the heaviest bomb of the war was dropped by a Handley Page at 1,650lb, an unthinkable weight at the beginning. Right up until the end of the war, the various nations’ air forces were evenly matched, suffering similar numbers of losses.","Diaries written by young pilot from Pembrokeshire give insight into the war .

"By . Richard Spillett . Benefits Street star White Dee will NOT face an investigation into her finances despite public anger over her high-profile holiday in Magaluf. The most famous resident of Birmingham's James Turner Street has come in for fierce criticism after she was seen partying in the Spanish resort - despite claiming she's too depressed to work. Her agent Barry Tomes has now insisted she is not under investigation over the four-day trip and could go away every month to help combat her depression. Scroll down for video . White Dee, who starred in the Channel 4 documentary Benefits Street, is not being investigated by the Department of Work and Pensions despite being pictured on holiday in Magaluf, her agent has said . Dee - who gets around £200 a week in state support - could now make more trips abroad to help her depression . It was claimed earlier this week that . Dee - real name Diedre Kelly - could be questioned by officials over whether her financial . or medical circumstances had changed since the Channel 4 show. The mother of two, who is said to receive around £200 a week from . the state, was pictured downing shots and clutching bottles of champagne . while on a trip to Majorca last week. But . Mr Tomes told the Daily Star he and Dee are in constant contact with . the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and 'have recieved no . correspondence from them whatsoever'. Mr Tomas was also quoted by The Sun saying his client is now planning trips to France and Spain to raise her mood. The paper said he told her: 'I'm taking you on holiday every month until you conquer your depression.' The 42-year-old told the TV programme she has been left too depressed to work since her mother died . She was pictured sipping cocktails and lying on sun-loungers in the beach resort last week . During . the controversial documentary Benefits Street, Dee said she had . suffered from depression since her mother died and has 'good days and . bad days' with the condition. Since returning from holiday, she has denied downing £500 bottles of champagne and insisted she ‘f****** hated the stuff’. Mr Tomes told MailOnline earlier this . week: ‘Dee has been back in the UK since Saturday. Dee had lots of fun . as the many pictures show. ‘She missed the children [and] she . hates flying, but she understands why we are trying to get her active to . help us decide the suitability for some projects we would like her to . undertake in the future. ‘She is not on Job Seekers’ Allowance . as reported - she is on [Employment and] Support Allowance. We have been . in touch with the benefits agency since we started to represent Dee in . February.’ It is now said the single mother-of-two will not face a quiz from benefits officials . She may be too depressed to work, but that didnt stop White Dee partying hard on holiday in Magaluf . The Department . for Work and Pensions has refused to comment on her case directly, but . was prompted to mount a fresh defence of its welfare plans following . anger at her holiday. A . DWP Spokesman said: 'We are reforming disability benefits by . introducing a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews for . Disability Living Allowance - something missing under the old system. 'We . are also re-assessing people on incapacity benefits to see what work . they can do - with the right support - rather than just writing them off . on sickness benefits as happened in the past. 'Our welfare reforms will ensure that support goes to those who need it most.' There . is no suggestion Dee has broken the rules, but since starring in Benefits Street she has appeared on TV several times . and been linked with a string of new jobs including standing as an MP . and becoming a TV chef. The Benefits Street star was spotted enjoying an all-expenses-paid, mid-week trip to Majorca . Dee is now back in her council house on Birmingham's James Turner Street after returning from the holiday . This week she took to Facebook to deny claims that she drank . champagne while on her holiday. Dee, 42, said: ‘I’m . turning into Jesus - making cloudy lemonade turn into booze. You gotta . love the press haha.’ And, responding to a supportive comment, she . added: ‘F****** hate the stuff hun haha.’ Mr Tomes has insisted she was not paid for going on the trip and told the Mail how she was currently . considering an offer to front a new cookery show. ‘What many people don’t know about Dee is that she is an amazing cook and has been offered her own cookery show,’ he said. He . added that she has had seven offers from production companies in total, . including from BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, as well as three . separate record deals, but has had to turn them down because she is ‘too . unwell’. ‘It is like a . light switch goes off when you are with her, sometimes she’s fine but . then suddenly her whole mood will change and there’s nothing you can . do,’ he said of her condition. ‘She could easily earn half a million from one of these, but she doesn’t want to at the moment.’","Mother-of-two White Dee not being investigated by authorities, says agent .

Officials say the 22-year-old was babysitting Zoie and was the boyfriend of the child's mother, Bailea Johnston. An autopsy performed on the toddler’s body determined the cause of death to be head trauma, Kalamazoo Gazette reported. Hains testified last week that he did not hurt Zoie and she suffered a seizure after falling from his arms. However, a pathologist told the jury the condition of the victim’s body was consistent with violent shaking or being struck. Baby Zoie was declared brain dead at Bronson Methodist Hospital on December 31, 2012. Her death was ruled a homicide caused by head trauma. Tests showed that the one-year-old had marijuana in her system and a blood-alcohol level of 0.087 - the equivalent of three drinks consumed by a grownup woman weighing 175lbs. Prosecutors said Hains, pictured here May 2, gave the toddler pot brownies and vodka before shaking or striking her to death . According to the prosecution, the toddler suffered fatal injuries December 30, 2012, while she was left in the care of her mother's live-in boyfriend, Toren Haines, at their apartment on South 11th Street in Oshtemo Township. During his murder trial, which got under way April 30, Hains testified that he did nothing to harm Bailea Johnston's daughter while she was at work that night. Hains told the jurors that he was holding Zoie in his arms and doing laundry when the child fell to the floor and suffered a seizure. But Dr John Bachniski, a pathologist from Sparrow Hospital, testified that the amount of trauma Zoie suffered pointed to a violent shaking and having been struck against a soft object. According to police, Hains took the unresponsive Zoie to a neighbor's apartment the night she was injured and asked him not to call 911. His version: Hains testified that he was holding Zoie in his arms when she fell and suffered a seizure . A Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputy testified that the night before the toddler’s death, Hains made a batch of pot brownies, lacing the baked goods with a bag of marijuana ‘the size of about a potato.’ The 22-year-old then allegedly fed baby Zoie some of the brownies, and also gave her a flavored drink containing vodka. ‘At the end of this trial you may not care for the parenting skills, or lack thereof, of Toren Hains, his lifestyle -- marijuana brownies, etc. -- but he's not on trial for being a druggie, he's not on trial for not paying the best attention or being the best parent,’ his attorney Keith Turpel told jurors in his opening statement.","Investigators say Toren Hains gave 14-month-old Zoie Grace Johnston pot brownies and a drink with vodka December 30, 2012 .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A violent thug who killed a vulnerable man with one punch will not have his 'lenient' four-year sentence extended, leading judges have ruled. Lewis Gill, 21, was convicted to just four years in prison over the death of Asperger's sufferer Andrew Young, whose mother branded the sentence 'an absolute joke'. It means he could be released within two years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is the shocking moment Andrew Young was punched by Lewis Gill. Mr Young died of head injuries a day later . Gill, 21, was sentenced to just four years for the attack in Bournemouth, and could be released within two . Despite hundreds of complaints, Lord Justice Treacy today ruled the four-year sentence was 'reasonable' Jailed: Convicted robber Lewis Gill (left) launched his attack after rowing with Mr Young (right) about a bicycle . Deluged with complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve called for an immediate review into what he deemed an 'unduly lenient' sentence. But today, Lord Justice Treacy told the Court of Appeal the sentence is 'reasonable' and not 'unduly lenient'. The shocking incident took place on a busy street in Bournemouth when Mr Young, 40, warned Victor Ibitoye that riding on the pavement was dangerous. When the conversation ended Lewis Gill, who was with Mr Ibitoye, punched Mr Young, taking him by surprise. Distressing CCTV footage shows the Asperger’s sufferer toppling back on to the road, violently striking his head. Gill, . who has a conviction for handling stolen goods as well as robbery, then . walks away, with a glance back at his motionless victim. Passers-by came to Mr Young’s aid but he died the following day in Southampton Hospital. His mother Pamela was at his bedside. The . sentence was imposed by Judge Keith Cutler, who was criticised for his . handling of the inquest into the gangster Mark Duggan, whose shooting by . police sparked the riots of 2011. Distraught: Pamela Young, Andrew Young's mother, branded the sentence 'an absolute joke' Speaking outside Salisbury Crown Court . in February, Andrew Young's mother Pamela said: ‘You can see Andrew . didn’t cause Lewis Gill any harm. ‘I . wish that awful man who took my son away had pleaded not guilty so he . would have got a longer sentence. The sentence is an absolute joke. ‘I’m a committed Christian but I think that if someone takes a life they should be prepared to forfeit their own.’ She said that too few killers served full sentences. Lord Justice Treacy made headlines in 2010 after becoming the first judge to support secret arrests. He presided over the first criminal case without a jury for 400 years. In 2011, he presided over the trial of Gary Dobson and David Norris for the racially aggravated murder of Stephen Lawrence. With today's ruling, Lord Justice Treacy supported Judge Keith Cutler, who handed Lewis Gill a four-year sentence for punching Andrew Young. Mr Cutler is the controversial judge who presided over the case of Mark Duggan, the gangster who was shot twice by police marksmen, sparking the London riots of 2011. Mr Cutler ordered the court to hold a 20-second silence for the 'regrettable loss of a young life'. Today, Victims’ Commissioner Baroness Newlove told MailOnline: 'This was a horrific act of violence and my heart truly goes out to Andrew’s family and friends. 'I think it was right that the Court of Appeal looked at this case again and I note with particular interest Lord Justice Treacy’s comments on the consideration of this wider issue. 'This is an area which I will discuss in one of my regular meetings with the judiciary on sentencing matters.' Supporting Judge Cutler, Lord Treacy said: 'We have concluded that the sentence imposed below is not one which can be described as unduly lenient. 'Indeed, . it seems to us that the sentence imposed was one within the reasonable . range available to the trial judge, properly weighing the relevant . factors and the guidance of this court.' His controversial words come weeks after convicted Gill's mother dismissed his crime as ‘no big deal’. In a display of callous indifference, Sherron O’Hagan said she did not know ‘what all the fuss was about’. The . 41-year-old mother of three told the Mail: ‘It was just an accident. It’s not a big deal. This will all be forgotten tomorrow. He’s my son, . what do you want me to say? He didn’t mean to kill him and that’s that.’ Mrs O’Hagan, who was not married to Gill’s father Richard McKenzie, added: ‘This story will be the lining of chips tomorrow. I just don’t understand what all the fuss is about.’ During the hearing, Mr Grieve outlined a number of 'aggravating factors' in the case. He said the victim was vulnerable because he suffered from Asperger's syndrome, telling the court: 'It is accepted that the offender had no means of knowing the detail of the victim's condition, but it was clear from the victim's unusual behaviour, as seen on the CCTV, that he was vulnerable.' The punch was delivered with deliberation in a place where a 'great many' members of the public were present. Mitigating factors included a guilty plea at an early stage, the expression of remorse, Gill's relatively young age, and the fact that the offence was not planned or premeditated. Concluding, Lord Treacy said: 'We readily understand that this is the sort of case that arouses public concern. 'If there are public concerns going beyond this case then it may well be appropriate for the wider issue to be the subject of detailed consideration and consultation by the Sentencing Council in the future. 'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic Grieve had called for a review into the sentence he deemed 'lenient' 'It is open to the Secretary of State for Justice or other interested bodies to invite the Sentencing Council to do so.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Grieve said: 'This was a case of gratuitous, unprovoked violence. 'It was broad daylight when Lewis Gill delivered a very deliberate, forceful and vicious punch. 'I asked the Court of Appeal to look again at this sentence as I believed it was unduly lenient. 'They have taken the view that the four-year sentence imposed on Lewis Gill should not be increased and I accept their decision entirely.'","Lewis Gill, 21, jailed for 4 years for manslaughter of Andrew Young, 40 .

The organizers of the annual Oscars Night Before Party have announced that they are joining the growing boycott of the Beverley Hills Hotel and will be hosting their event elsewhere in 2015. The hotel, one of the most popular in Hollywood, is feeling the effects of a protest campaign which is calling for a boycott after the owner, the Sultan of Brunei, last week introduced the Sharia Penal Code which condemns homosexuals to death by stoning amongst other things. The Motion Picture & Television Fund, which holds the annual fundraising event, has said it ‘cannot condone these harsh and repressive’ anti-gay laws that Brunei has introduced.

Jay Leno speaks at a gathering of Women's Rights and LGBT groups protesting across from the Beverly Hills Hotel owned by the Sultan of Brunei . During its 12 year history, the Night Before Party has grown to become one of the largest fundraising events in the Hollywood calendar raising more than $60 million since it began. Next year will be the first time that the event has been held somewhere other than the Beverley Hills Hotel. MPTF’s top executives issued a statement to The Hollywood Reporter explaining that they expressed their 'deep concern about the recent enactment of laws in Brunei that call for violent punishment, including amputation and death by stoning, against those engaging in same-sex activity and extramarital sexual relations and those committing adultery. 'We expressed very clearly that we cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws and as a result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei.' Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah last week introduced the Sharia Penal Code which condemns homosexuals to death by stoning . The MPTF joins a growing boycott of the Beverly Hills Hotel and other Dorchester Collection properties, which include the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. On Sunday, Virgin Records mogul Richard Branson tweeted that neither his family nor Virgin employees would stay at Dorchester Collection hotels 'until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.' Celebrities who have lent their voices to the call for a boycott include Ellen DeGeneres, Sharon Osbourne, British actor Stephen Fry and director William Friedkin. Jay Leno recently spoke at a gathering of Women's Rights and LGBT groups protesting across from the hotel. Shoe designers Brian Atwood and Peter Som have called for a boycott of the Dorchester Collection’s European properties during the various fashion weeks that take place abroad. The Dorchester Collection has said that it 'continues to abide by the laws of the countries we operate in and does not tolerate any form of discrimination of any kind.

"By . Ashley Collman . The crack-smoking mayor of Toronto was supposed to enter rehab after announcing a leave of absence last Wednesday. Ford reportedly got on a private plane bound for Chicago but he was turned away at the border, the Globe and Mail is reporting. Neither Ford's brother Doug Ford or his lawyer Dennis Morris will say where the exactly the mayor is, but insist he is seeking treatment as promised. Scroll down for video . Where are you? Rob Ford is pictured above on May 1, a day after he announced his leave of absence. He has now spoken out about rehab, calling it the best thing he ever did . Ford was last seen leaving his house the morning of May 1 to board a private plane at Buttonville Municipal Airport. He landed in Chicago but never formally entered the country. 'He voluntarily withdrew his application to enter the USA,' Ray Norton, Canada's Consul General in Chicago, told the Globe and Mail. Norton added that Ford 'was not declined entry, per se'. Norton didn't learn about the incident until after the fact, when he was notified by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Getting help: The mayor is seeking treatment for alcohol addition. Pictured above arriving at his home early Thursday morning after announcing his leave of absence . CBP spokesman Kris Grogan wouldn't comment on Ford's application, because of the privacy act, but pointed out that foreigners attempting to enter the U.S. can be barred on the grounds of 'criminality, security reasons and documentations, among dozens of others'. Ford's lawyer Dennis Morris wouldn't comment on where the plane went after the fact, since he wasn't on board. He maintains that Ford is in rehab, but when asked where, Morris said: 'I think it is close to Timbuktu.' 'The bottom line is he’s in rehab, he’s getting rehab and he’ll be there for a number of weeks – and that’s the answer. It’s not like he’s at a baseball game in Los Angeles or something,' Morris said. Back to drugs: Ford's announcement follows the emergence of yet another video showing him smoking what appears to be crack. A still from the new video released by the Globe and Mail, above . The mayor's brother Doug wouldn't even say which country he was in. He previously announced that Ford was seeking treatment at one of the best facilities in North America. 'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes. As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob,' Doug Ford said. But that's not enough for politicians in Toronto, who are demanding answers for Ford's whereabouts. 'The mayor should explain where he's going to be and how long he anticipates being there,' Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti told the National Post. 'I think everybody will leave him alone if he does that.' 'Right now nobody in this city believes him and trusts him on any of this. If a plane landed and he didn't get off, he better tell this city where he is going for treatment.' Infamous: Since the original crack video scandal, Ford has been the center of scandal after scandal. Pictured at a news conference with wife Renata (left) on November 14 . While the U.S. has barred foreigners from entering the U.S. before for noted drug use, such as when celebrity chef Nigella Lawson wasn't allowed to enter from the UK because she admitted to taking cocaine in a court case, Ford was allowed into the country as recently as March for an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. But that was before news broke of yet another tape in which the mayor appears to be smoking crack-cocaine. The same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26. Ford made headlines last year when another group in Toronto was trying to sell a different video of Ford smoking crack, and he refused to step down. The new video also corresponded to reports that Ford got drunk at a Toronto bar Sullie Gorman's on April 28, making lewd comments about mayoral competition Karen Stintz.

"David Walker went missing in Cambodia ten weeks ago. His body was found near the Gate of Death at the country's Angkor Wat temple (Pic: Tim Rowsell) A journalist, film maker and former member of a British Army anti-terrorist squad, who went missing in Cambodia ten weeks ago, has been found dead near the Gate of Death at the country's ancient Angkor Wat. The body of 57-year-old Canadian David Walker was discovered outside the temple by a passer-by who alerted police. Although it has been impossible to tell from the state of the body exactly how David Walker died, a statement made on behalf of the family clearly implied he was murdered and called on whoever was responsible for his death be brought to justice. Officials at . the Australian Embassy, who represent Canadian interests in Cambodia, . have been informed as have the Australian Federal as has the Canadian . Embassy in Bangkok. An . Australian Federal Police officer is going to the scene to assist the . Cambodian National Police and a pathologist is being called from Bangkok . in nearby Thailand. Walker's body was found near the east gate, known both as the 'Gate of Death' and Victory Gate, shortly after dawn.

Police . will have to determine independent investigators suspicions that he . died somewhere else and his body late dumped at the temple. Walker from Edmonton, Alberta, speaks Khmer, Thai and German as well as English. He served with the British Army in Germany and later joined the controversial 14th Intelligence Company in Northern Ireland. Members unit was later linked to the infamous attack by the UVF on the 'Miami Showband' and other loyalist bombings but Walker was not in the unit at the time. After leaving the army he made his name as a screen-writer and 'fixer' for film and television companies including a documentary with the BBC's Investigative journalist Sue Lloyd Roberts, and was also the co-author of a book 'Hello My Big Big Honey' about Thai bar girls' relationships with their western boyfriend/clients. Together with a Cambodian colleague Sonny Chhoun he ran a company in Cambodia called 'Animist Farm Films'. They were making a film about the charitable works of a former Khmer Rouge soldier. The Khmer Rouge under Pol Pol - Brother Number One - were responsible for Cambodia's 'Killing Fields'. Walker had not been seen since leaving the Green Village Angkor Guest House in Siem Reap three kilometres away on February 14th. He left leaving everything in his room including his mobile phone telling the maid to make the room up while he went out. The Canadian Government has been severely criticized by friends of Walker for doing nothing in his case. They claim that a consular official visited for 24 hours from Bangkok, refused to take charge of his possessions and left without even meeting his business partner Sonny Chhoun. Tammy Wallbridge-Madden Walker's cousin and only surviving relative said after being informed of the discovery: 'The authorities must bring to justice whoever was responsible for this.'","Canadian David Walker, 57, found dead near Angkor Wat in Cambodia .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Airman Daniel Wassom II spent his life putting others first - and his final act of selflessness was to use his body to shield his five-year-old daughter as a tornado demolished their Arkansas home. As the twister ripped through the town of Vilonia on April 27, the 31-year-old huddled with his wife and two daughters in the hallway of their Aspen Creek home - the hardest hit street in the area. But as a large piece of lumber crashed toward his family, Wassom threw himself in front of little Lorelai, taking a fatal blow to the neck. 'Lorelai kept telling the emergency room people, she said, ‘My daddy saved me; the house exploded and my daddy saved me; he’s a hero', Wassom's heartbroken mother Pamela Wassom told Air Force Times.  'And he is. He’s a true hero.' Hero: Master Sgt. Daniel 'Bud' Wassom II (pictured left and right) died after shielding his daughter from falling lumber as a tornado destroyed their home in Arkansas on April 27 .

Family members said Wassom's wife Suzanne, was also a hero, shielding their seven-year-old daughter, Sydney, when the tornado tore through their neighborhood. Suzanne moved both daughters to safety and helped a little boy who lived across the street. Suzanne was hospitalized with a concussion, and Lorelai suffered a shoulder injury. To relatives, Wassom's final act of heroism was not surprising. 'Dan always put his family first,' his grandmother Carol Arnett said, wiping away tears.

Relative Sherry Madden said the family had just returned home from church, where the girls were fighting over who got to sit next to dad: 'He was the best dad'. Wassom II served in the Arkansas Air National Guard's 189th Airlift Wing for 12 years as a loadmaster. His mother Pamela Wassom said her son had a college degree and could have trained to be a pilot, but he liked being a loadmaster. 'We're a military family. His father is retired Air Force. His grandfather was in the Navy. He joined right after 9/11,' she said. 'That boy loved his country. He was patriotic. He even volunteered to go to Kuwait a couple years ago, and he said if it hadn't been for the wife and kids, he would even have stayed longer.'

This aerial photo taken the day after the tornado hit on April 27 shows destroyed buildings and debris along U.S. Highway 64 in Vilonia, Arkansas . The half-mile-wide tornado which claimed Wassom II's life had carved an 80-mile path of destruction through the Little Rock suburbs. Twisters or powerful straight-line winds were blamed in at least 17 deaths on that dark Sunday - 15 of them in Arkansas. The tornado outbreak which hit Southern states continued the next day, responsible for at least nine more deaths in Mississippi and Alabama. LA Times reports the current death toll stands at around 34. Following the April 27 twister, most of the dead in Arkansas were killed in their homes in and around Vilonia, population 3,800. Firefighters searched for . anyone trapped amid the piles of splintered wood and belongings strewn . across yards. Hospitals took in more than 100 patients . The . tornado that hit Vilonia and nearby Mayflower was probably at least an . EF3 on the 0-to-5 EF scale, which means winds greater than 136 mph, . National Weather Service meteorologist Jeff Hood said.

A . few houses down from the Wassom family, neighbors Deanna Noble, 32, and Regina Chavez, 31, . couldn't find their trucks. Their homes were shredded and their vehicles . were missing, perhaps blown hundreds of yards away. Both tried clicking their truck remotes to see if they heard a distant honk. Nothing.

"By . Dr Ellie Cannon . I was so pleased that  Lady Louise Windsor, the daughter of Prince Edward  and the Countess of Wessex, appears to have had what  was a fairly dramatic squint corrected. With conditions like this, some people have a tendency to make unfair assumptions about someone’s character based purely on appearance. The family have chosen not  to reveal the details of ten-year-old Lady Louise’s treatment, and whether she had surgery  is not known. Before and after: Lady Louise Windsor in June 2013, left, and right, attenidng the Christmas Meeting at Ascot Racecourse in December after her correction . Although there are many options for treating a squint,  an operation shouldn’t be shied away from – it’s not simply a cosmetic treatment, but one that saves sight. Can’t some people with  a squint see just fine? People can learn to live with varying degrees of vision  and sight loss. But this condition, if untreated, usually leads to deterioration in the capabilities  of the affected eye, which is why treatment at a young age is recommended. A squint – the medical term is strabismus – is when the eyes do not align in their movements. One eye will look straight ahead, while the other turns inwards, outwards, upwards or downwards. As the eyes are focusing on different things, the brain ignores the signals from one eye to avoid ‘seeing double’. It’s this eye that becomes  weak, and eventually vision in it starts to worsen. The problem is often  something a child is born with, evident from birth, and it is due  to weaknesses in the muscles that surround the eye. A child is more at risk of a squint if they are born prematurely, like Lady Louise, or have a family history  of them. Saving grace: The squint, also known as a lazy eye, prevented Lady Louise, pictured before her operation with her mother Sophie Countess of Wessex, from seeing straight . Is surgery the only sure way of correcting it? No, it’s usually offered only once other options have proved ineffective. Glasses are one of the most common treatments for squints and are used firstly to correct any vision problem. But this can also correct the squint itself. Injections of Botox have now started to be used on the NHS for squints: this is injected into the eye muscles and allows them to realign. The younger the child, the higher the chances are of correction and preserving optimal vision. What about eye patches  – are they helpful? Patching is used for children with squints but is not a treatment. It can save the child’s vision, but doesn’t affect the cosmetic appearance. When a child has a squint, one eye becomes ‘lazy’ and loses vision – we call this amblyopia. This weaker eye points in the wrong direction and so doesn’t get all the visual stimuli the other one does. An eye needs these stimuli to develop proper visual pathways to the brain. A lazy eye will therefore not have proper development and  the child relies more and more  on the good eye. Patching is used to cover the good eye, which forces reliance on the weaker eye, and so it can start to develop proper visual pathways. The earlier this is done the better – often from age two.  If left untreated beyond the age of seven, it is usually too late to acquire full vision in the lazy eye. What does the  operation involve? Eye movements are controlled by a set of muscles, and corrective surgery moves these muscles to a new position to straighten the eyes. There is no scar – just a few dissolvable stitches are left inside the eye socket. It can be sore for a few days but recovery involves using the eyes as soon as the patient feels comfortable – to read, for example – so that they get used to working again. Is surgery always successful? Squint surgery is relatively straightforward, but a second operation for further alignment of the eyes is not uncommon. Estimates show that about one in five goes on to have a second operation. Is there a cut-off point –  can adults have squints corrected if they didn’t as children? The operation is possible with a good chance of an acceptable cosmetic result,  but it would be too late to correct a ‘lazy’ eye for visual acuity. As a rule, the earlier someone is treated, the better the outcome. Concerns about a child’s eyes should be a raised with a GP who can refer  to an orthoptist for assessment of the  eye muscles.","Lady Louise Windsor, aged ten, has had an eye problem corrected .

Garth, 21, stands accused of striking Mr Manalad and his of charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, common assault and affray is expected to upgraded when he appears at Blacktown Local Court tomorrow. A photo of a bottle of Southern Comfort posted to Garth's Facebook hours after the attack could provide a crucial bit of evidence as to whether he was drinking that night. Meanwhile, Saturday's fatal attack is the third of its kind to claim a young life in Sydney since 18-year-old Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie died on the streets of Kings Cross in July 2012. And like both of them, it appears Mr Manalad was yet another innocent victim. Friends and family have called for justice on Facebook declaring his death is yet another senseless act of violence. 'RIP Ray brother. Didn't know you well enough but through everything I've seen and heard the past few days you were loved by all. Heart goes out to all the family and loved ones. Rest well bro,'  Jeremy Nool posted to Facebook. Accused: Hugh Garth was fighting with his girlfriend before being accused of punching Raynor who was trying to quell the argument . Hugh Garth will appear in Blacktown local court on Wednesday where he will face charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, common assault and affray . Tony Xuan Nguyen said Raynor's last moments alive typified the kind of person he was. 'You can see the type of person Ray was, trying to break the fight up...' he said. Pat Canavan agreed, along with others who have started the online rally #justiceforray. 'Well said bro,' Mr Canavan wrote. 'He didn't deserve anything like that. At all. RIP Ray.' Another friend, Alyssa, described him as 'a beautiful sunset.' 'Hearing about your passing hits me like a ton of bricks. I cannot believe that you are gone. It hurts that you are no longer alive because you where the person who would always keep the peace in the group.' The mother of the man accused of the killing is still in shock, first made aware of her son's arrest when approached by Channel Nine on Monday. 'I was watching 60 minutes, on the news Saturday, and that's when my heart was pumping,' she said. She also said the severity of the situation was 'hard' for her to deal with. Since the deaths of Thomas Kelly and Daniel Christie, both 18, and a number of other serious assaults on Sydney's streets, new laws have been introduced to help curb alcohol-fueled attacks. The state government also introduced earlier lock-out and closing times for some of Sydney's busiest bars. In similar circumstances to this latest death, Daniel Christie was walking along the same street as Thomas when he was attacked by 25-year-old Shaun McNeil on New Year's Eve. Tragedy: A man has died in Westmead Hospital following another one-punch attack which occurred at a house party in Sydney's south . Mr Christie had been in a critical condition for 11 days before his family made the decision to turn off his life support. In December last year, Michael McEwen, 23, was attacked by up to three men at Bondi when he was punched to the ground and allegedly stomped on. All these incidences were the catalyst for new mandatory minimum sentencing laws imposed against people who commit such crimes. It was announced that anyone convicted of reckless grievous bodily harm or wounding a member of the public or a police officer while intoxicated can expect a minimum sentence of three to five years and a maximum penalty of up to 16 years. Former premier Barry O'Farrell said the new laws, which included a curfew on trading hours to 3am across the city, sent out 'the possible strongest message' that drug and alcohol-fuelled violence will no longer be tolerated.

"By . Damien Gayle . Legend: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has said that the scandal surrounding LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling is a symptom of wider racism in the U.S. White people are more likely to believe in ghosts than in racism, said Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in a strident contribution to the debate over the scandal surrounding Donald Sterling. The NBA legend said the bigoted remarks by the owner of the LA Clippers are evidence that prejudice against black people is still deeply ingrained in American culture. The former Lakers ace, who briefly coached the Clippers in 2000, said he believes the NBA has good grounds for removing Sterling from the sport. Abdul-Jabbar spoke as the NBA announced it was looking for an interim chief executive to guide the Clippers through its transition to a new owner after Sterling was banned for life by its most senior official. The new CEO will run the team while NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and his legal team try to force Sterling to sell. Sterling, a property tycoon who has owned the Clippers since 1981, has been roundly condemned after a recording of him ranting at his girlfriend for associating with black people. But Abdul-Jabbar told George Stephanopoulos on ABC News that he believes that Sterling's remarks are merely the tip of the iceberg, suggesting that there is a deeper problem with race in the U.S. that few dare to confront. 'This is a problem,' he told Stephanopous on This Week. 'I did a little bit of research, more whites believe in ghosts than believe in racism... 'That’s why we have shows like Ghostbusters and don’t have shows like Racistbusters. 'It’s something that’s still part of our culture and people hold on to some of these ideas and practices just out of habit and saying that, ""Well, that’s the way it always was."" But things have to change.' Abdul-Jabbar admitted he never experienced any racism from Sterling during his brief time coaching the Clippers in 2000 but, referring to charges of racial discrimination filed against him, he said the remarks heard in the recording published by TMZ 'certainly should not have been a surprise to anybody.' A long-time anti-racism campaigner, Abdul-Jabbar adopted his Muslim name in 1971 after converting to the religion while at university in the late-1960s. Now 67, he successfully combined one of the greatest ever careers in basketball - spanning 20 seasons - with work as an author and actor, and recently accepted a position as a cultural ambassador for the U.S. Scandal: LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling with girlfriend Vanessa Stiviano, to whom he made the bigoted remarks which have led to him being excised from basketball by the NBA's governing body . Visor: Stiviano, seen Thursday, has been seen around town in the wake of the controversy, but Sterling has kept a low profile . In a comment piece published by Time last night he expanded on his comments on the Sterling scandal, slamming the mostly white and Right-wing commentators and politicians who have in recent years asserted that 'racism is dead'. He wrote: 'Maybe the worst racism of all is denying that racism exists, because that keeps us from repairing the damage. This country needs a social colonoscopy to look for the hidden racist polyps. And we aren’t doing ourselves any good by saying, “I feel fine. Everything’s fine. Nothing to see here.""' Citing polls which have shown that black people in the U.S. are far more likely to flag up racism as a 'very serious' problem, Abdul-Jabbar argues that the reason so many white people seem to think that it is 'dead' is because it doesn't target them. 'That’s why the best way to combat racism in the face of selective attention and situational racism is to seek it out every minute of every day and expose every instance we find,' he goes on. 'And not just racism, but also sexism, homophobia and every other kind of injustice that lessens the principles of inclusion that define this country.' Abdul-Jabbar with Bruce Lee in a scene from Game Of Death: He combined one of the greatest ever careers in basketball with work as an author and actor, and recently as a cultural ambassador for the U.S. Any attempt to force Sterling to sell the Clippers would require a vote of approval from at least three-fourths of team owners. Those rumored to be interested in buying the team include Oprah Winfrey, Magic Johnson, music industry executive David Geffen and more. The Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors 126-121 in Game 7 of their playoff series on Saturday, to close out an emotional playoff series and advance to the Western Conference semifinals.","Abdul-Jabbar says he believes NBA has good grounds for removing Sterling .

"By . Emma Innes . A toddler who has spent almost all of her life battling cancer has received a special award. Grace Elvidge, one, was diagnosed with a very advanced form of leukaemia when she was just 11 weeks old. She has had to undergo months of chemotherapy treatment and has spent almost all of the first year of her life in hospital. Grace Elvidge (pictured with mother, Alexandra) was diagnosed with leukaemia when she was 11 weeks old . Now she has received a Little Star Award from Cancer Research UK in recognition of her struggle for life. Grace was so poorly that she was placed in intensive care, but she has since made a full recovery and is now in remission. Her mother, Alexandra Elvidge, 34, from Mobberley, Cheshire, said: ‘The painful memories are still so raw, but to look at Grace now, you'd never believe there is anything wrong with her, she's full of life - an absolute chatterbox.’ Just weeks after her birth in July 2012, Grace came down with a cold which would not go away. Her mother took her to a GP who thought Grace may have a viral infection. But her condition worsened and when Mrs Elvidge took her back to the doctor Grace was sent straight to Wythenshawe Hospital by ambulance. After a series of tests, Mrs Elvidge and husband Mark, 35, were told Grace's white blood count was very high. After months of chemotherapy, Grace is now in remission and has been allowed home . Grace was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where she was placed in intensive care. Doctors then broke the devastating news that she was suffering from acute myeloid leukaemia, an aggressive cancer of the white blood cells. Mrs Elvidge said: ‘By then Grace needed oxygen to breathe. ‘We were so concerned about how ill she was then that the leukaemia diagnosis almost seemed secondary to our worries.’ After two weeks Grace was well enough to leave intensive care but was immediately placed on a four-month cycle of intensive chemotherapy followed by further treatment. She was not allowed out of hospital for months but is now going from strength to strength. Mrs Elvidge said: ‘We are so proud of Grace. Although she's only small she's been extremely brave and tolerant of all the pain, sickness, prodding and probing. She is amazing.’ She has now been presented with one of Cancer Research UK's Little Star Awards. The awards, in partnership with TK Maxx, acknowledge the unique challenges faced by youngsters who encounter cancer. The charity is calling on the public to show their support for children with the disease by nominating a Little Star. The awards are open to all under-18s who have cancer or who have been treated for the disease in the last five years. Each child nominated receives the accolade. There is no judging panel because Cancer Research UK believes that every child who faces cancer is extra special. Siblings of Little Stars also receive a special certificate in recognition of the support they give. Jane Bullock, Cancer Research UK's spokeswoman for the North West, said: ‘Grace has been through such a lot at a very young age and is more than deserving of a Little Star award.’ Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia is leukaemia that progresses rapidly and requires immediate treatment. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells affected. There are two main types - lymphocytes and myeloid cells. The myeloid cells, which are affected in acute myeloid leukaemia, fight bacterial infections, defend the body against parasites and prevent the spread of tissue damage. The early symptoms include having pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and contracting repeated infections. Acute leukaemia affects about 7,600 people a year in the UK. Of those people, about 2,300 have acute myeloid leukaemia. It is most common in people over the age of 65 and is more common in men than women. People who have been exposed to radiation and the chemical benzene are at higher risk. The prognosis tends to be better for younger patients than older ones.

California-based attorney Sharon . Vinick says she and other members of the Jets Flight Crew earned $150 . per game and $100 for required special events. But the 25-year-old dancer, identified on court papers as Krystal C. says they weren't paid for practices, transportation or other appearances. The former New York Jets cheerleader, named Krystal C. (pictured in 2012) says she was underpaid in the lawsuit . Vinick says when the unpaid hours are factored in the $1,700 per season works out to $3.77 per hour. Krystal C. told The New York Post: 'We worked so much and it was so time-consuming. 'We are professional dancers and we should be compensated that way. I needed to speak up about this, it's not fair for people trying out for the squad, who think it's going to be glamorous.' The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in state Superior Court in Bergen County, where the Jets and the New York Giants play their home games at MetLife Stadium. New Jersey minimum wage is $8.25 an hour, which Krystal C. says the cheerleaders deserve to be paid. She is seeking damages for the unpaid wages and back-pay for work-related expenses. Vinick also represents cheerleaders with the Oakland Raiders in a similar lawsuit. A Jets spokesman won't comment on the lawsuit. The case follows a suit filed by five Buffalo Bills cheerleaders against the NFL team last month, who claimed they weren't paid for their time at games or mandatory public appearances - equating to '840 hours of work' between them. The Oakland Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals cheerleaders also have pending wage battles.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Expectant mom Chelsea Clinton was full of smiles on Saturday afternoon, as she strolled through the May sunshine in New York with husband Marc Mezvinsky. With only a slight hint of a bump on show, the 34-year-old looked relaxed and healthy as she and Mezvinsky walked their Yorkshire terrier through Madison Square Park. Appearing still very much in love four years after their wedding, the soon-to-be parents were spotted laughing and chatting together. On show: A hint of a baby bump could be seen as Chelsea Clinton strolled through Manhattan with her husband, Marc, on Saturday afternoon . A gently bulging baby bump was on show under the loose-fitting top Clinton had teamed with dark jeans and a maroon coat. At one point, she cradled her terrier as her husband stopped to buy a snack from a food vendor. Clinton had been spotted earlier on Saturday too, as she headed out for breakfast in the Flatiron district. Make up free, and with her blonde hair loosely tied back this morning, the vice-chairwoman of the Clinton Foundation looked relaxed as she wrapped a large beige cardigan around her bump. Clinton announced that she and Mezvinsky are expected their first child, during a Clinton Foundation event in April.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Zoe Szathmary . Overdue? Margaret Sanchez, 30, was arrested on Wednesday for the murder of a New Orleans stripper found dismembered and washed up on Mississippi beaches across two counties in 2012 . An arrest has finally been made in the grisly murder of a New Orleans stripper who was stabbed and dismembered in 2012. Margaret Sanchez was booked on second degree murder charges in the death of Jaren Lockhart, whose head and body parts were found strewn across Mississippi beaches in two counties. The 30-year-old, who was picked up at her parents' Metairie home Wednesday, is known to be one of the last two people to see the slain 22-year-old mother but was released after an initial arrest due to lack of evidence. Sgt. Brian McGregor said Sanchez was arrested by Kenner, Louisiana police, the U.S. Marshal's Gulf Coast Regional Task Force, FBI, and Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. Missing in reports of Sanchez's arrest were two things: mention of a motive in the horrific, headline-grabbing slaying and any hint at whether Sanchez's long-suspected accomplice Terry Speaks will also be charged. Speaks, 41, is currently in a New York federal prison after having been picked up since the murder on charges the convicted sex offender failed to register as such. More information about Speaks' potential involvement and possibly his and Sanchez's relationship to the deceased, who was last seen on security footage with the couple the night she disappeared, was expected to come Thursday morning when authorities had scheduled a press conference. Friends and family of Lockhart's had already expressed their appreciation for all the detective work that led tot he arrest before day's end Wednesday. Both Sanchez (right) and Speaks were briefly held following the discovery of Lockhart's body but released due to lack of evidence. At the time of their arrests, they both sported fresh hair dye jobs . Victim: Jaren Lockhart, 22, was found dismembered in June 2012 by Mississippi authorities . 'We're . just over-the-moon happy, today,' Alice Maxwell Swain, a close family . friend of Lockhart's, told NOLA.com. 'It's closer to justice. It's the . news we've been waiting for.' Lockhart's brother Lance concurred in a Facebook post. 'I knew it would happen all in time. God doesn't sleep,' he said. Lockhart's daughter Rylie is now 5 and living with her grandmother. Authorities found the stabbed torso of Jaren Lockhart, 22, washed up in Mississippi's Hancock County in June 2012, NOLA reported at the time. Her decapitated head and parts of her legs were found in nearby Harrison County. Authorities . were able to identify Lockhart based on her neck tattoos. Her fiance . reported her missing after she did not return from a shift at a Bourbon . Street club. What happened? The 22-yaer-old mother, pictured, was reported missing after she did not return home from her shift as a New Orleans dancer on Bourbon Street . 'The new information, from a circumstantial point, indicates a higher probability that the killing happened in Kenner,' Glenn Grannan, a lead investigator for Hancock County, told WAFB. 'The evidence was strong enough to convince the District Attorney, which is huge.' Terry . Speaks and Margaret Sanchez were the last two people to see Lockhart . alive. They were seen on surveillance video walking with Lockhart down a . street, NOLA reported in 2012. Both were briefly held before they were released.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Charged: Leroy Smith III, from Maine, is accused of murdering his father . A man who wrote on his Facebook page that he was God and the head of racist organization the Klu Klux Klan has been charged with murdering his father. Leroy Smith III, 24, is accused of killing Leroy Smith Jr, 56, after his remains were discovered on Monday morning in wooded ground near to the apartment they shared on the outskirts of Gardiner, Maine. The State Medical Examiner said that Mr Smith Jr had died from ‘multiple sharp force injuries’. Police believe that he murdered his father inside the apartment and dragged the body to the woods. It’s understood that Mr Smith Jr took his son in several months ago after he was evicted from an apartment in Westborough, Massachusetts, for unruly behavior that caused deep concern among other tenants and the landlord. Police Chief Alan Gordon, from Gardiner Police Department, told the Morning Sentinel that on one occasion Smith III set his guitar and amplifier alight in the apartment’s backyard because ‘he believed they were emitting evil music’. Smith III used a picture of burnt musical equipment for his Facebook profile picture. He was subsequently served with a protection against harassment order, which he apparently broke just 24 hours later, leading to a warrant for his arrest. His father allowed him to move in with him but was very uneasy about the situation. Close friend Michael Parady said: ‘He said, “I sleep with one eye open.’” Mr Parady shared Mr Smith’s Jr’s nervousness, adding: ‘I was very concerned about his son living with him.’ Extreme: Smith III posted this picture of a burnt guitar and amp on his Facebook page after setting them alight in the backyard of an apartment in Westborough, Massachusetts . Smith III’s Facebook page contains numerous rants, including some that are delusional. One post reads: ‘I am God. I hate you all, you never see the truth.’ Another states ‘go to Hell anyone on Earth’, while some contain racist outbursts. In one message he declares that he’s the ‘head of the KKK’. He was arrested after asking police in Gardiner for directions. Officers performed a background check and discovered that he was wanted for failing to appear in court for a hearing about the harassment order. Smith III eventually revealed where his father's body was, police said.

"By . Alex Greig . A streaker has interrupted proceedings on the annual Met Gala soiree in Manhattan. A man wearing just a hot-pink 'mankini,' a chunky gold chain and a smile made a run for the celebrity-strewn red carpet as celebrities preened for photographers.

He reportedly whipped off his tear-away suit and ran for the red carpet, much to the amusement of onlookers. Unfortunately for him, police managed to intercept the man before his loafer-shod foot reached the hallowed ground. According to Harpers Bazaar, Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the evening's hosts, was unperturbed by the interruption. Red carpet bound: Sarah Jessica Parker in her elaborate Oscar de la Renta gown can be seen making her way up the stairs to the top right as the man approaches . Odd encounter: The suited man appears unsure how to proceed when faced with the nearly nude New Yorker . Tight security: With so many police around, the streaker's mission was doomed from the start . While he must have felt disappointed to have failed in his nudie mission, the man flashed a smile for cameras as he was hauled off by police. It's not the first time in recent months a streaker has attempted to interrupt a fashion event. In February a man who bears a striking resemblance to tonight's intruder crashed the catwalk at Prabal Gurung's New York Fashion Week show. On a streak? February's Prabal Gurgung runway streaker bears more than a passing resemblance to Monday's Met Gala man . In that fashion-streak, the man was clad just in a leopard-print thong, red socks and a gold crown set at a jaunty angle. Most attendees of tonight's event took the interruption in stride, but one star will be mightily annoyed. Madonna reportedly skipped the event this year because she was asked not to wear a particularly revealing dress. Had she taken inspiration from the fashion streaker, she could have worn the outfit of her choice - and saved herself $25,000.","A man in a hot-pink 'mankini' attempted to storm the Met Gala's red carpet in Manhattan .

"By . Jonathan Block . Frustrated San Francisco drivers who are fed up having to circle around trying find a parking space on the street can use a new app that allows them to purchase a spot from someone who is already parked in one. The app, called 'Monkey Parking,' connects drivers looking for empty spaces with someone who is also on the app who is willing to give up their prized spot, but for a fee of anywhere between $5 and $20. San Francisco has a severe parking crunch already, given that the city has about 500,000 parking spots and there are about 750,000 residents. And that doesn't even include the tens of thousands of drivers who come into city daily. A new app for San Francisco drivers called 'Monkey Parking' lets them buy a parking spot from another motorist already in a space . Although the app is slowly catching on in the city by the bay, San Francisco officials are questioning whether the practice is even legal. Others in the city have complained that the app is unfair as it is lining the pockets of some motorists out to make quick buck at the expense of other drivers. 'You are trying to monetize public parking spaces and it is disgusting,' one person wrote on Monkey Parking's Twitter feed. However, Monkey Parking CEO and co-founder Paolo Dobrowolny tells the San Francisco Chronicle those reactions are unfair. He claims that the app just acts as a facilitator between those looking for parking and those who need a financial reward to move from their space. 'We’re just providing information when someone is leaving,' he said. 'That is valuable information for everybody.' 'Monkey Parking' has drawn the attention of city officials who question its legality as well as other motorists who claim the app is unfair . The CEO of 'Money Parking' says the app provides an important service to frustrated drivers . He also dismisses claims that that the app discriminates against those who are not able to pay up to $20 for a space. 'It’s a fair business for anybody,' Dobrowolny said. 'It’s not just for rich people. If you think you can get that money back when you leave that parking spot, you can earn back the money when you leave the spot.' He adds that the app will help to improve the lives of San Franciscans as well. 'If it’s faster to get a parking spot, or if someone was leaving in any case, that is an improvement to urban city living overall,' he told CBS San Francisco. 'We’re not trying to create this strange thing that they’re saying we are.'","'Monkey Parking' allows drivers who are looking for spaces with motorists who are already occupying a space for a fee .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Of all the reasons to buy a Tesla - the luxurious, eco-friendly electric cars created by billionaire inventor Elon Musk - there's a new reason with which even the priciest luxury cars can't compete: There is nearly a zero-percent chance that it will get stolen. In fact, only four Teslas have been stolen - ever. In 2013, only three of the pricey cars were stolen - one each in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. Prior to those three thefts, only one other Tesla had been stolen since the company was founded in 2003. That leaves Tesla with a theft rate of roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced. The median theft rate for all cars . is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles produced, according to the . National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Pricey: A Tesla has a base price of roughly $70,000 - but that hasn't made them a target for thieves . Impressive: Teslas have a theft rate of 0.15 per 1,000 vehicles produced, which is better than almost all other popular luxury vehicles . And the cars' impressive theft statistic can't be dismissed as a product of the fact that there aren't many Tesla's on the road - according to MarketWatch.com, 'the auto maker sold about 20,000 cars in the US last year, according to . IBISWorld lead analyst Brandon Ruiz. Based on that estimate, its theft . rate is pretty low at roughly 0.15 per 1,000 cars produced; the median . theft rate for all cars is roughly 3.58 thefts per 1,000 vehicles . produced, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety . Administration.' Teslas are unlikely to be stolen for a number of reasons - for starters, they're incredibly difficult to steal. Additionally, given the market for stolen cars and stolen car parts, it doesn't make much sense to steal a Tesla. It's electric: Tesla is one of the most innovative, eco-friendly electric cars on the road . According to Mark Takahashi, an editor at Edmunds.com, cars are typically stolen for parts. But there isn't much demand for stolen Tesla parts - most people who can afford the upwards of $70,000 price tag can afford to buy legitimately purchased parts for the car. Teslas also have unique FOB keys that are nearly impossible to replicate. And even if a thief were able to hack into Tesla's system and bypass the key, it's unlikely that the company wouldn't be able to track the stolen vehicle. Luxury cars typically have theft rates lower than those of economy cars. For example, MarketWatch.com cites the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's latest data showing that 'of the 15,179 Infiniti FX35’s produced in 2008, 52 were stolen (that’s a rate of 3.43 cars per 1,000 made) and of the 159 Lamborghini Murcielago autos made in 2006, one was stolen (that’s a rate of 6.29 per 1,000 automobiles).' Status symbol: Teslas have replaced the Toyota Prius as the car-du-jour for eco-conscious celebs like Ashton Kutcher (pictured) Budget cars have much higher theft rates, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. According to the NTSB, the vehicles with the highest rates of theft per 1,000 vehicles produced are the Chevrolet Aveo, Chevrolet HHR, . Chevrolet Impala, Hyundai Accent, . Mitsubishi Galant and Dodge Charger.","Since Tesla was founded in 2003 only four cars have been reported stolen .

Currently, there are about 20,000 Teslas on the road in the U.S."
"By . Associated Press . A Colorado woman is recovering after being stranded in her car for five days after crashing off a rural highway southwest of Denver . Kristin Hopkins wrote pleas for help on a red-and-white umbrella that she managed to push through a broken window of her crashed car and open, hoping to attract the attention of drivers on a scenic highway above. Days later, someone spotted the flipped car of the 43-year-old single mother of four children about 80 feet down an embankment in a central Colorado aspen grove. Scroll down for video . Found: Kristin Hopkins, a 43-year-old Highlands Ranch woman who had been missing since Tuesday, was found alive in her wrecked car Sunday afternoon . Timely discovery: Hopkins was found in the wreckage of her car by a group of hikers 140 feet below the scenic road she had been traveling on . Missing person: Hopkins was discovered off the Red Hill Pass, near Fairplay in Colorado, USA, on Sunday May 4 after being reported as a missing person by Douglas County Sheriff's Office on April 29 . Authorities say at least one motorist . hiked down from Red Hill Pass on U.S. Highway 285 and alerted . authorities on Sunday that there was a body inside the car. Rescuers . found Hopkins alive, conscious and coherent - but critically injured and . extremely dehydrated. Hopkins was flown by helicopter to St. Anthony Hospital in suburban Denver, Park County undersheriff Monte Gore said. She was in critical condition Monday, said hospital spokeswoman Loralee Sturm. Hopkins' family issued a statement saying she will lose both her feet because of injuries sustained in the crash and is expected to survive. Hopkins drove off the roadway near the old mining town of Fairplay sometime after she was last seen on April 27. The accident occurred beneath a spot overlooking the sprawling ranchlands and surrounding mountains of Colorado's South Park area. Her 2009 Chevrolet Malibu struck multiple trees and rolled several times before landing on its top. Serious condition: Kristin Hopkins was airlifted to hospital where she is being treated for severe dehydration and is in a critical condition . Recovered: Hopkins was found inside her upturned vehicle 140-feet below the 10,051-foot Red Hill Pass - some seven miles north of Fairplay - off U.S. Highway 285 . Hopkins had been entered into a statewide police database as a missing person. But since she is an adult and there were no indications of foul play, there was no active search for her. When rescuers reached the car Sunday, firefighter Jim Cravener asked a colleague to break a window and feel for a pulse. 'He started to break the window and she put her hand up to the window,' Cravener said. 'At that point, it became a rescue.' Hopkins' notes on the umbrella were hard to make out but appeared to say, ""six days, no food, no water; please help me; need a doctor,"" Cravener said. 'It's really something off that ""Shouldn't Be Alive' show,""' he said. 'She really had a strong will to survive.' Survivor: Rescuers were stunned when they found a dehydrated and critically-injured Kristin Hopkins, 43, in her upturned vehicle 140 feet below the 10,051-foot Red Hill Pass . Pure chance: Emergency crews who rescued Kristin said she had written notes on an umbrella to try and get help, but that the area usually doesn't receive many visitors until fall . Rescuers set to work cutting into the vehicle, pulling out Hopkins and taking her to the helicopter. It was a complicated extrication because of the location, Cravener said. Hopkins was fairly responsive at first, even telling her rescuers she was not hurt. But they could see her face was badly bruised, possibly by the steering wheel or air bag. 'She didn't talk a whole lot. She started to become less responsive as we carried her down the hill. We had to keep waking her up,' Cravener said. The area had spring snow storms but not bitterly cold temperatures in the past several days. Sightseers often stop at the spot but usually in the fall when the leaves are turning color. It was just by chance that somebody would stop at this time of year, Cravener said. Her family thanked people for their prayers and thoughts.","43-year-old Kristin Hopkins was stranded in her car for five days .

"By . Associated Press . A Florida court has heard the recordings of a Tampa mother telling a detectives that her teenagers were mean and that she hoped they were dead- just hours after their bodies were found. Prosecutors on Wednesday played a recorded interview between Julie Schenecker and Tampa Police Detective Gary Sandel, conducted in January 2011. Schenecker is accused of killing her 16-year-old daughter Calyx and 13-year-old son Beau. 'I loved them when they were birth through six,' Julie Schenecker told Tampa Police Detective Gary Sandel in January 2011. But they became 'sassy' as teens, she said, especially her daughter. Insane or premeditated: A tape was played for the court which heard Julie Schenecker telling a detective that her children were mean and that she hoped they were dead- hours after their bodies were found (pictured in court on Tuesday) 'I just topped over. The last straw,' Schenecker said in the interview, a recording of which was played in court Wednesday. 'My daughter, the 16-year-old, is mouthy. She calls me names.' Schenecker, . who is now 53, also told Sandel how she met her husband, Parker . Schenecker, while both served in the military and said she worked as a . military debriefer in the Army before having children. She . has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to two counts of . first-degree murder. If convicted, she will face a life prison sentence . without parole; prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty. During the interview, her voice was slow and slurred. She said she had been in therapy and took multiple prescriptions, including Lithium for bipolar disorder. She told the detective that she had long thought about suicide. 'I feel horrible. I just feel horrible,' she said. 'But I've been thinking about doing this for a long time.' During the interview, Schenecker did appear confused at times. 'Are my kids coming in later?' she asked the detective. Later, the detective asked her where her kids were. She said that Calyx was in her bed where she had placed her after the shooting, and that Beau was in the family's minivan where she had shot him. 'I hope they're dead,' Schenecker said to the detective. 'What do you think?' 'They're dead,' Sandel replied. His side: The recording was played the day after her ex-husband Paul Schenecker took the stand (pictrued Tuesday) telling how he was an Army colonel deployed in the Middle East when his children were killed . Schenecker detailed how she had . intended to kill herself after she killed her teens, but wasn't able to . articulate why she didn't. 'Beau went first, Calyx went second. I'd sure as hell like to go third,' she said. Tampa Police officer Fred Arnold testified that Schenecker's mood was 'jovial' the day of her arrest. 'She wasn't sad or anything like that,' Arnold said. 'She wanted me to give her my gun so she could finish the job.' Prosecutors argue that the slayings were premeditated as opposed to the result of a mental break. The recording was played the day after her ex-husband Paul Schenecker took the stand. He . told how Julie, who he was still married to at the time of their . children's' deaths, starred at him coldly immediately after he heard the . devastating news and said: 'I guess I stomped your heart flat, huh?' During . his questioning by prosecutors in Hillsborough County Court, Parker . Schenecker did not mention Julie Schenecker by name, instead calling her . 'the defendant' or his 'ex-wife.' He was an Army colonel deployed in the Middle East when his children were killed. Parker Schenecker did not show any emotion as he testified for a little more than an hour. He identified various items from the family's home in photographs, and affirmed that the handwriting in a spiral-bound notebook was Julie's. The 50-year-old read one sticky note aloud: 'Tuesday, Feb. 1 Beau is in the van (on the way to practice) Calyx is in her bed tried to make her comfortable.' Victims: Beau Schenecker, 13, was shot dead by his mother . on the way to soccer practice in 2011. His sister Calyx (right) was . then murdered by her mother while she sat at their home computer . Prosecutors said the note was written by Julie Schenecker and detailed the location of the teens' bodies. Parker . said that he had no concerns about the kids' safety with their mother . while he was deployed, even though his wife had suffered from mental . illness, was taking pills and uncharacteristically drinking. Julie . Schenecker and Calyx were also at odds with each other, he said, and he . thought the situation would soon be under control because the teen was . supposed to attend a boarding school. 'To let the situation settle down,' he said. Earlier in the day, Tampa Police crime scene analyst Matthew Evans said that Julie Schenecker had written in her journal that she thought her children would inherit her bipolar disorder and that she was rescuing them from depression and mental illness. 'I believed I've saved them from the pain,' Julie Schenecker wrote, according to Evans. 'I wish this on nobody.' Schenecker wrote of 'going to heaven,' and she both apologized to and chastised Parker Schenecker, the analyst testified. 'You didn't teach the kids to be compassionate,' she wrote. Motivations: Julie Schenecker, seen listening as her ex-husband Packer testified, is bipolar and on several medications so her defense team have entered a not guilty by reason of insanity plea . Evans said Julie Schenecker also described how she had stayed in bed for seven weeks, with none of her family spending time with her. 'Neither were you,' she wrote of her husband. 'I sense divorce is inevitable,' she also wrote, according to Evans' testimony. 'I can't live alone.' Her writings show she intended to commit suicide by shooting herself, inhaling carbon monoxide or taking pills. 'I don't believe I could ever recover or make up for my failures over the years,' she wrote.","Julie Schenecker is accused of killing her 16-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, telling police shortly after that she hoped they were dead .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated  Press Reporter . The man charged with planting a backpack with a rice cooker near the Boston Marathon finish line on the anniversary of the bombing wept in court Wednesday as he was found mentally competent to stand trial. Kevin Edson, 25, a student at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital in April after being charged with multiple counts, including possession of a hoax device, threatening to commit a crime and disturbance of the peace. A Boston Municipal Court judge found Edson competent to stand trial and ordered his bail cut in half to $50,000 after hearing from both sides. Brought to tears: Kevin Edson, 25, cries during a hearing as he stands beside his attorney, Shannon Lopez, left, in Municipal Court Wednesday, May 7 . Emotional hearing: A Boston Municipal Court judge found a tearful Edson competent to stand trial and ordered his bail cut in half to $50,000 . Edson also must wear a GPS tracking device, attend counseling and stay on medication. He is due back in court June 3. His mother, Joie Edson, said he has been battling a bipolar disorder for years. She would not comment after the court appearance. Kevin Edson wept several times during the hearing, raising his cuffed hands to wipe away tears. His friends and family also sobbed. Authorities say Edson was spotted by passers-by on Boylston Street near the marathon finish line April 15, a week before this year's race; he was walking barefoot in the rain and wearing a backpack, a black veil and makeup. Authorities say two unattended backpacks were near the finish line, one of which was Edson's and the other was a misplaced bag from the media. When police approached him and asked what was inside the bag, he replied a rice cooker. No explosives were found and no one was injured. Edson's attorney, Shannon Lopez (left), said her client does not present any danger to himself or others, and he is willing to continue treatment . Edson's attorney, Shannon Lopez, said Wednesday that her inbox was flooded with emails in support of the Wakefield resident and that multiple doctors say her client is not a danger to himself or others. She said he also has followed doctors' advice and is willing to continue treatment. Edson previously had been sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered held on $100,000 bail on charges of threatening battery, possession of a hoax explosive device, threats to commit a crime, disturbing the peace, disturbing a public assembly and disorderly conduct. According to a police report read aloud in court last month, after Edson was read his rights, he told an officer: 'I knew what I was doing, it was conceived in my head. It's symbolism, come on. The performance got the best of me.' Color coordination: 'Kayvon' Edson's face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, when he was arrested Tuesday night after dropping off a backpack with a rice cooker filled with confetti at the finish line on the one-year anniversary of the bombings . Edson's arrest occurred hours after ceremonies to mark last year's Boston Marathon bombings, in which two pressure cooker bombs hidden in backpacks exploded, killing three people near the finish line and injuring more than 260 others. Edson, with addresses in Boston and Wakefield, was stopped April 15 after passersby told an officer they saw him yelling, walking barefoot down the middle of a street, veiled in black, in pouring rain. His face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, police said. The street was open to pedestrians at the time, and police said his presence was not a security breach. Man behind the stunt: Edson told police that he 'got caught up in the performance' when he went through with the bomb scare . Mental problems: Edson's mother said that the former art school student, seen in court April 16, has bipolar disorder . The backpack was destroyed in a controlled explosion by police, who later determined that the contents were not explosive. Parsons, The New School for Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology, both in New York City, confirmed that Edson had taken classes at their schools but never graduated. The Massachusetts College of Art and Design posted a statement on its website saying that an undergraduate student had been arrested by police and the school was cooperating with authorities, but it did not mention Edson by name. The stunt : Witnesses spotted the first bag being dropped off by a . barefoot man- later identified as Edson- dressed in all black with a black veil who was 'acting . strangely' and yelling 'Boston Strong!'

"In 1964, Daily founded the West Cape May Community Christmas Parade which she ran for 49 years until her death. Despite her diminutive size -- she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was known for keeping the parade orderly and smooth. 'She always wanted to make sure there was a good spread between the floats and the fire trucks,' her oldest daughter, Victoria Kelly-Kuhn, told the Press of Atlantic City.

Daily's funeral procession went along the same route as the Christmas parade she took so much pride in . Inside the coffin, Daily was dressed in a Mummers outfit, which was then placed on a float. It then proceeded down the same streets as the Christmas parade. The route include going past Borough Hall, where she worked as a municipal clerk for more than 20 years. 'My mother would be ecstatic. She loved everything gregarious, colorful and flamboyant,' said Kelly-Kuhn. Charlotte Daily, who died on April 30 at the age of 82, founded the Christmas parade in West Cape May, New Jersey, in 1964 . The only difference between the parade and the funeral procession was where the was where the float ended -- Cold Spring Cemetery. Daily began preparing for the parade months in advance, according to her youngest daughter Becky Daily Horton. 'Mom would start in early September putting cans in stores and going door-to-door for donation,' she said. 'I remember girls coming over and mom sewing with them. The phone was always ringing. People were coming and going. Growing up with the parade was a very exciting time.' A descent of Pilgrims who came aboard the Mayflower, Daily was a religious woman who fought hard to keep Christian symbols in the parade when critics had argued it violated the separation of church and state. She was also patriotic, and her coffin had a photo of the American flag and eagle on it. Along the procession route, children held flags.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A New York City councilman has been arrested on corruption charges after investigators found that he has allegedly been misusing tens of thousands of dollars of public funds. Ruben Wills and his relative Jelani Mills were taken into custody in Queens on Wednesday morning and has being charged with grand larceny and other theft charges. The arrests come after an investigation that started in 2012 when it was reported by The New York Daily News that a $33,000 grant that had been awarded to a charity Wills was involved with went unaccounted for. In custody: Ruben Wills was arrested on Wednesday morning and will be charged with grand larceny and crimes related to the theft of about $30,000 in public and federal funds . Under scrutiny: The investigation into the missing funds was launched in 2011 and now the state comptroller's office and the office of the attorney general have charged Wills and a relative for their role in the scheme . Before being elected as a city councilman, Wills worked as the chief of staff for state Senator Shirley Huntley, who was convicted in connection to the theft of $88,000 from a different not-for-profit. The New York Post reports that before that arrest, Huntley directed tens of thousands of dollars-worth of legislative grants to NY4Life, a group founded by Wills in 2006 which was supposed to help single parents. He has served on the board of the group- which does not have it's own website- since he founded the charity in 2006 and has been the chairman since 2009. Questions started being raised in 2011- a year after he was elected to the City Council- when the Office of Children & Family Services inquired about how the $33,000 grant was being spent but they never got a response. According to state records, the $33,000 in question was earmarked by Will's former boss in 2008. Dealings: Investigators claim Wills' former boss directed funds to a fake not-for-profit that Wills launched in 2006 and Wills has repeatedly refused to hand over forms accounting for where the money went . When the OCFS never got a response or the specific accounting of how the money was spent that they had asked for, so they referred the case to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office. That same year, Wills pled guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief in an unrelated incident that happened more than a decade earlier. He admitted that he stole and damaged property in relation to a business dispute in 1998, and was ordered to pay restitution and do community service for three days. Schneiderman's office teamed up with the State Comptroller's office and issued a subpoena in February 2012 after another letter demanding the funds be accounted for or repaid went ignored again. Wills met with investigators from the attorney general's office that February and brought no such documentation. The Daily News cites court papers that say he only brought one undated invoice for $980 but it was unclear when that money was even spent. The New York Post claims that the Democrat used his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid speaking for fear of self-incrimination during a 2013 meeting with investigators. Punishment: Both Wills (left) and his relative Jelani Mills (right) face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail if they are found guilty on their most serious charge- grand larceny . The nature of the relationship between Wills and Jelani Mills remains unclear, but Mills is being called Wills’ relative and is charged with conspiring with him on the grand larceny scheme. If convicted of grand larceny, both men face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail. In a joint release from the attorney general and the comptroller's office, officials said that Wills and Mills have been indicted for allegedly pocketing about $30,000 in both grant money and public campaign funds. It goes on to specify that the New York City Campaign Finance Board handed his staff $11,500 in funds that matched the amount he raised through public campaigning. He claimed that the money was paid to Micro Targeting, a campaign literature translation and distribution service, but the investigators assert that it is simply a shell company. From there, Mills allegedly transferred the funds to NY4Life and Wills withdrew cash from those accounts, which he then used to buy personal items like a $750 Louis Vuitton bag. 'The crimes Mr. Wills is accused of committing represent a shameful breach of the trust his constituents placed in him,' Attorney General Schneiderman said in the statement. 'New Yorkers are repeatedly asked to have faith in our leaders, and it appears that faith has been shattered once again. Every time my office arrests a corrupt public official, it sends the message that elected office does not come with a blank check or a license to break the law.'","Councilman Ruben Wills and a relative have been arrested and will face grand larceny charges .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Senator Ted Cruz blasted President Barack Obama on Wednesday for '76 instances of lawlessness and other abuses of power,' in a wide-ranging speech that drew comparisons with Richard Nixon, lashed out at the administration's 'obstruction of justice' on Benghazi and reached its peak with a quote from the cult-classic film 'The Princess Bride.' The Texas tea party darling recalled hearing Obama tell Fox News host Bill O'Reilly during a Super Bowl Sunday interview that there is 'not a smidgen of corruption' related to the Internal Revenue Service's practice of targeting conservative nonprofit groups because of their political beliefs. ''My first thought was of my favorite movie, ""The Princess Bride"",' Cruz said of the president's use of 'smidgen.' '""You keep using that word"",' he recalled a character Broadway star Mandy Patinkin saying. '""I do not think it means what you think it means"".' Deadly serious, with a smidgen of silly: Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz unveiled his fourth 'Abuse of Power' report on the Obama administration at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., but couldn't help cracking a few jokes . In the Princess Bride, it was Vizzini (L) saying 'Inconceivable!' to Inigo Montoya (R); and with President Obama, says Ted Cruz, it's 'not a ""smidgen"" of corruption' -- to which comes the same reply 'You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means' Cruz released the fourth edition of his 'Abuses of Power' report during a Washington, D.C. conference hosted by the right-wing Federalist Society. Speaking of what he sees as the Obama administration's activism that falls outside the boundaries of federal law, he claimed that 'if the same acts had been committed by Richard Nixon, every day the headlines in newspapers would be banner headlines.' 'And yet,' he said, 'you don't have that level of scrutiny.' Most lawmakers, Cruz said, claim to be in favor of enforcing federal laws as they are written, but many Democrats and some news outlets reflexively come to Obama's defense because 'he's on our team.' 'There is not presently in the United States Congress an ""anti-Rule-of-Law"" caucus,' he fumed, 'but give it time.' Cruz's complaints ran the gamut from the IRS, drug laws and immigration reform to offshore drilling, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. Ted Cruz's speech to the Federalist Society covered a wide swath of territory, offering judgments on a variety of what he sees as legal presidential missteps: . Benghazi: A recently revealed White House memo said the administration's 'goal was to declare that whatever happened here, it was not the fault of any policy from this administration. In the criminal world, that used to be called obstruction of justice. And yet here it's treated like just another feature of politics.' Immigration: President Obama 'suddenly announced [that] some 800,000 people who are here illegally – he was unilaterally granting them amnesty. Never mind that Article II [of the U.S. Constitution] gives the president a duty to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"".' Gay marriage: Cruz blasted the president for siding with gay marriage advocates in Utah by choosing not to enforce the law, saying that his administration 'decided it's going to recognize marriages that Utah law doesn't allow and federal law doesn't allow.' Recess appointments: He complained that Obama has gone around the Senate to appoint officials by determining on his own when the legislators are in 'recess,' joking that 'tonight, I'm pretty confident that a lot of senators are going to go home and go to sleep,' and the if president has that power he 'can appoint whoever he wants.' 'Take Obamacare,' he said at one point. 'Please! Take Obamacare!' 'If you wanted to come up with an example of lawlessness, it would be difficult to come up with a better example,' Cruz claimed. He cited a half-dozen examples of the White House 'illegally' ignoring the text of the president's health insurance overhaul law to score political points and keep the new system afloat. The administration first offered waivers for certain business groups 'in a blog post by an assistant treasury secretary, put up right around the Fourth of July,' he recalled. Cruz also complained about a secretive meeting between the president and congressional Democrats that resulted in broad Obamacare exemptions on Capitol Hill. An amendment to the Affordable Care Act, first sponsored by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, ensured that members of Congress would have to participate in the Obamacare insurance exchanges. But Cruz alleged that the White House 'had a closed door meeting between Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats, and Obama, where they suddenly realized ""Hey, we don't want to be on Obamacare"".' Days later, new exemption options emerged for federal lawmakers and their staffs. A third episode he cited came after more than 6 million Americans lost their medical insurance as Obamacare's implementation loomed in the waning months of 2013. 'We needed to get together and fix this,' Cruz said. 'We needed to do something to provide relief for those Americans we've hurt.' 'The president didn't do that. Instead he held a press conference ... where he instructed private insurance companies to go ahead and break violate the law, [saying], ""By presidential grace and whim, I'm telling you to do so"".' Lawgiver: Cruz said President Obama has been 'telling private individuals and private companies to violate the law' Cruz lambasted Obama on Wednesday for 'illegally' changing federal law to suit him . 'We have . never had an instance where the President of the United State instructs . private citizens and private companies to go ahead and violate the . law,'the senator claimed. The White House did not respond to a request for a reply to Cruz's stinging charges. But the senator alleged that 'when you have a president who can pick and choose which laws to follow and which laws to ignore, then you no longer have a president.' He also joked about the likelihood that the federal government will soon toss aside some drug laws that tend to earn offenders long sentences. 'The brownies outside were provided by the state of Colorado,' he chuckled, 'so if my remarks today appear in Technicolor, perhaps it will render it more enjoyable.' Cruz, who is expected to run for president in 2016, told reporters after his speech that he would pledge to be just as hard on future occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, even if they're from his own party. 'Whoever the president is – Republican or Democrat,' he said, 'if he or she disregards the rule of law [and] disregards the Constitution, you can be certain that I will speak out every bit as vigorously against lawlessness by a subsequent president. Asked if a strict interpretation of laws would also apply to a hypothetical Cruz administration, he fell silent and then spoke slowly: 'Regardless of who the president is.'","The Texas senator blasted the White House for 'obstruction of justice' on Benghazi and 'illegally' changing laws to suit the president .

"By . Candace Sutton . Missing Irishman Donal 'Donie' O'Sullivan has been miraculously found alive, five days after he went missing on a street in broad daylight in Sydney, Australia. A caretaker at an office tower around 100m from where O'Sullivan was last sighted found the 33-year-old naked and injured down a rarely used stairwell around 8.30pm on Wednesday. Lapsing in and out of consciousness, Donie was able to give his mobile phone number and address back in Ireland before the man rushed next door to Easts Leagues Club to raise the alarm and call an ambulance. Two hours later, his relieved brother, Johnnie O'Sullivan, learned Donie was alive, soon after he had returned home from a third night out scouring Sydney suburbs for the missing man. Found alive: Five days after Irishman Donie O'Sullivan (above) disappeared on a street in Sydney's Bondi, he was found naked and injured by the caretaker of a nearby office block . Missing man found: the 33-year-old Irish carpenter was was found down a disused stairwell in the Easts Tower (above) just 100m from where he was last seen . More than a hundred young Irish nationals living in Sydney went out in pairs on Wednesday night, each assigned a search grid on a map drawn up by Donie's brother, a housemate and friends. After spending several fruitless hours looking, Johnnie received a call telling him Donie had been admitted to St Vincents Hospital. 'He went straight there and Donie was able to talk,' a friend told the MailOnline. 'He recognised Johnnie. 'He's got head and back injuries, and he's very dehydrated, but he's now stable. He's quite stocky and that might have helped over five days without food.' Johnnie O'Sullivan said he was 'very relieved' his brother has been found and was able to communicate with the person who found him. Scroll down for video . Five day ordeal: Donie O'Sullivan was found in an office block stairwell as his brother and more than a hundred young Irish people were out on their third night of searching for him . Donie and Johnnie's sister and brother-in-law, Anna and Liam O'Hare, boarded a flight in Ireland on Wednesday and are due to land in Sydney tonight, when they are expected to go straight to St Vincents Hospital. It is unclear how Donie came to stumble down the stairwell in Easts Tower. He had not taken his mobile phone with him for his night out last Friday at a party. Donie, who is one of eight brothers and sisters from Clooney in Western Ireland, has been living in Australia since June 2012 . He had returned from the all night party in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs on Saturday morning with one of his housemates and was looking for something to eat before returning to his home, just metres away. CCTV footage showed him minutes earlier walking into the nearby Tea Gardens Hotel, buying a drink and sitting down. Last sighting: After disappearing from the street near the Cock'n'Bull Bar (above) in Sydney's Bondi Junction, Donie O'Sullivan stumbled down a stairwell just metres from the bar and lay there injured for five days . Mystery: it is still unclear what happened to Donie O'Sullivan, 33, captured on CCTV (above) after having a drink in the Tea Gardens Hotel last Saturday morning and his discovery on Wednesday naked and injured in a nearby office block . He was last seen around 10.30am on Saturday on Bronte Road, Bondi Junction, walking in the direction of the Cock ‘n Bull Bar on Ebley Street. The bar is a short walk via a series of back lanes and a loading dock from the Easts Tower where Donie was found. Last Sunday night, Donie's brother, and flatmates Amy Croffey and Jerry Calahane, were worried enough to report him missing to Waverley Police Station. They said a woman police officer did not regard the case as serious and they had to return again to the station to speak with other officers a day later. On Monday morning, Donie usually picked up his fellow workmates at around 4am to drive the two hours to the Australian capital, Canberra, where they spent the week working as pipe layers for Sydney company, KNF. Donie didn't turn up, and the company vehicle he used for the drive was still parked outside his shared Bondi house. On Monday night, Donie's flatmates met with other young Irish nationals to spread out over Sydney's Eastern and Inner City suburbs searching for him and putting up 'missing' posters with his photograph. They renewed their search on Tuesday night and again on Wednesday before getting the news about Donie's discovery alive. Police had stepped up their efforts to find Donie. Easts Leagues Club told the MailOnline police had approached them for clues, but that none of the club's CCTV footage was of use in the investigation. Police say they are continuing their investigation as to how Donie sustained his injuries.

A church in Mississippi has released stunning video from a security camera showing a massive tornado ripping through its playground on April 28, destroying nearly everything in its path, except a slide. A series of twisters devastated several states in the Southeastern United States late last month, killing at least 35 and leaving behind millions of dollars in devastation. 'It really kinda brought things back, seeing it a week later,' Brad Bullock, technical director for St. Luke’s United Methodist Church in Tupelo, Mississippi, told NBC News. Scroll down for video .

'The building was really damaged,' Bullock added. 'About 50 percent of the front of the building is gone.' After the tornado that struck Tupelo, many church members were left without power and some, unfortunately, lost their homes. As the tornado begins to subside, the massive damage caused by it becomes evident . The aftermath of the twister shows nearly ever piece of playground equipment is destroyed, except for the slide in the background. 'A lot of folks are displaced,' Bullock said. 'Right now you can’t even see the houses. This is a neighborhood that has huge beautiful oak trees that survived the 1936 tornado and a lot of those are gone.' As the cleanup continues, Bullock is optimistic that the church will open its doors to worshipers again. 'We have a pastor that went through Katrina so he has experience in this,' he said. 'We’re looking from 18 months to 2 years to reopen.

"By . David Mccormack . A 16-year-old boy whose life was miraculously saved by a heart transplant from an anonymous donor was also touched to receive an emotional note from the donor’s family advising him to ‘live life to the max.’ Brett Wallick of Peoria, Arizona, was a typical healthy and active teenager until he started suffering chest pains last December. Thinking their son had asthma, his parents Scott, a retired Senior Master Sgt in the Airforce, and step mom Carla scheduled a doctor’s appointment. Scroll down for video . Brett Wallick, who was miraculously saved by a heart transplant from an anonymous donor, was also touched to receive an emotional note from the donor's family advising him to 'live life to the max' The family’s world was upside down when the doctor told them that a virus was attacking the sophomore student’s heart and that the only way he could survive is if he received a transplant. Brett was diagnosed with a dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that causes the heart to become so weakened and enlarged that it cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body. Ten days later after the diagnosis, Brett had a mechanical pump fitted at Phoenix Children's Hospital that would help his heart pump blood through his body. The device was necessary to would keep him alive until a donor heart became available, reports AZCentral. Happy family: Brett Wallick, his father Scott, step mom Carla and step sister Jordan . He was a son, a brother and a father.He was always a giving person. Always cared for others.We as a family wish you the best. Live life to the max. Keep him in your prayers.We as a family would like to know about you, one day, when you get better.Know that our family member always wanted to help others. Brett was been placed on the heart transplant list in the hope that a donor could be found. As well as the right blood type, the heart also had to be the correct size. For the next three months Brett and his family waited patiently to hear about a transplant. When they finally received word, doctors had to act fast and the operation took place just hours later. In the hours following the successful operation, Brett’s father wrote a letter to the donor's family to thank them for giving his son hope. Scott passed his note on to April Colón, the pediatric cardiac transplant coordinator, to forward to the Donor Network of Arizona to eventually be handed over to the donor's family. As Colón was in the process of forwarding the letter, she discovered a photocopy of a handwritten letter in a binder of information that had come with Brett's new heart. It was something that she had never seen before. Road to recovery: After the operation, doctors had expected Brett to stay in the hospital for another two weeks, but he was home in nine days . The note started: ‘He was a son, a brother and a father. He was always a giving person. Always cared for others.’ Scott . Wallick, who was in the Air Force for 26 years, and his wife Carla were . in tears as the emotion of what they and their son had been through. The note continued: 'We as a family wish you the best.

Scott Wallick felt the note could have been describing his own son. Brett hopes to get the chance one day to meet his donor's family and plans to let them listen to his heart with a stethoscope . 'It will be nice for them to know that a part of him is living on in you,' he told AZCentral. Wife Carla said the note made her think about the donor's mother. 'Her son's heart is keeping my son alive,' she said. The fact the note was a photocopy makes Colón believe that the donor gave more than just his heart after his death. After the operation, doctors had expected Brett to stay in the hospital for another two weeks, but he was home in nine days. Brett now plans to put the letter in a frame on his bedroom wall.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . A dim-witted thief appears to have led the cops straight to his door after using the back of a grocery receipt to write a note that he handed over to bank teller during a robbery two weeks ago. The scrap of the receipt, which the robber left at the Home Federal Bank in Bend, Oregon, had the last four digits of a food stamp account and the account balance on it. That was enough information for police to track down Robert Short, 54, who has been arrested on theft and robbery charges. Robert Short, 54, has denied that he carried out the robbery even though the information on the receipt led police directly to him and his DNA was found on a stocking cap left at the crime scene . Short denies the charges. He told police he never keeps receipts and would have thrown it in the trash, where anyone could have picked it up. He also said that a hitchhiker must have stolen a black stocking cap that police kept as evidence after it was knocked off when the robber and a bank client struggled during the April 24 holdup, the affidavit said. Police told Short his DNA was on the cap. In an affidavit, Detective Jeff Frickey said he was able to track Short down by checked the digits on the receipt against state records which provided a name to go with the account number. The scrap of the receipt, which the robber left at the Home Federal Bank in Bend, Oregon, had the last four digits of a food stamp account and the account balance on it . An online search of the name then turned up a pawn shop transaction with a telephone number and a service provider then came up with the coordinates of the phone, the Stillwater Campground in Central Oregon. Further investigation revealed Short has 36 arrests in Oregon, including six felony convictions, according to the affidavit. He also has 17 arrests in Washington, including one for a bank robbery in 1989. Short was arrested on suspicion of first-degree theft, second-degree robbery and harassment. He is being held without bail at the Deschutes County jail. A plea hearing is scheduled May 27.","Cops used information on the receipt to track down Robert Short, 54 .

'I’m not an extremely social person and I don’t have a lot of close friends, so with most of these people I’m meeting, it’s more common than not this is the first time we’ve spent time alone,' McLaughlin said according to elitedaily.com. Mikel McLaughlin, an Army vet, is making a trip across the country to visit his more than 300 Facebook friends . McLaughlin is making his Facebook journey in this rented red Volkswagen Beetle . McLaughlin with one of his Facebook friends he has met on his venture . 'I like to be with them while they’re doing whatever they enjoy doing,' he added. 'With one guy, we went out to fly remote control planes for instance. With most people though, it’s food or drinks. I’ve never drank as much coffee as I have in the past month,' McLaughlin has been chronicling his venture through a blog titled 'We're Friends, Right?', which includes both updates and pictures. Some of the people he is visiting, it is the first time they are meeting each other. His latest blog entry was on May 5, or day 34 of his journey. 'I am really enjoying this journey that I'm on,' McLaughlin wrote. 'I'm not only talking about this recent quest to have more meaningful relationships with my Facebook friends, but also the longer journey sometimes referred to as life.  It's been an incredible existence filled with some odd and amazing people, things, experiences, and adventures. McLaughlin says he has met about one-third of his 377 Facebook friends so far since he began his journey on April 2 . That day, he met his friend 'K,' who is about to graduate from law school, and  did lunch  with 'L,' a law school graduate, whom he ate falafel with for the first time. McLaughlin was also trained as a lawyer. McLaughlin said he was motivated to meet all his friends after other people told him they were deleting friends from their profile they had never met before. 'I had noticed people doing what's referred to as a ""spring cleaning"" on their Facebook accounts. One of my thoughts was, ""Is there an alternative to that,""' he told 9News. 'Instead of deleting Facebook friends I haven’t spoken to recently, maybe I could speak to them.' McLaughlin told Yahoo he's visited about a third of his Facebook friends. He also estimated that about a quarter of his Facebook friends were real-life friends before he set out in his VW Beetle. 'I have this idealistic view of the world, and I think if I can meet up with these people, I know spending time with them makes you more likely to be compassionate,' McLaughlin said. 'I thought if I could be a little better perhaps everybody could be the same.'","Mikel McLaughlin decided to make the journey since people he knew were deleting friends from Facebook they never met before .

"By . James Rush . They say chimpanzees are the closest living evolutionary relative of humans, and in this case it proved true as heart specialists more used to carrying out procedures on people turned their attention to a 154-pound ape. The chimp, called Goliath, was sedated at Chattanooga Zoo, in Tennessee, to allow the team of doctors and vets to monitor his heartbeat to check for signs of malfunction. Eric Smith, an echocardiographer with at Chattanooga's Memorial Health System, carried out the procedure on the 38-year-old chimpanzee along with cardiologist Dr Bill Warren. Chattanooga Zoo veterinarian Tony Ashley, left, and Lacy Hickle prepare Goliath for the echocardiogram yesterday . Memorial Hospital cardiologist Dr Bill Warren, right, and echocardiographer Eric Smith, in red, carried out the procedure at the zoo yesterday . Veterinarian Dr Tony Ashley contacted the heart institute three years ago after the zoo's former mascot, chimpanzee Hank, died of heart disease - the number one cause of death among chimps, gorillas and orangutans living in captivity. Dr Warren told Timesfreepress.com: 'His heart has the same measurements and valve structures as the human heart. 'If you had shown us pictures without telling us that it was a chimpanzee, we wouldn't have known the difference.' The echocardiogram carried out on Goliath was the third carried out by the specialists from the Memorial Health System. It is not just chimps' hearts, however, which are similar to those of humans. It was reported this week that researchers have discovered chimpanzees also have almost the same personality traits as humans. Randi, a female chimpanzee, watches with concern Wednesday, May 7, 2014 as doctors and vets give a physical exam to Goliath . Cardiologist Dr Warren (left) said: 'His heart has the same measurements and valve structures as the human heart' The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect. The Georgia State University research also shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee. This echoes a well-known five-factor model of the human personality, although the specific factors are slightly different.","Chimpanzee Goliath sedated so doctors and vets could carry out procedure .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A golden retriever kept guard over the body of its elderly owner after the 81-year-old died while skiing in Colorado. Robert Blake had been reported missing on Friday afternoon, after failing to return from a cross-country ski trip. When mountain rescue teams found his body under some trees the following day, Buddy the dog was standing guard to keep coyotes away. Loyal: Buddy the retriever stayed with Robert Blake, right, after the retired veterinarian died while skiing on Friday . Relief: Marlene Blake says knowing that Buddy would stay by her husband's side gave her some comfort as she waited for Robert to be found . The loyal dog was found in a 'protective stance' next to Mr Blake's body, and it appeared he had stayed at his owner's side for nearly 24 hours. It is thought that Mr Blake, a retired veterinarian from New Mexico, had died of natural causes when he stopped for lunch while skiing near the Delores County line. 'There are a large number of coyotes in the area and Buddy refused to leave Mr Blake’s body until we spent some time coaxing him to trust us, Sheriff Bill Masters told KRQE. A GPS tracker the experienced skier used helped the rescue team find him after his worried wife, Marlene Blake reported him missing. When her husband failed to check in with her on Friday, Mrs Blake feared that he may have died. But she said knowing Buddy would be protecting him helped ease her mind during the rescue. Companion: Robert often took his four-year-old retriever with him on skiing trips . 'I knew Buddy was with him, and would not leave him, I knew that, you know just from my heart,' she said. After keeping a vigil over Mr Blake, the four-year-old dog is now providing companionship for the skier's grieving widow, who said she couldn't 'make it without him'. The family have thanked the mountain rescue team who searched for Mr Blake, including the four-man crew of a helicopter that crashed during the mission. The helicopter, which was carrying a sheriff's deputy and three Classic Lifeguard members, had a sudden loss of power at 10,000ft.

"By . Associated Press . Rebels allied with a young Fidel Castro burst into the street outside Havana's Government Palace as soldiers loyal to strongman Fulgencio Batista rain gunfire from above. Steps away, Ernest Hemingway and a young journalist friend dive for cover behind a parked car. An international film crew in recent weeks has been re-enacting this and other historic scenes in the streets of Havana for Papa, a biopic about the budding friendship between Hemingway and the reporter in the turbulent Cuba of the 1950s. Years in the making, producers say it is the first full-length feature film with a Hollywood director and actors to be shot in the country since the 1959 revolution. Scroll down for video . Director Bob Yari, left, with Joely Richardson, center, and Adrian Sparks, right, during the filming in April of the movie Papa in Havana Bay, Cuba. The movie is based on an autobiographical script by journalist Denne Bart Petitclerc who befriended Hemingway while he lived on the island . Actor Joely Richardson sits down to have her makeup applied during the shooting of Papa in Cuba. She said being involved in the project has been 'chaotic... but up there with my best experiences' Actor Giovanni Ribisi during the filming of Papa. He plays the journalist Denne Bart Petitclerc who befriended Hemingway and went on his legendary fishing trips after sending the author a fan letter . Due to decades of ill will between the two countries and Washington's 52-year-long embargo, other movies ostensibly set here, such as The Godfather Part II and 1990's Havana, were filmed in stand-in locations like the Dominican Republic. 'It was an absolute passion to actually make it in Cuba where everything that is in the script happened, where the finca (farm) is where (Hemingway) lived, where his boat was, all the spots from the Morro castle to Cojimar where he fished,' director Bob Yari said. 'It's all here, so trying to duplicate it somewhere else was not very appealing.' Shooting began in March and wrapped over the weekend on the joint Canadian-Cuban-American production, with the island's governmental film institute known as ICAIC providing location support, period costumes and local actors. Papa came to Cuba under a U.S. Treasury Department license exempting it from most embargo restrictions. The film's makers said there was a cap on how much they could spend, but would not say how much or release overall budget figures. In this April 24 photo, actors and crew work on a fishing boat while shooting Papa in Havana Bay. The movie is allowed to be filmed in Cuba due to a U.S. Treasury Department license exempting it from most 52-year-long embargo restrictions . Cuban supporting actors wait for their scene during the shooting the movie Papa in Havana, Cuba. An international film crew has filming in the streets of Havana in recent weeks . Author Ernest Hemingway at home in Cuba in 1952. He lived on the island from 1939 to 1960 and wrote much of The Old Man and the Sea there, for which he won the Nobel Prize . Tropical plants surround Finca Vigia, Ernest Hemingway's former estate, 12 kilometers from Havana. The film crew have been allowed unprecedented access to the property . Ernest Hemingway's desk in the study of Finca Vigia (Lookout Farm) where he wrote his masterpiece, The Old Man And The Sea . For licensing purposes the movie qualified as a documentary, since it depicts a firsthand account of real events that took place here. So it's unlikely just any Hollywood blockbuster would get the same permission in the future. Though the title derives from the Nobel Prize-winning novelist's nickname, the movie is based on an autobiographical script by Denne Bart Petitclerc, who is played by Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan). Hemingway is portrayed by theater and screen veteran Adrian Sparks. Petitclerc was abandoned by his father as a young boy, fell in love with Hemingway's writing and later came to see him as a father figure. While working for the Miami Herald in the 1950s, Petitclerc wrote a letter to Hemingway professing his admiration. He didn't intend to send it, but his girlfriend found it and dropped it in the mail. On a recent Saturday, a reading room at the University of Havana library stood in for the Herald newsroom. Cuban extras milled about in slim ties and saddle shoes, long skirts and horn-rimmed glasses. Vintage typewriters clacked away. The scene retells the moment when Petitclerc, known as Ed in the movie, fields a fateful phone call that at first he thinks is a prank by one of his pals. 'Good letter, kid,' says Hemingway. 'You like to fish?' Actors Giovanni Ribisi, top left, Adrian Sparks, top third right, and Joely Richardson (sitting, right) film scenes for the Hemingway biopic which has been years in the making . Film crews move equipment during a scene on a fishing boat in Havana Bay.

Ernest Hemingway fishes from his beloved boat Pilar in Cuba in the Fifties during his time spent living on the island of Cuba . Before long, Ed is on a boat with his idol, and the two strike up a friendship that would last until Hemingway's 1961 suicide. Journalist Denne Bart Petitclerc became friends with Hemingway in the 1950s after he sent him a fan letter . The film crew got access to some of Havana's most iconic locales, including the former Government Palace, which long ago was turned into a museum celebrating Castro's revolution. At the majestic Grand Theater, which is closed for restoration, a sumptuous salon was tricked out to look like the bar of the Ambos Mundos hotel where Hemingway frequently stayed. In this scene, Ed is tipped off by notorious mobster Santo Trafficante (actor James Remar; Django Unchained, Dexter) that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover has it out for Hemingway. Producers even secured unprecedented permission to shoot inside Hemingway's former estate, Finca Vigia, today considered such a shrine that tourists aren't even allowed inside and must peer in through the windows. Sparks who has played Hemingway on stage since 2005, confessed to something of a spiritual connection to the writer and said it was a magical experience portraying him in the land he loved. 'To be playing a section of the film . where he's struggling with writer's block, I'm standing on exactly the . square foot of ground that he stood on, with his typewriter in front of . me, playing the scene. It wasn't acting, it was channeling,' Sparks . said. 'It was just allowing him to come through.' There have also been some only-in-Cuba moments of frustration. In . a country with a history of high-seas defections, something as simple . as getting on a boat requires official approval. So when cast members' names were missing from a list one day, an open-water shoot was delayed.

Yari said trying to make the movie in somewhere other than Cuba 'was not very appealing' El Floridita in Havana's historic old town was a well-known hangout of Hemingway in the 1950s. It is unclear if the movie will be filmed there although Cuban officials have allowed Papa to be filmed at Hemingway's former estate on the island . Cuba's scarce and creaky Internet service forced the crew to return to the yesteryear practice of slipping the day's call sheets under hotel room doors, rather than sending them by email. Much of the equipment had to be brought in from overseas to guarantee high production values. But the payoff was the opportunity to shoot in a city that has in many ways remained frozen in the 1950s, with classic American automobiles from the era readily available to provide a historic backdrop. 'It's been chaotic. Every day there's a new drama,' said English actor Joely Richardson (Nip/Tuck, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo), who plays Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary. 'It's been so nutty. But you know what? It's up there with my best experiences. It's been fantastic.' Petitclerc went on to a long career as a journalist and writer of books, TV shows and movies, including the screenplay for Islands in the Stream, based on the Hemingway novel of the same name. He died in 2006. Hemingway lived in Cuba from 1939 to 1960 and wrote much of The Old Man and the Sea and other works here, and islanders claim him as much as Americans do. The two countries' mutual affection for Hemingway is among the few things they agree on. Cuba and the U.S. have cooperated multiple times to preserve his writings and belongings - so it's not surprising the first Hollywood feature to shoot in Cuba is about him. 'Hemingway was probably the most prominent American to make Cuba his home, and I think the people of Cuba to this day cherish him and love him,' said Yari. 'And hopefully this film will become an addition to that component of bridging this gap between two cultures and two peoples that have drifted apart.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . The South Korean ferry that overturned last month killing 269 people was caused by excessive cargo, it has been reported. The news comes just a day after officials confirmed a civilian diver helping to recover trapped bodies in the wreckage died after losing communication with the task force. The Sewol ferry was carrying 467 passengers and crew, including more than 300 high school students on a school trip when it capsized on April 16. Investigators believe that the Sewol ferry, pictured, capsized last month as the ship was carrying excess cargo . According to the country’s coastguard, 35 people are still missing. Now it is thought that authorities believe the cargo aboard the vessel was double the ship’s limit and wasn’t tied down correctly. Senior prosecutor Yang Joong-jin told CNN: ‘The lashing devices that should have held cargo goods steady were loose, and some of the crew members did not even know how to use them correctly.’ A memorial for South Korean civilian diver Lee Kwang-wook, who died in the search for bodies . A joint investigation by South Korean Police and a prosecuting team also believe that it wasn’t the first time that the ferry had excess cargo adding that the Sewol carried more cargo than it should have 139 times on the Incheon to Jeju route since March 2013. Four employees of the ferry's owner, Cheonghaejin Marine Co., have already been indicted over the last two weeks, including a senior executive. Recovery teams are still searching for the bodies of people who are unaccounted for and yesterday, a diver involved in the search died. The civilian diver, named as Lee Kwang-wook, died in hospital after becoming unconscious following searches off the southern cost of South Korea, where the Sewol sank. Some task force team officials say the 53-year-old diver was pulled to the surface by fellow divers after losing communication. Searches for bodies have been hampered by strong currents and floating debris inside the ship. Today, the South Korean prime minister called for underwater searches to be completed by the weekend. Chung Hong-won told a cabinet council meeting that workers must ‘resolve to finish searches’ by Saturday as tidal currents are forecast to be weak until then. Family members weep during a rally to pay tribute to the victims of the sunken ferry Sewol on Saturday . The slow searches have deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news . The slow searches have deepened the anguish of families of missing people, who have been camping out at a nearby port waiting for the news of their loved ones. Last the weekend, South Korean President Park Geun-hye visited the port where the rescue operation is based to console families and encourage divers. It has been reported that mattresses and clothing from the ship have been found up to nine miles away from the accident site. Trawler nets were being set up to catch any items that may float away from the ship.","Investigators believe capsized Sewol was carrying twice ship's cargo limit .

"By . Wills Robinson . Resignation: Yingluck Shinawatra has been forced to step down after Thailand's Constitutional Court found her guilty of abuse of power . Thailand's prime minister has been forced to resign after the Constitutional Court found her guilty of abusing her power, pushing the country deeper into political turmoil. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, 46, was charged with abusing her authority by transferring a senior civil servant to another position in 2011. The court ruled that the transfer was carried out with a 'hidden agenda' to benefit her politically powerful family and, therefore, violated the constitution, an accusation she has denied. 'Transferring government officials must be done in accordance with moral principle,' the court said in its ruling. 'Transferring with a hidden agenda is not acceptable.' It is not immediately clear who will become the new acting prime minister. The ruling also forced out nine Cabinet members who the court said were complicit in the transfer of Thawil Pliensri from National Security Council Chief to a role in Yingluck's office. The verdict marks the latest dramatic twist in Thailand's long-running political crisis. It is a victory for Yingluck's opponents who for the past six months have been engaged in violent street protests demanding she step down to make way for an interim unelected leader. But it does little to resolve Thailand's political crisis as it leaves the country in limbo - and primed for more clashes. Since November, more than 20 have been killed and hundreds injured in demonstrations. The ruling also casts doubt on whether new elections planned for July will take place, which would anger Yingluck's mostly rural supporters who have called for a major rally in Bangkok on Saturday. Reaction: Anti-government supporters celebrate after hearing the news that Prime Minister Yingluck Sinawatra was forced to step down following a court ruling . Coverage: The judge, sitting in Bangkok, read out the verdict live on television . It also remains far from clear whether her opponents will be able to achieve other key demands, including creating a reform council overseen by a leader of their choice who will carry out various steps to rid the country of corruption and what they say is money politics, including alleged vote-buying. The campaign against Yingluck has been the latest chapter in Thailand's political upheaval that began when her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted by a 2006 military coup. It came after protestors accused him of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for the constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Controversial: She was charged with abusing her authority in 2011 when she moved a civil servant to another position. Her supporters claim she has been the target of a 'judicial coup' Raising a glass: Protestors, who have been filling the streets and calling for Yingluck to be ousted for the last six months, toast their 'victory' The Constitutional Court in 2007 made . a landmark ruling dissolving Thaksin's original Thai Rak Thai party for . fraud in a 2006 election, and banned its executives from politics for . five years. Thaksin went into self-imposed exile in 2008 to escape a . two-year jail sentence for conflict of interest while prime minister. Thaksin's allies in late 2007 handily . won the first post-coup election, but the Constitutional Court in 2008 . kicked out two successive pro-Thaksin prime ministers. A coalition government then cobbled . together by the opposition Democrat Party had to use the army to put . down pro-Thaksin demonstrations in 2010 that left more than 90 people . dead in street battles, but Yingluck and her Pheu Thai party won a . sweeping majority in a mid-2011 general election. Yingluck's fortunes plunged when her . party's lawmakers last year used shady legislative tactics to try . to ram through a law that would have given an amnesty to political . offenders of the previous eight years, including Thaksin.

"By . Emily Crane . A young boy has narrowly missed being hit by two cars after he dashed out onto a busy Singapore street. The toddler was captured on a dashboard camera running straight into oncoming traffic on Bedok North Road at 8.50pm last Friday. The driver who recorded the ordeal can be heard shouting when the small boy suddenly appears in front of his car. Mad dash: A toddler was nearly hit by two vehicles when he ran out onto a busy road in Singapore on Friday . He braked just in time before honking his horn several times. The driver shouted when the little boy failed to stop and almost got collected by a taxi in the next lane. The toddler seemed unfazed by his near miss. He turned around momentarily in front of the taxi as a woman dashed into the camera frame with her handbag under her arm. But he raced off again and only stopped when the woman caught up with him on the other side of the road. The one-minute video was uploaded to streetdirectory.com's Facebook page on Tuesday. Many who watched the video praised the driver for his quick reflexes but also condemned the woman for not keeping the toddler close as they crossed the road. Near miss: Two vehicles had raced past just before the boy ran onto Bedok North Road . Frightening footage: One of the drivers recorded the ordeal on his car's dashboard camera . 'The driver was very quick to see this child in a split second. Able to avoid the child and at the same the car behind him. The praise should be given to the driver who was alert and vigilant. It could happen to any body and not to specific people. Life is precious,' Margisvaran Chris posted. Wendy Cheng said: 'Parents must always hold their hands. Even till now, my boy is 11, as a mother, I will never let go this hand when crossing the road'. 61 children aged under 12 have been casualties in road accidents this year in Singapore – a 15 percent increase from last year, according to Yahoo!

"By . Chris Paine . A Mississippi policeman who was refereeing an amateur youth basketball match has been charged with murder after a coach he fought with during and after the game died from injuries resulting from the scuffle. Hinds County Sheriff's Deputy Joshua Adams was charged over Monday's death of 25-year-old Justin Griffin. Adams, 37, was refereeing a 7th-grade AAU state tournament game in which Griffin was coaching on Sunday. The two argued over play calls on the court and later Griffin was attacked in the parking lot outside, police said. Griffin died from blunt-force trauma to the head from injuries in the fight, said Hinds County Coroner Sharon Grisham-Stewart. Now Griffin's family and friends are calling for swift justice to be served against Adams and a second unnamed Sheriff's Deputy. A family friend holds photograph of James Griffin, left, and his son Justin Griffin, 25, a youth basketball coach who died after a fight with a referee . James Griffin, father of Justin Griffin, 25, mourns his son who died from blunt-force trauma to the head due to injuries suffered in the fight . 'We believe this was an unprovoked act of aggression as a result of our investigation,' Assistant Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. 'That's why we charged him with the murder.' Adams is jailed after being denied bond . Tuesday. A second unnamed deputy in uniform, working as a security guard . at the gym - is being investigated. Vance said police are consulting . prosecutors about charges. Both deputies are suspended without pay pending an internal investigation by the sheriff's office, said Othor Cain, spokesman for Hinds County Sheriff Tyrone Lewis. Lewis will ultimately decide whether either deputy is fired, though Cain said he couldn't say when the investigations would be finished. James Griffin, Justin Griffin's father, disputed accounts by authorities that his son started the fight. Dozens of people gathered at Griffin's home Tuesday evening, saying they wanted to uphold Griffin's reputation. 'He was assaulted and killed by the guys who were supposed to be protecting him,' the father told reporters Tuesday. 'My boy was not a thug. We raised him and we raised him right.' Dwayne Pickett comforts his son Julian, following the death of his best friend and fellow coach Justin Griffin . Joshua Adams was working as a referee when he punched Griffin . Hours after Griffin died, police arrested Adams, who did not make his initial appearance in open court. Court personnel said he was privately arraigned by Jackson municipal Judge William Walker in a hallway. It was unclear Tuesday whether Adams had an attorney. Vance said that from reviewing 'two or three' partial videos of the scene, it's clear the second deputy participated in the assault. But he said it's not clear whether murder is the right charge. Julian Pickett, a fellow coach and longtime friend of Griffin, said the coach did complain vocally about Adams' officiating during the game. He also said that Adams had officiated previous games in ways that Pickett and Griffin found unfair. Pickett, though, said the team, the Kingdom Warriors, came from behind to win Sunday's game. Then he and Griffin watched another game that Adams officiated without saying anything. Vance said surveillance video shows Griffin was walking out of the Mississippi Basketball & Athletics facility when Adams came out behind them with the second deputy. Pickett said Adams grabbed Griffin and when he pulled free, the security guard reached for an electronic stun gun. Pickett said he tried to intervene, but Adams pursued Griffin. 'Justin swings; he swings; he hit him,' Pickett said of Adams. 'Justin went down and he just stood there.' Pickett said he took video of part of the assault on his mobile phone, one of the videos that police have reviewed. Dwayne Pickett, Justin Pickett's father, said family and friends had to pursue police Sunday and Monday to press charges. Mississippi Basketball & Athletics facility in north Jackson is run by the nonprofit Mississippi Basketball and Athletics Foundation. The facility offers camps, clinics and training in basketball, volleyball and physical fitness. No one was present at the gym Tuesday morning, and a telephone call was answered by a recording that said the voice mailbox was full.","Mississippi sheriff charged with murder over death of Justin Griffin, 25 .

"By . Amanda Williams . At just 6ft wide, and sandwiched between two terraces, it his hardly an imposing structure. But London's narrowest house is set to be torn down after its owner lost a legal challenge against the local council. A planning inspector ruled that the property - in Leyton, east London - looked 'singularly out of place' and was 'wholly unsatisfactory'. He has now given the owners three months to remove it. The narrowest house in London - just 6ft wide, sandwiched between two terraces - is to be torn down after its owner lost a legal challenge . Building work on the wooden property began in May last year. Neighbours at the time said they were 'very concerned' for the safety of people living in the home. Waltham Forest Council soon ordered the building work to stop on site, which used to be a garage, as planning permission had not been granted. The authority later ordered the structure to be torn down, but the owner Zim Properties in Leyton, appealed against the decision and the matter was handed to the Planning Inspectorate. But the appeal was dismissed and the owner has been given three months to tear it down or face further action. Planning Inspector Ian Currie ordered Zim Properties to pay the council’s legal costs after deciding the appeal was unreasonable. In his ruling, he said it was not of a 'high standard of design', as required by Policy DM30. He added: 'It is much narrower than the terrace houses it adjoins, giving it a pinched appearance, it finished in wood rather than brick and it has flat roof, unlike its neighbours with their pitched roofs. Building work on the wooden property in Leyton, east London, began in May last year. But a planning inspector ruled that it looked 'singularly out of place' and was 'wholly unsatisfactory' The wooden structure is built on the site of a former garage which was attached to number 105, but does not have planning permission . 'Overall, it looks singularly out of place, in an area that has maintained its late nineteenth/early twentieth century character remarkably intact, and I conclude that the design of the structure is wholly unsatisfactory.' Waltham Forest Council is set to serve an enforcement notice to tear down an illegal building built between two terraced homes. Work started on the plywood abode in Leyton, about a month ago, and it has quickly divided neighbours, some of whom welcome the home while others fear it will create overcrowding. The wooden structure is built on the site of a former garage which was attached to number 105, but does not have planning permission. The council was not immediately sure whether it had broken planning regulations, but a spokesman said the authority will serve a notice to pull down the structure 'as soon as possible', after serving a temporary notice to prevent building continuing over the weekend. Last May the council served a temporary notice to prevent further building work. At the time, cabinet member for the environment Clyde Loakes said: 'As soon as this issue came to the attention of the council, officers visited the site in the company of the owner. In order to prevent any further unauthorised development a Temporary Stop Notice was served. 'Arrangements have been made for council staff to monitor the site over the long weekend and the neighbours directly affected by the development have been asked to contact the council should any further works take place.' Work started on the plywood abode in Leyton, about a month ago, and it has quickly divided neighbours, some of whom welcome the home while others fear it will create overcrowding . Neighbours said no tenants have been found for the property, which is still under construction, and do not know the owner of the garage or the name of the building company working on it. Nearby resident Claire Weiss, 65, said she has complained to the council about the building. She said: 'I feel sorry for whoever will live there. People shouldn’t have to live in a space like that, even with the housing crisis. 'Passing by I’ve seen inside when the doors open and you can see right through to the back garden. There’s no dividing wall. It’s a garage with a loft. 'It’s dreadful and it doesn’t fit in at all with the other houses.' There are 24,000 people on the council’s housing waiting list and, as of March, just 60 empty homes in the borough, many of which have been allocated already. The council is trying to free up space for housing developments by targeting disused garages. It has found 159 sites around the borough, and the strategy is expected to create hundreds of homes. Des Douglas, 64, who lives opposite the development, said: 'It’s a bit rough but other than that it doesn’t bother me. It hasn’t been used for years as a garage so why not? 'There’s a shortage of housing so everything helps.'","Planning inspector ruled east London property looked 'out of place'

"By . Richard Spillett . Animal lover Bill Oddie has become the latest victim of the plague of so-called 'super rats' sweeping Britain. The BBC presenter revealed more than 30 of the creatures invaded the garden of his home in Hampstead, north London earlier this week. Despite being known for hosting wildlife programmes and recently condemning the killing of migrating birds, the 72-year-old called in pest controllers to get rid the creatures. Scroll down for video . Bill Oddie, pictured in the garden of his Hampstead home, which he revealed was invaded by rats last weekend . Pest controller say the numbers of so-called 'super rats' are rising as they develop an immunity to traditional poisons . Oddie, 72, told his 32,000 Twitter followers of the 'invasion' on Sunday, after a weekend blighted by the rodents. He tweeted: 'Rat invasion yesterday. At least 30 in garden. Mainly young. Climbing, jumping, tumbling. Quite entertaining, BUT. Called the Pied Piper.' Oddie, who lives at the house with his wife, Laura, 61, and daughter Rosie, 26, has also used his Twitter feed to back calls for hunters in Malta to stop shooting birds migrating to Britain. His brush with the rats comes after figures revealed that in some part of the UK, the number of vermin has surged by 50 per cent since this time last year. This huge rat was caught in Cornwall earlier this year. It measured 50cm from tail to nose . Pest control experts have warned that similar large rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and discard left-over fast food . And experts believe the rat population could soar from 80 million to 160 million by the end of the year. Many local authorities have shelved free pest control for homes as they battle funding cuts.  And in some towns, councils have reduced bin collections to just once a month - leaving mountains of rotting rubbish to lure in the creatures. It is feared some of the larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill. Pest controllers say traditional poisons are killing off rats which are susceptible, but those that survive quickly breed, creating a species immune to pesticide. This giant rat was reportedly found on the banks of the Thames Estuary in Gravesend, Kent . A dog-owner in Tunbridge Wells, Kent was shocked to see his pet dog emerge from a bush with one of the rodents during a walk in a park . Oddie is not the first famous face to be affected by an increase in pests, Liz Hurley was said to be having a problem with mice at her Herefordhire country home earlier this year. Oddie told of the rat problem in the same week it was announced he is to return to BBC2's Springwatch wildlife show. He was dropped from the show in late 2008 and has gone on to claim that the impact of his departure led to a spell in a psychiatric hospital. But the BBC revealed this week that he will feature in a new series of the programme, which will be fronted by Chris Packham, Michaela Strachan and Martin Hughes-Games. The BBC said of Oddie's involvement: 'Bill returns with his own very special look back at our wildlife and how it has fared over the past decade.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . A judge has insisted that ‘this knife business must end’ as he jailed three men for life for the murder of a bright schoolboy who had ambitions to be a doctor. Ajmol Alom, 16, had been playing football with some friends in a park in Poplar, east London, last August 12 and were on their way home when the gang wearing hoodies and bandanas attacked them near some shops in Spey Street. Without saying a word, they knifed Ajmol’s friend, in the face then turned on Ajmol when he intervened. Tragic: Ajmol Alom, 16 who was stabbed to death near his home in Poplar, east London, last August, just days before his GCSE results . The attackers used kitchen knives and a machete-like blade to carry out the assaults. Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Mashudur Rahman, 22, and Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20, were told by Judge Martyn Zeidman, QC at Snaresbrook Crown Court that they will serve a minimum of 23 years. Ajmol, described as one of the brightest pupils at nearby Langdon Park School, was just days away from receiving his GCSE results and it later emerged that he had achieved top marks including eight A and three B grades. Judge Zeidman said the gang’s actions had ‘imposed upon the Alom family a life sentence of sadness and mourning’ adding that the attack on Ajmol and his friend, who was stabbed in the face with a 10in knife but has since made a good recovery, were ‘totally unprovoked’. Murderers: Aminur Nadir Khan, 20, Ali Akbar Choudhury, 20 and Mashudur Rahman, 22, who were told at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, they will serve a minimum of 23 years for the murder of schoolboy Ajmol Alom . His Honour Judge Martyn Zeidman QC has issued a call for an end to 'knife madness' In the year ending in March 2013, 400 people died as a result of knife crime and the judge said: ‘This knife madness must end. There has to be a change. But cold figures can never sufficiently reflect the tragic sorrow caused by knife crime. ‘In our case there were two totally unprovoked attacks upon 16-year-old boys. ‘The first stabbing was to [Ajmol friend]'s face but that did not quench your joint thirst for violence. ‘Within a minute or so you were each a party to the second attack, this time upon Ajmol Alom. You each played a part in bringing his life to an end.’ Scene of the crime: Spey Street in Poplar, east London, where Ajmol Alom was murdered last summer . Judge Zeidman said that he could not say for sure which defendant stabbed each victim but it was clear it was a ‘joint enterprise’ between them. ‘I am sure that this was a planned premeditated group attack, carried out in revenge upon a random selection of targets who were entirely innocent of any wrongdoing and who had not in any way provoked the attack,’ he said. The judge . told the defendants that Rohima Khatum, Ajmol’s mother, said in a victim . impact statement that her son’s death ‘has left a massive hole in my . life which can never be filled. ‘There . is no laughter in our home anymore. I have no interest in planning for . the future and I find it hard to enjoy anything,’ she said. ‘I feel . like my heart has been taken away.’ All three defendants had previous convictions for violence, the court heard. Rahman received a three-year sentence in a young offenders’ institution for stabbing someone in the face with a seven-inch knife, while Choudhary did not have any knife crime on his record but has 15 previous convictions, including an unprovoked group attack on a man in a street. Khan, who was taken into care at the age of 15, has four offences of assault or battery on his record, including a robbery in which he threatened a man on a bus with a knife, the court was told. After the men were led down from the dock, Judge Zeidman offered his condolences to Ajmol’s family in the public gallery and said it was clear the teenager was an ‘exceptional person’. ‘Some have emphasised his intellectual qualities. He did brilliantly in his GCSEs and there was talk of him becoming a doctor,’ the judge said. ‘Those are useful gifts but his star quality was not his brain but his heart. He was an extraordinarily kind person, gentle and sensitive.’","Ajmol Alom, 16, murdered just days before his GCSE results .

"Dressed in an open polo shirt and jeans, the former Prime Minister stands casually as the subject of a portrait at his home in Buckinghamshire. With his hands in his pockets and what looks like a splodge of paint on his jacket, this is a most informal view of Tony Blair. But what is perhaps most noteworthy is the painting hanging behind Mr Blair - the image by British war artist Ken Howard depicting a Northern Ireland mural with the slogan ‘No Surrender’ and a Union flag and crown. Dressed in an open polo shirt and jeans, the former Prime Minister stands casually as the subject of a portrait at his home in Buckinghamshire . At a time when the arrest of Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has threatened to plunge the Northern Ireland peace process – which Mr Blair helped to negotiate - into fresh turmoil, the image is striking. In the mural painting, obscured from view by Mr Blair is a small child under the words ‘WAR child’ and the statement: ‘Provies rule ok’ - slang for the Provisional IRA. Ken Howard, who was Official War Artist to Northern Ireland in 1973 and documented the Troubles for the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘If I sat drawing in the middle of Falls Road, the local Catholics would come up and see what I was doing, and there was nothing questionable about it. They knew I was with the army and where I was staying because the intelligence at that time was pretty good. But I never felt in danger.’ Mr Blair bought the painting at auction for £26,250 in 2003, and it now hangs in his office at home. Alastair Adams, who was commissioned to paint the former premier by the National Portrait Gallery, said the Ken Howard picture made an ‘interesting backdrop’ to the portrait and said: ‘It reflects his work back in the day on the Northern Ireland peace process.’ Mr Adams also said he wanted to capture Mr Blair ‘as he was’ and added: ‘I wanted to paint him as he was on a day-to-day basis when I visited to undertake sittings for the formal NPG commission. ‘The work was completed during the Olympics and the strong presence of the Union flag seemed to fit the occasion. ‘He was a compliant sitter and was happy to pose for me however I saw fit, no strings attached.’ Another of Mr Adams’ portraits of Mr Blair hangs at the National Portrait Gallery, but the image going on display later this month was in the artist’s private collection and it is the first time it will be shown in public. The portrait of Tony Blair will hang in the Royal Society Of Portrait Painters Annual Open Exhibition, at the Mall Galleries, London, from May 8-23.","Thee image of the former PM was painted by British war artist Ken Howard .

"By . Dan Ripley . Follow @@Ripley_77 . Will Man City beat West Ham to win the title? Manuel Pellegrini has claimed he was always certain that Manchester City would go on to beat Aston Villa, despite a nervous first hour against the Villans. Two goals from Edin Dzeko as well as late strikes from Stevan Jovetic and Yaya Toure helped City record a 4-0 win at the Etihad Stadium. But City toiled in attack for long periods, and only scored the opening goal in the 64th minute following a stubborn defensive showing from Paul Lambert's outfit. VIDEO Scroll down for Pellegrini: Man City always believed we could win title . Team effort: Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini congratulates Edin Dzeko after substituting the striker . Keep going: Pellegrini encouraged his Manchester City side to keep playing the same way after half-time, resulting in Edin Dzeko scoring the first of his two goals in the 64th minute . Pellegrini's team only had one shot on target in the first half, but the City boss claimed he was always confident his side would make the breakthrough by sticking to their guns. 'It was a big test because it was not an easy game, Pellegrini told Sky Sports. 'We now have to win at home if we want to continue what we can do in the future. 'The team played very well for 90 minutes and we were very patient in the first half. We were patient and prepared, it's not easy to play against 10 defenders but I spoke to the players at half-time and I told them to continue what we were doing. 'We were playing well. I was absolutely sure we would find space to score the goal.' The result means Manchester City only need to beat West Ham on the final day of the season to win their second title in three years. Stubborn: Aston Villa's defence caused City serious problems for over an hour as Yaya Toure goes to ground trying to fend off Villans defender Ron Vlaar . Fans' backing: City fans unveiled a banner in support of manager Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium . Not again, surely? Sergio Aguero's injury time strike against QPR famously won Manchester City the 2012 title . The scenario will bring back memories of the 2012 title race when Roberto Mancini's City team needed to beat QPR on the final day, eventually stumbling to the title thanks to two dramatic late goals against the Hoops.

"By . Richard Spillett . Freddie Starr has spoken of his 19 months in legal limbo after an investigation into claims he molested a string of women was finally dropped this week. The entertainer said the more than a year he spent on bail has been 'mental torture' which left him considering suicide and turned him into a physical wreck. Starr, 71, was first arrested in November 2012, then rearrested three further times in April last year and January and February this year. Scroll down for video . Freddie Starr outside his home in Warwickshire earlier this week after the CPS confirmed that he will not be charged as part of Operation Yewtree due to insufficient evidence . Starr (right), 71, and his lawyer Dean Dunham (left), both said he would mount a legal case against police . Starr, pictured at his home after his first arrest in 2012, says his months on bail have been 'mental torture' But the case against him was dropped this week when prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago, which he has always denied. After looking frail in a press conference outside his home in Studley, Warwickshire earlier this week, Starr has now told how the months spent with the case hanging over him have taken a devastating toll on his health. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'This has been like a dark cloak that I have had to wear all the time. It's been mental torture.' He said the worst thing about his situation was that he could not be left unsupervised with his daughter Ebony, seven, after a 'heart-wrenching' visit from social services. Starr, who says he has suffered four heart attacks in the past, said the sleepless nights and stress hit his health and left him considering suicide. His wife Sophie Lea, 33, has been looking after him and, at one point, had to check on him regularly to ensure he didn't try to take his own life, the paper reported. Starr leaving his home in Studley, Warwickshire earlier this week. He said he considered suicide . Starr, . whose health has deteriorated so much he has needed a wheelchair during . the investigation, has criticised the authorities after the decision. Speaking at his Warwickshire village mansion earlier this week, his lawyer Dean Dunham . said: ‘This will not be the end of this matter. I’ll . tell you this, we will not be sitting down and letting this go as it is . now. The police have some questions to answer and they will be . answering them.' Long battle: Starr pictured in November 2012 . Despite his ailing health, Starr has now vowed to get back to work and says he is considering featuring in a reality TV show. Starr . was the second celebrity to be arrested by Scotland Yard’s Operation . Yewtree when he was held on November 1, 2012. He was re-bailed nine times as the controversial investigation . engulfed a series of celebrities. The . comedian accused police and prosecutors of ‘playing dirty’ by . associating him with known paedophiles Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter. He suspects the announcement of charges being dropped was delayed by the Clifford case, because his . notorious front page story – ‘Freddie Starr ate my hamster’ – featured . in the evidence. But prosecutors insist they only made their final . decision at the end of last week and did not receive a full case file from police . until March. A Crown . Prosecution Service spokesman told MailOnline today: 'The decision not . to prosecute was only formalised on the Friday last week.' 'The CPS received initial material from the Metropolitan Police Service regarding these allegations in December 2012. 'Investigative advice was provided to the police throughout 2013 and the final evidence was submitted to the CPS in March 2014. 'The decision to re-bail that month was made for legal reasons.' After the case was dropped, Starr's lawyer aimed a strongly-worded volley of . criticism at the authorities whom he accused of orchestrating a . ‘harrowing’ ordeal. Mr . Dunham said: ‘It has taken too long; it has not been done properly. We . presented evidence right at the start of this matter  that we say was . conclusive to show  that he was not guilty of these allegations.’ Freddie Starr and his wife Sophie in 2011. Starr will not be prosecuted after spending 18 months on bail . Comedian Starr at the height of his fame, pictured two decades ago in 1997 (left) and 1995 (right) Starr . was one of the most high-profile and outspoken Yewtree suspects and the . decision to release him is a blow for an inquiry which some have . branded a ‘witch-hunt’ It came just days after detectives secured . their first conviction when publicist Max Clifford was found guilty of a . string of sex attacks. The . claims against Starr first came to light just weeks after the Savile . scandal first emerged in October 2012. Starr made a failed attempt to . secure a High Court injunction to restrict media reporting of the claim . and hired private investigators to examine it. This week's decision leaves only a handful of Yewtree suspects on bail, including Glitter, who was arrested five days before Starr. Others . include BBC DJ Paul Gambaccini, and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning.

The former driver who worked for the BBC was found dead at his home on . the first day of his trial in October last year. The 67-year-old was . arrested in December 2012 and charged in April last year with abusing a . 12-year-old boy in 1984. ONGOING . Dave Lee Travis: The former Radio 1 star – dubbed the 'Hairy Cornflake' – was acquitted on . 12 of 14 sex assault . charges made against him.

"Aldi sales are growing at . 36.1%a year- Lidl's are up by 20.6per cent . By . Sean Poulter . Middle class shoppers are deserting Sainsbury’s and other major supermarkets with new research showing budget chains offer big savings on everything from asparagus to blueberries. Sainsbury’s yesterday revealed its smallest growth in annual profits in 10 years, with the figure rising by a modest 5.3per cent to £798 million. Industry research shows the chain’s market share is shrinking as the big four supermarkets, which includes Tesco, Asda and Morrisons, struggle to cope with the rise of the cut price rivals. Middle class shoppers are deserting Sainsbury's and other major supermarkets with new research showing budget chains offer big savings on everything from asparagus to blueberries . By contrast, Aldi sales are growing at 36.1per cent a year, while the figure at Lidl is up by 20.6per cent as they make a concerted effort to attract Middle Britain families. Two reports yesterday demonstrated how the budget stores are succeeding on the back of a combination of low prices and awards for quality food, wine and spirits. A shopping basket price comparison by the Good Housekeeping Institute looking at 19 items found on a middle class shopping list found huge savings at the budget stores. The list, which included blueberries, asparagus, pesto, pancetta, Parma ham, rocket, south American ground coffee and Greek yoghurt, came in at just £33.61 in Lidl and £34.01 in Aldi. Sainsbury’s was more expensive than Asda, Tesco and Morrisons with a shopping bill of £49.32, but most significantly its basket cost some 47per cent more than the Lidl version. Consumer director at Good Housekeeping, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘Discounters like Lidl and Aldi aren’t just for people looking for cheap basics. Our shopping list shows you can now buy anything from South American filter coffee and ciabatta to Parma ham and flour for the bread maker. ‘Since the recession consumers are no longer embarrassed to be seen hunting out a bargain and why would you when you can save as much as £20 on the same basket of goods’. Retail analysts Kantar said the mainstream supermarkets are effectively being forced to cut prices in order to stem the loss of shoppers. Sales at Lidl are up by 20.6 per cent as they make a concerted effort to attract Middle Britain families . Director, Edward Garner, said: ‘There are clear signs that the major supermarkets are reviewing their strategies in the face of increasing competition.  We’re now seeing the big four moving away from ‘here today, gone tomorrow’ promotions and toward everyday low prices.’ Sainsbury’s is being forced to cut prices on some products, despite claims from the chief executive, Justin King, who is about to leave, that shoppers want more than low bills. Mr King said a focus on quality, affordable own-brand products had helped Sainsbury’s succeed in a tough retail environment. His swansong as chief executive has been marred by its most recent periodic trading update, which showed a fall in like-for-like sales after 36 consecutive quarters of growth. But he rejected suggestions that he was leaving the business at the top and said he was confident it would go from strength to strength. Sainsbury’s results showed a £92 million hit to its balance sheet as it scrapped planned supermarket developments - though it still opened 13 supermarkets during the year and extended six, adding a million square feet of space. Sales at Lidl are up by 20.6 per cent as they make a concerted effort to attract Middle Britain families . There is now a much greater focus on its network of smaller convenience stores, with 91 opened in the year, taking their total number above the number of supermarkets for the first time, and reaching sales of £1.8 billion. Sainsbury’s said its premium Taste the Difference range achieved double digit growth with more than £1.1 billion in annual sales, but sales of its ‘basics’ range declined and the brand has been re-launched. The chain acknowledged that the behaviour of savvy shoppers topping up their weekly supermarket visit with a trip to discounters or convenience stores had become ‘entrenched’ and that prices of staples such as bread, milk and eggs had come down. It said the market remained ‘intensely competitive’, but insisted it offered better quality and in-store experience than its rivals. Mr King said: ‘There has been a tremendous amount of concentration on the German discounters because they have seen a good chunk of growth in the last two or three years. But it is also true that convenience stores have been too. ‘Whatever happens in the price skirmishes that we are seeing, we have a business very well equipped to succeed in that environment.’","Sales figures have risen by a modest 5.3per cent to £798million .

The 62-year-old Dutchman will be unveiled as the new Old Trafford boss next week, once he and the club have agreed the make-up of his coaching staff. Speaking in Holland, the Dutch national coach said he he is still speaking to other clubs, but was quite happy to let it be known how much he wants the United job. VIDEO Louis van Gaal: Manchester United biggest club in the world . Soon to come? Louis van Gaal sang the praises of Manchester United, saying he'd love to join . United bound: Van Gaal with assistants Patrick Kluivert (centre) and Frans Hoek at the Dutch training camp . ‘I would love the (United) job,’ Van Gaal told BBC Sport. ‘For every coach who takes the job it’s a fantastic challenge. ‘I . hope I shall be the one but you’ll have to wait and see. There are more . clubs interested. I have more options. It is a process we’re in and . everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs. ‘But United are the biggest club in the world’. United had hoped to officially unveil Van Gaal as David Moyes’ replacement this week. They have agreed most of the details with the former Ajax, Barcelona and . Bayern Munich coach but want to announce his appointment, and the . composition of his coaching staff, all at the same time, rather than . have a drip-feed of information as was the case when Moyes took the job . last year. United also have . to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Dutch FA. Holland have a . World Cup to prepare for under Van Gaal and understandably do not want . their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach’s . future beyond Brazil 2014. Where do I sign? Van Gaal pens autographs for young Dutch fans at the World Cup training camp . Through the door: Van Gaal says United are the biggest club in the world . As . Van Gaal gets ready to take over, Phil Neville, one of the United . coaching team under the sacked Moyes, revealed how the Old Trafford lap . of honour after Tuesday’s 3-1 win over Hull City was the emptiest moment . of his career. Neville could not hide his pain as he spoke about the . traumas of a season that reduced England’s most successful club to an . object of fun. ‘It’s been a . real difficult season,’ said Neville. ‘A club that should be . challenging for league titles to  finish seventh is obviously not good . enough. And to see a man who, for the last eight years, has put so much . confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the . toughest days I’ve had in football. ‘Walking . around the pitch after the Hull game was probably the emptiest I’ve . ever felt on a football field. I took the job expecting to be walking . around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league . title or parading a league title. That’s what this club demands and . we’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that.’ All smiles: It is unknown whether current interim manager Ryan Giggs will stay at Old Trafford . It . has been the fall of Moyes that has particularly stung Neville. ‘He has . taken the majority of criticism from outside the club, but if you speak . to anyone inside then we’ve all got to take collective responsibility — . from players, the staff, the coaching staff, everybody,’ said Neville. ‘It . was really disappointing when David lost his job because I class him as . a friend. As a player, I’ve never experienced anything like that with a . manager — maybe once with Kevin Keegan at England, when he lost his . job. ‘The thing we’ve all . collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games (in . all competitions) at Old Trafford this season. That is not acceptable. ‘If . we played all our games away, then we’d be champions. But we’ve lost . games at Old Trafford against teams that we should be beating. That has . been the biggest single failing.’ Happy: But Phil Neville, with Robin van Persie, slammed United's dismal season . Neville’s . future, and that of the rest of the Class of ’92 — Ryan Giggs, Nicky . Butt and Paul Scholes — is uncertain pending Van Gaal’s arrival after . Sunday’s final game of the season against Southampton but Neville is . keen to stay on. ‘I don’t know what’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job,’ said Neville. ‘But . the season as a whole has just not been good enough. We’ve got to make . sure next season, whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching, that we . get back challenging for league titles. ‘I want to be part of United’s future, I’m a Manchester United person, I love the club. ‘Results . aside, it’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that I . love. I want to be here for the rest of my life, being involved with . United. So that’s my hope.’ Axed: But Neville insisted the blame for the campaign does not lie solely with David Moyes .

The Belgium forward, 19, has burst on the scene at Old Trafford this season; cementing his position as one of the most outstanding young players in Europe. Januzaj, who was 18 at the time, signed a new five-year deal worth £30,00-per-week in November. Big future: Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj is earning more than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were at 18 . In the shade: Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi (right) were earning less than £30,000-a-week at 18 . And the player's representative Dirk De Vriese says the deal made Januzal the best paid youngster in world football. 'I can say Adnan's the best paid youngster in the world. He earns more than Ronaldo and Messi when they were 18,' said De Vriese. And Januzaj advisor has also revealed the teenager turned down a last gasp big-money switch to Paris St Germain ahead of penning his new United deal. 'Five minutes before Adnan signed a new deal at Manchester United, PSG offered us an astonishing deal,' he said. 'As Adnan was a free agent at the end of the season, the Qatari were ready to offer anything. Anything in terms of wages and signing on fees. 'It could have been interesting from a commercial point of view. But money has never been a deciding factor in his choice.' Splashing the cash: Paris Saint-Germain made Januzaj a big offer to join Edinson Cavani and Co at the Parc des Princes . Meanwhile, manager Ryan Giggs called for . Januzaj to be given more protection on Tuesday night after the . youngster was injured in an incident with Hull midfielder David Meyler. Meyler . will be waiting anxiously to see if the FA take any action after he . appeared to deliberately stand on Januzaj's outstretched leg towards the . end of the game. If . referee Craig Pawson confirms today that he did not spot it, then the . FA will be free to act and Meyler's place in the FA Cup final against . Arsenal a week on Saturday could be in jeopardy.

It's the . second time it has happened to him this season. It's not great to see, . and it's terrible his leg. 'He . needs protecting. He's a brilliant, exciting player and the authorities . need to sort it out. It's just the length of his leg, not cutting into . his skin. It goes from his knee to his ankle.'

"By . Eileen Mccarroll-outram . When she suffered a massive stroke, Inger Wallis needed lifesaving five-hour surgery – and her distraught family were prepared for the worst. So it felt like a miracle that once she was allowed home, there were no significant lasting physical effects. Or so it seemed. In fact, the damage caused by a burst blood vessel in her brain was far more insidious . Inger, 52, former manager of retail at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, recalls: ‘The stroke happened without any warning one morning as  a terrible pain in my head and uncontrollable sickness. Invisible struggle: Inger Wallis, from London, has found that the stroke four-and-a-half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions . ‘Although I was home alone, I was able to call an ambulance myself,  and lived very close to University College Hospital, London, a specialist stroke centre. For months afterwards I had constant flashbacks of those moments, and couldn’t stop crying. But that was just the start of it.’ Inger found that the stroke four-and-a-half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions, such as getting dressed. ‘I just sat in a chair for hours not knowing what to wear. It was the same with shopping. ‘Like most people, I always had a  list at the supermarket, but if the list didn’t specify exactly which brand name, I’d stand in an aisle not knowing which to buy.’ Professor Reg Morris, from Cardiff University, a psychologist who specialises in stroke, says: ‘A stroke can be caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply the brain or by bleeding, which can be caused by injury or a weakness in the blood vessels. The result is brain damage, which can affect everything from speech and movement to reading ability. Stroked off: Inger Wallis's damage was caused caused by a burst blood vessel in her brain . ‘Normally, the worst impairment is seen immediately after a stroke  and, as bruising and swelling heals, improvement is seen. We know that two-thirds of stroke patients experience psychological problems, including depression, fatigue, sexual problems and changes in identity. ‘This can be the result of physical disability leading to isolation, but also happens without it. Whether or not the brain damage causes the psychological problems isn’t always clear.’ Further psychological assessment  at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London revealed the extent of Inger’s problems. ‘The things that had been affected were all the things I’d been good at: multi-tasking, forward-planning, thinking on the spot, working out implications, nuance. It made me laugh, then I cried.’ Her doctors referred her for psychotherapy to help her adjust. ‘I’d been a high achiever – an alpha female. At work, I had a staff of more than 50 and an £8 million budget. ‘With a husband and two teenage daughters, I would have said I was one of those “superwomen”. Suddenly, I had to adjust to a learning disability. Now I work one day a week welcoming visitors to my workplace. I’m especially geared up to look out for people like me with less obvious disability.’ Family life has changed, too. ‘My husband Simon, a supervisor at the National Gallery, has to run the house. We have a deep, loving relationship of companionship, but it’s not like before when we sparked off each other. ‘He cosseted me like an invalid for the first year afterwards, and is still terrified it could happen again. She adds: ‘I still don’t like meeting new people as they’ll just think I’m slow. I can’t tell what direction sound comes from, so I feel disorientated  all the time and suffer massive anxiety because of it. It means I can’t go  to the cinema or pub any more, and  I watch television on my own as otherwise I keep asking what’s happening because I can’t follow complicated programmes.’ The effect on Inger’s daughters, Amber, 20, and Rosie, 24, was more dramatic. ‘They became noticeably distant,’ she says. ‘My doctor explained they were frightened of getting close again in case I died. ‘Then, about five months into my recovery, I noticed Amber was very thin. I was distraught when she was diagnosed with anorexia. Basically, she couldn’t control the outcome of my stroke but she could control eating. ‘Both are still looking for their “mum”. But I couldn’t cope with anything dramatic, like boyfriend troubles.’ Inger has been helped by counselling and occupational therapy and wants to emphasise the emotional impact a stroke can have. ‘There has been practical help – I have organised all my clothes into colours and outfits so I don’t have to make so many decisions when dressing. My therapist has helped me grieve for the person I used to be, but it has taken me three years to accept where I am now.’ New data suggests that stroke patients and their families in up to two-thirds of the country have no access to psychological support. Inger says: ‘People need to realise that even if a survivor looks OK,  their lives are almost always much more challenging.’ stroke.org.uk .","Inger Wallis, from London, suffered a stroke four-and-a-half years ago .

The Spaniard arrived in Germany at the start of the season and has already won the Bundesliga, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA World Club Cup. But the former Barcelona manager is facing battle to convince his highly-talented squad that he remains the man to continue the club's recent success. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pep yelling at his players and losing it with a journalist . Under pressure: Pep Guardiola is in danger of losing the dressing room at Bayern Munich . Despite having already won three trophies this season, the club's humiliating Champions League semi-final failure against Real Madrid has raised questions over his reign. There is an emerging perception that the team has gone backwards under Guardiola, a notion amplified by their dismal showing against Carlo Ancelotti's side. And there is a growing contingent of players in the Bayern squad who share that view, fuelling concerns Guardiola is losing the dressing room. There is also a feeling the strong team-spirit that has been nurtured during Louis van Gaal and Jupp Heynckes' reign is softening under Guardiola. Bayern legend Franz Beckenbauer alluded to the problems following the demoralising defeat to Real last week. Crushed: Bayern were thrashed by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals this season . Destroyers: Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were the architects of Bayern's demise . 'Bayern are not right. This is something that we have known for weeks. The disappointment is huge,' said Beckenbauer. 'I can't change what I feel and what I feel is we must play with the ball and attack as much as possible. 'Real have a magnificent team at the moment and our limitations have been exposed to a certain extent.' Whether the internal problems at the Allianz Arena will result in Guardiola lasting just one season in Germany remains to be seen. But there will be a number of English clubs monitoring Guardiola's situation ahead of the summer managerial merry-go-round in case there is a shock change.

FA chairman Greg Dyke, whose controversial England Commission is causing major ructions, has now antagonised the Premier League by bringing forward publication of the findings. Dyke had been expected to delay the launch until next week so as not to deflect attention from the Premier League climax on Sunday. Controversy: FA chairman Greg Dyke will present his recommendations at Wembley on Thursday . But instead Dyke, having received unanimous support from the FA board, will present his recommendations at Wembley on Thursday - much to the annoyance of the top flight, who had been told that their last set of fixtures would be fully respected. Relations between the FA and Premier League - not great at the best of times - have been further strained by the belief at Gloucester Place that they have not been properly consulted during the Commission process. They have not even been sent a full copy of the report. Concern: Premier League fear England report could deflect attention from the climax on Sunday . However, the FA insist the Premier League, who have two representatives on their board, have been kept fully in the loop with numerous meetings and all available literature. The feeling on the FA board was that parts of the Commission report were already in the public domain. So, rather than let opponents drip-feed further information, it was better to get everything out in the open. There are fears at Leeds United that numerous staff will be axed in a purge by new owner Massimo Cellino. Purge: Massimo Cellino has been at Leeds conducting a root and branch investigation .

BBC Sport, as if they haven't got enough sports PR operatives running around, for some reason allowed Rio Ferdinand (above) to have his agent Jamie Moralee and publicist Justin Rigby present in media interviews at their World Cup launch. Rigby even intervened in the press questioning because he felt there had been too much talk about Manchester United. Danny Mills, the most ridiculed member of Greg Dyke's England Commission, has gone native to the extent of describing newspaper stories revealing some of the proposals in advance of Thursday's launch as 'selfish and irresponsible'. Mills, who said he had attended 25 Commission meetings, has totally bought into Dyke's blueprint, claiming everyone needs to read the full 50-page report to understand the nuances.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A farmer's daughter who says she was left at home ‘with a muck fork’ while her sisters went out dancing has triumphed in her fight for a fair share of her family’s £7million estate. Eirian Davies, 45, who was nicknamed the ‘Cowshed Cinderella’, claims she was assured by her parents that she would ultimately take over the thriving farm and its pedigree milking herd. But following a row they began proceedings to evict her, while she began a legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in South Wales. Eirian Davies won her legal campaign to secure what she said was her rightful share of the farm in South Wales. Her parents have now seen their challenge against that decision dismissed at the Appeal Court . Miss Davies won her case and yesterday a challenge by her parents, Tegwyn, 75, and Mary, 76, was dismissed by the Appeal Court. Lord Justice Floyd, sitting with Lords Justice Richards and Underhill, said he hoped the family would now resolve their differences in relation to her entitlement ‘without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation’. Miss Davies told the original hearing that she missed out on going to Young Farmers’ Club dances with her two sisters, Enfys and Eleri, as a teenager because she had to stay at home to deal with her chores at Caeremlyn Farm. Appeal: Tegywn and Mary Davies have lost a challenge in the Appeal Court after their daughter Eirian Davies won a legal campaign to secure what she claimed was her rightful share of the family farm . Her parents apparently told her that her patience would be rewarded. ‘They always told me that the farm would be left to me,’ she told the hearing. ‘Even on my birthday, when the other girls were having things, they would say, “You will have the damn lot one day, it will all be yours”. She claimed that her sisters once paraded through the poultry shed in their ball gowns while she prepared turkeys for Christmas. Her father would regularly warn her ‘not to kill the goose that lays the golden egg’ if she complained about her treatment, she added. Miss Davies claimed that until she reached the age of 21, she was paid nothing at all for her work on the farm and, after that, there was a period when she was paid just £15-a-day for milking the cows, although sometimes she received more. She was said to have a ‘passionate interest’ in the herd and, by 1989, was the only daughter at the farm after her sisters began other careers. And, when she left to work elsewhere, her father was said to have begged her to return. Although there was evidence that her parents had ‘pinned their hopes’ on Miss Davies over the years, they became increasingly annoyed by her relationships with men. Lord Justice Floyd said this concern was not so much the men involved but ‘any children that they had and how that may impact upon their duties to keep the business in the family’. ‘Her mother referred to a string of men, to whom she referred as “wretches”, with kids behind them,’ said the judge. Despite their deteriorating relationship, Miss Davies claims she was shown a draft will in 2009 that left the lion’s share of the farm to her. However, her parents subsequently proposed to place the farm in trust for the benefit of all three sisters equally. Family relations hit rock bottom in August 2012 during an altercation during which milk was thrown over Miss Davies by her mother, and she and her father ended up entangled on the floor, where she bit her father’s leg. Caeremlyn Farm, near Whitland in South Wales. Eirian Davies claimed she was promised the farm. She won a bid to secure a share of the £7million estate while her parents have lost an appeal against the decision . It led to the legal battle in which Mr and Mrs Davies sought to evict their daughter from the farm cottage, where she still lives close to her parents’ farmhouse, while she fought for her share of the farm. At the original hearing, Judge Milwyn Jarman QC ruled that Miss Davies had relied on her parents’ promises and thrown herself into working on the farm. She was thus entitled to a ‘beneficial interest’ in the business. Dismissing her parents’ appeal against the ruling, Lord Justice Floyd described the dispute as ‘in many ways a tragic case’. ‘The bitterness between the parties was such that each had few, if any, good words to say about the other,’ he said. ‘The fact remained, however, that between them they had over the years built up a prodigious Holstein pedigree milking herd and a highly successful business. ‘It is greatly to be hoped that they might now be able to resolve such remaining differences as they have in relation to Eirian’s entitlement without recourse to further costly and divisive litigation.’","Eirian Davies claims parents told her she would take over South Wales farm .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The Co-op’s dramatic decline is ‘one of the great national business calamities’ but its leaders are still in denial, a damning report into its failings warned today. Former Labour City minister Lord Myners said half of the group’s net worth, built up over 150 years, has been wiped out in just four disastrous years. Unveiling his plans to rescue the Co-op, he said it could yet be saved but he was not confident that bosses will take the action needed, claiming some on the board do not know the difference between credit and debit. The collapse of the Co-op bank has added to the financial woes of the ailing mutual . The ailing mutual last month reported annual losses of £2.5 billion, and has been dogged by rows over the way it is run. To add to the sense of crisis, the former Co-op bank chief Rev Paul Flowers is due in court today charged with possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth. The minister, dubbed the crystal Methodist, will appear at Leeds Magistrates' Court following his arrest in the Liverpool area last year. Flowers, 63, stepped down as the bank's chairman in June amid claims of illegal drug use and inappropriate expenses payments. Last month a major review found a merger between the Co-op bank and the Britannia building society should never have happened. The problems at the bank have added to the financial woes of the entire group, which former chief executive Euan Sutherland branded ‘ungovernable’. Former Labour City minister Lord Myners said the Co-op could yet be saved, but he is not confident its leaders will take the necessary action . Today Lord Myners called for the abolition of the group's 21-member board to be replaced by a slimmed-down body to take commercial decisions. The idea will be put before the Co-op's AGM in Manchester on May 17 but regional membership boards and independent societies that currently hold sway in the group are reported to be unhappy about the proposals. In a damning verdict, Lord Myners said: ‘The Co-op has lost half its net worth – net worth accumulated over 150 years – in the last four years. ‘We’re talking about circa £3.5billion of erosion of wealth over a period of four or five years,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘This makes it one of the great national business calamities. And it’s been led by a board totally unable, because of a lack of experience, to hold the executive to account.’ The report comes days after the running of the food-to-funerals mutual was sharply criticised in a review by Sir Christopher Kelly into the near-collapse of its banking arm - a report which backed the need for change. The bank faced near-collapse last year after the discovery of a £1.5 billion hole in its balance sheet, and had to be rescued by bondholders in a move that saw the group's stake reduced from 100% to 30%. Lord Myners, who recently resigned as a director after just four months, said that the 15 lay directors on the current board were drawn from a total eligible pool of only 35 regional board members. They include an engineer, a plasterer and a retired deputy head teacher. He said: 'Effective organisations, undoubtedly, tend to have a strong managerial presence, but it’s never down to one woman or one man; it’s down to an accountable and experienced board who hold that executive to an agreed strategy and have the right knowledge to ask the right questions. 'The Co-op board tends not to ask the right questions because the people around the board table don’t know the difference, in some cases, between a debit and a credit.' He said that apart from the lack of relevant skills and experience, ‘this has not even been genuine democracy at work’. Lord Myners said: ‘Radical decisions on governance structure need to be taken very soon - and with resolution - if the Co-op, as my mother knew it, is to be saved. ‘The decision lies in the hands of the elected democrats. I have done all I can do.’ Former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers is due in court today charged with possessing drugs including cocaine and crystal meth . The former chairman of Marks & Spencer added: ‘I have no doubt that the Co-operative Group can over the next five years reverse a decline that started over 50 years ago. But I am less confident that it will choose to do so. ‘Much will depend on the small number of 'elected democrats', less than one in 10,000 of the group's entire membership. ‘Will they put their self-interest to one side for the greater good, acknowledging the collective failure of the current board and the crippling deficiencies of the entire governance system?’ ‘I would say that the group board and many on the regional boards are still stuck in denial over this near ruinous failure of governance, whereas the vast majority of ordinary members feel justified anger.’ Lord Myners said the resistance from traditionalists reflected a culture of entitlement within a small but highly active proportion of the membership. He added: ‘This has undoubtedly created strong vested interests and a reluctance to rethink existing ways of doing things. ‘I have myself witnessed repeated instances where there has been denial of responsibility, corrosive suspicion, deliberate delay and a practice of hiding behind 'values' in order to deflect or stifle criticism and protect self-interest.’ Ursula Lidbetter, chairman of the Co-operative Group, said a resolution containing four key principles on reform will be put to members at the AGM. Britain's largest union Unite described the report as the ‘only game in town’, which could deliver a future for the group and its workforce.

The journalist-turned popular novelist – best known for his book The Virgin Soldiers - died at his home, surrounded by his family, earlier this week at the age of 83 after battling a lengthy illness. The Welsh writer who was yesterday described as a ‘fount of creativity’ was orphaned aged 12 after his mariner father was lost at sea and his mother died of cancer just a few months later. Leslie Thomas, a journalist-turned-author, has died after a long illness at his home in Salisbury, Wiltshire. (Pictured, Mr Thomas receiving an OBE for contributions to literature alongside his wife Diana) Mr Thomas began his career as a journalist in London, working for a local paper and then the London Evening News, before switching to writing full-time in 1965. He died aged 83 . Mr Thomas was raised in a Barnardo's children's home from the age of 12 after his father was lost at sea and his mother died of cancer shortly after . Subsequently raised in a St Barnardo’s children’s home his time there became the inspiration for his first book, This Time Next Week. Mr Thomas started his writing career as a news reporter in London, working for a weekly local paper and then the London Evening News before devoting himself to novel writing full-time in 1965. He leaves four children, four grandchildren and his wife Diana who delivered a moving tribute to him. She said: ‘He had a wonderful life and he travelled the world. All he ever wanted to do was write and that is what he did. ‘He died at home with his family around him.’ While Mr Thomas was best-known for The Virgin Soldiers, he wrote many other novels, including Last Detective - which was adapted into and ITV series - Dangerous Davies, and Orders for New York (right) He leaves behind four children, fur grandchildren, and his wife Diana (pictured left on ship Royal Clipper) It was Mr Thomas’ time spent as a national serviceman in Malaya that inspired his most famous work, The Virgin Soldiers, a comic tale of British soldiers based in the Far East which became a bestseller and a hit film. His other works included Dangerous Davies, the Last Detective, which was adapted for ITV, and he was given an OBE for services to literature in 2004. Yesterday Mr Thomas’ publisher Penguin Random House also commended the late Newport-born writer. Susan Sandon, divisional managing director at the company said: ‘Leslie Thomas was an immensely popular author with a huge gift for storytelling and a wonderful sense of humour. ‘His books have given so many people pleasure over the years, with their mix of great characters, strong sense of time and place, and unique ability to combine laughter and tears in the space of a few sentences.’ Peter Finch, a contemporary of Mr Thomas, called him a 'fount of creativity' and 'super friendly'. Mr Thomas's wife Diana (far right) said he had 'a wonderful life', adding that 'all he wanted to do was write' Mr Thomas's publisher described him as an 'immensely popular author with a... wonderful sense of humour' Author and former chief executive of Literature Wales, Peter Finch, also fondly remembered Mr Thomas. He said: ‘He shied away from what he saw as Wales’s literary establishment, but did attend events encouraging young writers. ‘But he was super friendly person. There was no edge to him whatsoever. He was a slightly private person but he was good company. ‘He was a raconteur. That was his strength, which you can tell from the books. ‘He made me laugh, a lot. It’s very sad to see his fount of creativity is now extinguished.’","Leslie Thomas died at his home with his family aged 83 after a long illness .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Vulnerable pensioners may be at risk of poor care and even abuse because so many home helps cannot speak English properly, a government adviser warned yesterday. Agencies must ensure care workers have decent language skills before placing them in people’s homes, she said. One in five carers is a migrant, according to research by King’s College London. In some cities, it is thought around half of care workers are foreign nationals. Dr Shereen Hussein said that if carers cannot speak English properly, they risk being badly treated by patients . Dr Shereen Hussein, scientific adviser . to the Department of Health, said changes to immigration policy and the . relaxation of EU labour rules has altered the profile of migrants who . work as carers in the UK. Many . agencies do not adequately test language skills during interviews – . leading to risks that the elderly could become victims of ‘bad . treatment’, she said. While . migrants from outside the European Union are subject to rigorous . language tests, this is not the case for those who come from within it. More . and more care workers are now from EU accession countries such as . Poland and Hungary, where no language testing is required. Dr . Hussein told the BBC: ‘This means new migrants can be vulnerable when . they’re placed in people’s homes – and carers have reported instances of . racism and discrimination that stem from communication problems. ‘It . would be really beneficial to have a standard interview process to . establish English language proficiency, communication skills and softer . skills of all care workers aiming to work in the sector. ‘At . the moment, vulnerable workers are placed in the homes of vulnerable . adults with complex needs, and sometimes communication problems can . result in bad treatment for both parties.’ Prime Minister David Cameron told the Commons that he wanted to make sure people in the care system are properly trained . One . man, who wishes to remain anonymous, has a 62-year-old brother with a . severe form of dementia. He employed carers for 18 months to oversee the . care of his brother, but grew frustrated with the quality of the staff. He told 5 Live Breakfast the situation grew so problematic he took the decision to put his brother in a care home. ‘The dynamic between the carers and a frightened man who was suffering with dementia didn’t work most of the time,’ he said. ‘Almost . all the carers were from overseas, mainly from Poland. I found some of . them exceptionally difficult to understand, which meant my brother, in . his condition, was never going to understand them and the reaction from . him was to hide or get slightly violent.’ Dr . Hussein, of King’s College London’s social care workforce research . unit, added: ‘In the majority, migrant workers are very hard-working, . but sometimes when their English language is quite poor, that can put . both carers and the user in very vulnerable situations – especially if . they are the only carer. ‘Interview . standards are variable. We heard from care workers who admitted that . their English is not very good, and the interview process is quite . easy.’ Under Brussels right . to freedom of movement rules, it would be considered a breach to . prevent someone taking a job on the basis of their language alone. The BBC spoke to some former care workers from Hungary, who told of their struggles to communicate with clients. Hajnalka . Deak, who came to the UK in 2008, said: ‘To do the job you have to . understand the doctor’s instructions, report to relatives and speak to . agencies. ‘You have to help clients do things they can’t do for themselves, and it’s essential to understand their instructions. ‘I . remember once I worked with a wheelchair user. I had to strap him in . the car. Unfortunately I couldn’t understand the exact instructions and . we had to stay at home and couldn’t go anywhere. I felt partly . embarrassed and partly frustrated.’ But . Colin Angel, of the UK Home Care Association, which represents care . agencies, said there was not enough money for language training because . of council cuts. The Government is bringing in a new ‘care certificate’ to ensure carers have the necessary skills. Care . minister Norman Lamb added: ‘Employers are responsible for recruiting . staff who can competently speak and read English but communication will . be a key part of the Care Certificate.'","Dr Shereen Hussein warns language barriers could lead to poor care .

Dyke, who goes public with the findings of his England Commission at Wembley today, discussed his plan with Football League top brass at a dinner last night, having received FA board backing earlier in the day. The central plank and most controversial of Dyke’s Commission recommendations is a new fourth tier of the English game featuring mainly B teams from the Premier League plus possible Conference club involvement as well as promotion and relegation. Back to the future: Greg Dyke's latest plans are to regionalise lower leagues and introduce Premier League B teams .

The B team proposal has received strong support from the clubs — if not the PL administrators — with Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all very enthusiastic.

Southampton favour this feeder option, although Football League fans might not be so enamoured.

David Meyler is free to play in the FA Cup final after the Hull midfielder escaped punishment for stamping on Manchester United youngster Adnan Januzaj. United interim boss Ryan Giggs hit out at Meyler for sinking his studs into Januzaj’s outstretched leg in the latter stages of United’s 3-1 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. The FA were unable to take the matter further after referee Craig Pawson yesterday said that he had seen the incident. VIDEO Scroll down for Giggs hails 'Class of 14' but says no decision on retirement . Nasty: David Meyler (right) leaves his boot in on Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj .

Meyler, who . was facing the  possibility of a three-match ban, will now be available . to play for Hull against Arsenal in the Cup Final at Wembley on May 17. It is the second time this season that Januzaj has been the alleged victim of a stamp after Fulham's Sascha Riether was banned for three matches in November after accepting a FA charge of violent conduct. Hull boss Steve Bruce insisted that he did not see the incident, but Giggs described it as 'a joke'. He added: 'I didn't see it but I've seen his leg. It's the second time it has happened to him this season. It's not great to see, and it's terrible his leg. 'He needs protecting.

Giggs came on as a substitute for his 963rd - and possibly final - appearance at Old Trafford in his last home game as interim boss, and admitted that he is still in two minds whether to play on next season.

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . CLICK HERE to read the full match report from the Etihad Stadium. He was arguably Manchester City's third choice striker at the beginning of the season, but Edin Dzeko's clinical finishing has taken the club to within a point of returning the Premier League title to the Etihad. The Bosnian international scored an opening brace during City's resounding 4-0 victory over Aston Villa in their penultimate game of the season - leaving them needing only a draw against West Ham to be crowned champions. Dzeko's two goals took his tally for the season to 26 in all competitions (16 league goals) - not a bad return for a player who has frequently been linked with a move and bristles at the term of 'super-sub'. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini on the title . Clinical: Edin Dzeko's brace in Man City's 4-0 win against Aston Villa takes them to within a point of the title . Invisible man? Dzeko's heat map is not that impressive, but it's finding the right space that sets him apart . The 28-year-old can appear almost invisible during games, especially when teams employ the sort of defensive spoiling tactics that Aston Villa used to strangle the first-half. In fact, Dzeko's heat map for his entire game doesn't assume greatness - but it is the 6ft 4in striker's ability to be in the right place at the right time and clinical finishing that sets him apart. He only managed two shots on target during the entire game... but scored with both. Predator: Dzeko opened the scoring with a close range finish from Pablo Zabaleta's cross . Wait for it: Dzeko's first goal produced a precise finish from Manchester City'sd patient probing down the right . At the double; Dzeko reacts fastest to Samir Nasri's rebounded shot to give City a controlling 2-0 lead . Goal poacher: Dzeko was at hand to convert Samir Nasri's rebounded shot from close range . Will Manchester City win the Premier League? Dzeko could have opened the scoring earlier when a lofted ball from Yaya Toure sent him into acres of space with only the keeper to beat, but he failed to take the ball down as exquisitely as perhaps the absent Sergio Aguero might. Nonetheless, Dzeko's attributes come alive in the six yard box and that is where both of his goals were netted from - with both coming from crosses made by the formidable Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentininean deserves praise for his relentless running that gave his team an attacking outlet throughout the game without ignoring his defensive responsibilities on the rare occasion that Villa moved out of their own half. Argy bargy: Pablo Zabaleta was a constant threat down the right, setting up both of Dzeko's goals . Right on time: Zabaleta patrolled his flank with absolute authority, spending more time in Villa's half . For the first goal, City patiently probed before David Silva played in Zabaleta on the right . and his squared cross left Dzeko with a simple finish from close . range to break the deadlock on 64minutes. The second came only eight minutes later and started with the same link up play between Silva and Zabaleta before ending with Dzeko reacting quickest to Samir Nasri's deflected shot - again only inches from the goal line. As well as Dzeko and Zabaleta, City's other outstanding performer was, typically, Yaya Toure. The Ivorian midfielder is the league's ultimate all-rounder. No other player can combine the  athleticism of his surging runs from midfield with the delicacy of his passing and power of his shooting - while he also takes a mean free-kick. 100 not out! Yaya Toure finished the game in style with a surging run and his 20th goal of the season . Action man: Yaya Toure's heat map shows him to be the Premier League's ultimate all rounder . Eventually, there may even be a position named after him in the same way that Claude Makele became a byword for holding midfielder. The game's final goal perhaps epitomises Toure's strength, seizing the ball from midfield before leaving defenders in his wake to slot home his 20th goal of the season and, incredibly, the team's 100th league goal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Adele Greenacre, now 36, was just 11 weeks old when her father Derek walked out of the family home in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, and never returned. Now, after launching a Facebook campaign to find him, the devoted daughter has finally been reunited with her father - more than three decades later. Inspired by the no make-up selfie craze, Mrs Greenacre posted an old photo of her father on the social networking site, and 21,000 shares later, was contacted by a man living in Geneva who claimed to know her father. Back together: Adele Greenacre was finally reunited with her father Derek after spending 30 years apart . An hour later, he phoned again - this time with her father's mobile number to hand. Mrs Greenacre then called the number and, within moments, found herself speaking to her father for the first time in 30 years. 'A man had seen my Facebook post, which had been shared over 21,000 times, and Skyped me all the way from Geneva in Switzerland, to say he knew my dad,' beams Mrs Greenacre. 'They . had known each other because of The Passage homeless charity that . picked up my dad a few years ago and he, too, had been homeless. 'An hour later, he called back and gave me a number.

"By . Bianca London . An 84-year-old woman is celebrating 70 years of working in the Mars factory making the chocolate bar - and admits she still enjoys a Mars a day. Audrey Cook was thrown a surprise party by colleagues to mark her seven decades at the factory, based in Dundee Road, Slough. She is thought to be the longest-serving worker in the food and drink industry. Audrey Cook has just celebrated 70 years making Mars bars and he colleagues threw a surprise party for her at the Mars Chocolate Factory to celebrate her seven decades there . Her first job in 1944 aged 14 was cutting Mars bars in the ‘stripping room’ before moving onto the confectionery production before her current role running the staff shop. Audrey, from Slough, joined the company straight from school earning £2 (6s) per week. She counts the highlight of her career as meeting the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they visited the factory last year. Ms Cook made the headlines in national newspapers after Prince Philip cracked a joke about her former job in the stripping room. 'I love working here, it’s a great company,' she said. 'I’ve enjoyed meeting so many people over the years. Meeting the Queen is definitely the best thing that’s happened to me since working at Mars, it was such an honour.' Her first job in 1944 aged 14 was cutting Mars bars in the stripping room for £2 per week before moving onto the confectionery production and her current role running the staff shop . Career highlight: Audrey meeting the Queen last year. She made the headlines in national newspapers after Prince Philip cracked a joke about her former job in the stripping room . She added: 'It’s another wonderful story to tell my family about my career at Mars.' Ms Cook was given a Mars-themed cake, a book of tributes and photographs at the anniversary bash. Fiona Dawson, president of Mars Chocolate UK, also paid tribute to the long-serving employee. 'We have been making chocolate in Slough for over 80 years and are incredibly lucky that Audrey has been here almost from the start,' she said. Audrey, pictured around 50 years old, joined the company straight from school and is thought to be the longest serving worker in the food and drink industry . She says that the Mars bar is her absolute favourite treat and she eats one with a cup of tea every morning . 'She is truly remarkable, a wonderful associate, who embodies the culture of Mars and lights up everyone’s day with her infectious smile and wicked sense of humour.' Ms Cook started off cutting Mars bars by hand, before joining Spangles production and later becoming supervisor on the Opal Fruits (now Starburst) production line. She moved to the staff shop in 1972, where she has worked ever since. When asked what the biggest changes she has witnessed are, she said: 'Everything is automatic now. There are so many more people working at Mars, doing so many different jobs.' But one thing has not changed during her time: 'The Mars Bar is my absolute favourite. I eat one with a cup of tea every morning,' she added. Mars Bar has been made in the factory where Audrey works in Slough, Berkshire since 1932 - three million are made there every single day. Forrest Mars, the son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars, established the factory with just 12 members of staff and began making the chocolate bar consisting of nougat and caramel covered in milk chocolate. It was modelled on his father's Milky Way bar, which was a confectionery hit in the US. During the war years, the bars were allocated to troops in the UK and to prisoners of war in Germany. In 1991, the bars were exported to Russia for the first time. Demand was so high that they had to be rationed to four per person. In 2002, the Mars Bar was reformulated and the nougat made lighter and the chocolate on top thinner, which was met by outrage. In 2006, the UK versions were renamed 'Believe' bars as a gesture of support for the England football team during the FIFA World Cup in Germany. In 2013, the company said the decision to reduce Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g was part of a pledge to cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250. In 1944, a Mars bar cost just 6p - today, it's priced from 50p.","Audrey Cook first joined Mars bar factory in Slough in 1944 aged 14 .

"By . Katy Winter . Trendy grandfather Allan Bradbury is still a 'dedic-aged' follower of fashion - at the age of 70. The former construction worker may have his bus pass and is entitled to 20 per cent discounts in DIY stores and garden centres - but he spends up to £160 a month on Gucci and Vivienne Westwood designs, including oversized shirts and funky pirate boots. Mr Bradbury, from Bolton, who has two wardrobes at home to house his giant collection of flamboyant designer gear, is refusing to grow old gracefully. As a result, he says he regularly gets stopped in the street by onlookers admiring his quirky fashion sense. Scroll down for video . Fashionista Allan Bradbury likes to dress to impress and wears the latest styles and designer gear . Allan has two wardrobes at home to house his giant collection of flamboyant designer gear . Allan has vowed never to give into 'old man' slacks and woolly jumpers, no matter how old he is . The former RAF gunner who served the 15th squadron’s parachute team in Borneo, Asia, warned he would never give up his favourite ripped jeans for conventional ‘old man’ jumpers, no matter how old he is. 'Anyone who suggests I wear slacks and a beige shirt can wash out their mouth with soap and water as far as I’m concerned,' said the divorced father-of-four, from Bolton, Greater Manchester. 'I’ve always been a follower of fashion and I’m not going to stop now just because I’m in my 70s. When I left school at the age of 15 I was a Teddy Boy and I thought I was a bit of looker back then. 'Then in the 1970s I loved the whole Flower Power theme and in the Eighties I wore a lot of leather. My fashion sense has evolved with the decades. Allan's funky dress sense has caught the eye of exclusive fashion house Vivienne Westwood, which invited him to a tea party at the Manchester store to preview the new season's collection . 'Fashion is an expression of people’s personalities and I don’t think that should stop just because you have reached a certain age.' Amongst his collection of designer jackets, trousers and shoes in his walk-in wardrobe, Mr Bradbury boasts a section dedicated to his favourite fashion label Vivienne Westwood. The world-famous designer is known for her daring and off-the-cuff designs, and is favoured by celebrities such as Dita Von Teese and Kate Moss. But the fashion house was so impressed with Mr Bradbury, it invited him to a tea party at the Manchester store when the new season’s collection was unveiled. He added: 'I discovered Vivienne Westwood about eight years ago and that’s when my obsession started. I love her designs, they’re asymmetric and she doesn’t follow the rules or conform. I love that about her. Allan with one of his favourite T-shirts (L) and his trousers that once belonged to Jim Morrison of The Doors . 'I buy her clothes whenever I can, and staff in the Manchester store now know me really well - they give me a hug when they see me.' Mr Bradbury who currently volunteers as a counsellor admits his style is far from conventional and said his love of Vivienne Westwood took a while for his children, Tracy, 40, Lee, 40, Alaine, 31, and Christopher, 27 and granddaughter Jade, 22, to get used to. He said: 'When I first started wearing . Vivienne Westwood clothes my children would tell me to walk on the other . side of the road but they’re used to it now.

Allan, pictured in Cardiff in the Eighties, says he sees no reason why fashion should be influenced by age . Allan (right) in Cairo in the Seventies (L) and aged 19 (R) says he thought he was 'quite a looker' in his youth . 'I get so many people coming up to me in the street and saying things like ""I love you for having courage. You’re old but you still have a love of fashion"". I guess I do like the attention. I have been called the ""OAP fashion icon"". 'So many people stop me for photographs but some young men do judge me. I get called ""gayboy"" because I wear pirate boots and an oversized shirt, but I’m not bothered. I like my style and that’s the main thing. 'I will absolutely, definitely not ever wear plain trousers and beige shirts and jumpers. My favourite outfit is combat ripped jeans with red pocket linings, a Vivienne Westwood shirt with gold glitter on the cuffs and a Union Jack on the neck. I dress loud and colourful - I guess I’m a bit of a show off. 'Age is just a number, it is nothing to do with fashion. It was Vivienne Westwood who said buy less but buy well.

"By . Emma Innes . Doctors working in Britain who received their training in India are four times more likely to be struck off than those who trained locally, figures have revealed. The General Medical Council (GMC) statistics show that between 2008 and 2013, 117 Indian and Pakistani doctors were stuck off the medical register. During the same time period, 142 doctors who trained in Britain were struck off. Figures released by the General Medical Council show that between 2008 and 2013, 117 Indian and Pakistani doctors were stuck off the medical register - proportionally four times higher than those trained in Britain . Proportionally, this means about one in 1,000 British-trained doctors were struck off, compared to one in 250 of those trained in India and one in 350 of those trained in Pakistan, The Daily Telegraph reports. Currently, about a third of the doctors working in Britain received their training abroad, but 75 per cent of those who were struck off the medical register in 2013 were trained overseas. Since 2008, 458 doctors in Britain have been struck off. The largest proportion of these were trained in this country, followed by those trained in India, Pakistan, Egypt and Nigeria. The figures have prompted concerns about the level of scrutiny overseas doctors are subjected to before being allowed to work in this country. However, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) says the figures do not reflect poorer medical training in India and Pakistan. Currently, about a third of the doctors working in Britain received their training abroad . Instead, it says the statistics show that Indian doctors face discrimination when subjected to investigation by the GMC. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of BAPIO, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘Over the years we have repeatedly pointed out to the GMC that foreign doctors are treated harshly in disciplinary procedures. ‘It is ironic that on the one hand Indian doctors are being criticised and on the other hand they are being courted.’ Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the General Medical Council, added: ‘We are here to protect the public and make sure that doctors who treat patients are safe to do so, regardless of where they have received their training. ‘These figures demonstrate that we will take action where doctors fall short of the standards we expect. ‘International medical graduates make a huge contribution to healthcare in the UK and the vast majority of them provide excellent care for their patients. ‘However, we know that doctors coming here from overseas can find it difficult to adapt to different cultural norms and it is certainly true that in the past not enough was done to support them when they first came to practise in this country. ‘More is now being done – we ourselves run a “welcome to UK practice” programme and all doctors coming here are now part of national system of regular checks. ‘We have also commissioned a major review of how we assess their knowledge and skills when they apply to join the UK register – the review will report later this year.’ Currently in the UK there are 150,000 doctors who have been trained in Britain. There are also about 30,000 licensed doctors who trained in India and Pakistan.","In the last five years, one in 1,000 British-trained doctors were struck off .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It is popularly thought that Portuguese explorers colonised Madeira in the 15th century. But mouse bones suggest that the Vikings visited the island four centuries beforehand. Scientists also believe that the mouse population that stowed away on their boats led to an ‘ecological disaster’ and the extinction of native birds. A flying visit? Mouse bones suggest that the Vikings visited the island four centuries before Portuguese settlers colonised Madeira in the 15th century. A new study indicates that mice travelled on ships (illustrated) and made their homes on the island . House mice reached the island in the year 1036 - four centuries before the Portuguese colonisation - according to a study published in the journal proceedings of the Royal Society B. The discovery comes after experts dated old mouse bones found at Ponta de São Lourenço, to the east of the island. Researchers from the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies (Imedea) in Majorca and the University of La Laguna, Tenerife, analysed two samples of bones and while the first yielded no information, the second was dated to between 900 and 1030AD, which is the earliest evidence of the presence of mice on the island. ‘Current populations of house mice on Madeira show similarities in mitochondrial DNA with those in Scandinavia and northern Germany, but not with those in Portugal,’ said Josep Antoni Alcover of Imedea. Experts dated old mouse bones found at Ponta de São Lourenço, to the east of the island (pictured). Current populations of house mice on Madeira show similarities in mitochondrial DNA with those in Scandinavia and northern Germany, but not with those in Portugal, the researchers said . This hints that the mice were neither indigenous nor hitched a ride on the ships of Portuguese settlers who took possession of the island in 1419. ‘The second sample analysed leads us to think that the Vikings…[carried] the mice.’ He explained that more morphological and genetic studies of the remains are needed and there are no historical references of Vikings travelling to the island. However, if the findings are correct and Vikings did land on Madeira long ago, they may have triggered significant ecological changes on the island. The researchers believe that the first human visitors began the extinction of endemic bird species on the island. The fast and the furriest: Scientists think that the mice population the warriors brought with them led an 'ecological disaster' and extinction of endemic birds . They think the mice quickly thrived due to their reproductive potential and the lack of rats – and their predatory activity wiped out eggs and chicks of small and medium birds such as the quail and rail. The researchers said that least two thirds of the endemic birds and two non-endemic species became extinct, which in turn enabled predators such as owls to prosper. ‘The introduction of the mice probably resulted in an ecological disaster, based on the extinction of endemic birds and changing the ecology of the island four years earlier than previously thought,’ Mr Alcover said.","Study suggests explorers stepped foot on the island 400 years before the Portuguese colonisation .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Climbers face an array of risks when scaling Mount Everest - from freezing temperatures to altitude sickness - and now a scientist has found one that could leave more lasting effects. Scottish radiation expert Bob Kerr climbed the Nepalese mountain and, with help from his guide, recorded exposure levels at its summit using a Geiger counter. The 36-year-old found that the high-altitudes expose climbers to an extra 1milliSievert (mSv) of radiation, which is five times more than the average annual exposure in a nuclear power plant. Scottish scientist Bob Kerr scaled Mount Everest, pictured, in May 2013 to record radiation levels at its summit. The radiation comes from cosmic rays from space and Kerr found the mountain exposes climbers to 1milliSievert (mSv) of radiation - five times more than annual exposure in a nuclear power plant . Last month, scientists gained insights into the molecular process of how some people get Type II diabetes, which could lead to new ways of preventing people getting the condition. The research, led by the University of Southampton and UCL, took place on Mount Everest and assessed the mechanisms at which low oxygen levels in the body - known as hypoxia - are linked with the development of insulin resistance. The research found that several markers of insulin resistance were increased following sustained exposure (six to eight weeks) to hypoxia at high altitude, and that this change was related to increased blood levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Kerr, a radiation protection adviser from Portskerra, Sutherland, took on the challenge in May 2013. He reached a height of 26,000ft (7,925m) before temporarily losing sight in his right eye due to a lack of oxygen. His Nepalese guide, Dorje Khatri, then took the equipment to the summit at 29,000ft (8,839m) to record the readings. The radiation levels at the top of the mountain are caused by cosmic rays from space, but despite the risks, Kerr told the Society for Radiological Protection that no-one has ever died as a result of the radiation. The chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of the exposure are also low, at one in 10,000. The chances of developing fatal cancer as a result of exposure on Mount Everest are low, at one in 10,000, but Kerr said if someone received the same level of dose at ground level at a nuclear plant, stock image of the Dungeness B nuclear power station in Kent is pictured, it would be classed as a 'significant dose' However, Kerr said that if someone received the same level of dose at ground level, and it was not due to cosmic radiation, then under the UK's Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 the exposure would be classed as a 'significant dose' and would be at the annual public dose limit. 'When chatting about my career in radiation protection I find that climbers, despite participating happily in one of the world’s potentially hazardous hobbies, share the general public’s emotional fear of radiation,' said Kerr. ‘They don't realise that as they ascend into the heavens their exposure to natural background radiation from outer space - cosmic rays - increases.’ Last month, an avalanche killed 16 local . guides, including Khatri, as they helped a film crew from the Discovery Channel climb the mountain. The avalanche hit the Khumbu Icefall on April 18 and was the deadliest day in the mountain's history. It brought the total death toll up to 265 . from almost 7,000 summit attempts and climbs have been suspended out of respect for the dead.","Scottish radiation expert Bob Kerr scaled Mount Everest in May 2013 .

"By . Emma Innes . A bride-to-be has launched a battle against the clock to find her fiancé a life-saving stem cell donor. Kate Robertson, 31, has just 60 days to find a donor for Mike Brandon, 29, who has leukaemia. She is urging people to join the donor register so that Mr Brandon can have the transplant he desperately needs when he finishes his current chemotherapy regime in early July. Kate Robertson, 31, is trying to find a stem cell donor for Mike Brandon, 29, who has leukaemia . Ms Roberton, who lives Bristol, said: ‘Our friends and family in London and Bristol have rallied around, asking what they can do to help, and at least 20 of them joined the Anthony Nolan donor register straight away. ‘Any one of them could be a match for someone like Mike who needs a donor. ‘It's so easy and straightforward to sign up. We started thinking that if we channel our energies into getting our friends, and friends of friends, and even strangers, to join the register, we could make a big difference.’ In March this year, Mr Brandon, who also lives in Bristol, started to suffer from fatigue and night sweats. He visited a doctor who carried out blood tests and just four hours later he was given the devastating news that he has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. At the time Ms Robertson, a physiotherapist, was halfway through a six month backpacking trip in Burma. Mr Brandon was diagnosed with leukaemia in March and will need a stem cell transplant in early July . Mr Brandon was diagnosed just three months after proposing to Ms Robertson. He went to a doctor after developing fatigue and night sweats and blood tests confirmed he had leukaemia . The couple had become engaged just three weeks before she left, while enjoying their last weekend away together before her trip. Mr Brandon called Ms Robertson on her mobile while she was in a remote internet café in Burma. She assumed he was ringing with good news because he had been waiting to hear the results of a job interview he had attended. Visit www.anthonynolan.org to join the donor register. On the website you can request a 'spit kit'. This will be sent to you in the post and you can provide a saliva sample by spitting into the pot and posting it back to the charity. When Anthony Nolan receives the sample, you will be added to the register. Ms Robertson is also running the #Shake4mike campaign. She is urging people to post pictures of themselves shaking their faces on Facebook and Twitter while pledging to join the register. She would also like them to nominate others to do the same. She told MailOnline that she knew he had been having blood tests but that she just assumed they would come back normal. Instead, 5,000 miles from home, she was told he had cancer. Ms Robertson said: ‘I had been due to go on a three week trek in Nepal the following day, so if the news had come a day later, Mike wouldn't have been able to reach me for weeks. ‘Thankfully, I got the message in time and after a gruelling 10 hour bus journey, 12 hour wait in Yangon, two 11 hour flights and a three hour car journey I was finally by his side.’ She added: ‘I was completely shocked when he told me. My only plan was to get home. ‘It was the worst day of my life. I tried to calm myself down and focus on getting home but the journey was awful. ‘I felt better a soon as I got to him.’ Ms Robertson went on to explain that this is not the first time her family has been struck by tragedy. In 2005 her father, who was 59, developed a blood clot in his leg and died suddenly in front of her mother and sister. A few weeks later her grandmother died, and just eight days after her death, Ms Robertson says her grandfather died of a broken heart. Following the spate of expected deaths, Ms Robertson’s mother’s best friend, 38-year-old Simon, moved in to support the family. Mr Brandon (pictured before his illness) is currently having chemotherapy and will need the transplant when the chemotherapy regime finishes. Devastatingly, none of his three brothers are matches for him . Shockingly, within two months he had suffered a brain haemorrhage and he also passed away. Ms Robertson and Mr Brandon met in 2009 and Ms Robertson says he turned her life around and made her smile again. She says he helped her to move on from the tragedies of 2005. As a result, she says she is now determined to be his ‘rock’ and says she will not give up without a fight. After his diagnosis, Mr Brandon started chemotherapy at Bristol Royal Infirmary. He will finish his current chemotherapy regime in early July at which point he will need a stem cell transplant. Ms Robertson worked with Anthony Nolan to launch the #Shake4mike campaign. She's urging people to take pictures of themselves shaking their faces and to post them on Facebook while pledging to join the register . All of his three brothers have been tested but, devastatingly, none are a match for Mr Brandon. Ms Robertson told MailOnline that there was about a 60 per cent chance that one of his brothers would be a match so it was a ‘devastating blow’ when they learned that none were matches. As a result, he and his family have turned to the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan for help finding a lifesaving donor from the register. Ms Robertson said: ‘Mike now has so much ahead of him - a new job, a wedding and building a family - but he desperately needs to find a matching stem cell donor so that he can focus on getting better and embrace his future.’ As a result, she is urging people to join the register by visiting www.anthonynolan.org and requesting a ‘spit kit’. Potential donors, who must be between the ages of 16 and 30, can just spit into the kit and send it back to the charity and they will be added to the register. Ms Robertson says she will be Mr Brandon's rock and that she will not give up without a fight . Most people who join the register are never asked to donate. However, for those who are, there are two different procedures they could be asked to undergo. About 90 per cent will be able to donate their stem cells quickly and easily in a process similar to blood donation. Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia is that which progresses rapidly and aggressively. Lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes - the white blood cells that fight viral infections. Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and repeated infections. It affects about 650 people a year in the UK and is the most common type of cancer in children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15. Treatment usually involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a stem cell transplant is sometimes required. Source: NHS Choices . This takes about four to five hours and sometimes needs to be repeated the following day. However, it does not require a general anaesthetic and the donor will not be required to stay in hospital. The other 10 per cent will be asked to donate by giving stem cells from the bone marrow in their pelvises. This requires bone marrow to be taken from the pelvis and is usually carried out under general anaesthetic to prevent the donor experiencing too much pain. Most donors who give in this way are required to stay in hospital for 12 to 24 hours to recover from the anaesthetic. Ms Robertson is also asking that people get involved in the #Shake4mike campaign. She wants people to take a photo of themselves while shaking their heads and to share the picture on Facebook or Twitter while pledging to join the donor register. She hopes people will then also nominate a friend to do the same. She told MailOnline: ‘The idea was to get people to shake their faces at cancer – at leukaemia. ‘We wanted to have a funny and light hearted campaign that people could really get behind.’ For more information about the campaign visit the Facebook page by clicking here.","Kate Robertson is trying to find a stem cell donor for Mike Brandon, 29 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Lindsay Clarke suffers the rare disease Stiff Person Syndrome, leaving her in agonising pain as her body stiffens into a living statue . Violent spams and excruciating pain consume her, leaving her gasping for breath as her body stiffens into a living statue. Mother-of-three Lindsay Clarke is confined to her bed, held prisoner by an extremely rare disease, which threatens to kill her. The 33-year-old can no longer breathe without the help of an oxygen mask, as her muscles contract and her body stiffens. The former dancer has Stiff Person Syndrome - a rare and currently incurable neurological disorder affecting one person in every million. Mrs Clarke said: 'I was active, healthy and ambitious . and almost overnight I became so overcome with exhaustion I could . barely lift my head off the pillow. 'My . spasms have travelled from just my legs to right the way through my . body - they affect my face, brain, and respiratory system.' She . was training to be a lawyer when she was struck down by the illness in . 2011, leaving her too ill to work or look after her children, . Olivia-Beth, 12, Mollie-Jai, seven, and Dylan, four. Her . symptoms baffled doctors for almost a year, first diagnosing her with . post-natal depression, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and lupus. The condition has forced Mrs Clarke to lock herself away to avoid sound, light and touch - all of which can trigger an attack. She said since diagnosis her condition has deteriorated, adding: 'Battling the disease is like fighting a ghost.' Spasms can be violent and unpredictable. When they strike they can be so severe, they cause Mrs Clarke to break bones, leaving her in horrific pain. The condition leaves the 33-year-old confined to her bed and unable to breathe without an oxygen mask . The neurological disease causes her muscles, especially those in the torso and limbs, to stiffen over time . The condition has forced Mrs Clarke to lock herself away to avoid sound, light and touch - all of which can trigger muscle spasms . What is Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS)? Stiff-person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder with features of an autoimmune disease. It causes a patient's muscles to stiffen over time - typically affecting the torso and limbs. The condition is often triggered subtly by a period of emotional stress and it commonly develops in a person's mid-40s. Sufferers can also experience a heightened sensitivity to stimuli, including noise, touch and emotional distress, which can trigger muscle spasms. People with Stiff-Person Syndrome can be too disabled to walk. Abnormal postures - often hunched over or stiffened - are characteristic of the disorder.What causes the rare disorder? Stiff Person Syndrome affects twice as many women as men. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases including diabetes, thyroditis and the skin condition vitiligo. Scientists do not know what causes the condition, but research has shown it is the result of an autoimmune response that has gone awry in the brain and spinal cord.How is it diagnosed? The condition is often mistaken for Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis. A definitive diagnosis can be made with a blood test. People with Stiff-Person Syndrome have raised levels of an antibody that works against an enzyme involved in the synthesis of an important neurotransmitter in the brain. There is no cure for the disease at present but it can be managed with medication. Her muscles tear and internal organs harden making it impossible to breathe unaided. The mother-of-three said: 'Each day I watch my tots leave from the view of my bedroom window. 'They . are each growing, changing, developing their own personalities and I am . not a part of it. I am only able to see from afar.' Her . only hope for treatment is to pay for a Stem Cell Transplant but the . procedure has never been offered in the UK for anyone suffering from . Stiff-Person Syndrome. 'My only option is to leave the country and privately fund my treatment,' Mrs Clarke said. 'I am looking into Canada, Australia, possibly Colorado, but even in these countries it is still classed as clinical trials. 'But I am willing to do whatever it takes, I need to get my voice heard, I am suffering in silence and slowly dying.' Her husband Jason, who she met when she was 12, has never left her side throughout her diagnosis and treatment. She said: 'We grew up together, he was my trusting friend. We had so many hopes, dreams and aspirations we wished to fulfill. 'But our dreams have all gone because of Stiff Person Syndrome. 'I feel like I have been robbed and Jason has no choice but to raise our three children alone.' Mr Clarke has given up work as a driving instructor to become his wife’s full-time carer at their home in Pontypool, South Wales. He regularly monitors her oxygen levels and has to pump her chest to help her breathe. 'When I am choking during spasm, vomiting and coughing up blood because my lungs are contracting so hard I can see the look of fear on Jason’s face,' Mrs Clarke added. 'Jason has tried contacting the hospital, but no one will help. He just keeps getting told that this is a complex case.' Mr Clarke said: 'I can’t sit back and watch her die - she was so headstrong and active. Now she is a shell of her former self.' Mrs Clarke, pictured left on her wedding day with husband Jason, was diagnosed with the condition in 2011. Since then Mr Clarke has given up work to become her full-time carer .","Lindsay Clarke was diagnosed with Stiff Person Syndrome in 2011 .

"By . Mark Prigg . A mystery disease is killing starfish on both US coasts by causing them to explode. Scientists are struggling to find the cause of the disease, which has been found on both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. The unexplained wasting disease that causes white lesions to appear before the animal's body sags and ruptures and it spills out its internal organs. The unexplained wasting disease that causes white lesions to appear before the animal's body sags and ruptures and it spills out its internal organs. Scientists prefer to call the animal a sea star rather than a starfish because these marine creatures are not fish but rather echinoderms, cousins of sand dollars, sea cucumbers and sea urchins. Most have five arms, although some have many more. They are remarkably durable creatures, and when healthy are able to regenerate lost limbs. They are predators and use suction to pull shells apart to get at the soft body inside. When the shells are pried opened, the starfish pushes its stomach out of its body and into the prey, secreting enzymes that digest the victim's soft body parts. Researchers have ruled out some possible culprits including fungi, some parasites and certain other microorganisms and are taking a hard look at whether viruses or bacteria may be to blame. 'The magnitude of it is very concerning,' said Cornell University ecologist Drew Harvell, one of the scientists involved in the loosely organized search for a cause. 'There's the potential that some of these species could actually go extinct,' Harvell said she is concerned because the mysterious pathogen is affecting 18 different West Coast species along their entire range. Pathogens that affect an animal's range in such a way like a fungus that has targeted frogs can be particularly damaging, she said. The disease appeared last year and is showing no indication of abating. 'I wish we had a sign that it was petering out, but believe me it definitely is not,' Harvell said. The scientists seem to have more questions than answers. 'What is it that has caused this? Where did it come from? If it's exotic, how did it get here? Is it something that's likely to be repeated?' asked Pete Raimondi, chairman of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He expressed concern that the disease that is killing the starfish could be a harbinger of bad things to come for other marine species. Researchers have logged hundreds of examples of starfish killed by the disease . 'This is a really difficult disease in lots of ways because it's very virulent,' Raimondi said. The researchers noted that starfish were the victims of previous diseases in past decades that reduced their numbers, but the current one is more serious. The scientists are wondering whether the starfish have been infected by a virus, bacterium or something else unwittingly imported to the region or whether a pathogen already present somehow became more dangerous, Raimondi added.

"By . Mark Prigg . It was a remarkable step forward in warfare - and the first submarine in history to sink an enemy warship. The H.L Hunley, a hand-cranked submarine, was first launched in 1863 - but after sinking twice, was lost a year later for unknown reasons, killing all crew. The Hunley was eventually discovered off the Charleston coast in 1995 and raised in 2000. Scroll down for video . The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sits in a conservation tank at a lab in North Charleston, about to undergo a chemical bath it is hoped could reveal why it sank, killing all seven crew aboard. A drawing of H. L. Hunley, based on a photograph taken in 1863 by George S. Cook . Scientists near the city where the Civil War began are now preparing to soak the encrusted Confederate submarine in a chemical bath to reveal its hull for the first time in 150 years, seeking to solve the mystery of the demise of the first sub in history to sink an enemy warship. The hand-cranked H.L. Hunley - which rests in a 76,000-gallon conservation tank - will be treated with a solution of sodium hydroxide for about three months to loosen the encrustation coating the hull and interior of the sub. Conservationists will drain the tank each day and later, wearing protective gear, use hand tools to remove the hard sand, sediment and rust coating the sub before refilling the tank each evening. 'This is the end of the beginning' of the preservation work, said Nestor Gonzalez-Pereyra, the associate director of the Lasch Conservation Center at Clemson University's Restoration Institute. 'In a year we may be able to have the clues.' Removing the encrustation will reveal the original surface of the hull and with it any damage that could yield new clues to its sinking off Charleston, S.C., in February 1864. The war had begun with the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor three years earlier. The sub and its crew of eight had set off a powder charge that sank the Union blockade ship USS Housatonic as the Confederacy tried to break a Union blockade of Charleston. The H.L. Hunley, nearly 40 feet (12 m) long, was built at Mobile, Alabama, and launched in July 1863. Hunley was designed for a crew of eight: seven to turn the hand-cranked propeller and one to steer and direct the boat. Each end was equipped with ballast tanks that could be flooded by valves or pumped dry by hand pumps. Extra ballast was added through the use of iron weights bolted to the underside of the hull. Inside the Hunley: It was designed for a crew of eight: seven to turn the hand-cranked propeller and one to steer and direct the boat. In the event the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency, the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel. She was then shipped by rail on August 12, 1863 to Charleston, South Carolina. Originally called Fish Boat, the sub sank on August 29, 1863, during a training exercise, killing five members of her crew. However, it was found and refurbished, before she sank again on October 15, 1863, killing all eight of her second crew, including Horace Hunley himself, who was aboard at the time, even though he was not enlisted in the Confederate armed forces. In the event the submarine needed additional buoyancy to rise in an emergency, the iron weight could be removed by unscrewing the heads of the bolts from inside the vessel. After being reused again, on February 17, 1864, Hunley attacked and sank the 1240-short ton (1124 metric tons) screw sloop USS Housatonic on Union blockade duty in Charleston's outer harbor. Soon after, Hunley sank, killing all eight of her third crew - and researchers still have no idea why. But the Hunley never returned and just why remains a mystery. The wreck was discovered off the coast in 1995. Five years later, in August of 2000, cannons boomed, church bells rang and thousands watched from the harborside as the 40-foot-long sub was raised and brought by barge to the conservation lab. The silt-filled interior of the sub was later excavated and the remains of the crewmen removed. In April of 2004, thousands of men in Confederate gray and Union blue walked in a procession with the crew's coffins from Charleston's waterfront Battery to Magnolia Cemetery in what has been called the last Confederate funeral. The chemical bath will help remove salts and the encrustation on the submarine's hull. The Hunley sank a Union blockade ship off the South Carolina coast in 1864. It was discovered in 1995 and raised in 2000 and brought to the North Charleston lab. Last year, scientists announced it appears the charge that sank the Houstonic was attached to the 16-foot spar at the front of the sub. That could mean the crew was knocked unconscious by the explosion and died before awakening. A closer look at the hull may provide clues. 'Chiseling away the concretion will allow us to travel back in time, potentially helping us learn what happened to the Hunley and her crew that night,' Lt. Gov. Glenn McConnell, the chairman of the South Carolina Hunley Commission, said in a statement. H. L. Hunley, suspended from a crane during its recovery from Charleston Harbor, August 8, 2000. When the Hunley was raised, historians thought it was farther away from the Housatonic and speculated the crew ran out of air before they could crank the submarine back to the coast. Gonzalez-Pereyra said while the encrustation on the hull should be removed in a year, the sub will have to soak in the chemical bath for at least four more years to remove salts in the metal and prevent further corrosion of the sub. Eventually the Hunley will be put on display in a new museum in North Charleston not far from the conservation lab.","Sub sank a Union blockade ship off Charleston in 1864 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Since the Space Shuttle was retired in July 2011, the US has relied on Russia to get its astronauts into orbit. But through their Commercial Crew Program, Nasa has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft. And now Boeing has unveiled its capsule that will begin transporting astronauts into space by 2017. Boeing has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new Crew Space Transportation (CST-100) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years. The capsule is funded by Nasa as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft . Boeing’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the Crew Space Transportation (CST-100). They unveiled the new commercial interior . of its CST-100 next-generation manned space . capsule, showing how people other than Nasa astronauts may one day . travel to space. This is the first time they have made the design of the interior public. Boeing and partner Bigelow Aerospace highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for Nasa, while Bigelow showcased a full-scale model of its BA 330 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in. 'We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential  customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior,' said Chris Ferguson, former Space Shuttle Atlantis commander and current Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for the Commercial Crew Program. Engineers from across Boeing leveraged the company's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule's interior. The capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space . 'Boeing's teams have been designing award-winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation,' said Rachelle Ornan, regional director of Sales and Marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 'Designing the next-generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression. A familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with Earth.' The CST-100, developed as part of Nasa's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability initiative, is designed to transport crew and cargo to low-Earth-orbit. One thing of note is that the capsule seems very clean and tidy. Spacecraft are generally an array of wires and buttons, but it seems Boeing are going for a ‘cleaner’ approach. It also has a surprisingly large number of windows, something not normally favoured by engineers but preferred by astronauts. The seats are lightweight and plastic to keep the weight of the capsule down. The CST-100 spacecraft will at first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats, which will be launched in the future . The CST-100 is designed to carry a crew of seven people into orbit to the ISS or whatever over space station comes to be built in future. However, Boeing also has plans to make the spacecraft available for private missions, highlighted by their partnership with Bigelow Aerospace. Bigelow is in the process of developing a series of inflatable space habitats, known as the BA 330, with a view to launching them into orbit in the coming years. They have already tested inflatable habitat technology with their Genesis 1 and 2 missions in 2006 and 2007. In 2017 they will attach an inflatable module to the ISS to further test the technology, before launching a standalone habitat in the future. Three companies are currently receiving funding from Nasa to develop manned vehicles as part of the Commercial Crew Program. The . first is SpaceX, the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade . ago and has now flown the unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the ISS three . times on its successful Falcon 9 series of rockets. They . are in the process of developing a manned version of the Dragon . spacecraft (mockup pictured above) that can take a crew of seven into orbit, with rumours . suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its . first crew as early as next year. Boeing, meanwhile, with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven-seater CST-100 capsule. And finally Sierra Nevada Corporation are constructing what some regard as the true successor to the Space Shuttle. Known . as the Dream Chaser (test vehicle pictured below), this ‘mini-shuttle’ of sorts will launch upright . on top of a rocket, taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding . back to Earth at the end of its mission. Dream Chaser . With testing already underway, Dream Chaser is expected to undertake its first mission into space for the first time in 2017 on an Atlas V rocket.","The aerospace giant has revealed a concept of its new spacecraft .

"By . Emma Innes . A poet has lost 5st after challenging his father to a weight loss competition. Sven Stears, 25, from Maidstone in Kent, dropped from 17st to 12st in just six months by joining Diet Chef. He says that since the weight loss he feels hugely more confident and that it has cured his crippling IBS. Sven Stears, 25, from Maidstone in Kent, lost 5st to drop from 17st (left) to 12st (right) in just six months . Mr Stears told MailOnline: ‘I feel a thousand times better – I can’t believe it took me so long to realise what was wrong with my life and to fix it. ‘It was a journey of acceptance – I accepted that I was overweight and that it would be hard to lose the weight but I knew that I could do it. ‘I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and to know that I can be proud of my body.’ Mr Stears was a healthy weight, if a little stocky, until his late teens. He then got a job in a pub and started to pile on the pounds rapidly. He says he was working unusual hours and eating at strange times and that this caused him to gain weight. Added to . this, he says that in the pub he always had Coca Cola and Red Bull . readily available so he drank far more than he should. He said: ‘I was very unhealthy. You let it get you down but you turn a blind eye at the same time. Mr Stears piled on the pounds while working in a pub because he ate at unsociable hours and drank a lot of fizzy drinks because they were too readily available behind the bar . Mr Stears lost the weight by joining Diet Chef - he had a weight loss competition with his father, Terry, and was determined to win. In the end, he lost 5st and his father lost 3st . ‘It was half acceptance and half denial. You don’t see yourself as as fat as you are.’ Mr Stears, who earns a living by performing his poetry and holding workshops in schools, also developed IBS as a result of his poor diet and his weight. As a result, he says he would often be doubled over in pain behind his bar. He added: ‘It was very bad but at the time I didn’t see the IBS as connected to my diet and weight.’ Mr . Stears explained that at this point he would eat a bacon, sausage and . egg baguette for breakfast followed by a sandwich for lunch. BEFORE . Breakfast - A bacon, sausage and egg baguette washed down with a whole carton of orange juice. Lunch - A sandwich. Dinner - Yorkshire pudding with chips, cheese and gravy. Snacks - A lot of chocolate. Drinks - Three cans of Red Bull, a can of Lucozade, two cans of Dr Pepper and two to three pints. AFTER . Breakfast - porridge made with milk and one glass of orange juice. Lunch - Soup with some bread. Dinner - A Diet Chef curry with rice. Snacks - Popcorn. Drinks - One fizzy drink, water, black coffee and black tea (both with no sugar) He says he would then have a Yorkshire pudding with chips, cheese and gravy for dinner. He would also snack on chocolate and each day drank three cans of Red Bull, a can of Lucozade, two cans of Dr Pepper and a whole carton of orange juice. Most days he also had two or three pints of beer after work. However, everything changed when Mr Stears developed a very bad case of tonsillitis about a year ago. He was so ill that he was barely able to eat and he lost a stone. When he recovered, he piled the weight straight back on again and then says he was disappointed with himself as he felt he had missed an opportunity to kick start a diet. But then, he lost his job in the pub and realised he no longer had any excuse not to lose weight. He moved back in with his parents and his father, Terry, suggested that they start following a Diet Chef programme. Mr Stears said: ‘This got quite competitive. I missed my old diet for a while but for me it had to be all or nothing – and I wanted to beat my dad!’ As a result, Mr Stears started eating nothing but Diet Chef meals. He now eats porridge with milk for his breakfast, soup and some bread for lunch and a Diet Chef curry for his dinner. He snacks on popcorn and drinks one fizzy drink and one glass of orange juice a day. Otherwise, he just drinks water and black tea with no sugar. Mr Stears says that he used only to be able to cycle for 10 minutes but that he now cycles to work and that this has helped his weight loss. He now weighs a healthy 12st after losing 5st and he also beat his father who lost 3st. Mr Stears (pictured before his weight loss) says he feels 'a thousand times better' now . He said: ‘Losing weight became a goal and an objective. I kept beating my target weight and that kept me going.’ He added: ‘Diet Chef made it easier to stick to it.’ Mr Stears says his IBS has now all but disappeared and that he feels far more confident. He also explained that people’s amazed reactions when they saw him helped motivate him. He said: ‘People’s reactions were amazing. People thought I was lying when I told them who I was. ‘People have been flabbergasted – other people’s reactions have made it worthwhile.’ Mr Stears says he now intends to stay on Diet Chef for a few more months before reverting to normal meals. He added that he now feels he has lost enough weight and wants to concentrate on becoming more muscular. As a result, he intends to start increasing his protein intake and working out.","Sven Stears, 25, piled on the pounds while working in a pub .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Finding your way around a bustling city can be difficult – and it can be even trickier if you suffer from autism. The condition affects people in a variety of ways, but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills, making tasks such as shopping, asking for directions, planning a route and navigating crowded areas testing. Now one architecture student has taken a fresh look at town planning in a bid to create more accessible urban environments that are inclusive of people with autism, like her brother. A planner has  developed a toolkit that helps designers make cities more inclusive for adults with autism. The perfect accessible city (pictured) should have jobs, affordable housing, health and vocational training facilities - all linked by public transport (denoted by symbols), to enable autistic adults to live independently . The U.S.' National Institutes of Health has . identified six needs for adults with autism: . The new urban toolkit highlights . these needs and services, which many cities lack. The perfectly adapted accessible city should have . jobs, affordable housing, health and vocational training facilities – . critically, all linked by public transport - to enable autistic adults to . live independently, Elizabeth Decker, of Kansas State University said. Ms Decker developed a toolkit for her master's in Landscape Architecture that helps designers and planners make cities more accommodating for adults with autism like her brother Marc. It centres on an inclusive approach to urban planning by knitting together public transport and services with green areas, markets and housing. ‘Through this project, I really want to understand my brother,’ Ms Decker said. ‘I want to see him go out in the real world and be successful. This project was a way for me to research more about autism and learn more about people like my brother. It helped me figure out how we can design for a group of adults that is getting bigger.’ According to the most recent figures, one in 68 children are diagnosed with autism in the U.S. and around 1 in 100 in the UK. As a generation of diagnosed autistic children ages, it is especially important to find ways to help adults live more independently with the condition. Inclusive-ville: The most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism-related services. Ms Decker said they should be linked by a simple 'corridor' (pictured) with good public transport to link green areas, housing and civic facilities and that such a corridor could be threaded through existing cities . The National Institute of Health has identified six needs for adults with autism: vocational training, life skills, mental and physical health support, employment, public transportation and affordable housing. Ms Decker's urban toolkit highlights these needs and services, which many cities lack. ‘Cities can become more usable for individuals with autism when these six needs are met. The toolkit provides a beginning list of implications within these six needs that cities can follow in order to meet the needs for adults with autism,’ she told MailOnline. Autistic people can find everyday tasks such planning and organising their days, going to the shops and keeping their homes in order challenging, so navigating a crowded city can be difficult. They often have different . patterns of thinking and can struggle with activities that involve social . interaction, such as visiting a shop or asking for directions. Centres . offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as . clearly designed cities and straight-forward transport systems. Ms Decker’s adviser Katie Kingery-Page, who is an assistant professor of landscape architecture and community planning said: ‘Elizabeth's project is about connecting the dots. 'While many different aspects exist in an urban environment, she is looking at how future planning and design changes can help connect everything in a way that works and is inclusive of a particular group. 'We want to allow people to function fully in an inclusive environment.’ The designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a proposed corridor of autism services, shown in bright pink. Gyms, healthcare facilities, places to buy healthy food, green spaces and affordable housing are marked . Ms Decker said: ‘The most important feature for an inclusive city is the connection of autism-related services. It is not enough to view a city from a few city blocks and suggest placing an affordable apartment complex or park, because in order to develop the inclusive city, one has to view the city as a whole network of services. To pinpoint the features of cities that make a real difference to people with autism, Ms Decker interviewed adults with various disabilities to better understand their needs. The adults stressed the urban needs for public transportation, training services and access to health support. One in 68 children are diagnosed with autism (stick image) in the U.S. and it is important to find ways to help adults live more independently . She used Nashville, Tennessee, as a test city for the urban toolkit. ‘Without realising how to connect autism-related services, then the development of the inclusive city is unsuccessful. From my audit of Nashville, I found that proximity to services…and access to public transportation to existing or proposed services, are key components when designing the inclusive city.’ Ms Decker said that in any city, disused areas of land near well-used civic buildings - such as libraries - could be redeveloped to address the physical and health needs of people with autism – as well as the wider community. Her designs for a more accessible city include more affordable housing locations that connect with a 'corridor' of autism services. Ms Decker initially thought that she wouldn’t find services for people with autism in Nashville, but when she overlaid her inventory of needs with existing infrastructure, she found a cluster of useful amenities. ‘The core of downtown Nashville has an active cluster of services - vocational rehabilitation, disability services, etc - and Nashville's farmers' market provides fresh, healthy food,’ Ms Decker said. She has provided links to healthy food areas, such as farmers’ markets and has recommended placing vocational training facilities near civic buildings. She proposes preserving and increasing green space in downtown Nashville to offer areas for sensory relief from crowded, chaotic and noisy urban conditions. Ms Decker used Nashville, Tennessee (pictured) - which offers residential services, a strong job market and good transportation as well as the Vanderbilt-Kennedy Centre that runs adult services and vocational services - as a test city for the urban toolkit . Autism affects different people in different ways, but it is characterised by deficits in language and social skills. People with autism have different patterns of thinking and can struggle with sensory experiences, which when combined can make it difficult for an autistic person to live independently. Everyday actions like getting dressed, preparing food and coping with crowded places can be tough for severely autistic people. Some people have difficulty planning and organising - and so navigating a sprawling city can be especially difficult. People with autism can struggle with activities that involve social interaction, such as visiting a shop or asking for direction. Centres offering support and life skills are therefore important as well as clearly designed cities and straight-forward transport. In her modified city, Ms Decker also addressed employment for adults with autism and marked job opportunities - including craftworkers, service, professional, administrative work - throughout Nashville. ‘My project views cities from a larger perspective and demonstrates that cities lack connection of services for autism,’ she said. ‘It is not enough to view a city within a few blocks and suggest placing a building or park; without seeing the vision of an inclusive city as a whole, the design falls short of successfully connecting the needs of adults with autism. ‘The inclusive city not only provides opportunity for individuals with autism, but also adds another level of health and success to dynamic urban environments for everyone.’ Carol Povey, director of The National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: 'This is an innovative and exciting approach to city planning. In the UK we are increasingly seeing individual buildings - such as hospitals and museums - becoming more autism friendly. It's encouraging to see that thinking about creating autism-friendly spaces is spreading to the wider canvas of the urban environment. 'The NAS is not surprised to see this has been done by the sister of someone with autism, who understands the difference that an inclusive environment can make - not only for people with autism, but for all of us, allowing everyone to participate fully in urban life.' As it is not practical to raze parts of cities to the ground and redesign them from scratch, Ms Decker said that an inclusive city can be ‘threaded though the existing form and space of the urban hub. ‘Trying to design an entire city in one master plan is unrealistic. 'Cities are meant to develop themselves, because the goal for a city is to be diverse…In order for any city to begin to be inclusive, it is necessary to determine what the existing services are and what is needed. From there, proposals for connections can be determined,’ she added.","A planner from Kansas State University has developed a toolkit to improve the accessibility in cities such as Nashville .

The flaw was discovered by a security expert in Germany and it causes attachments to be sent unencrypted, even if the operating system’s data protection feature is enabled. Apple has acknowledged the bug and said it is working on a fix, but did not reveal how long the bug had been active or when the fix would be issued. Scroll down for video . The bug was discovered by a security expert in Germany.  It causes attachments to be sent unencrypted via the Mail app on iOS 7 devices, pictured. It occurs even if iOS 7's Data Protection feature is enabled. Apple has acknowledged the bug and said it is working on a fix . Data protection is available for devices that offer hardware encryption, including iPhone 3GS and later, all iPad models, as well as the iPod touch from the 3rd generation. The feature was designed to enhance the built-in hardware encryption by protecting the encryption keys with a user’s passcode. According to Apple, this provides an 'additional layer of protection for email messages attachments, and third-party applications'. To enable data protection, go to Settings, General and Passcode. Once a passcode is set, the 'Data protection is enabled' becomes visible. Andreas Kurtz, a researcher for NESO Security Labs in Germany, announced the vulnerability on his blog last week. He wrote: ‘A few weeks ago, I noticed email attachments within the iOS 7 MobileMail.app are not protected by Apple's data protection mechanisms. 'Clearly, this is contrary to Apple's claims that data protection ""provides an additional layer of protection for (..) email messages attachments"".' He said he verified the issued by restoring an iPhone 4 to the most recent iOS versions; iOS 7.1 and 7.1.1, and setting up an IMAP email account to give him test emails and attachments. By mounting the iOS data partition to a computer, he was able to find the email folder and see all the attachments without any encryption or restriction. The flaw was produced on an iPhone 4, 5S, pictured, and iPad 2 running iOS 7.0.4 to 7.1.1. Despite the flaw, experts have stated it is difficult to exploit because the attacker would need access to the device and need to know the passcode . He was also able to reproduce the flaw on an iPhone 5S and an iPad 2 running iOS 7.0.4. Kurtz confirmed the data protection feature was enabled elsewhere on the phone by attempting, and failing, to access the Protected Index file, in the email message database. In a statement, Apple said: 'We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix which we will deliver in a future software update.'

After being discovered in a stack of papers in 1873 and sold on for just six shillings, the British Guiana 1c Magenta stamp is expected to fetch up to $20 million (£11.8 million) at auction. Frequently described as ‘the most valuable stamp in the world’, the small, octagonal-shaped stamp will be sold in a one-lot auction in New York on 17 June. It is the only surviving example of the ‘emergency’ stamps range launched by the British Guiana postmaster in 1856, and is so rare it has been previously dubbed 'the Holy Grail of stamps.' Frequently described as 'the most valuable stamp in the world', the British Guiana 1c Magenta, pictured, will be auctioned in New York on 17 June. It is the only surviving example of the 'emergency' stamps range launched by the colony's postmaster in 1856, and was discovered by a schoolboy in Demerara in 1873 . Also known as the One-Cent Magenta, the stamp was part of a shipment commissioned by the country’s postmaster when a delivery from England was delayed. This range also included the 4c Magenta and the 4c Blue, and all the stamps were printed by the local Royal Gazette newspaper. The 1c Magenta is printed in black on magenta paper, and features a sailing ship with the colony's Latin motto 'Damus Petimus Que Vicissim', which translates to ‘We give and expect in return.’ The stamp's country of issue - now known as Guyana - and its value is shown in small black lettering around the frame.

Reports . claim it was sold for six shillings to a local collector and was later . bought in 1878 by Liverpool stamp dealer Thomas Ridpath for $200 (£120). Ridpath then sold it to Philip von Ferrary for $250 (£150) the same year. Arthur Hind bought it in 1922 for $36,000 (£21,000) and in 1940 it was bought for $40,000 (£23,700) by Fred Small during a private sale. In 1970, Small auctioned his entire stamp collection and the 1c stamp was bought by Irwin Weinberg, for $280,000 (£166,000). A . decade later, John E. du Pont bought the 1c Magenta for $935,000 (£554,000) to add . to his private collection, where it remained until his death in 2010. The stamp is now scheduled to be sold at auction in New York on 17 as part of du Pont’s estate for an estimated $20 million (£11.8 million). In March, the Expert Committee at the . Royal Philatelic Society London gave the stamp a pre-sale estimate of . between $10 million (£6 million) and $20 million (£11.8 million).

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The naming of a child is a very personal thing, but you could help yours on the road to success if you pick a number of middle names. Scientists suggest that making use of middle initials in everyday life is the easiest way to appear cleverer, which in turn can lead to success. Psychologists have found that using one or more middle initials boosts a person’s social status in the eyes of others because initials are associated with high status professions such as law or medicine. Initials are useful from birth: Parents could put their child on the path to success simply by picking out some middle names. Scientists believe that making use of middle initials in everyday life might be the easiest way to appear cleverer, which in turn can lead to success . Scientists have found that we trust strangers with easier-to pronounce names. Simpler names make people come across as more familiar and less risky to know, according to a recent study. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that people who speak English trust strangers with easier-to-pronounce names more than those with names that are more difficult to say– even when those strangers are from the same country. People are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight-forward names, they said. A previous study revealed that people with easily-pronounceable names are perceived as more likable, more electable and more accomplished. People trust strangers with simple names as they come across as being more familiar and less risky to know. ‘People’s middle initials have a particular and powerful effect on how people are perceived by others,’ Wijnand A.P. Van Tilburg of the University of Southampton and Eric R. Igou of the University of Limerick wrote in their study, which was published in the European Journal of Social Psychology. ‘The display of middle initials increases the perceived social status of these people and positively biases inferences about their intellectual capacity and performance.’ One study conducted by the duo, saw 85 students from the University of Limerick evaluate how well an article explaining Einstein’s theory of general relativity was written, Pacific Standard reported. The author of the text was written as David Clark, David F. Clark, David F.P. Clark, or David F.P.R. Clark and the psychologists found that David F. Clark was considered a better writer than David Clark - without any middle initials. While they wrote: ‘It seems that one middle initial is sufficient to produce the middle initials effect,’ they noticed that David F.P.R. Clark was considered the best writer in the test. Psychologists think that people are used to seeing initials used in 'intellectual domains' and associate their use with a clever person. Doctors, (pictured) lawyers and other 'high status' professionals often display their middle initials, which might form the association with initials and intellect in people's minds . As a result of further studies, they found that the phenomenon was linked to the status of the writer. One of the experiments revealed that people were more eager to join a quiz team if its members included people who used their middle initials, while they were not as impressed if they were joining a theoretical sports team. The duo think that people are used to seeing initials used in ‘intellectual domains’ and therefore associate their use with a clever person. Doctors, lawyers, scientists and other ‘high status’ professionals often display their middle initials, which might form the association with initials and intellect in people’s minds. There is also a theory that parents who give their children more middle names have more resources available to make sure their offspring receive a good education.","Scientists from the Universities of Southampton and Limerick said that the use of middle initials is the easiest way to appear cleverer .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Solar power has had a difficult start on Earth thanks to inefficient panels and high costs. But in space, scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy. Now, the space-based solar power – once merely the stuff of science-fiction – could be available sooner than expected if Japan has its way. Within 25 years, the country plans to make space-based solar power a reality, according to a proposal from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa). Solar power has had a difficult start on Earth. But in space, scientists believe it could transform the way we generate energy. By the end of this year, Japan expects to perform a ground experiment in which a beam of hundreds of watts will be transmitted over about 164ft (50 metres) The agency has outlined its plans to create a 1-gigawatt commercial system for space-based solar power, which would provide about the same output as a nuclear power plant. In a recent IEEE article by Susumu Sasaki, a professor emeritus at Jaxa, he outlined the agency’s plans create a 1.8 mile long (3 km) man-made island in the harbour of Tokyo Bay. The island would be studded with 5 billion antennas working together to convert microwave energy into electricity. The microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles (36,000 km) above the Earth. To collect the solar energy, two large mirrors would be positioned to direct light onto photovoltaic panels . The microwaves would be beamed down from a number of giant solar collectors in orbit 22,400 miles (36,000 km) above the Earth. Pictured are artist's impressions of what the system may look like . To collect the solar energy, two large mirrors would be positioned to direct light onto photovoltaic panels 24 hours a day. In a . separate porject, a Japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the . moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here . on Earth. Shimizu . Corporation's Luna Ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles . (11,000km) around the moon's equator and a field of solar panels would . form a belt. Energy . captured by these panels would then be sent to Earth using microwaves . and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is . needed. According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terawatts of continuous solar energy. The . company claims the plans would not only provide an 'almost . inexhaustible' energy supply, it would stop the rise of global warming . caused by carbon dioxide from current energy sources. A separate substation on the island would send electricity coursing through a submarine cable to Tokyo, to help keep the neon lights of Shibuya shining. ‘A combination of technical and social factors is giving it currency, especially in Japan,’ said Professor Sasaki. ‘On the technical front, recent advances in wireless power transmission allow moving antennas to coordinate in order to send a precise beam across vast distances. ‘At the same time, heightened public concerns about the climatic effects of greenhouse gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels are prompting a look at alternatives.’ Japan has a particular interest in finding a practical clean energy source: The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant prompted an exhaustive search for alternatives. However Japan lacks both fossil fuel resources and empty land suitable for renewable power installations. By the end of this year, researchers expect to perform a ground experiment in which a beam of hundreds of watts will be transmitted over about 164ft (50 metres). Each panel will transmit 400W, so that the total beam will carry 1.6 kW. In this early-stage experiment, Jaxa hopes to achieve a power output of 350 W. Shimizu Corporation plans to install a 250-mile-wide field of solar panels on the moon's equator (concept image pictured). Energy from these panels would be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights and the company claims the system would be an 'almost inexhaustible' source of power . ‘Some people have a grisly mental image of roasted seagulls dropping from the sky. In fact, the beam wouldn’t even be intense enough to heat your coffee,’ said Professor Sasaki. In a separate project, a Japanese firm last year revealed plans to cover the moon in a huge swathe of solar panels and use them to power homes here on Earth. Shimizu Corporation's Luna Ring project would stretch almost 6,790 miles (11,000km) around the moon's equator and a field of solar panels would form a belt. Energy captured by these panels would then be sent to Earth using microwaves and laser lights could be beamed directly to countries where it is needed. According to the plans, the project would produce around 13,000 terrawatts of continuous solar energy. At present, the world's population consumes about 15 terawatts of power each year.

"By . Sarah Michael . A dangerous high-speed car chase across the western suburbs of Adelaide has ended after a stolen car hit an oncoming truck and crashed into a pub. A 27-year-old man has been arrested and branded an 'idiot' by police after he endangered dozens of other vehicles while driving the stolen car on Wednesday morning. The car chase followed an earlier incident when the man allegedly attempted to rob a West Lakes hotel while armed with a screwdriver. Scroll down for video . A stolen black ute crashed into The Lady Daly Hotel in the Adelaide suburb of Hindmarsh on Wednesday morning following a dangerous car chase . A 27-year-old man from New South Wales has been arrested following the car chase, after he allegedly attempted armed robbery at a different hotel in West Lakes . Lakes Resort Hotel general manager Trent Fahey told The Advertiser he confronted the man but withdrew when the man allegedly threatened to stab him. 'Our gaming manager was first to see him and grabbed him and yelled ""stop"". He's pushed her over and then that's when I chased him,' Mr Fahey said. 'He legged it pretty fast and then turned around and confronted me and said ""I'll stab ya"".' The man then fled the scene in a black Holden ute, which had been reported stolen earlier in the day. Police spotted the car and alerted the Polair police helicopter, which tracked the vehicle as it sped across Adelaide's western suburbs. The moment before a heavy truck hit the black Holden ute after it sped into cross traffic . The truck clipped the stolen car and caused it to spin out of control . The car crossed onto the wrong side of the road and overtook other vehicles before speeding into a busy intersection, where it tried to turn right and narrowly missed hitting cars that were waiting at the traffic lights opposite. It was forced to swerve to a stop before pulling out and continuing its drive. The driver took a major risk at a second intersection by cutting off a white van, which avoided hitting the car by slamming on its breaks. At one point the car veered off the road and into a park before steering back onto the road. In the final moments of the chase the car overtook a white vehicle and sped into cross traffic, where it was hit by a heavy truck. The car pulled a risky manoeuvre at a second intersection when it sped through a red light . A white van narrowly avoided a crash by slamming on its breaks . The car spun out of control before smashing into The Lady Daly pub in the Adelaide suburb of Hindmarsh. Police arrested the driver, from New South Wales, after he entered the pub and then tried to escape on foot. Lady Daly owner David Limareff, 39, witnessed the car smash into the poles holding up his pub's veranda as he was opening the front doors at approximately 11am. 'I was opening the front doors on the corner and I saw the police car cross the road and thought I'd have a look to see what's going on,' Mr Limareff told MailOnline. 'I opened up our doors for the day's trade and I saw the truck clip the ute and basically saw it flying straight at me and I sort of leapt out of the way. At one point the ute veered off the road and into a park . The car made its way through the park for a short time before steering back onto the road . 'I raced out to see if the occupant of the car was OK and that's when I realised it wasn't a normal accident, when all the cop cars chasing it were piling in.' The 27-year-old man tried to enter the pub through a side door but it was locked, so he went through a delivery door into the kitchen where two chefs were working. 'The chefs chased him into the beer garden and he just picked up one of the chairs to use at the two chefs, so they retreated quickly and allowed him to pass,' Mr Limareff said. 'I was just about to head back into the hotel when I saw him just casually walking past the bar.' The man then exited the hotel and tried to escape on foot. 'He just went for a leisurely walk down Port Road so I grabbed one of the police officers,' Mr Limareff said. 'He probably thought he could just blend in nicely and walk away, he was just walking like he was going out for a stroll.' Police started chasing the man down the street and he broke into a run, but was eventually apprehended. Mr Limareff said between six and 12 police cars, marked and unmarked, arrived at the scene following the crash. He added he is thankful the car didn't do any lasting damage to his business. Western Adelaide Police chief inspector Kym Zander branded the arrested man an 'idiot' and said the situation could have had serious consequences . 'The car physically didn't hit the building,' Mr Limareff said. 'The two posts holding up the veranda, they caught 800kg of vehicle and prevented the car from slamming in the front.' Western Adelaide Police chief inspector Kym Zander said: 'This is a fairly serious situation that could have had far reaching consequences. 'If you or I or any member of our family had been in this vicinity this out of control car could have taken or severely injured anybody that was in the vicinity. 'Unfortunately it's because of these idiots that take these risks that we find ourselves with the consequences that we now face today.'

The tactic went unnoticed for for more . than three years while Finney was working as a cashier at the Barclays . branch on Colmore Row in Birmingham city centre. Her lawyer told Birmingham Crown Court all the money had been used to pay off of short-term payday loans she had taken out to pay off gambling debts. Finney had been employed by the company since 2004. The fraud involved the transfer of . fictitious amounts using a 'sundries account' at the bank and Finney . then made credits into her sole and joint accounts. She was caught out during a routine audit by the bank, who called in police. Yesterday, she pleaded guilty pleaded guilty to the theft of £127,471 belonging to Barclays customers between January 1, 2010, and January 20 this year. Richard Dewsbery, defending, told Birmingham Crown Court: 'It all went on short term loans and gambling.' Finney was released on bail and will now be sentenced on July 31. Judge Nicholas Webb adjourned . sentence for reports to be prepared on Finney, who wore a dark trouser . suit with a grey top and who only spoke when she entered her plea. Mark . Phillips, prosecuting, said the Crown would be seeking to establish what level . of responsibility she had at the bank before the July 31 hearing. Fraud: Finney was working at this Barclays branch on Colmore Row in Birmingham when she began stealing money . He also said it was unclear whether the defendant, who was of previous good character, was 'bound to be caught' over the fraud. The Crown would only be seeking a . nominal amount in a Proceeds of Crime application against Finney, as she . did not have any assets, Mr Phillips added. The . Judge warned Finney: 'The fact that I am adjourning for reports and . renewing your bail must not be taken by you as an indication of what the . sentence will be. I think you know what is almost inevitable in this . case. Addiction: Finney's lawyer told the court all the money had been used to pay off payday loans she had taken out because a gambling problem . 'The fact that you have pleaded guilty is an important and significant factor.' After the case Alan White, spokesman for Barclays Bank, said: 'Safeguarding our customer's money is our one of our highest priorities. 'Whilst rare, staff fraud simply isn't tolerated. We work with the relevant authorities to ensure matters such as this are dealt with in the appropriate way.' He added that all customers who lost money were refunded.","Julia Finney, 29, made nearly 200 transfers from customer accounts .

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . No clear leader has been announced in the primary contest between pop star turned political candidate Clay Aiken and textile entrepreneur Keith Crisco in the Democratic congressional race in North Carolina. Aiken, once a runner-up on TV's American Idol, and Crisco each had about 40 per cent of the vote late Tuesday night in the 2nd Congressional District. They were trailed by licensed family counselor Toni Morris of Fayetteville. Scroll down for video . Clay Aiken, right, speaks to supporters during an election night watch party in Holly Springs, North Carolina on Tuesday. Aiken is seeking the Democratic nomination for North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District . The winner will challenge incumbent Republican Congresswoman Renee Ellmers in November in the heavily Republican district. She had a better go of her own party's primary, as Ellmers handily defeated her primary challenger on Tuesday. The Democratic race has drawn celebrity buzz thanks to Aiken's career as an entertainer- even though this is his first political campaign. The openly gay father-turned-politician launched his campaign in February by releasing an emotionally-charged video where he detailed his mother's domestic abuse and his criticisms of the Congresswoman Ellmers. The entertainer talked about his work as a special education teacher, UNICEF representative and member of President Bush's commission on education. Opening up: The former singer announced his congressional candidacy in a video that was filmed at a family friends house where he and his mother lived when he was a toddler after she escaped his abusive father . 'For most Americans, there are no golden tickets- at least not like the kind you see on TV,' he says to the camera. 'More families are struggling today than at any time in our history, and here in North Carolina, we've suffered more than our share of pain.' Aiken said he examined the district's makeup for more than a year and has assembled a veteran Democratic political team. Aiken announced in 2008 that he is gay and has a 5-year-old son who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization with an older female friend. 'Golden ticket': Aiken lost the 2003 American Idol crown to Ruben Studdard (L) in 2003, but both have had successful recording careers . He said in an interview with the Associated Press that he doesn't believe his sexual orientation will play a role in whether or not people vote for him. 'There are dozens of issues that are important to the people living in the district, and that is not one of them,' he said. In the launch video, he cited Ellmer's votes in favor of military spending cuts and the federal shutdown as being harmful for the country, as well as North Carolina's 2nd District. 'I'm not a politician. I don't ever want to be one. But I do want to help bring back- at least to my corner of North Carolina- the idea that someone can go to Washington to represent all the people, whether they voted for you or not,' he said in the video. Competition: Surgical nurse turned congresswoman Renee Ellmers has represented North Carolina's Second Congressional District since 2011, and Aiken says she has been bad for their community . For Aiken, a Democrat, winning in the Republican-leaning District will be a challenge: Mitt Romney won 58 per cent of the vote in the district in 2012, according to a North Carolina Chamber analysis. John Davis, a longtime political researcher in North Carolina, said Aiken stands a decent chance to win the primary, but the district boundaries drawn by Republicans will make it difficult for any Democrat to win in November- particularly given his sexuality. 'It's not going to be an issue that people are going to talk openly about,' Davis said. His opponent dismissed his candidacy today by taking a swipe at his singing career. 'Apparently his performing career isn’t going so well and he’s bored,' Mrs Ellmers told a radio station Wednesday.","American Idol runner-up is competing as the Democratic candidate to run against current Republican Congresswoman Renee Ellmers .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A German exchange student shot dead by a homeowner broke into the garages of different homes with a companion three or four times before the shooting, it has been alleged. Markus Kaarma has been charged with deliberate homicide in the April 27 slaying of Diren Dede, 17, in Missoula, Montana. Prosecutors allege Kaarma, 29, shot blindly into his garage, hitting Dede, after sensors and a video monitor alerted him to an intruder. But Kaarma's lawyer, Paul Ryan said Dede's companion that night was an exchange student who has returned home to Ecuador. He did not release the student's name. Ryan says the Ecuadorian student told police the boys started 'garage hopping' after learning about the practice from other students at their high school. Tragic: German exchange student Diren Dede, 17 (pictured left and right) was shot dead by a Montana homeowner on April 27 . Meanwhile, authorities are looking into whether marijuana or alcohol played a role in the shooting. A newly published court document reveals Missoula police received a judge's permission to test whether Kaarma was drunk or high when he shot and killed Dede. Officers found a jar of pot in Kaarma's home the day he shot Dede, a police statement accompanying an April 28 request for a search warrant said. Kaarma also might have had marijuana stolen from his garage in a previous burglary, the document said. Police believe Kaarma 'may have been impaired by alcohol, dangerous drugs, other drugs, intoxicating substances or a combination of the above, at the time of the incident,' the statement from Detective Dean Chrestenson said. Charged: Markus Kaarma, pictured at his home in Missoula, Montana, has been charged with deliberate homicide in the shooting death of 17-year-old Diren Dede, an exchange student from Germany . Fired without warning: Markus Kaarma (right) and his wife set a trap in their garage for Dede, leaving the door open with a purse in plain view and trip wires to alert them to his presence . District Judge Karen Townsend granted the warrant to draw Kaarma's blood to test whether any traces of intoxicants remained. Kaarma's attorney, Paul Ryan, did not immediately return a call for comment Tuesday. Ryan has said Kaarma plans to cite Montana's self-defense laws in pleading not guilty to the charge. Prosecutors allege Kaarma and his common-law wife set up sensors and a video monitor, then left their garage door open the night of the shooting in Missoula. Kaarma had been burgled twice before, and he told his hairdresser that he had stayed up for three nights waiting to shoot some kid, prosecutors said. Heartbroken: Team-mates, friends and relatives gather to remember Diren Dede at his football club, SC Teutonia 1910, on April 30 in Hamburg, Germany . Memorial: Tributes are left in memory of Diren Dede outside his local football club, SC Teutonia 1910, on April 30 in Hamburg, Altona, Germany . The search-warrant request says Kaarma's live-in girlfriend, Janelle Pflager, told a neighbor that someone had taken all the marijuana and pot pipes out of the garage in a previous burglary. Pflager also told the neighbor her husband smokes marijuana in the garage, and police found a glass jar of marijuana in his pantry the day of the shooting, the search warrant said. Tributes: Team-mates, friends and relatives gather to remember Diren Dede at his football club, SC Teutonia 1910, on April 30 in Hamburg, Germany . The night of the shooting, Kaarma and Pflager heard the sensors trip and saw a figure in the garage on the video monitor, prosecutors said. Kaarma took a shotgun out the front door and fired four shots into the dark garage, hitting Dede. The boy was unarmed, and authorities have declined to say what he was doing in the garage.","Markus Kaarma, 29, has been charged with deliberate homicide .

"By . Mark Duell . Missing: Janet Brown has not been seen since 2005 . A wealthy heiress was killed and her body hidden by her lover as part of an audacious fraud that saw him strip her and her elderly parents of all their assets, a court heard today. Donald Graham, 59, is accused of murdering Janet Brown, who has not been seen since 2005, so he could use her estate to fund his lifestyle. The jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told that he then set about gaining the trust of her parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents. Along with Elizabeth Todd, 51, he is also jointly accused of perverting the course of justice.  Todd faces charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and forgery but both defendants deny the charges. The court heard that Miss Brown had worked as an extra on TV and as a mystery shopper but had made most of her money through developing properties. The court heard that after first meeting Miss Brown in 1998, the pair had begun a relationship. Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said that in 2005 the pair had planned a holiday to France together and they had booked tickets on a ferry from Dover. But shortly before they were due to leave, Graham told her he was unable to go because his wife was too ill for him to leave her. Probe: Police dig up land in 2012 as part of their search for Miss Brown. The court heard she has not been in contact with any of her friends, her family, her bank and or any service such as a doctor since 2005 . Miss Brown decided to go anyway, Mr Smith said, and told friends this was what she intended to do. As a result she arranged for a friend to collect her dog from her home in Hexham, Northumberland, where she lived with her parents. On arrival he saw that her car had gone and so assumed she had left for her trip abroad. ‘Her Porsche car was not at the farm when he arrived and he believed that Janet Brown had left for her holiday as planned,’ he said. In court: Elizabeth Todd, 51, is accused of perverting the course of justice and conspiracy to commit fraud and forgery but denies the charges . ‘He had no reason at that time to . think otherwise. But he was never to see or hear from her again. Janet . Brown has never been seen or spoken to since.’ Mr . Smith told the jury since that day she has not been in contact with any . of her friends, her family, her bank and or any service such as a . doctor or the police. In essence, he told the court, she had ‘disappeared from the face of the earth’. Mr Smith said the evidence could only be explained on the basis she had been killed before she was due to leave for France and that her body had been concealed and had remained concealed ever since. The court heard when Graham had told Miss Brown that he would not be able to go on holiday because his wife was too ill, he had in fact lied to her. But he had since found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, with whom he had become infatuated. Mr Smith told the jury that just before she went missing, Miss Brown transferred Graham the sum of £300,000 after he convinced her to do it through some deceit, only now known to him. ‘Donald Graham knew Janet Brown had a significant amount of money in a bank account under her name,’ said Mr Smith. ‘He wanted that money so he could live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars and to buy a property for Elizabeth Todd to live in.’ Trial: The jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told Graham set about gaining the trust of Miss Brown¿s parents, giving him access to banking information and personal documents . He would go on to send postcards from . France to Janet Brown’s parents pretending to be her, saying she had . found a job in Europe. Mr . Smith told the court that Graham ingratiated himself with Miss Brown’s . parents who were elderly and in poor health and after her mother Olive . died he began visiting her father Eric at his home. Work: Miss Brown worked as an extra on TV and as a mystery shopper but had made most of her money through developing properties, the court heard . He began to do his shopping for him and went on to gain his trust and confidence. The jury heard after both parents died . Graham went on to arrange their funerals but did not inform any . relative but did obtain a death certificate in order to defraud Eric . Brown’s estate. While . visiting he also gained access to all Janet Brown’s bank documents and . personal affairs, obtained Eric Brown’s cheque book, details of his . pension and went onto strip their estate of all their assets through . false telephone calls and false withdrawal slips. Mr Smith said Graham and Todd’s downfall came in 2009 when one of the banks that Eric Brown held an account with suspected fraudulent activity. Staff notified police about their suspicions and an investigation began. From there, officers discovered the full extent of the fraud, which had extended to Olive and Janet Brown. ‘That investigation has since established the details of her disappearance and the reasons for her disappearance,’ said Mr Smith. ‘We will be inviting you to conclude that . there is no other reasonable explanation for Janet Brown’s . disappearance other than she was killed by Donald Graham so he could use . her estate and those of her parents to fund his lifestyle.’ 'Donald Graham knew Janet Brown had a significant amount of money in a bank account under her name. He wanted that money so he could live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars' Robert Smith QC, prosecuting . Mr Smith said their estates were systematically defrauded by Graham, who killed Miss Brown and planned to start a new relationship with Todd. He told the jury that, given her history of property development, the transfer of £300,000 probably related to an intended investment in property. ‘However, Donald Graham had different plans for that money. He used the money to house his newly found girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd,’ said Mr Smith. ‘Despite her disappearance, Donald Graham placed a deposit on a house in Seaton Delaval using Janet Brown’s money. He used the money of his former girlfriend, who had disappeared just two months before, to buy a house for his new girlfriend to live in.’ The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former NYPD officer branded the 'cannibal cop' for allegedly plotting to kidnap, murder and eat more than 100 women is now working as a jailhouse cook, it was revealed today. And his pizza is so good, even the guards eat it. Gilberto Valle was convicted in March 2013 of conspiring to commit heinous acts of murder, torture and cannibalism - including on his own wife. New line of work: Gilberto Valle, a former New York police officer, is now a cook in the jail where he's being held awaiting sentencing . The New York Daily News reports that Valle's mother, Elizabeth, says her son now 'kills time' cooking lunch and breakfast at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. Valle is appealing the conviction and a federal judge has not passed sentence on the former Queens, New York, patrolman while he weighs whether to grant a new trial. Valle's fellow inmates know all about his reputation and even crack wise about his alleged plot to skin and roast women like sides of beef. 'Don’t stand too close to the oven!' the prisoners joke, Mrs Valle told the Daily News. For his work in the kitchen, Valle is paid 44 cents an hour. His mother says it keeps him occupied while he plots his new defense tactics. Valle, a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife, Kathleen Mangan, found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com. Valle's own wife, Kathleen Mangan, right, turned him in to police when she found a drove of his writings about cannibalism. She divorced him in July . Mrs Valle said Kathleen has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with him and his family . The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat. They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body. Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out. 'He’s not the monster they portray him to be,' Mrs Valle told the Daily News. 'He's innocent.' Mangan, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce in July, Mrs Valle said. She has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with Valle and his family, she said.","Gilberto Valle wrote extensively about his plans to kidnap, murder, cook and eat 100 women - including his own wife .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Nick Clegg came under furious attack today over his decision to veto Tory plans to crackdown on knife crime. The . Deputy Prime Minister said he would not support mandatory jail . sentences for those caught carrying a knife for the second time. But he was attacked by listeners to his weekly radio show, the Labour party and Britain's most senior police officer. Nick Clegg defended his knife crackdown veto on his weekly LBC phone in this morning . Mr Clegg told LBC listeners: 'I don’t . think everybody, in all circumstances, at all times, should be chucked . into prison when they are found carrying a knife the second time, . regardless of the circumstances.' Teacher Ann Maguire, 61, was stabbed to death at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds last week. Her tragic killing has sparked calls for a crackdown on thugs carrying knives . He added: 'All I’m saying is yes, bang people up who should be banged up. Yes, let’s strengthen the law where people threaten you with a knife. 'But saying that someone should always, always, no exceptions at all, end up in prison because they have a pen knife in their pocket, or a knife in their pocket having had a previous knife related offence I think that actually would rebound on us.' But one caller to Mr Clegg's weekly radio phone in on LBC, introduced as 'John in Wallingham' demanded to know how many times people needed to be caught carrying a blade before they were punished. Referring to the Deputy Prime Minister, he added: 'How are elderly people meant to sleep in their beds when you’ve got lunatics in suits like him who are looking after this country?' He then accused Mr Clegg of being soft on crime because it allowed the legal profession to make money defending criminals. John said: 'You’ve created these monsters out there - you like it. You’ve got all your lawyer mates all earning money out of it, the system. Legal Aid, help all the criminals Clegg.' A shocked Mr Clegg, whose wife Miriam earns a reported £500,000 a year as a lawyer, responded: 'Right.' The attack on Mr Clegg came as Britain's most senior police officer, Scotland Yard chief Bernard Hogan Howe, said it was 'vital' that knife crime was tackled. Labour leader Ed Miliband also suggested that Labour will back the Tory proposal, leaving Mr Clegg powerless to block it. The Labour leader told the BBC: 'I don't agree with Nick Clegg. I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime. 'Labour's been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at. 'We definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law and we are definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence, after conviction for a second offence. 'We need to make sure it's done in the right way, but that's where we stand, because I think the public want to know that we are going to send a strong message to people who carry knives repeatedly that it is not acceptable.' Mr Miliband's remarks echoed Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard who said mandatory jail sentences for carrying a blade, being pushed by the Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, would send a clear message to youngsters. Sir Bernard said the policy had worked with gun crime and could have the same effect in reducing the number of stabbings. But Mr Clegg accused the Tories of exploiting the tragic death of teacher Ann Maguire to look tough on crime. He . claimed new proposals to automatically jail anyone twice caught . carrying a knife were 'headline grabbing' politics that could force . judges to lock up innocent teenagers. The Deputy PM said the move would be a . 'step backwards' - creating hardened criminals out of youngsters who . had got themselves caught up with the wrong crowd. But Sir Bernard, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, told LBC: 'For me, it's vital we send a clear message to our young people.' He added: 'They do hear simple messages. They have heard it about guns, I think they need to hear it about knives.' Mr Clegg responded: 'The . police, quite understandably, often say they want new powers on the . statute book and often politicians and Parliament say 'hang on a minute, . we don't just constantly put new offences on the statute book without . considering the knock on effect on the prison population, on rates of . re-offending. 'Now . Bernard Hogan-Howe, for instance, said well, of course, sometimes people . might wander out of their home with a knife on them and not really . remember and they have done it innocently. 'The point is, under this arrangement that person would end up in prison because there are no extenuating circumstances.' He . added: 'Yes, let's be really tough on knife crime but let's be smart . about how we are tough on knife crime. Let's not just simply catch . headlines in a way which doesn't necessarily deal with the problem.' The . Deputy Prime Minister insisted he was 'not soft on knife crime at all' and wanted to 'bang people up who should be banged up'. He said young girls are often forced . to carry knives for gang leaders and it was not right to . automatically lock them up. Mr . Clegg said forcing judges to imprison anyone caught with a knife would . undermine their ability to weigh up the facts of each case. Writing in the Guardian, . the Deputy PM said: 'Everybody has been shaken by the death of Ann . Maguire and the notion that any teacher should lose their life in the . classroom. It was especially poignant because she was clearly such a . widely respected and loved teacher. 'But . in the aftermath of terrible events such as this we have to be careful . that we don't simply reach for headline-grabbing solutions that don't . necessarily work in practice.' The Lib Dem leader's explosive remarks threaten to spark a fresh Coalition row. Mr . Clegg's implication that Mr Grayling's proposals . are designed to win political points are likely to infuriate the Tories. Today's . row comes just a week after Mrs Maguire, 61, died after being stabbed . by a teenage student at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with her murder. Under Mr Grayling's proposal offenders caught twice with a knife to face an automatic six-month jail term. He wants mandatory jail sentences to be introduced through an . amendment to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which returns to the . Commons on May 12. Mr . Clegg's intervention comes despite the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, . the most senior judge in England and Wales, calling for an urgent review . of sentencing for youths carrying knives. He said it was a 'major . problem' among 12 to 14-year-olds. The country's top judge, Lord Chief Justice Sir John Thomas, told peers an urgent review of sentencing for youths carrying knives was needed . But Mr Clegg wrote that the proposed legislation might not work in practice. He said: 'When someone is caught carrying a knife, we need to do something about it. But six months in prison is not always the right answer. 'Imagine a vulnerable young girl hanging around with members of a gang. 'She could be forced into carrying a knife by another gang member; it happens a lot. When stopped by the police, she doesn't mention that she was forced to carry the knife, fearing retribution from the gang. 'Putting someone like that into prison could push them into the arms of hardened criminals, and let the gang leaders off the hook. Instead of prison, we need to divert vulnerable young people away from gang culture.' He called for decisions on sentencing to be left to judges so as not to undermine the justice system, saying: ""This is why I believe this proposed law would be a step backwards. 'It would undermine the government's progress in establishing a rehabilitation revolution and reducing crime. We need to treat knife crime very seriously by letting judges choose the sentence to fit the crime. 'Turning the young offenders of today into the hardened criminals of tomorrow is not the answer.'","Radio phone-in caller attacks Deputy PM for vetoing knife crime jail threat .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Same-sex couples can now create their own coat of arms. For centuries, married couples have been designing shared shields that combine their family histories in one heraldic symbol. But the strict rules of the ancient body meant civil partners could not qualify. Qualified: Sir Elton John, believed to be marrying his civil partner David Furnish this month, currently holds an 'escutcheon', or shield, featuring a keyboard, records and a satyr playing pan pipes. Once married, the couple could apply to 'impale' his with a design created for Mr Furnish, according to the newly-revealed College of Arms rules . Now, a month on from the first ever same-sex marriage, the College of Arms has revealed gay and lesbian married couples can be welcomed into the tradition. Sir Elton John, who is believed to be . marrying his civil partner David Furnish in a private ceremony this month, . currently holds an 'escutcheon', or shield, featuring a keyboard, records and a satyr . playing pan pipes. If Mr Furnish applies to join the College, the couple will be able to have a shared design fashioned once they are married. A shared shield is traditionally split vertically, with the husband's design on one side and the wife's on the other. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, 'impaled' her shield (left) with that of her husband, Prince Charles. It features her family's symbol of a boar's head, as well as her husband's motto 'Ich Dien', which means 'I serve', and a royal crown. Charles's (right) holds a number of features of the royal coat of arms, including the Royal motto . The Royal coat of arms represents all parts of the United Kingdom, and it is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ('Evil to him who evil thinks') Men have always been able to maintain their own without changing it, but brides have been obliged to commission a redesign that gives a nod to their husband's stature. Today, the College ruled men and women who contract a same-sex marriage can 'impale' the arms of their husband or wife with their own on a shield or banner. Coats of Arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use, taking up responsibility for the control of their use. Over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society. The College of Arms, a branch of the Royal household, is the official body in the UK that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues. The arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms. However, that doesn't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms. The cumulative knowledge of the Earl Marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people don't proceed with their application. The late Peter Gwynn-Jones, a former Garter King of Arms, once said: 'In practice, eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission, a sound university degree or professional qualification, or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole.' If their spouse dies, the bearer can continue to wear the joint emblem, the ruling added. And in a landmark amendment, women are now free to choose whether or not their coat of arms features their spouse at all. With a strict set of criteria, initially drawn up by Richard III in 1434, applicants must be of 'eminence or good standing in national or local life' to get one. Honours from the crown, military commissions, university degrees and professional qualifications are taken into account. Those who are descended from awardees automatically qualify. Clare Balding OBE, who went to Cambridge . University, is eligible for an escutcheon - and could apply for a shared . emblem if she were to marry civil partner Alice Arnold. Each design must be unique and have at least two 'linear differences' so that it can be distinct if shown in black and white. It costs £5,250 to design a coat of arms for a man; £3,750 for a woman. As a family has legal ownership of its coat of arms, a case could technically be brought in the Court of Chivalry if designs were too similar or if someone used another person's heraldry. No such action has been taken since 1954 when Manchester Corporation successfully sued the Manchester Palace of Varieties for using its coat of arms. Ahead of her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton designed her own family coat of arms, to be impaled with his. Although Kate's ancestors include coal miners and carpenters, she was welcomed by the College. The grant was made to Kate's father Michael Middleton because the coat of arms is passed down the male line. This allows Kate's siblings to use the design. Seeking advice from Downton Abbey's etiquette coach Alastair Bruce, her mother Carole Middleton settled on a design that reflected their Englishness, as well as their love of skiing. The design features three acorns to reflect oak trees in their family village of Bucklebury, as well as strength and Englishness. The chevrons are symbols of mountains, as the family are all keen skiiers. William’s design is a version of the Royal Coat of Arms which was granted to him by the Queen on his 18th birthday. It shows the various royal emblems of the United Kingdom: the three lions of England, the lion of Scotland and the harp of Ireland. It is surrounded by a blue garter bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense – Shame to those who think evil of it – which symbolises the Order of the Garter of which he is a Knight Companion. Both shields are supported by the Duke of Cambridge’s ‘supporters’ – a royal lion and unicorn, each wearing a three pointed collar, known as a label. Following their 2011 wedding, the Duke and Duchess had a shared escutcheon fashioned. The label has a red scallop shell derived from the Spencer coat of arms, which has been used by the ancestors of Princess Diana for centuries. Flowing out from the top of the . Conjugal Coat of Arms is ‘mantling’, which represents the slashed cloth . hung around the necks of knights fighting in the heat of the Middle East . during the Crusades. Timothy . Duke, of the College of Arms, said: ‘Any married couple who are both . entitled to arms are entitled to combine them in a  Conjugal Coat of . Arms. Duke and Duchess: Prince William and Kate Middleton had their shields impaled following their 2011 wedding to reflect their families' histories . Kate Middleton's family had to have a coat of arms designed especially for the union, which was then featured on the programme for the Royal wedding . The Middleton's design, unveiled (left) by Senior Herald Thomas Woodcock, features acorns representing Englishness and the oak trees in their village of Bucklebury. The chevrons that reflect mountains in a nod to the family's love of skiing. Bestowed to her father, it means the coat of arms can be passed down for the whole family to use . Herald painter Robert Parsons sketches a coat of arms for the Middleton. Each design must have two linear differences so it scan be distinct in black and white . ‘There are . different rules and conventions as to how this works, depending on who . the individual is, but as the Duke of Cambridge is a Knight of the Order . of the Garter his is encircled by the blue garter bearing its motto. ‘As . his wife is not, a wreath was made to balance hers out decoratively. Obviously that will change if she, in the future, is made a member . herself.’ The Royal coat of arms has evolved over many years and reflects the history of the Monarchy and of the country. In the design the shield shows the various Royal emblems of different parts of the United Kingdom: the three lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the lion of Scotland in the second and the harp of Ireland in the third. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow had a coat of arms designed to reflect his work to champion gay rights, including a rainbow-edged scroll and pink triangles . It is surrounded by a garter bearing the motto Honi soit qui mal y pense ('Evil to him who evil thinks'), which symbolises the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of knighthood of which the Queen is Sovereign. The shield is supported by the English lion and Scottish unicorn and is surmounted by the Royal crown. Below it appears the motto of the Sovereign, Dieu et mon droit ('God and my right'). The plant badges of the United Kingdom - rose, thistle and shamrock - are often displayed beneath the shield. It is customary for individuals to develop their coat of arms to reflect their life and work over time. John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, unveiled his in 2011, which reflects the work he has done to champion gay rights. Bearing the motto 'All Are Equal', it is embellished with pink triangles and a rainbow-coloured scroll.","College of Arms revealed same-sex couples can 'impale' their shields to create one heraldic symbol .

"By . Maggie Harbour . Tori Spelling has been told she needs to have major spinal surgery but she is stubbornly refusing to have the operation because she fears if she does, her life will spiral out of control more than it already has! The 41-year-old actress has been suffering from a painful cervical spine condition and needs surgery, but she refuses to go under the knife, fearing that if she’s out of commission, her already troubled marriage to Dean McDermott, 47, will take an even bigger hit. 'Tori has two disintegrated discs in her neck that have been causing her extreme pain,' confides the source. Scroll down for video . Worryingly thin: Tori's (pictured in LA last month) shrinking frame has been closely scrutinized over the years, despite the star having denied she is anorexic in the past . Reality check:  Dean McDermott breaks down on True Tori, as he confesses to his wife during their therapy session that their lovemaking was a let down. But behind the scenes they're facing a more critical problem: Tori won't even let Dean talk to her about having the surgery she needs . Although doctors are telling her she risks doing permanent damage if she doesn’t have the surgery, she feels she can’t put her family and her responsibilities on the back burner long enough to have the operation.' Last month when Tori spent eight days in an LA hospital, her people said it was because of migraine headaches.  And while it’s true she does suffer from debilitating headaches – it’s because of the diseased discs in her neck. 'The pain is so bad she has to take pain medication,' says the source. 'But the longer she takes it, the more meds she has to consume in order to ease the pain. It’s a vicious circle.' The source adds that Tori feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and to take time off to have surgery, and recover - which could take weeks - means she won’t be able to attend to everything she currently has on her plate. 'Tori feels a lot of pressure to bring money in right now,' says the source. 'She and Dean have been struggling and she knows how important it is for her to keep doing her True Tori reality series, and the new Mystery Girls sit - com she and her old friend Jennie Garth are doing for ABC’s Family Chanel. Pressure: Tori is afraid that if she spends a week in the hospital, leaving Dean home alone with the four kids, he won't be able to handle it. He's already showing signs of stress . 'Tori believes ratings for her reality series would suffer if the story line is forced to center around her hospitalization and recovery, and she knows she has to keep working if the bills are going to get paid.' Then of course, there's the fact that she’s desperate to repair her troubled marriage. 'Tori and Dean have been working hard on trying to put their marriage back on track after he admitted to cheating,' says the source.'She is still very much in love with her husband and is willing to do anything she can to put the pieces back together. 'She is afraid that if she spends a week in the hospital, leaving him home alone with the four kids, he won’t be able to handle it. Kid trouble: To add to Tori's woes, she and Dean learned that their six-year-old daughter Stella, who suffered a broken leg a few months back, must now undergo a tonsillectomy . 'She also knows that having the operation means she will have to be in bed recovering for a few weeks, putting even more stress and strain on the family and she’s just not willing to do that.' Dean wants her to take care of herself, but Tori told him not to even bring it up again right now. He is worried about her and feels her painful condition complicates their relationship. But she is so afraid if she drops the ball on all she has to do right now, they will have no chance. If what is going on the their reality show is any indication of Dean's mental state, he is falling apart. Tori doesn't want to add any stress to their lives. by taking herself out of commission, say the source. While Tori does worry about her health, her priority is her kids and she and Dean just received word their six year old daughter Stella, who suffered a broken leg a few months back, must now undergo a tonsillectomy. “Tori knows that Stella will be traumatized by having her tonsils out and she feels she has to be there for her little girl. And it’s just like Tori to put her family’s needs ahead of her own – because all her life, she’s had to be the one who takes care of everyone one else.” According to another source, Tori basically grew up looking after herself and her younger brother Randy. Tori and Randy – who is five years her junior – lived a lonely life in their 57,000 square. foot, $85 million mansion in LA’s posh Holmby Hills. Their father, producer Aaron Spelling, was already in his 50’s when the kids were born, and their mother Candy was always involved with charity work and her various hobbies. A house divided: Tori grew up looking after her younger brother Randy (right). Their father, famed producer Aaron Spelling was preoccupied and mother Candy involved in  charities and hobbies. The kids lived in a different wing of the house and had to fend for themselves, calling on a cook to bring them a meal or call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question. Tori wants to be a  a hands-on parent . Poor little rich girl: Tori grew up in this palatial 57,000 square foot home in Holmby Hills that Candy recently sold to Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone . Says a family source, 'The family of four lived in the largest house in Beverly Hills, boasting 123 rooms and I remember the kids saying it was like being orphaned living in the big house because while their parents lived in one wing, they were assigned another.' The kids said that although they were the envy of all their friends, living in a house with a pool, a tennis court, a home theater and a bowling alley, the house felt cold.  They also felt so alone that they would often have to fend for themselves, calling on a cook to bring them a meal or having to call their parents on the house phone if they wanted to ask them a question. 'Tori was like a protective little mother to Randy,' says the source. 'And she was always watching out for him.  And to this day, she tends to put her own needs aside in order to care for her family, even if it means risking her health in order to make sure everyone else in the family is well looked after.'","Today is Tory Spelling and Dean McDermott's eighth wedding anniversary, but there's little cause for celebration .
Besides agonizing over her troubled marriage, Tori has learned that she has two disintegrated disks in her neck and needs to undergo major surgery .
The reality star is so afraid that spending weeks in the hospital and then recuperating from the operation will put too much stress on Dean - and their relationship .
And now the couple have learned that little Stella needs an operation too - she needs to have her tonsils taken out ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Just one in 10 mums think politicians have their best interests at heart, a damning report revealed today. The Asda Mumdex survey of 11,000 of the supermarket’s customers reveals many think MPs do not speak like normal people and almost three-quarters think political party’s policies are too male-centric. Tory employment minister Esther McVey admitted some politicians use ‘fancy language’ to hide what they really mean from voters. In Scotland and Wales one in five mums say they feel alienated by politics, rising to 30 per cent in Northern Ireland . More than 80 per cent of those surveyed by Asda say they plan to vote in 2015, but just 2 per cent feel they are represented in the system . Supermarket giant Asda published its latest Mumdex with a year to go until the general election to put pressure on all parties to address the concerns of its customers. In a major boost for Labour leader Ed Miliband, it shows 65 per cent of mums want action to impose limits on energy prices. Labour has promised to freeze bills for two years if it wins the election in May 2015. Almost half of those surveyed back the Lib Dem policy to increase the personal tax allowance, to cut income tax bills, while 42 per cent want improves rights for working families. Almost three-quarters want the government to focus on solving the cost of living crisis, a key Labour party slogan. More than half of those questioned said MPs do not understand the financial pressures they face. Two thirds of mums said they wanted action on energy bills, a key promise made by Labour's Ed Miliband . 73 per cent want more 'honesty' from politicians about what they can realistically achieve . While a third of mums agree that UK politicians look out for the UK’s best interests, only one in 10 agrees ‘they have my best interests at heart’, the report said. Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said: ‘Mums play such an important role. They are cogs in society but their role and their value just seems to be ignored.’ Speaking at the launch of the report in Parliament, Storm Townend, from Wakefield, said: ‘Politicians have lost touch with people. They use a lot of language and jargon that every day people don’t necessarily understand. ‘It essentially means nothing. I would like them to break the jargon down,’ the mother-of-one said. In response, Tory minister Miss McVey admitted that many politicians use obscure language to ‘disguise’ what they really mean. The former TV presenter from Merseyside said: ‘We do have to listen. Sometimes fancy language in a fancy way could be because you’re trying to disguise something or could it be that you don’t quite understand it yourself? ‘I think understanding that basic language really is key and explaining to people.’","Survey of 11,000 mums who shop at Asda sets out political priorities .

"By . Richard Spillett . Britain has been warned to batten down the hatches with high winds and torrential rain set to sweep across the country over the next few days. Forecasters are predicting around 10mm of rain could fall in an hour in parts of the south and west today, tomorrow and into the weekend. Gusts will reach around 50mph along the south coast over the next two days as a series of banks of cloud move in from the Atlantic. Gusts of up to 50mph are expected to hit the south coast today, tomorrow and into the weekend . Forecaster Leon Brown, from The Weather Channel, told the Daily Express the end of the week and start of the weekend would see a lot of wet weather. He said: 'It will be quite windy over southern coasts with strong winds and husts up to 50mph. 'More scattered and thundery showers are expected for central and northern Britain.' Flood alerts have been issued as forecasters warn showers could dump up 10mm an hour in some parts . The Environment Agency has issued 13 flood alerts in the south east in areas of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire. The Met Office has not issued any severe weather warnings but says it is expecting an unsettled weekend with a risk of gales and rain in all areas.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A disgraced headteacher who spent more than £30,000 of public funds on extravagant parties and hotel rooms - including a £7,000 bill for her 50th birthday party - could be banned from the classroom for life. Jo Shuter claimed on school expenses for fancy meals, unexplained taxi rides and overnight conferences at plush hotels while she was in charge of Quintin Kynaston Academy School in Marlborough Hill, north London. The teacher - who was named headteacher of the year in 2007 - resigned from her post last year while the government launched a probe into her 'inappropriate' use of school funds. Jo Shuter could be given a lifetime ban on teaching children unsupervised after claiming tens of thousands of pounds on school expenses . Now a National College for Teaching . and Leadership panel is deciding whether to ban Shuter from teaching unsupervised for life, after she pleaded guilty to . unacceptable professional conduct. The hearing, taking place this week in Coventry, follows the investigation last year by the Department for Education, which found Shuter had used school funds for 'inappropriate purposes' - including her £6,957 birthday bash. The staggering bill included money spent on catering, alcohol, food, party lights and 'landscaping' - as well as extra pay for the staff's time. That money was not paid back for more than a year. The teacher - who was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to teaching -  also claimed on expenses for posh dinners, personal taxi rides and nearly £3,500 in flowers. Under her expenses, Shuter also paid £4,410 for an event at the five-star Landmark hotel, as well as £8,269 for an overnight stay at the Grove Hotel, Hertfordshire. She also charged her and her children's mobile phone bills back to the school and used the school’s account to spend £1579 on chairs - which were delivered to her home. Shuter, who has previously been named as headteacher of the year, resigned from her post at The Quintin Kynaston school after her string of false expenses claims came to light . The teacher, shown here collecting a CBE from Queen Elizabeth II in 2010 for her services to education, is facing a National College for Teaching and Leadership panel hearing. The panel has to decide whether to give Shuter a classroom ban after she admitted unacceptable professional conduct . The report, published last year, also raised 'a number of issues relating to the employment of family members'. Westminster Council, which ran the school until 2008, referred Shuter to the regulatory body because it said the matter was 'too serious' not to take it further. She later resigned. But just months later, Shuter - who was . earning at least £170,000 in her previous post - landed herself another . high-flying job at King Solomon High School in Barkingside, Essex, where . she is still headteacher. Shuter resigned from her post when the expenses allegations came to light but landed a job at the helm of another school in Essex last September . An investigation by the Department for Education last year found Shuter had used the school funds for 'inappropriate purposes' Andrew Christie, director of children’s services at Westminster Council, said: 'Following the governors’ investigation and the report by the Department for Education, we felt that this matter was too serious not to take it any further.' He added: 'We referred this case to the National College for Teaching and Leadership, the responsible professional body, for an independent review and to determine if further action could or should be taken. 'We expect very high standards from teachers and headteachers in Westminster. 'We also believe we have a duty of care for standards in the teaching profession as a whole, and will always do what we can to uphold these standards.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'This case has been before a National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel. A decision will be taken shortly.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said an allegation of fraud and false accounting at the school was reported to the force in September 2012. He said no arrests had been made but that police continued to investigate the allegations. The panel is expected to make a decision on Shuter's future later this week.","Jo Shuter resigned as headteacher from Quintin Kynaston school, London .

The 84-year-old appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court today, accompanied by his wife Alwen, who looked on from the public gallery with other family members as he sat in the glass-walled dock . A panel of 12, made up of six men and six women, along with three extras, two men and one woman, were chosen from a pool of more than 20 potential members. Harris stood at the front of the dock as the process took place, and the indictment was read out.Mr Justice Sweeney told the jurors: 'I am the judge of the law, likewise you are the judges of the facts. 'As judge of the law, I have various duties to manage the conduct of the trial, to see fair play and to rule, typically in your absence, on any legal argument and in due course to sum the case up to you, directing you on the law that you will have to apply.

A panel of 12, made up of six men and six women, along with three extras, two men and one woman, were chosen from a pool of more than 20 potential members . Count 1 - indecent assault of a girl aged seven or eight on an occasion between January 1968 and January 1970 . Count 2 - the same offence on a girl aged 14 between January 1975 and January 1976 . Counts 3 and 4 - the same offence on a girl aged 12 to 15 between December 1978 and April 1981 . Count 5 - indecent assault of a girl aged 14 to 15 between the same dates .

Counts 10 to 12 - the same offence on a girl aged 14 on May 31 1986 . The former television presenter denies all the counts. 'As judges of the facts, your duty, pooling your common sense and experience of life, is to assess the witnesses and the other evidence that is put before you in the trial, and in due course to decide the relevant facts and thereby, having applied my directions of law, to reach a verdict according to the evidence. 'A number of duties follow from your role as judges of the facts. It's your duty to try the case on the evidence. The evidence is the evidence that you hear in this courtroom and nothing else.' He said jurors have duties, including not allowing themselves to be influenced 'by any external matter', including media coverage. They should not discuss the case with anyone else, should not post entries on social networking sites about the trial, and should not try to research the case themselves. Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims, the youngest of whom was seven or eight and the oldest 19, between 1968 and 1986, which he denies. The clerk of the court read the indictment to the jury, going through the 12 counts as Harris stood in the dock.

Mr Justice Sweeney told the three extra jurors that they will sit in court for the beginning of the trial in case any issues arise with the 12 who were sworn in. He said: 'Sometimes in a case of some size, like this one, during the course of the prosecution opening of the case when the detail is gone through more with the jury, a juror can sometimes realise that they know someone who is mentioned or that something else has arisen that really means they should not be sitting on the jury. 'Because it is so strongly preferable that the trial should have 12 jurors rather than any lesser number, that almost inevitably means that the whole jury has to be discharged before the whole thing starts again. If you do not have spare jurors... that would mean that you would need to go through the whole process that you've gone through over the past few days again; obviously that would be an unfortunate waste of time and money. The spare jurors are here in case that happens.' The jurors were sent away until tomorrow, when it is expected that the prosecution case will open.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . More than 100,000 mothers would return to work under Labour's plan to cut child care costs, the party has claimed. Shadow children's minister Lucy Powell said Ed Miliband's proposal to extend free childcare would allow squeezed families to take on more hours. Under Labour's proposals working parents with three or four-year-olds will get an extra 10 hours of free childcare a week. Childcare costs are soaring - leaving many parents unable to return to work, even if they want to . This will help ease crippling childcare costs for half a million youngsters, Miss Powell said. Labour will also give parents new legal rights to get early evening childcare at their primary school. Miss Powell said the proposals would allow 135,000 mothers go back to work or take on extra hours. She pointed to international figures showing that Britain lagged behind much of Europe in helping mothers go back to work. Seven out of 10 mothers now have paid jobs in the UK - but this is considerably below top performers Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands where 80 per cent are in work. Shadow childcare minister  Lucy Powell said more needed to be done to get women to return to work . Miss Powell claims that if affordable childcare was available the gap between the UK and the top performers could be closed. This would mean the number of mothers in work or taking on more hours would increase by 135,000, she said. She said: 'Childcare is a big part of David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis. 'Families have been hit hard by the soaring cost of childcare which is up 30 per cent since 2010 – five times faster than wages. 'At the same time, there are fewer childcare places available and families have seen the support they relied on to help make childcare affordable has been reduced. 'Hardworking families will be better off with Labour. 'We understand that increased help with childcare is good for the economy and for families. 'Our plans to extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents with three and four-year-olds will make a real difference and help thousands of mums shut out of the labour market or prevented from working the hours they want by high childcare costs. 'Worth £1,500 per child and paid for by an increase in the bank levy, Labour's plans will help tackle the cost of living crisis and make work pay.' Families have seen childcare costs rocket 30 per cent since 2010. Labour say over the same period real wages have fallen by £1,600. Women earn most before they turn 40, according to the Office for National Statistics. Their pay peaks in the 30-39 age group at £533-a-week or £27,726-a-year. However, men continue to see another 10 years of wage rises, peaking in the 40-49 age group at £638-a-week or £33,176.","Ed Miliband's party plans to hand parents an extra 10 hours free childcare .

Robert Edmund Sangster was born in 1936, in Liverpool and was the son of Vernon Sangster, who started the Vernons Pools business in 1926 with £400  - in 1988 his son sold the Vernons Pools empire for £90 million. After entering the world of horse racing at 28, Sangster changed the face of thoroughbred racing in the Seventies, going on to win the Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe twice. He helped create a global bloodstock brand with the Coolmore Stud and at the height of his success he had around 1,000 horses at stud and in training across the world. His famous blue, green and white silks won more than 100 Group One races, including two Derbies with The Minstrel (1977) and Golden Fleece (1982).

He also had a colourful private life and was married three times. He dated a string of beautiful women including supermodel Jerry Hall in 1982 and author Tara Moss, and later married Melbourne socialite Susan Renouf. His 15-year marriage to Susan, his third wife, was often the subject of gossip columns and Sangster was known for lavishing gifts on his wife. When Susan admitted she couldn’t cook, he bought her a restaurant. When she divorced him in 2000 she received a settlement of £15 million - Sangster's wealth was believed to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds. He had five sons and a daughter from his three marriages. The flamboyant horse racing magnate died aged 67 after a long battle with cancer in 2004 - he spent most of his latter years in Australia and Barbados.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A book which is more than 320 years old written by an artist detailing every colour imaginable has come to light. The artist, only known as A. Boogert, created the 800 page guide, which was written in Dutch in 1692 with instructions on how to mix watercolours. He begins each chapter with a guide about how to use the colour when painting before explaining how to create certain shades by adding water. The book is entitled Traité des couleurs servant à la peinture à l'eau, and is thought to be the most comprehensive colour guide of its time . More than 270 years before the Pantone Colour Guide, the artist known only as A. Boogert created the book detailing every colour imaginable . Each chapter begins with a guide on how to use the colour when painting before explaining how to create certain shades using just water . This is done through hand painted illustrations of different coloured swatches. The completely handwritten and hand painted pages of ‘Traité des couleurs servant à la peinture à l’eau' was probably the most comprehensive guide to painting and colour of its time. The modern equivalent of the book, the Pantone Colour Guide, wasn’t published until 1963, with medieval book historian Erik Kwakkel believing the 17th Century guide has rarely been viewed. The book is completely hand written in Dutch and is 800 pages long. It is thought it was intended to be an educational guide .

"By . Becky Barrow . More than 12,000 retired public sector workers enjoy pensions worth 'in excess of £50,000 a year', a report reveals today. Of those, nearly 150 have retired on incomes worth more than £100,000 a year. The research lays bare the pensions enjoyed by high-earning members of the state sector  workforce – dubbed Britain's 'pensions aristocracy'. The study also claims that the true cost of pension promises made to current public sector workers is a massive £1,700billion – around £600billion higher than the Government's own estimate. A report has laid bare the pensions enjoyed by high-earning members of the state sector  workforce . It is the equivalent of an extra £35,000 bill for every tax-paying household in the country with occupants below retirement age. The report was written by former Bank of England economist Neil Record, and compiled by the Intergenerational Foundation, a Left-leaning think tank that examines fairness between the generations. Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Foundation, said: 'The relationship between those making these promises today and those who will pay later is one-sided.' He warns the bill for pensions, which he warned is 'an enormous Ponzi scheme', will be 'paid for in the future largely by our children and grandchildren.' This is because there is no  precise pot of money set aside for the majority of public sector workers' pensions, such as those in the NHS, teachers and civil service. Instead, it relies on new workers joining the State workforce and  paying into their pension to help pay the retirement benefits of those who have retired. The report was compiled by former Bank of England economist, now a multimillionaire, Neil Record . Retired state workers are 'rewarding . themselves huge pensions with scant regard to the interests of their . younger colleagues, many of whom will be funding their older colleagues' pensions until 2050,' according to the report. Mr . Record added: 'Rewarding an older generation at the hidden and . unrecognised expense of a younger generation until it is too late is . morally indefensible.' To . get a pension worth £100,000 a year, a private sector worker would need . to build a pension pot of around £2.8million, assuming he or she wants . to retire at the age of 65  and have a pension which increases with . inflation every year and passes to their spouse if they die first. Laith Khalaf, head of corporate research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Few people could ever dream of having a pension of this size.' By comparison, the average  pension pot is worth just £35,000, and pays out only £1,200 a year. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group, said: 'The scale of the public sector pension liability is enormous, much scarier than the Government lets on. 'The situation has rapidly deteriorated over the last decade and will only get worse with an ageing population, meaning our debt mountain will continue to grow.' Since 1997, the number of private sector workers with a 'defined benefit' pension has collapsed from 4.9million to just 1.7million today, according to the Office for National Statistics. A 'defined benefit' pension is one which guarantees to pay a certain pension to a worker when he or she retires, such as a final salary pension or a career average pension. The Coalition has also dramatically clamped down on public sector pensions. As a result, workers must pay more into their pension and retire at a later age – but still enjoy far more generous pensions than the majority of private sector employees. A Treasury spokesman said: 'The Government's reforms to public service pensions will save £430billion over the next 50 years and ensure they are affordable and sustainable in the long-term. 'Reformed public service pensions will remain among the very best available, whilst rebalancing the costs more fairly between employees, employers and the taxpayer.'","Study claims the true cost of pension promises is a massive £1,700bn .

"By . Steph Cockroft . This is the incredible moment that a mystery group of parachutists launched themselves off the top of a church spire - and landed in a market place just 210ft below. The five daredevils, some of whom came from as far as Wales, jumped from the spire at Newark Parish Church, Nottinghamshire, after weeks of planning the elaborate stunt. And the jumpers - who have all been . jumping for at least five years - even used cameras to film the scene as they plunged down to the square below in the middle of the night. Scroll down for video . A mystery group of parachutists launched themselves from the Newark church spire in Nottinghamshire - which is just 200ft high - and landed in a tiny market place . This sort of jump is known as a base jump, which involves jumping from a standing object, rather than from an aircraft. The acronym stands for building, antenna, span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap. As with the more traditional jumps, the participant uses a parachute to break their fall. Police have criticised the 'dangerous' jump and have now launched an investigation. But one of the . parachutists, who did not want to give his name, said the group spent two . weeks analysing the area to ensure they jumped at a safe time. He said: 'This was BASE jumping at its most difficult because the height was very low and it was very technical. The five jumpers said they spent two weeks analysing the town, including what time the pubs closed, to ensure the jump took place at the safest time . The jumpers filmed the move - which took place in the middle of the night - on hand-held and helmet-mounted cameras . One of the jumpers, who has not been named, said the view from the top of the spire, looking down onto the market place, was 'fantastic' The 200ft jump was said to be on the of most technical BASE jumps - which involves jumping off a static object - because of the low height of the spire . The phrase BASE jumping was coined by a filmmaker Carl Boenish - often seen as the father of BASE jumping - in 1978, when he filmed himself doing a jump in Yosemite National Park, America. The acronym stands for building, antenna, span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap. Once a person has made a jump from each of the four categories, they can apply to have a BASE jump number, which are awarded in sequence. The first people to be awarded a BASE number were Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield, who jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981. As of March 2014, more than 1,700 BASE numbers have been issues. The world record for the highest BASE jump was recorded in April this year. Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet jumped 2,717ft from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Other people had previously jumped from the building, but the duo jumped from a 500m platform to enable them to break the record. BASE competitions, where the jumps are based on landing accuracy, have been held since the early 1980s. The heights of the jumps vary between competitions, but a recent competition involved participants jumping from the 1,483ft high Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 'We’ve all been jumping for five or more years. We all come from . experienced skydive backgrounds and lots of us also having climbing or . mountaineering experience. 'We . spent two weeks visiting, studying the movements of the town centre . itself, what times the pubs closed, wind directions and studying . turbulence around the tower.' With the spire just 210ft from the ground, the parachutists had very little time to . erect their parachute - making it an extremely challenging jump. But the unnamed man said the jumpers were determined to complete the stunt because the spire is 'unique'. So . when they heard the spire was surrounded by scaffolding, as part of . work being done to replace a weather vane, they decided to start . arranging the jump. The . man said: 'We have military laser range-finding equipment so we know . how high something is and the distance we’ve got to fly to get to . safety. 'It does . get very scientific and it takes hours and hours of planning. We were . mindful not to do any damage to the fabric of the church. 'We are the first people ever to do it . and for us that was part of the attraction because it was a unique . object to jump from. It was spectacular up there and the view of the . town was fantastic.' Inspector Andy Gan, from Newark police, said the force had received calls about people being seen parachuting near the church. He said: 'Obviously this is very dangerous and we strongly advise people not to do it. 'It’s also trespassing on church property, which is potentially going to cause damage to the church. The jumpers say they are the first people to complete the jump. They said they wanted to jump from the spire because it is a 'unique object' The parachutists were seen landed in the market square directly below the spire. It is one of the most technically-difficult BASE jumps, according to one of the team . BASE jumping, regarded by many as an extreme sport, involves participants leaping from a fixed object, rather than planes. It stands for building, atenna, span and earth, indicating the four places from which the person can jump . 'It’s . likely those who have done this are very experienced and if people think . they can do something similar and come away unharmed that’s very . unlikely. 'People shouldn’t try this. It is dangerous and could result in serious injury.' According to an online ‘BASE fatality list’, 228 people have died doing base jumping since 1981. Churchwarden Mike Pollard said: ‘It’s disappointing they have trespassed on church property. 'Although they haven’t done any harm, it could encourage others to climb the scaffolding. We are obviously concerned and not very happy about it.' Work is now being carried out to make the scaffolding more secure, he said.","Group jumped from a parish church spire in Newark, Nottinghamshire .

"By . Damien Gayle . Flicking a peace sign is said to be the most-popular photo pose among the youth of east Asia, so it's no wonder this stone Buddha statue in China has gained huge popularity. The 24ft-tall Amita Buddha, located in the 104th cave of the famous Longmen Grottoes in Henan Province, appears to be posing with two fingers raised. It is one of an estimated 100,000 statues of the Buddha and his disciples carved into the living rock of the 1,400 caves at Longmen, which date back nearly 2,000 years. Pass the incense, man: This ancient stone Buddha has gained new popularity thanks to it's 'peace' gesture . That would make is far older than the peace sign, which was first popularised as 'V for victory' in Europe during the Second World War, but then reversed in meaning by the peace movement in the U.S. during the 1960s. At the same time as President Richard Nixon was flashing the gesture to prematurely claim victory in the Vietnam war, protesters flicked it palm out to call for an end to the conflict. It is said to have spread in Asia during the post-War allied occupation of Japan, and from there, through cultural dissemination, across the rest of east Asia. Nowadays, youths from South Korea to Communist China, and further afield, make the gesture as an almost instinctive reaction to finding themselves in the sights of a photographer. Counter-culture: An anti-Vietnam war protester makes the 'peace' sign as he is arrested at a demo in 1971 . Ahead of its time: Disappointingly, this 2,000-year-old Buddha statue's gesture is said to be purely a coincidence. Rex Features reports that its hand signal is the result of damage caused over the centuries . The Amita Buddha was built during the reign of Li Zhi, also known as Emperor Gaozong of Tang, who ruled northern China between AD 650 and 683. By the time he took to the throne, excavations of the man-made caves at Longmen was well underway as a flourishing of Chinese Buddhism led to a proliferation of devotional art. Many of the stone Buddhas of Longmen are portrayed with their hands in a number of stylised gestures, known as Mudras, which have different meanings in and of themselves and in combination with others. Disappointingly, this statue's gesture is said to be purely a coincidence. Rex Features reports that its hand signal is the result of damage caused over the centuries.","The Amita Buddha is one of 100,000 statues in the Longmen Grottoes .

But now there’s a mini tree that promises to charge your smartphone and can even be used as a light. The Electree Mini has solar panel 'leaves' to transform the light it absorbs into energy that can be used to charge a range of USB-connected devices as well as batteries. Scroll down for video . The mini power plant: The Electree (pictured) contains solar panels to transform the light it absorbs into energy that can be used to charge a range of USB-connected devices such as smart watches (pictured) and smartphones . The 'plant' is made from recycled plastic and contains no glue. It has nine solar panel 'leaves' that can be swivelled to face the sun. They transform light into energy that can be stored in batteries and used to power USB devices. A version of the tree enables it to be turned into a colour changing lantern. The Electree Mini will come in kit form and can be dismantled easily. Its design was inspired by bonsai trees and patterns in nature. It is available to pre-order from €199 (£164) via Indiegogo. The device has nine solar cells which can be swivelled on the ‘potplant’s’ plastic branches to get maximum exposure in the sunlight. Vivien Muller, the French designer behind the concept was inspired by bonsai trees and patterns found in nature when designing the device, which is now at crowd-funding stage. He intended it to provide solar-derived power to environments without electricity and after several prototypes over two years is close to bringing his idea to the public. The device comes in different versions: the basic Electree Mini, which recharges three AA or AAA batteries that people can use to power appliances; Electree LED, which turns the solar tree into a colour changing lantern and Electree USB, which will allow people in sunny countries to recharge their smartphones and smart watches every day.

"By . Dan Bloom . As an English country manor in the centre of Washington, it has been at the heart of diplomatic relations between Britain and the U.S. since the 1920s. For 80 years a visit to the grand, sweeping ballroom of the British ambassador's residence has become the ultimate statement of power and style. Yards from the official residence of the Vice President, the building has played host to figures from Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher to Elizabeth Taylor and the Beatles. Now the building - the only one in North America by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall and the Midland Bank building in Manchester - has been paid lavish tribute in the first book of its kind. An Englishman's home: A butler carries an urn of tea outside the main entrance to the ambassador's residence in Washington. Despite its scale, some inhabitants complained about the dark entrance . Elegant: In invitation to dine at the British ambassador's residence in Washington is the ultimate symbol of power. A new book explores the history of the English-style manor which helped forge the special relationship . Special guests: As well as political leaders the building has hosted stars of the silver screen such as Elizabeth Taylor, pictured left with her husband Jack Warner meeting Elizabeth II and President Gerald Ford in 1976 . Relationship: Prime Minister Winston Churchill with General George C Marshall at the embassy's door in 1952 . In his study The Architecture of Diplomacy, renowned historian Dr Anthony Seldon tells how the building became a haunt of both nations' brokers of power and popular culture over 80 years. King George VI sipped tea on the terrace with the banker JP Morgan just months before the outbreak of the Second World War, which would cement a permanent alliance between the two nations. Months after the war broke out, he hosted a garden party for 5,000 people which saw a ferocious scramble for tickets and helped to secure America's loyalty in what has been known ever since as the 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Britain. Margaret Thatcher held two dinners in the ballroom for President Reagan, as their world view brought them together in the closest 'special relationship' until the controversial one between George Bush and Tony Blair. The palatial home has remained a powerful symbol of Anglo-American relations despite the original complex becoming too small for the administrative side of the embassy, which moved to a purpose-built centre next-door in the late 1950s. But it was not just a place for British leaders to hold court. Americans took it on as their own too, including Hillary Clinton, who hosted her last dinner as Secretary of State inside its grandiose rooms. Months before war: King George V chatted to the banker JP Morgan on the terrace in June 1939 . Pop stars: Even the Beatles visited the embassy in their prime, attending a charity ball in February 1964 . Special relationship: Margaret Thatcher greets Ronald and Nancy Reagan at the British Embassy in 1981 . Star guests: Steven Spielberg with his wife Kate Capshaw and Michael Douglas with Catherine Zeta Jones . Prime location: The embassy is a stone's throw from the official residence of the Vice President . A redbrick palace with an entrance . like one of a museum, the residence was deliberately designed in the . style of Georgian country manor. It was the first of many diplomatic centres in the road now described as Embassy Row, stretching almost from the White House to the United States Naval Observatory. Set back from the street, it has eight acres of rose gardens, lawns and greenhouses, presided over by a statue of Winston Churchill clutching his trademark cigar. It does have American touches: Lutyens used Indiana limestone and Pennsylvania bricks to show partnership with the U.S., and its enormous scale is a tribute to American style. Those lucky enough to be invited as guests are presided over by an attentive staff, who serve tea in immaculate Royal Doulton china. The building has not always been so popular, however. In his new book Dr Seldon, the headmaster of the famed private school Wellington College, reveals how its first residents bombarded the renowned architect with complaints, partly about the gigantic portico over its entrance. Grand: The ambassador's residence was built like a Georgian manor on a vast scale in the heart of the capital . Leafy: The home is set in eight acres of gardens and is round the corner from the Vice President's residence . Now infamous, the phrase was coined by none other . than Sir Winston Churchill, who gave a speech in the U.S. in the . aftermath of the Second World War. Standing before a crowd in Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, he called for 'a special relationship . between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States', who . can 'work together at the common task as friends and partners'. Since then the message of the speech, which also coined the phrase 'Iron Curtain', has more or less been taken for granted. It . resurged particularly strongly in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher and . Ronald Reagan shared a political view of the world and a strong desire . to end the Cold War. But it has, of course, been strained in the past. When . Harold Wilson refused to send British troops into Vietnam, the . relationship between the two nations was weakened, though it never . broke to due British backbenchers emphasising their support. And when Tony . Blair co-operated with President Bush to send troops into Iraq, the . nature of the relationship took on a new, sinister significance for . millions. Sir Esme Howard, the famed British ambassador to Washington of the 1920s, complained that the dark, imposing doorway 'resembles the entrance to a Tube station or a mortuary chapel', The Times reported. His successor's wife, meanwhile, complained in 1930 that the newly-opened residence was 'overrun' with rats. But despite initial grumblings, the grand home has become a nationally-registered historic building in the U.S. and a cornerstone of what has been termed the 'special relationship'. In a speech to journalists to celebrate the book's release, British ambassador to Washington Sir Peter Westmacott said the building was still something 'really rather special'. 'The reason why this book has been produced is because for [my wife] Susie and me it is such an enormous privilege to live in this extraordinary house. 'Here we were at a time when the British government decided that it needed to make a bold statement about its relationship with Washington and America, recruiting probably the best-known of the British architects at the time to make a very brave and deliberate statement about the relationship. 'Here we are with a house which is built for purpose. 'Iit's not like most of the other great embassies, of which there are a number in this city, which were houses built by someone else for their own purposes and then bought by government. 'It has lots of space and a design which allows us to have lots of people in here.' Power and royalty: Prince Charles and Princess Diana at the embassy in 1985 with George and Barbara Bush .

"By . Dan Bloom . British vets have saved the sight of a blind lemur after conducting a first-of-its-kind operation on the animal to remove cataracts. Keepers at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey first noticed Sam, a four-year-old red-fronted brown lemur, had inflamed eyes in January - and within weeks he had been blinded by cataracts in both eyes. The normally social animal was left unable to interact with his troupe and had to use his memory to navigate round his cage, until he became trapped up a tree and had to be rescued. Scroll down for video . On the operating table: Blind lemur Sam can now see again thanks to pioneering surgery by British vets . Nerves: Animal opthalmologist Claudia Hartley prepares to put the four-year-old lemur under the knife . Full recovery: Sam, a red-fronted brown lemur, can now see again and is mingling with other animals . Distressed keepers called on the help of the British Animal Health Trust (AHT), whose vets have previously saved the sight of elephants, bears, lions and eagles. In the first operation of its kind on a lemur, vets Claudia Hartley and Rachael Grundon flew from the mainland and spent two hours painstakingly removing the cataracts last month. Just six weeks later, Sam has made a remarkable recovery and is once again socialising with other primates at the animal park, including his parents Matz and Millie. Senior keeper Sian Jones said: 'One morning we noticed he had a swollen eye and the pupil was massively dilated. 'We monitored him and sent for help but over the next couple of weeks we were literally watching him going blind, which was very upsetting. Examination: The vets had to put Sam under general anaesthetic to examine his eye so he would remain still . Pioneering: The vets work on the lemur during the surgery six weeks ago, from which he has now recovered . Back to normal: At one point Sam had to be locked in his enclosure after getting stuck up a tree . Endangered: Lemurs are native only to Madagascar and are at increasing risk of extinction through habitat loss . 'He was trying to use his memory to negotiate his way round the cage and eventually he got stuck up a tree, so we had to help him down and lock him in his enclosure to keep him safe.

"By . Snejana Farberov . In Aaron Rose's breathtaking photographs taken in the early 1960s on Coney island, Brooklyn’s famed beach emerges as the ever-egalitarian human melting pot simmering in the sun. From the very beginning, the humble working class resort has been attracting sun worshipers from all walks of life and of every race, creed and color. Between 1961 and 1963, Rose traveled to Coney Island to document life on the beach in all its many facets. His candid snapshots invite the viewer into the world of couples passionately kissing in full view of their neighbors, mothers with their nude children playing in the surf and Rubenesque goddesses reclining on the sand in all their glory. Sea of humanity: Photographer Aaron Rose traveled to Coney Island in Brooklyn more than 50 years ago to capture sun worshipers in their natural habitat . Grand dames of Coney Island: Rose caught a glimpse of this beach-goer on the left who appears to be more interested in her hand of cards than the ocean; the Brooklyn grandmother on the right is clearly not afraid to show off her decolletage . Anatomy lesson: What Rose found most fascinating is the great variety of body types all on display on the beach . It's getting hot in here: The photographer's candid camera captured intimate moments between amorous couples letting loose in the sand . Dare to be different: Unusually tall, muscular, lanky, fat and skinny - Coney Island has attracted everyone like a great big melting pot . Egalitarian: The beach as seen in Rose's pictures is the great equalizer welcoming the young, middle-aged and elderly alike . Supreme self-confidence: No one in Rose's series of photos appears self-conscious or concerned with body image . No one in Rose's series of photos, aptly titled In a World of Their Own, appears self-conscious or concerned with body image. Less-than-pert . behinds, fleshy arms, ample bosoms and rotund bellies squeezed into . bathing suits are all proudly on display in the 50-year-old photographs. In an interview with Museum of the City of New York . where Rose's images go on display for the first time May 9 to August 3, . the photographer explained that he was fascinated by Coney Island's . uniquely uninhibited way of life. 'Where . else could I find the variety of flesh so close and natural?' he said. 'Coney island represented the sea of humanity coming together from so . many parts of the world to worship the sun and the sea.' Ready for their closeup: In order to catch sunbathers off guard, Rose had to move quickly from place to place and be almost invisible . Lost in each other: The scantily clad strangers, like this young couple, appear blissfully unaware that they are being photographed at all . 60s style: Rose's portraits and group photos also allow us to look back on the daring beach fashions from half a century ago . Big beautiful women: Many of the women in the images are distinctly Rubenesque - and inspiring in their approach to body image . Their private beach: Photography critic Vince Aletti has described Rose's Coney Island photographs as intimate portraits of people relaxing as if in the privacy of their own homes . Rose's photos do not shy away from strangers’ most private moments, often in closeup, as they appear blissfully unaware that they are being photographed at all. The artist explained that in order to achieve that effect and allow people to behave naturally around him and his camera, he had to move very quickly and be almost invisible to those around him. Photography critic Vince Aletti has described Rose's Coney Island photographs as remarkably intimate portraits of people relaxing as if in the privacy of their own homes. Nap time: Some of the strangers depicted by Rose were caught snoozing on the beach - a great place for an afternoon catnap . Vintage look: Rose used special chemical processes and color to make his images look like they are radiating heat . The beach as seen in Rose's pictures is a way of life: the great equalizer welcoming the young, middle-aged and elderly. Using special chemical processes and color, Rose’s Burnt-Sienna images seem to radiate pulsating, sweaty summer heat that brings to mind a day at the beach. Like many of the subjects in his portraits, the pictures have a burnished, almost sun-tanned look.","Photographer Aaron rose visited Coney Island between 1961-1963 and took pictures for the series In a World of Their Own .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . South Africans voted in the first 'Born Free' election today, although polls suggest the allure of the ruling African National Congress as the conqueror of apartheid will prevail even among those with no memory of white-minority rule. An estimated one million South Africans who were born after the end of apartheid will be voting in the elections, which are the first since the death of Nelson Mandela in December. Opinion polls suggest there is no doubt about the overall result, with ANC support estimated at around 65 per cent, only a shade lower than the 65.9 per cent it won in the 2009 election that brought President Jacob Zuma to power. Scroll down for video . People power: South Africans queue to vote at a polling station at Crawford College in Lonehill, north of Johannesburg, in the country's first 'born free' election . Queuing for their say: Polling stations opened at 5am BST, with voters waiting in line, many wrapped up against the early morning chill of the southern hemisphere winter .

Polling stations opened at 5am BST, . with voters waiting in line, many wrapped up against the early morning . chill of the southern hemisphere winter. They close at 7pm BST and a firm idea of the outcome should be available by noon tomorrow. The resilience of ANC support has surprised analysts who a year ago were saying it could struggle at the polls as its glorious past recedes into history and voters focus instead on the sluggish economic growth and slew of scandals that have typified Zuma's first term. Africa's most sophisticated economy has struggled to recover from a 2009 recession - its first since the 1994 demise of apartheid - and the ANC's efforts to stimulate growth and tackle 25 percent unemployment have been hampered by powerful unions. South Africa's top anti-graft agency accused Zuma this year of 'benefitting unduly' from a $23million state-funded security upgrade to his private home at Nkandla in rural KwaZulu-Natal province that included a swimming pool and chicken run. His personal approval ratings have dipped since the findings by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. Patient: South African voters queue at a polling station in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg. The outcome of the election is expected by noon on Thursday . Early start: South Africans stand in line against the sunrise to cast their vote at a polling station in Pretoria . Dark moment: South African queue up to vote at a polling station that was burned down overnight, but a tent was erected in the morning in the politically-sensitive mining town of Bekkersdal . But at a news conference this week to . conclude the ANC election campaign, the 72-year-old brushed aside . suggestions the imbroglio was damaging the party. 'I'm . not worried about Nkandla,' Zuma said. 'The people are not worried . about it. I think the people who are worried about it is you guys, the . media, and the opposition.' Besides . being easy fodder for the cartoonists who have revelled in the freedom . of speech enshrined in the post-apartheid constitution, Nkandla has . exposed the gulf between current and former ANC leaders, in particular . Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, who died in . December. It has also become . the rallying cry for those who feel the dominance of the ANC as it . enters its third decade in power has corrupted the soul of the . 102-year-old former liberation movement. Bright start: South Africans wrap up against the early morning chill while queuing to vote in the restive Bekkersdal township . People form a long queue as they wait to cast their votes in an informal settlement in Soweto in an election that is expected to keep President Zuma in power . Braving the chill: People form a long queue to cast their ballot in the township of Barcelona on the outskirts of Cape Town . Choosing her party: A woman leaves a polling station after casting her ballot for the general election at the Qunu Junior Secondary School . 'It is not necessarily the huge sum paid by the public that is the most corrupt aspect of Zuma's palatial rural estate,' the Business Day newspaper said in an editorial this week. 'It is how voraciously this wretched business has sucked in so many others: ministers, bureaucrats, party officials and, as the election hots up, ordinary loyalists.' Barring a major upset, the stock market and rand should take the vote in their stride and could even gain if South Africa's reputation for stability relative to other emerging markets such as Brazil, Ukraine or Turkey is affirmed. 'Overall, the election is reassuringly boring,' said Simon Freemantle, an economist at Standard Bank in Johannesburg. 'We know who's going to win and we know there are not going to be any radical policy changes. That is reassuring.'

The resilience of ANC support has surprised analysts who a year ago were saying it could struggle at the polls . A woman registers to vote for the general election in Gugulethu as an armed guard stands nearby. ANC support is estimated at around 65 per cent . The ANC's nearest rival, the Democratic Alliance, polled 16.7 per cent nationwide in 2009 and, even though it has been gaining ground, is still seen too much as the political home of privileged whites to have mass appeal. Instead, the most spirited challenge has come from the ultra-leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) led by expelled ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, who models himself on Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, right down to the jaunty red beret. In his final rally at a Pretoria soccer stadium, Malema, who wants to nationalise banks and mines and seize white-owned farms without compensation, lambasted everything from the Nkandla issue to foreign investors and former colonial powers. Set to retain power: South African president and leader of the African National Congress, Jacob Zuma, casts his vote in Ntolwane, rural KwaZulu Natal province . Inspiration: The elections are the first since the death of anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela (pictured with his wife Graca Machel, left, and ex -wife Winnie Madikizela Mandela at his 86th birthday in 2004) 'London must know that we're not scared of the queen,' he said to thunderous applause from the 30,000-strong crowd. 'Therefore, we shall not report to London. We will report to the people. The people of South Africa will decide how business is conducted in South Africa. We are taking everything.' However, even the EFF's noisy emergence is likely to have minimal overall impact, with polls putting its support at 4-5 per cent. But of 1.9 million 'Born Free' voters aged 18-19 - its key constituency - only one in three is registered. The silver-tongued Malema himself is also likely to barred from public office this month if a court confirms a provisional sequestration order imposed in February because of 16 million rand ($1.4 million) owed in unpaid taxes.","Around one million South Africans born since white-minority rule to vote .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that some of the information that was used to locate and kill Osama bin Laden was attained using torture. The admission comes after months of speculation about the role that waterboarding plays in CIA interrogations following its graphic depiction in the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty. 'In order to put the puzzle of intelligence together that led us to Bin Laden, there were a lot of pieces out there that were a part of that puzzle. Yes, some of it came from some of the tactics that were used at that time, interrogation tactics that were used,’ Panetta said Sunday during an appearance on Meet The Press. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Admission: Leon Panetta said some of the information that was used to locate and kill Osama bin Laden was attained using torture . Oscar winning pair: Kathryn Bigelow (left) and Mark Boal (right) previously paired up for The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty is their latest collaboration . 'But the fact is we put together most of that intelligence without having to resort to that. 'First of all, it’s a movie, let's remember that. I lived the real story with the Bin Laden operation.’ This is not the first time that Panetta, who is portrayed by James Gondolfini in the controversial film, has admitted that American investigators were aided by the information gathered using torture. Even in the months prior to the release of the film in December, many were raising concerns about the graphic torture scene that takes up much of the first fifteen minutes of the movie. Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says that the interrogation of Bin Laden's courier, who then led U.S. military teams to the Al Qaeda leader's compound, did not involve any waterboarding. That particular questioning session was key to the case, as American authorities then trailed the courier who lead them to Bin Laden's compound in Pakistan, but Feinstein told The New Yorker that waterboarding was not used during the interrogation of the man. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal counter her claim without giving any specific details, saying that the film is based fully on first-hand accounts of the years of investigations. Their response to Feinstein's claims, however, gave a bit more room for creative license. 'It’s a movie, not a documentary,' Boal told The New Yorker.

Waterboarding is a controversial torture tactic that has been used been used by the CIA in their interrogation of terror suspects. The specifics of the tactics differ, but in most cases a cloth or plastic wrap is put over the suspect's face and then the agent proceeds to tour water on their head. It is thought to simulate drowning, and the bound suspect fears that their are about to die. The official stance on it's use has varied over the years, though the CIA has publicly confirmed that they have used the technique on at least three al Qaeda operatives, including self-proclaimed '9/11 mastermind' Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 'We’re trying to make the point that waterboarding and other harsh tactics were part of the C.I.A. program.' Another criticism of the film was that . Bigelow and Boal (both of The Hurt Locker fame) received special . treatment by the Obama administration during the production stages of . the film, but both have denied such claims. 'It was all based on first hands . accounts so it really felt very vivid and very vital and very, very . immediate and visceral of course which is very exciting as a film . maker,' Bigelow said without revealing any specific sources. For the director, the jarring waterboarding scenes were the most difficult to film. ‘I wish that it wasn't a part of history, but it is and was,’ she said.

"By . Sam Webb . Sci-fi fans who happened to glance skywards in central London on Saturday night were surprised to see one of the most recognisable and enduring symbols in film and television history as a new star constellation. The symbol for Starfleet, the intergalactic starship armada from the Star Trek universe that counts the USS Enterprise among its numbers, was emblazoned across the sky above Tower Bridge, astonishing passers-by. The bold stunt was to promote Star Trek Into Darkness, the second movie of the re-booted franchise chronicling the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk, Spock and Lieutenant Uhura. Scroll down for video . Star sign: The 30 small unmanned quadrotors flew in formation to create the Starfleet insignia, which adorns the USS Enterprise . In Star Trek, The USS Enterprise is the flagship of Starfleet, the military arm of the United Federation of Planets . However, even moving the stars is beyond the might of movie marketing moguls, and the effect was achieved using small remote control aircraft called quadrotors fitted with powerful light emitting diodes (LED). Art group Ars Electronica and a German company called Ascending Technologies launched the 30 AscTec Hummingbird quadrotors near London's Tower Bridge and flew in a 94-foot-tall formation to create the incredible sight. They hovered at between 118 and 426 feet above Potters Fields Park. The quadcopters, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), communicate with each other and ground controllers via a 2.4GHz transmission channel and have GPS units to achieve the precise positioning. Space, the final frontier: The 30 craft manoeuvre into position by the London landmark . Into Darkness: The lights on the quadrotors dim to mark Earth Day . The formation even rotated slowly, allowing Londoners from all parts of the capital to see it. The stunt was held to coincide with Earth Hour, where environmental advocates across the world switch lights off for an hour as a show of concern for the environment. In London it took place at 8.30pm on Saturday. To coincide with the environmental theme, the batteries that powered the quadcopters were charged on the Austrian renewable energy grid, according to event sponsor Paramount Pictures. To mark Earth Hour, the LEDs went dim along with the lights on Tower Bridge, the Houses of Parliament, and the London Eye, then turned on 60 minutes later.

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Ap Reporter . There are more than 300 of them in New York - violent crews of dozens of 12- to 20-year-olds with names such as Very Crispy Gangsters, True Money Gang and Cash Bama Bullies. Police say these groups, clustered around a particular block or housing project, are responsible for about 40 percent of the city's shootings, with most of that violence stemming from the smallest of disses on the street, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. 'It's like belonging to an evil fraternity,' said Inspector Kevin Catalina, commander of the New York Police Department's gang division. 'A lot of it is driven by nothing: A dispute over a girl or a wrong look or a perceived slight.' Scroll down for video . There are thought to be more than 300 gangs running the streets of modern-day New York, with the majority of the violence being caused by smaller teenage crews . While large gangs such as the Bloods and Crips still exist, they tend to adhere to the motto that violence is bad for business, while younger gangsters do not (file pic) Volunteers such as the Guardian Angels patrol neighbourhoods in an attempt to keep violence down . The trend of smaller, younger crews has also been seen in Chicago and Northeast cities over the last few years as police have cracked down on bigger, more traditional gangs, experts said. While the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings still exist, operating such money-making schemes as drug dealing, their members are usually older and understand the timeworn mantra of organized crime: violence is bad for business. Not so for the crews, whose recklessness prompted former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly in 2012 to launch an initiative to confront the crews dubbed Operation Crew Cut. Investigators now focus on gathering intelligence about specific crews - understanding their activities, allegiances and feuds which they glean through traditional street policing and trolling of social media sites, cell phone photos and even recorded jailhouse calls. Police have also stepped up arrests of the most active crew members. In Manhattan, prosecutors set up an internal email alert system that notifies them when crew member are arrested, even on minor charges, and provides beyond-the-rap-sheet details for bail arguments. The prosecutor might mention that the person was a suspect in another crime or had made threats on Facebook, for instance. In a recent case in Harlem, Manhattan, District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. says a 2009 killing kindled years of vendetta attacks, including three killings and 30 shootings. Kai Smith, a former convict turned businessman, now runs a programme for gang members in schools . Kai believes that mos of the shootings happened because 'disrespect' show by one gang member to another (pictured: pistols on display in New York after police arrest six men for arms smuggling) Sixty-three . people were rounded up, and at least 62 entered guilty pleas, including . crew members so young that one told another to ""mob up"" after school. 'The . evidence was very powerful,' said Robert Anesi, who represented a . 19-year-old who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and conspiracy . charges in the case last week. 'They had such access to social media and . they knew who the players were.' NYPD statistics show gang arrests are up citywide nearly 14 percent from 2013 - and more than 28 percent from two years ago. Shooting incidents citywide are about the same as they were last year, with 282 recorded so far, and are down by nearly 23 percent from two years ago. Still, crew-related violence persists despite record dips in overall crime in New York City over the last few years. The most notable recent case came in March when investigators say a 14-year-old member of the Stack Money Goons shot a .357 revolver at a rival member of the Twan Family on a crowded bus in Brooklyn. The bullet instead killed an immigrant father who was working two jobs to support his family. 'When you ask young adults, ""Why? Why did you shoot that young man?"" Probably 80 percent of the time the answer is: He disrespected me,' said Kai Smith, an ex-con-turned-businessman who runs a gang-diversion program in city high schools. Smith works with students who have been arrested at least once, forcing them to define what disrespect means through exercises and role-playing. In the 1800s, before prohibition and the Mafia, gangs were still rife in the city. The likes of the Dead Rabbits and the Plug Uglies ran the streets, lead by the likes of Bill The Butcher and Hell-Cat Maggie . This gangland violence was encapsulated in Martin Scorsese's 2002 film Gangs of New York, starring Daniel Day Lewis as Bill The Butcher, who was an actual gangster in the 1800s . Jamal Williams, 18, a high school junior, says he's been affiliated with crews and gangs since he was 9, though he's trying to turn his life around. 'A crew to me is a family,' he said. 'They are going to be there for me like my parents was never there for me.' As more crew members are locked up, investigators are noticing a trend of crew members shifting affiliations behind bars, emerging as a sort-of hybrid gang-crew combination with diffuse connections and alliances. 'That has really complicated this universe,' Catalina said. 'We went from a traditional gang problem to a crew problem and now we're morphing back into somewhat of a traditional gang problem' Gang culture has existed in New York for hundreds of years, from the modern-day crews, back to the dominance of the Mafia during the 1920s and prohibition, and even back to the 1800s when the likes of the Dead Rabbits and Plug Uglies roamed the streets. These criminals were captured in Martin Scorsese's 2002 film Gangs of New York, a part-historical film that was based on the histories of this criminal underworld. The film's anti-hero, Bill The Butcher, was a genuine gangster in the city in the 19th-century, named William Poole, and contested his territory with the likes of 'Dandy' Johnny Dolan and Hell-Cat Maggie.","There are thought to be more than 300 gangs currently in New York .

"By . Chris Pleasance . The Russian military put on a show of strength today as thousands of soldiers marched down Moscow's streets, accompanied by hundreds of tanks and the scream of military jets flying overhead. These images were captured in during final preparations for a Victory Day parade on May 9 to mark Stalin's triumph over the Nazis in the Second World War. While the public holiday used to be celebrated with sombre remembrance, according to the Moscow Times, it has seen a revival under Putin and is now a cause for patriotic celebration. This year, in a nod to the conflict in nearby Ukraine which has seen Putin's popularity soar, the Russian Black Sea Commandos will carry the flag of Crimea and its capital Sevastopol, which were annexed by Russia in March. Russian troops will also march through the streets of Sevastopol, although celebrations in Crimea will be more muted than in Moscow. A record total of 69 warplanes and helicopters, 149 military vehicles and over 11,000 troops will feature in Moscow’s Red Square parade to mark the 69th anniversary of the end of war in Europe.

Victory Day used to be an event of solemn remembrance, according to the Moscow Times, but in recent years has become a patriotic celebration . The battle marked the last major European offensive of the War, and ended with Hitler's suicide and the eventual surrender of the Germany army (pictured, Tu-22M3 strategic bombers fly over the Kremlin) Preparations for the parade, due to take place on May 9, have been taking place for days (pictured, a T-90 tank pulls up next to spectators in Moscow) Spectators have flocked to see the preparations, and to take photographs of the vehicles, such as this strategic ballistic missile Topol-M launching platform .

"By . Louise Boyle . A father who complained about his 14-year-old daughter being given a novel with sexually-explicit content in her high school English class was arrested on Monday during a school board meeting. William Baer lost his temper during the meeting between parents and school officials from New Hampshire's Gilford High School. They had gathered to discuss the appropriateness of ninth-grade students being given Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes - a novel about a school shooting that contains themes of bullying and sexual violence. Scroll down for video . Willaim Baer is led out of the school board meeting by a police officer on Monday after he complained about his 14-year-old daughter being given a sexually-explicit book as an English assignment . Mr Baer, an attorney, raised his voice at the meeting and said that he didn't believe that the school showed his daughter respect by giving her a book with sexually-explicit themes . Parents had met with the school to express their anger that they had not been notified that the book contained sexually explicit material or been given the option to opt out of it. The book contains a description of rough sex between two teenagers including the words: 'She could feel his erection, hot against her stomach'. Mr Baer expressed his outrage that his daughter had been assigned the reading material and when he asked to read the concerning passage aloud, the school board refused. 'Sir, would you please be respectful of the other people?' a school board member asked. He replied: 'Like you’re respectful of my daughter, right? And my children?' Mr Baer, an attorney, was seen on camera arguing heatedly with school authorities and a parent who supported the book for several minutes before a police officer approached him in the audience. Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult deals with a school shooting and has themes of bullying and sexual content . The officer appeared to ask Mr Baer to leave. He responded: 'Because I violated the two-minute rule?', referring to his allotted speaking time at the meeting. 'I guess you're going to have to arrest me,' Mr Baer told the police officer, who then ordered him to stand up and led him by the arm out of the library meeting. The father was then placed in handcuffs and charged with disorderly conduct. Mr Baer told EAGNews: 'I was shocked when I read the passage, and not much shocks me anymore. 'My wife was stunned by the increasingly graphic nature of the sexual content of the scene and the imagery it evoked.' Another parent Doug Lambert told WCVB: 'You are also cheating the kids out of being exposed to real literature in front of them. This is garbage.' Jodi Picoult also weighed in on the debate over her book. She wrote: 'Another parent is challenging #19Minutes bc it contains a sex scene far more vague than anything on TV. Sad to focus on that & not bullying.' The lines which caused parents' concern in the class-assigned text: . 'Relax,’ Matt murmured, and then he sank his teeth into her shoulder. He pinned her hands over her head and ground his hips against hers. She could feel his erection, hot against her stomach. She couldn’t remember ever feeling so heavy, as if her heart were . beating between her legs. She clawed at Matt’s back to bring him closer. 'Yeah,' he groaned, and he pushed her thighs apart. And then suddenly . Matt was inside her, pumping so hard that she scooted backward on the . carpet, burning the backs of her legs. He clamped his hand over her mouth and drove harder and harder until Josie felt him come.Semen, sticky and hot, pooled on the carpet beneath her. Nineteen Minutes was published in 2007 and debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller list. Picoult's fans jumped to her defense over criticism of the novel. Jolene wernig wrote:'@jodipicoult My 2 girls went to #GHS and LOVE your books! Re-reading 19minutes this week.' Holly Soave tweeted to the writer: '@jodipicoult as a teen, #19minutes changed my life & the way I think about bullying & how actions affect everyone around us. I'm grateful.' The school board apologized 'for the failure of the school . district to send home prior notice of assignment of the novel' but added that it had been part of the school curriculum since 2007 and there had been no complaints. Superintendent Kent Hemingway told WND that the book was 'thematically important' because it allowed students to explore issues surrounding a fictional school shooting. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Mr Hemingway. The school's mission statements include the belief that 'learning occurs best in disciplined, safe, and respectful environments where community members are valued and expected to play their roles in education and be accountable for their actions'. A police officer approached the father because he violated the two-minute speaking rule at the school board meeting on Monday night . The police officer took Mr Baer by the arm and led him out of the New Hampshire school meeting before placing him in handcuffs .","Attorney William Baer charged with disorderly conduct at meeting in New Hampshire between parents and the school board .

Chardenea VanRooyen, 27, is facing child endangerment charges after admitting to leaving her two young children to sleep in bushes for almost a week while she had stayed in hotel rooms in Modesto, California . VanRooyen told officers that the children had spent about five nights sleeping in the bushes with their father while she had stayed in other people’s rooms at two nearby motels. ‘She said she can’t stay there because she can’t see her children staying in the bushes,’ police spokeswoman Heather Graves told the Modesto Bee. ‘When officers asked why she doesn’t take the children with her to the hotel, she just says again she doesn’t want to see her kids sleeping in the bushes.’ Graves said officers offered to take VanRooyen and her children to a homeless shelter, but she refused. Police were alerted to the situation on Saturday night after getting a report of an abandoned stroller in bushes between a Wendy's and Denny's on McHenry Avenue, Modesto .

"By . Leon Watson . and Daily Mail Reporter . and Helen Pow . Bomber: Turkish officials identified the suicide bomber who attacked the US embassy as convicted terrorist Ecevit Sanli, pictured . The first pictures of the suicide bomber who attacked the U.S. Embassy in Ankara on Friday have emerged as Turkish officials identified him as convicted terrorist Ecevit Sanli. Armed with six kilograms of TNT - enough to blow up a two-story building - and a hand grenade, Sanli, killed himself and a Turkish security guard in the brazen attack, which has been labelled an act of terror by U.S. officials. As the U.S. flag flew at half-staff today and security at the embassy was heightened, details about the 40-year-old assailant emerged. Sanli was not linked to al Qaeda, rather he was a member of the outlawed Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C. He had spent five years in prison on terrorism charges after he was arrested in 1997 for alleged involvement in attacks on two official buildings in Istanbul. But he was released in 2001 after being diagnosed with a brain disorder that he suffered during a prison hunger strike that killed dozens of inmates. He fled Turkey after he was freed but managed to come back 'illegally' using a fake ID, Turkish officials said. It wasn't clear how long before Friday's attack he returned to his home country. DHKP-C, which has claimed responsibility for assassinations and bombings since the 1970s but has been relatively quiet in recent years. Compared to al Qaeda, it has not been seen as a strong terrorist threat. Sanli's motives were still unclear. But some Turkish government officials have linked the attack to the arrest last month of dozens of suspected members of the group in a nationwide sweep. Scroll down for video . Terrorist: Sanli, pictured, spent five years in prison on terrorism charges after he was arrested in 1997 for his alleged involvement in attacks on two official buildings in Istanbul . Speculation has also abounded that the bombing was related to the perceived support of the U.S. for Turkey's harsh criticism of the regime in Syria, whose brutal civil war has forced tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to seek shelter in Turkey. But Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied that. Sanli was diagnosed with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and released on probation in 2001, following the introduction of legislation that allowed hunger strikers with the disorder to get appropriate treatment. The syndrome is a malnutrition-related brain illness that affects vision, muscle coordination and memory and that can cause hallucinations. Sanli fled Turkey after his release and was wanted by Turkish authorities. He was convicted in absentia in 2002. Half-staff: The U.S. flag at the embassy flies at half-staff a day after a suicide bomber attack, in Ankara, Turkey . Heightened security: Turkish security officers stand outside the US Embassy a day after Sanli targeted the building . On Saturday, a street in front of the security checkpoint where the explosion knocked a door off its hinges and littered the road with debris was blocked off. Police vehicles were parked in streets surrounding the building. The guard who was killed was standing outside the checkpoint. The U.S. ambassador on Saturday attended his funeral in a town just outside of Ankara. A Turkish TV journalist was seriously wounded and two other guards had lighter wounds. The White House was quick to declared the bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Ankara an 'act of terror' on Friday as Westerners in Turkey were warned to be vigilant. Sanli detonated his stash of TNT outside the embassy in the Turkish capital at 1.15pm local time, killing a guard and himself. Turkish officials blamed the attack on domestic leftists but U.S. officials were not immediately clear who was responsible.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A study has shown that as congressmen and women in the US voted Democrat, the people in the states they represented drank more alcohol . Politicians voting liberal can cause people to drink more, a new study has suggested. Researchers in the US found that as congressmen and women voted Democrat, the people living in their states began to drink more - specifically beer and spirits. Possible explanations include the fact that liberals are more likely to rebel through drinking, sex, and drugs, to the belief that public healthcare - such as Obamacare - and social systems are more likely to pick up the pieces if their drinking becomes a problem. Economists behind the study examined all 50 states from 1952 to 2010 and found that the results agreed with previous research showing that socialists in Russia were more likely to drink than their more conservative counterparts. Researchers estimate that if the congressional representatives for Michigan - just over half of whom are Democrats - became as liberal as Vermont - where two thirds voted for Barack Obama - the population could be expected to guzzle an extra two gallons of beer per year. Dr Pavel Yakovlev, a professor of economics at Duquesne University, in Pittsburg, added that the numbers were adjusted for economic, demographic and religious differences. A separate study of consumer habits by Hunch.com found that liberals were 28 per cent more likely to drink both beer and wine compared with conservatives who favoured milk and fizzy drinks. Another study published in Psychology . Science also showed that when both liberals and conservatives did drink, . Democrats were more likely to favour new, cheap brands of beer compared . with conservatives who preferred pricier and more established names. Despite his ale-swilling image, data suggests that right-wing voters in the UK - such as UKIP party leader Nigel Farage - are less likely to drink than their more liberal counterparts . For UK drinkers the same could be true, as 2013 data from the Lifestyle Statistics, Health and Social Care Information Centre showed that most problem drinking occurred in the North, traditionally a Labour stomping ground. Men in the North East were the heaviest drinkers, with 68 per cent regularly exceeding their daily limit, while those in London - where the Tories attract more votes - were less likely to over-indulge.","US researchers found that politicians voting liberal increased drinking .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An Arkansas middle school teacher is under fire after she accidentally showed a personal sex image to her class last week. An x-rated photo of the unnamed female teacher somehow became mixed in with classwork through the teacher's iCloud account. While the teacher even personally called parents to apologize and sent out an apology for the embarrassing mixup, she's now been disciplined by the Little Rock school board. Scroll down for video... Oops: An Arkansas middle school teacher accidentally showed her students a photo of her performing a 'sex act' that she'd apparently uploaded to iCloud and shared with the class . And parents like Nicholas Tolerson, whose son was in the class and exposed to the material, say that may not be enough. 'My heart goes out to not only my son, but other kids in the classroom,' Tolerson told KARK. Tolerson was one of the parents the teacher called after school on Wednesday. His son had come home announcing he'd seen a sex video. '(My son) says she was performing sex acts,' said Tolerson. Parents of the kids in the classroom, like Nicholas Tolerson, have demanded answers but feared the damage was already done 'My heart goes out to not only my son, but other kids in the classroom,' he said . While there's some discrepancy between what was actually seen--Tolerson's son said it was a video while the school maintains it was a fleeting still image--it's clear that the young teens saw something highly inappropriate. 'She was apologetic,' said Tolerson of the phone call he received from the teacher. KARK also obtained a copy of the apology the teacher sent to each parent: . 'Hello my name is [redacted] and I am your child's [redacted]. Today an unfortunate and embarrassing incident occurred during class . 'An inappropriate picture that was taken on my personal phone was transferred to iPads in the classroom. Disciplined: The unnamed Forest Heights teacher has apologized to all the parents, the class iPads in question have been wiped, and she's been disciplined by the Little Rock school board, though it was unclear if the teacher was terminated . 'Unfortunately some of the students were exposed to the photo by accident. I would personally like to apologize for and inappropriate and unprofessional image that your child may or may not have seen. 'Please know that the photo was never intended for view by anyone here at the school. The incident is being investigated and appopriate sanctions for my actions will occur. 'Every measure is being taken to ensure that the picture is not accessible from any source.' Each iPad's memory was wiped after the incident. While it remained unclear Sunday what exact disciplinary action has been taken, KARK reports that she was punished under the Arkansas Teacher Fair Dismissal Act, which covers both terminations and suspensions.","The unnamed teacher Arkansas woman immediately apologized and even personally phoned parents .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Republicans in the House of Representatives are planning to call a vote next week on a contempt resolution against Lois Lerner, the former IRS official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofit groups for special scrutiny based on their political beliefs. Lerner, who retired in late 2013 with a government pension, led the agency's Exempt Organizations office and is accused of masterminding a scheme aimed at hobbling tea party groups when they applied for tax-exempt status in the run-up to the 2010 federal elections. She has twice refused to answer questions during congressional hearings, invoking her Fifth Amendment to remain silent instead of incriminating herself. But Republicans say she waived that right when she gave a lengthy opening statement during a May 2013 hearing, in which she defended herself in no uncertain terms. GOP leaders suspect she has information linking political appointees in the White House and elsewhere in the Obama administration to the scandal. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth: Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner insisted that she was innocent during a May 22, 2013 congressional hearing, but then refused to answer questions -- prompting a constitutional crisis that House Republicans want to resolve by holding her in criminal contempt . Angry tea partiers have rallied against the IRS since news broke a year ago that the agency targeted their organizations in order to cripple them in the midst of a busy political election season . 'If this thing stops at Lois Lerner and doesn't go higher up the food chain, then I'm a Swedish supermodel,' a male aide to a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staffer joked on Friday. On April 10, that committee voted along party lines to green-light a contempt resolution, a necessary step before the full House can vote. The resolution, which is likely to pass in a Republican-dominated House, also refers Lerner's case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. That approach is likely to be a dead-end with Attorney General Eric Holder, however. The full House voted Holder himself in criminal contempt in 2012, in relation to an alleged pattern of hiding documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking debacle, but the DOJ has taken no action. Meanwhile, a federal court is examining a . parallel civil contempt lawsuit that the House filed against Holder. Its goal is to force the DOJ to hand over the documents House . Republicans subpoenaed years ago. Lerner's attorney, William W. Taylor III, has asked the oversight committee's Republican majority to consider a face-to-face private interview of Lerner in lieu of her public testimony, but the lawmakers have held firm. Taylor insisted in an April 28 letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor that 'Ms. Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment privilege' by proclaiming her innocence in an open hearing. He recalled the case of disgraced WorldCom executive Bernie Ebbers, . who told a House panel in 2002 that 'no one will conclude that I . engaged in any criminal or fraudulent conduct' – before refusing to . answer questions. 'Holding . Ms. Lerner in contempt would not only be unfair and, indeed, . un-American,' Taylor wrote, 'it would be flatly inconsistent with the . Fifth Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court.' House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (L) and Speaker John Boehner (C) are ready to force the Lois Lerner stalemate to a legally binding vote . Precedent? Former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers refused to answer congressional questions in 2002 about his company's $11 billion fraud. Like Lerner, he had already offered a self-serving opening statement . At the time, Democrats universally attacked Ebbers for making a speech during a July 8, 2002 hearing and then refusing to answer 30 questions – including those asking if he was a U.S. citizen who worked for WorldCom. Max Sandlin, then a Texas Democratic congressman, called for a contempt vote immediately after Ebbers was dismissed. 'I am not aware of this new theory of selective Fifth Amendment,' he said then. 'It's my position that he has waived his Fifth Amendment protections for all purposes.' Ebbers was ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2005 for his part in WorldCom's then-unprecedented $11 billion public fraud. Cantor spokesman Rory Cooper told The Washington Post on Thursday that Lerner 'always has an opportunity to address the House by testifying before the House Oversight Committee. That invitation stands.' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel added that Lerner 'can avoid being held in contempt at any time by testifying fully and honestly, but she has chosen not to.' Cantor announced Thursday during his regularly weekly preview of the House floor schedule that the Lerner contempt motion would be heard. var docstoc_docid=""168995951"";var docstoc_title=""Letter to Boehner Canter re Lois Lerner.pdf"";var docstoc_urltitle=""Letter to Boehner Canter re Lois Lerner.pdf""; .","Next week the House of Representatives will vote on whether to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in criminal contempt .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor, In Manchester, Nh . U.S. senators told MailOnline during a weekend presidential candidate cattle-call that Attorney General Eric Holder's credibility is on its last legs, that he owes one Republican lawmaker an apology, and that it's time for his exit if he won't indict a corrupt Obama administration official . Holder has frayed the GOP's collective nerves in the past two years, presiding over what they see as a wall of silence that impedes congressional oversight and gives a middle finger to legislators' lawful subpoenas for tens of thousands of documents. Last week the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee passed a resolution calling on the whole House to vote Lois Lerner, a former IRS official, in contempt of Congress for her refusal to answer questions about her role in a scheme to play political favorites with her agency. If Holder refuses Congress' demand to indict her, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told MailOnline, it's time for him to resign. 'Yes,' he said. 'Absolutely.' Clash of the titans: Attorney General Eric Holder delivered a 'disrespectful' verbal slap to a Republican congressman last week, said Sen. Mike Lee, and he should apologize . 'Absolutely': Sen. Ted Cruz said without hesitation that Holder should resign his office if he refuses to indict former IRS official Lois Lerner following a contempt of Congress resolution in the House . Utah Sen. Mike Lee told MailOnline that Holder deserves a 'mulligan' for his outburst last week, but he first owes congressman Louis Gohmert of Texas a sincere apology . Lerner allegedly orchestrated a plan to prevent the approvals of tax-exempt statuses for conservative tea party groups in the run-up to the 2010 congressional elections. That move hampered their ability to raise funds and participate in the election season with ad-buys and other independent expenditures. If Holder is the proverbial cat with nine political lives, he's used up eight of them with the GOP. And his appearance last week before the House Judiciary Committee has Cruz's colleague, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, demanding an apology. The attorney general snapped at Rep. Louie Gohmert during the April 8 hearing when the former Texas chief justice claimed Holder didn't take seriously a 2012 House vote holding him in criminal contempt for clinging to documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious gunrunning scandal. 'You don't want to go there, buddy,' Holder told him. On Saturday at the site of the first New Hampshire Freedom Summit in the city of Manchester, Lee told MailOnline that Holder's outburst 'was disrespectful.' 'Now look – everybody makes mistakes. Everyone's entitled to a mulligan now and then,' he said. 'I hope that it was just a mistake. And if it was, then I'm sure Eric Holder should issue an apology.' But 'it would be much better,' he added, 'if Holder and the Justice Department just complied with the House's requests. They shouldn't go there.' Contempt: Texas GOP Rep. Louis Gohmert slammed Holder in a House hearing, saying a congressional vote of contempt was apparently 'not a big deal to our attorney general' Friendly terrtory: The 2014 New Hampshire Freedom Summit was a gathering of tea party-affiliated conservative lawmakers and other potential future candidates, making swag like an anti-Hillary Clinton 'stress ball' popular items . Sen. Rand Paul said Eric Holder should be -- but isn't -- an 'independent' investigator, even though he's an Obama political appointee with loyalty to the White House . Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who along with Cruz is seen as a GOP presidential front-runner for 2016, said he understands the tightrope Holder has to walk, even if he doesn't like the result. Body slam: Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold said during the same Capitol Hill hearing that Holder should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress . 'It is a pretty big question' whether congressional subpoenas still have any teeth,' he said. A U.S. attorney general 'should be an independent agent. That's what they're supposed to be,' Paul told MailOnline. 'But it's hard because he's also a political appointee.' Should Holder go if he doesn't indict Lerner following a contempt citation from the House? 'I don't know the answer to that,' Paul conceded. 'I really don't know exactly what will happen.' Lee seconded that note of caution. 'It's going to be a very interesting thing,' the Utahan said. 'I'm watching that one very closely.' Paul gave Lerner no such leeway, however. 'Lois Lerner was a government employee and is still receiving a government pension. She should cooperate in a government investigation,' he said of her refusal – twice – to answer the House oversight committee's questions. 'Everything should be done to find justice. I think it upsets a lot of people, Republican or Democrat, if government is being used to punish political enemies.'","Eric Holder exploded last week at a Republican congressman during an open hearing when a 2012 criminal contempt vote against him was raised .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The House Oversight Committee voted Thursday to refer a 'Contempt of Congress' vote on former IRS official Lois Lerner to the full House of Representatives. The latest page in the IRS tea-party targeting scandal came a day after the Ways and Means Committee referred Lerner to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. In May 2013 and March 2014, Lerner invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer Oversight members' questions about a plan she allegedly led to subject right-wing groups to years of intrusive questions before they could claim a special tax-exempt status. Liberal applicants were quickly green-lighted. A visibly angry South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy provided the biggest rhetorical fireworks on Thursday, demanding that Democrats join with the GOP in approving the resolution. None did, and the resolution passed, 21-12. The committee, he crowed, had good reason to rule in 2013 that by giving a lengthy opening statement that contained more than a dozen statements in her defense, she waived her right to remain silent and would have to face her accusers' questions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rep. Darrell Issa, the tenacious chairman of the House Oversight Committee, smiled as his Republican-controlled panel voted in favor of holding former Internal Revenue Service official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to answer questions . Lerner, a career bureaucrat and former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations, has refused to answer questions about her role in a scheme to play political favorites by slow-walking conservatives' applications for special tax status while fast-tracking requests from liberals . 'Can you imagine a fact pattern,' Gowdy said, referring to criminal trials, 'where somebody takes the stand and says, ""I didn’t rob the bank, but I'm not gonna answer why my fingerprints are on the demand note. And I’m not gonna tell you why I’m on the surveillance footage with a gun in my hand. And I’m not gonna tell you why the dye pack blew up in my car. I’m just gonna tell you I didn’t rob the bank!"" That’s not the way our system works.' 'I counted 17 separate factual assertions by Ms. Lerner. ... That is a lot of talking for somebody who wants to remain silent. That’s a lot of talking,' Gowdy said in a loud denunciation. 'If you honestly believe that you can make 17 separate factual assertions and still invoke your right to remain silent, then please tell me what a waiver is!' Oversight committee chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, laid out his side's case in an opening statement. 'Our investigation has found that former IRS Exempt Organizations division Director Lois Lerner played a central role in the targeting scandal and then failed to meet her legal obligations to answer questions after she waived her right not to testify,' he said. 'In demanding answers and holding a powerful government official accountable for her failure to meet her legal obligations, this committee did its job. If the House takes up and passes the resolution, the matter will be referred to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, which statute requires he take to a grand jury.' There is 'sufficient reason to move contempt through the House,' he told Democrats, 'and then ultimately have the question decided by a lifetime-appointment U.S. federal judge that I won’t get to pick and you won’t get to pick.' A visibly angry South Carolina GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy went after Democrats who refused to concede that Lerner's lengthy opening statement in a May 2013 hearing was sufficient to require her to face questions afterward . McCarthyism!: Rep. Elijah Cummings (L), the Oversight Committee's ranking Democrat, held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution as he insisted that a contempt vote against Lerner would be no different from Sen. Joseph McCarthy's 'Un-American activities' witch-hunts in the 1950s . Democrats have held throughout the IRS saga that Lerner's right to refuse to answer questions was absolute, regardless of any statements she made to the committee before pleading the Fifth. 'Ms. Lerner has invoked her Fifth Amendment right, and that’s it. The end!' said New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney on Thursday. Elijah Cummings, the committee's ranking Democrat, said that his 'no' vote was an effort to defend 'the protections guaranteed by the Constitution to every American. I cannot cast a vote that will place me on the same page of history books with [Joseph] McCarthy.' Issa has doggedly pursued the IRS tea-party targeting scandal, investigating how the nation's tax agency came to be involved with the rights of nonprofits to engage in public speech . McCarthy was a Wisconsin Republican Senator during the 1950s 'red scare' anti-communist period who orchestrated contempt votes against Americans who refused to answer questions related to so-called 'un-American activities.' 'We are defending Ms. Lerner’s right to . exercise her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination,' added . Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly, 'precisely because she cuts a less than heroic figure.' Issa insisted that 'taxpayers don’t get to plead the Fifth and escape all accountability when the IRS audits them. … It would irresponsible for the committee not to vigorously pursue her testimony.' House Speaker John Boehner has said that he will take up the Oversight committee's resolution on the House floor. 'If Lois Lerner continues to refuse to testify, then the House will hold her in contempt,' he told reporters on Wednesday. The resolution approved on Thursday declares that '[t]he Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee recommends that the House find Ms. Lerner in contempt for her failure to comply with the subpoena issued to her' for her testimony. In a House Ways and Means Committee hearing Wednesday, a different slate of Republicans won a vote demanding the Justice Department criminally prosecute Lerner, claiming she committed three federal crimes punishable by a total of 11 years in prison. The panel voted 23-14, along party lines, to approve a letter instructing Attorney General Eric Holder to charge Lerner and prosecute her in court. The Justice Department has said it already has its own investigation into the conduct of Lerner and other Obama administration officials in what has become known as the 'tea party scandal.' One-two punch: Ways and Means Committee chair Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, presided over a vote directing the attorney general to prosecute Lerner on three criminal charges . Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, has told reporters that his client  met with DOJ officials and answered their questions weeks ago, but has heard nothing since. President Obama seemed to pre-empt that inquiry's result on Super Bowl Sunday, declaring in a televised interview with Fox news Channel host Bill o'Reilly that there is 'not even a smidgen of corruption' at the IRS. Ways and Means approved a criminal referral letter charging her with 'us[ing] her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law.' She 'impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,' their statement continues. And 'Lerner risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of Internal Revenue Code section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business.'","House Oversight Committee Republicans prevailed on a party-line vote to refer a contempt citation to the full House of Representatives .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Swathes of Britain could be left totally underwater by a tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean, it has been claimed. An earthquake off Portugal could trigger disastrous levels of flooding along the coast of the UK, scientists have said. The Isles of Scilly and parts of Cornwall would be worst hit if there were a repeat of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. The Isles of Scilly, which include Tresco, pictured, lie 45 miles off the coast of Cornwall, coulde be wiped out by a tsunami if Portugal suffered another devastating earthquake . Experts believe that a quake similar to the devastating one 250 years ago would send a 10ft wall of water towards the UK. The tsunami would crash over the tip . of Cornwall within a few hours – leaving much of the coast underwater . and wiping the tiny Scilly Isles off the map. The prospect of the natural disaster . was raised at a meeting of the Devon and  Cornwall Local Resilience . Forum, which includes police, town planners and emergency services. Members of the LRF told the meeting . they fear Britain could suffer its own version of the 2004 Boxing Day . Tsunami. They want an early warning system to alert bathers and people . living on the coast, similar to technology used across Asia and America. St Martin's is one of the five inhabited Isles of Scilly - plus dozens of islets - with a total population of around 2,100 . Paul Netherton, assistant chief . constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and LRF chairman, said other . countries have suffered by failing to plan ahead. He told the forum: ‘After seeing the . devastation in Japan and Thailand we have to ask the question of the . scientific community – what and where would be the impact, is it likely . and, if it is, should we plan for it? A lot of areas would cope but in . others it would cause a big problem. We have to consider whether we do . anything differently than we do now for severe weather events. ‘Tsunami are different – you don’t know they are coming and the water keeps coming and coming.’ Britain was last hit by a tsunami in 1755, the year of the great Lisbon earthquake, the meeting in Bristol was told. In the event of an earthquake in the . Atlantic, the public would currently rely on the British Geological . Survey to register the quake and the arrival of a subsequent wave at . nearby Portugal. Neil Hamlyn, LRF coordinator in Devon . and Cornwall, said: ‘The Isles of Scilly could be affected greatly, the . islands could be covered and disappear.’ Quake zone:  Lisbon was ripped open by the 1755 earthquake which left fissures 15 feet wide in the city centre . The 1755 Lisbon earthquake almost . totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas and had a magnitude in the . range of 8.5 on the Richter scale. Under the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004, the UK maintains a National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. The very high risk table is currently . topped by pandemic flu, terrorist attacks and coastal flooding, though . the last major civil flooding emergency was on the east coast in 1953. Mr Hamlyn says a tsunami is in the top 20 of the second . category of high risks. Other uniquely regional threats include a . nuclear submarine incident at Devonport dockyard and possible . contamination from old tin mines in Cornwall. Work has also already been done to . predict the catastrophic impact should a massive slab of rock twice the . volume of the Isle of Man break away from the island of La Palma, in the . Canary Islands, and smash into the Atlantic Ocean. The resulting tsunami, higher than . Nelson’s Column and faster than a jet aircraft, would devastate the . eastern seaboard of America and inundate much of southern Britain. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon Earthquake, occurred on Saturday, November 1, 1755. The earthquake, which had its epicentre around 200 miles south-west of Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast, almost totally destroyed Lisbon and had a magnitude in the range of 8.5 on the Richter scale. It struck in the morning and lasted between three and six minutes, leaving vast cracks 15ft wide in the city centre streets. An engraving by Laplante from Le Monde Illustre shows how Lisbon was destroyed in the earthquake of 1755 . Around 40 minutes later, a vast tsunami engulfed the city's docks and centre, followed by two more waves. Estimates place the death toll in . Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people, making it one of the . deadliest earthquakes in history. But its devastating impact was not only felt in Portugal - it travelled more than a 1,000 miles before crashing into the British Isles. At around 2pm on the same day, a wave reported to be between three to four metres in height hit the shores of Cornwall, smashing into Mount's Bay, the area's highest point, where it killed at least one person. Estimates suggest that the death toll in Lisbon reached between 10,000 and 100,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history . The waves (there were two more) also struck the south coast and were even seen in the River Thames in London. The tsunami even reached as far as Galway in Ireland, where it was described as being two metres high. French writer Arnold Boscowitz claimed the wave caused a 'great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall'. Recent studies show that should another earthquake of the same magnitude happen, it could affect the south west of England. A wave would take approximately five hours to travel to Britain, with maximum water heights reaching one to two metres around the vast coast of Cornwall. But it would peak at around four metres (13ft) in Mount's Bay.","Disaster planners say a repeat of the 1755 Great Lisbon quake is overdue .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Boston Bruins players and officials have condemned fans’ racially charged rants directed at a black hockey player on Twitter in Boston Thursday night. One estimate pegged the number of tweets with Montreal Canadiens defenseman P.K. Subban’s name and the n-word at about 17,000 after he scored the game winning goal for the Habs in double overtime – but the team moved quickly to distance itself from the racist remarks. Bruins officials condemned the ‘racist’ and ‘classless’ tweets that came only days after Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was banned for life from the NBA for expressing similar views in a recorded conversation leaked to multiple media outlets. Winner: P.K. Subban, #76 of the Montreal Canadiens, celebrates his game-winning power play goal with his teammates in the second overtime period against the Boston Bruins in Game One of the Second Round of the 2014 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs . ‘That stupid n****r doesn’t belong in hockey #whitesonly, said one tweet. ‘F**K YOU N****R SUBBAN YOU BELONG IN A F*****G HOLE NOT AN ICE RINK,’ said another. ‘F**k PK Subban. F*****g n****r. Wish he got sold,’ said yet another. The offensive onslaught was in reaction to the Bruins blowing multiple leads to drop the first game of their playoff series 4-3. The devastating loss was called ‘a kick to the stomach’ and compared to some of the all-time great Boston sports defeats by the Boston Globe. Not all Bruins fans took the loss in stride. ‘Subban is the definition of a n****r,’ wrote another. ‘Someone needs to smack PK subban (sic) across his big n***** lips. #scumbag,’ said another. Not all bad: There were many tweets in support of Subban (shown at left taking his game winning shot), including the one pictured at right . The avalanche of racist hatred making references to slavery lasted into the early hours of the morning, but most of the accounts involved have been suspended by Twitter in the hours since. Montreal-based social analytics firm Influence Communications estimated to the CBC that about 17,000 tweets containing Subban’s name and the hateful slur flowed through Twitter immediately after the goal. But not all of them were negative. ‘N----r was trending in Boston because P.K. Subban scored… It’s a rare moment in my life to be ashamed to be a Bruins fan,’ one person derisively wrote. Many others were quick to point out the Bruins drafted Subban’s younger brother Malcolm only two years ago – he is currently the goalkeeper for the minor league Providence Bruins. He has not publicly commented about the racist remarks targeting his brother. P.K. Subban's brother: Bruins goalie Malcolm Subban, #70, shown during a 2013 game in which he allowed 8 goals against the Red Wings in Boston . Nor has Jarome Iginla, a biracial left winger who also plays for the Bruins. But Boston left winger Milan Lucic has. ‘It's very, very disappointing to hear that,’ he said. ‘It's really sad that people do something like that… To criticize someone about something that has nothing to do with hockey on an issue like that is very ignorant and stupid if you asked me.’ Bruins team president Cam Neely issued the following statement. ‘The racist, classless views expressed by an ignorant group of individuals following Thursday's game via digital media are in no way a reflection of anyone associated with the Bruins organization.’ The team’s coach Claude Julien told the Boston Herald the remarks were in ‘poor judgment [and] poor taste. ‘We . don't associate ourselves with people like that. The people who think . that way are not what we call our fans,’ he continued. ‘They may think . they are, but we certainly don't support that at all.’ Not amused: Bruins team president Cam Neely called the remarks 'racist' and 'classless' Boston Mayor Martin Walsh also chimed in. ‘These racist comments are not reflective of Boston, and are not reflective of Bruins fans,’ he said in a statement. ‘There is no room for this kind of ignorance here,’ Early reports the racial slur was trending on Twitter in Boston were debunked by Deadspin, but the stain remains. Willie O'Ree, the National Hockey League's first black player, made his debut with the Bruins in 1958. Thee predominantly white league currently has only 23 players of African descent among its 32 teams spread across the U.S. and Canada. The series between the fierce rivals resumes Saturday with Game 2 in Boston.","The Montreal Canadiens defenseman scored the game-winning goal in double overtime .

"By . Associated Press . An Indiana man has become the first American to be infected with a deadly virus that has swept across the Middle East, it was announced today. The man fell ill after arriving in the U.S. about a week ago from Saudi Arabia where he is a health care worker. He traveled via London to Chicago before getting a bus to Indiana, according to local TV station WTHR. He is hospitalized in Indiana with Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is investigating the case along with Indiana health officials. Saudi Arabia has been the center of an outbreak of MERS that began about two years ago. At least 400 people have had the respiratory illness, and more than 100 people have died. Scroll down for video . Spreading: A health worker who recently returned to Indiana from Saudi Arabia has the first American case of SARS . All had ties to the Middle East or to . people who traveled there. Infections have been previously reported . among health care workers. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003. The MERS virus has been found in camels, but officials don't know how it is spreading to humans. It can spread from person to person, but officials believe that happens only after close contact. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill. But it appears to be unusually lethal — by some estimates, it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened. That's a far higher percentage than seasonal flu or other routine infections. But it is not as contagious as flu, measles or other diseases. There is no vaccine or cure for MERS. Health experts are particularly concerned about the spread of MERS. In Saudi Arabia alone, there have been 345 reported cases and 100 deaths . The CDC on Friday released only limited information about the U.S. case: The man flew to the United States about a week ago, with a stop in London. He landed in Chicago and took a bus to the neighboring state of Indiana. He didn't become sick until arriving in Indiana, the CDC said. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing problems, which can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. CDC officials say they are sending a team to investigate the man's illness, his travel history and to track down people he may have been in close contact with. Saudi Arabia health officials have recently reported a surge in MERS illnesses; cases have tended to increase in the spring. Experts think the uptick may party be due to more and better surveillance. Researchers at Columbia University have an additional theory — there may be more virus circulating in the spring, when camels are born. U.S. health officials have been bracing for the arrival of one or more cases, likely among travelers. Isolated cases of MERS have been carried outside the Middle East. Previously, 163 suspected cases were tested in the U.S. but none confirmed.","Indiana health care worker with MERS had recently returned from Saudi Arabia .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Camels are being blamed as being the source of MERS, a new SARS like disease sweeping across the Middle East . Camels are being blamed as the source of the deadly MERS virus, a SARS-like condition which is spreading through the Middle East. Researchers have warned it is not advisable to come into close contact with the animals, especially sick camels, as most are infected with the same strain of the virus as humans. MERS, which stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has already infected 345 people in Saudi Arabia since it was identified two years ago. There has been further concern over the spread of the virus as Saudi Arabia has reported more cases over the weekend, taking the reported number of deaths to 100. Symptoms include fever, pneumonia and sometimes kidney failure, with a third of all sufferers eventually being killed by the virus. Yesterday, acting Saudi health minister Adel Fakieh told a news conference: 'There has been consensus in the discussions taking place over the last two days after the scientific team reviewed various evidence that it is advised not to get into close contact with camels, especially sick camels.' He was speaking after meeting foreign experts including those from the World Health Organisation who were invited by the government to help investigate MERS. They have also advised people not to consume raw milk or raw meat products from camels. A countrywide survey of camels in Saudi Arabia shows many, if not most, are infected with a strain genetically almost identical to the strain that’s infecting people, a team at Columbia University, King Saud University, and the EcoHealth Alliance reported. Nasal swabs were taken from the animals who seem untroubled by it after researchers ran genetic test. 'Given these new data, we are now investigating potential routes for human infection through exposure to camel milk or meat products,” Abdulaziz Alagaili of King Saud University, who worked on the study, published in the journal mBio told NBC News. But the WHO's latest advisory on MERS says that most people infected by the virus have it transmitted from another human rather than a camel. Scroll down for video . Health experts are particularly concerned about the spread of MERS. In Saudi Arabia alone, there have been 345 reported cases and 100 deaths . The MERS virus was first discovered in 2012 when an elderly man from Saudi Arabia died from the virus. It concerned health experts due to its similarity to the SARS virus, which has infected more than 8,000 people since 2003, with 800 deaths. MERS has been detected in people in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, annd the United Arab Emirates. Cases have also been confirmed in Europe too in countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Greece. MERS is of particular concern due to Saudi Arabia's role as host of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which attracts millions to the kingdom each year . MERS is of particular concern due to Saudi Arabia's role as host of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage which attracts millions to the kingdom each year. Mr Fakieh said very old people, children and those with chronic diseases should delay their pilgrimage, set for early October, this year, but that no other restrictions were being imposed. Camels are a common sight in some eastern districts of the capital Riyadh, grazing on empty plots of land or carted in trucks on major roads. While they are less prevalent inside some other Saudi cities, such as Jeddah, they are still often seen on town outskirts.","Researchers say most camels are infected with a strain of MERS virus .

"By . David Mccormack . A group of Amazon warehouse workers in South Carolina are suing the world’s biggest online retailer claiming that the company's workplace policies don't leave them with enough time to eat their lunches. The lawsuit, the latest in a string of cases brought against Amazon over worker’s rights, claims that retailer is violating federal wage and hour laws. The claims made by the seven warehouse workers offers a fascinating insight into the retail giant's working processes. A group of Amazon warehouse workers in South Carolina are suing the world¿s biggest online retailer claiming that the company's workplace policies don't leave them with enough time to eat their lunches . Staff are allotted an unpaid 30 minute break during the working day, but according to the lawsuit they were required to continue working and complete their tasks even after their lunch breaks had began. Next they would have to wait in line to go through a security screening. Amazon has employees pass through metal . detectors and subjects them to searches to prevent shrinkage – a retail . industry term for merchandise theft. This process could take five minutes, states the lawsuit. Then because of the sheer scale of the Amazon's warehouse - or Fulfillment Center - in West Columbia it would take the workers a good seven minutes to walk outside to get some fresh air and eat their lunch. Typically workers were left with ‘less than 18 minutes’ to enjoy their lunches before having to get back to picking and packing goods, according to the suit. Amazon workers get an unpaid 30 minute break during the day, but that includes enduring lengthy security checks . According to this latest lawsuit, these are the steps that Amazon workers must go through as part of their unpaid 30 minute lunch break: . ‘Workers were unable to pursue their mealtime adequately and comfortably,’ the complaint states. What's more, the workers claim those lunch breaks were interrupted by managers reprimanding them for failing to meet quotas out on the floor. ‘Managers and Supervisors sometimes approach Warehouse Workers during Defendant's designated break period to give them written warnings and assign disciplinary points to them for [failing] to maintain the Defendants' productivity goals during the shift,’ the complaint states. Amazon commonly uses temp workers in its warehouses, and the South Carolina complaint names two temp firms, Staff Management and SMX, in addition to Seattle-based Amazon. The seven plaintiffs, William Johnson, Tyrone Fisher, Brian Gunter, Lester Mayo, Jeffrey Hope, Latoshia Mack, and Christina Thomas, are all from Richland County, South Carolina. According to the lawsuit all worked at the Amazon facility in West Columbia at one time or anther over the past four years. As many as ten similar lawsuits were filed last year in states including Nevada, Washington, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. All the lawsuits complained about how the security checkpoints ate into the worker's personal time and demanded that workers be compensated . Initially dismissed by a Nevada judge, the employees involved in the first suit successfully appealed and are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, attorney Peter Winebrake told MailOnline. ‘We look forward to pursuing this class-action lawsuit in an effort to ensure that [workers] get paid for all of the time they spend on the job,’ he told the Lehigh Valley Morning Call. ‘We definitely think the case has merit.’ Pay up: A worker sorts packages at an Amazon warehouse, ten lawsuits have been filed by employees claiming security checks at the warehouses should be paid time .","Seven ex-Amazon employees have brought a lawsuit in South Carolina claiming the company doesn't give workers enough time to eat .

"By . Dan Bloom . Jailed: Paedophile language student Zdenek Junek did not have his record checked - but his hosts did . A language school did not check the criminal record of an exchange student who was a convicted paedophile - despite running a full screening on his British hosts. Horrified Wayne Beavill and his wife Sharon - who have two sons aged nine and 13 - discovered their Czech lodger, Zdenek Junek, was a sex offender in his home country after police in Britain arrested him for similar crimes. Junek, 32, was jailed for two and a half years last week for making indecent images of children after spending three months at the Beavills' home in Brighton, West Sussex. The couple are furious at the language school for not running a records check on Junek, who was in their house with their two sons and was 'always in his room... constantly on his computer'. Finance worker Mr Beavill, 44, said: 'Three police officers knocked on my front door saying . they had to search the premises. 'They . said it was about the student who was living with us after they caught . him filming children in Brighton and they left with his computer. 'When we found out he was a convicted sex offender we all felt disgusted. 'It’s sick. I have two young boys and it’s scary to think he was living with them for three months.' Mr Beavill and his wife, aged 43, were paid £260 a month to host students for the Education First School in Brighton. They worked with the firm for 14 years and hosted more than 50 students, saying the work was less about the money - which has to cover a full B&B service - and more about helping the community. Mr Beavill added: 'The language school CRB (Criminal Records Bureau) check all the host families. 'But this guy wasn't CRB checked and was allowed to live in our house with our children... It's disgraceful. Appalled: Wayne and Sharon Beavill, from Brighton, West Sussex, have been hosting language students for 14 years and both of them have been subjected to several Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks . 'They haven’t given us so much as an apology and have just said it’s the first time it’s ever happened. 'But if they’re not checking students’ backgrounds how many others do they not know about?' Mr Beavill continued: 'He was due to stay with us until August and I dread to think what could have happened if he’d not been caught. 'We now keep thinking of things that might have been dodgy - he was always in his room and constantly on his computer.' Junek was jailed for 30 months last Friday at Lewes Crown Court for making indecent images of children, possessing indecent images of children and making an indecent video of children. Mr Beavill said: 'The police told us he had a history of similar offences in his own country. 'No vetting required': The language school, based in this street in Brighton, said it complied with the law . 'He seemed like a nice enough guy, kept himself to himself, so we never would have thought he’d do something like this.' Junek's offences in the Czech Republic were also believed to involve indecent images. The language school defended its policy and said it would never knowingly place a sex offender with a host family. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) was launched in March 2002 and checks the criminal backgrounds of people who want to work with children or vulnerable adults. Information is collected from government agencies and the police and controversially, often includes allegations which were never proven or prosecuted. But the CRB - which was recently merged with another agency to become the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) - cannot access criminal records outside Britain, rendering it more or less useless in cases with foreign nationals. Employers are advised to make additional checks with agencies in the worker's home country. Vice-principal . Bev Garth said: 'We were extremely shocked to hear of this . case, as an accredited organization which complies fully with all the . requirements of the industry. 'There are no standards or requirements for vetting visitors who are accommodated in private accommodation. 'We would never have knowingly placed someone with a known record within a family. The information is not available to us. 'We have discussed this direct with the host family concerned and apologised for any distress caused.' A Home Office spokesman said checks can be made on the criminal history of Czech nationals, who are free to move between their country and Britain for work. An application can be made to the Czech national criminal records office or embassy for £1.50. A Sussex Police spokesman said the force would not have been aware of Junek’s previous convictions until he was arrested.","Wayne Beavill, 44, and his wife Sharon, 43, took in student Zdenek Junek, 32 .

"By . Wills Robinson . A grieving widow is suing a GP for £1.25million because she believes he misdiagnosed her husband's deadly cancer as piles. Christopher Goodhead, died aged just 41 in January 2009, four years after the examination by Dr Asim Islam, who performed the exam on his first day in the job. His devastated widow Melissa Cutting claims Dr Islam's allegedly inadequate . examination caused a fatal 'delay in diagnosis' of her husband's . condition until 2007. Tragic: Christoper Goodhead (left) died in 2009 leaving his wife Melissa Cutting (right). She is now suing the doctor who misdiagnosed his cancer four years before his death . Family: The 41-year-old also left behind four sons who were aged between five and 11 when he passed away . Furious Mrs Cutting, who has been left to look after her four sons, who were aged between five and 11 at the time, heard the news of his rectal cancer in 2007 - just weeks after Mr Goodhead had completd the London Marathon. The IT expert, originally from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had visited the doctor two years earlier at The Stanstead Surgery, in Essex, near his new home in Suffolk. Lawyers for his widow told London's High Court Dr Islam, on his first day in the job, carried out nothing more than a 'simple visual examination' and failed to thoroughly investigate the problems. Dr Islam denies any responsibility for the death, and his legal team insist Mr Goodhead 'would have died in any event' even with specialist treatment from 2005. Robert Seabrook QC, representing Mrs Cutting, told the court Mr Goodhead had left the surgery believing he had nothing worse than piles. He said: 'He left the surgery believing that his diagnosis was certain, non-serious, and that no further medical input was necessary. 'Had he been advised to return for review - or if symptoms continued - he would have done so. 'It . is our case that, with competent assessment and treatment in April . 2005, a diagnosis of cancer would have been made in May 2005. 'He would have been successfully treated and would have lived, or would at least have had an increased length of time to live. Wedding photo: On a memorial site dedicated to her late husband, Mrs Cutting described Christopher as 'an amazing man with a very big heart.' Treatment: Mr Goodhead received the horrifying news that he was suffering from stage four cancer in June 2007. He began chemotherapy, but it was not enough to prevent the cancer spreading through his body . Missed: His tribute page also said he 'adored his family and was a wonderful husband and father' 'The defence case is that, even with earlier diagnosis and treatment, he would still have died on exactly the same day - or not significantly later.' Mr Goodhead and his wife received the horrifying news that he was suffering from stage four cancer in June 2007. Soon he began to undergo chemotherapy - but it was not enough to prevent the virulent cancer spreading through his body. He died at home less than two years later in January 2009 but Mr Seabrook argued that given his 'gritty' character and ""exceptional"" fitness he would have stood a chance of beating the disease if given longer. Claire Toogood, representing Dr Islam, told the court it would have been 'ludicrous' for her client to diagnose cancer from the symptoms he was presented with. Case: Lawyers for hi Mrs Cutting told London's High Court Dr Islam, on his first day in the job, carried out nothing more than a 'simple visual examination' and failed to thoroughly investigate the problems . She said: 'It would have been ludicrous for a GP to have worried Mr Goodhead that he had cancer in circumstances where there were absolutely no pointers towards it.' On a memorial site dedicated to her late husband Mrs Cutting described Christopher as 'an amazing man with a very big heart. He adored his family and was a wonderful husband and father.' Compensation in the case has been agreed at £1,250,000 if the widow can prove he would have 'survived and lived' but for the alleged negligence. Judge Dame Frances Patterson QC has reserved her judgement on the claim until a later date.","Christopher Goodhead died four years after Dr Asim Islam examined him .

"By . Helen Pow . Lawsuit: Chris Sevier, 36, pictured, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month blaming Apple for letting his access porn . A married Nashville lawyer and amateur model is suing Apple claiming the tech giant should have blocked him from accessing porn when he, apparently by accident, typed 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google. Chris Sevier, 36, filed a 50-page complaint in federal court last month claiming the supposedly innocent spelling mistake resulted in him viewing a plethora of pornographic images that 'appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction,' which then 'poisoned his life' and ruined his marriage. Sevier, an army veteran who on a Model Mayhem profile lists his age as 26, states in the suit that Apple should sell all products with an installed porn-filter. He is seeking damages from the company. 'The Plaintiff is a victim of Apple's product that was sold to him without any warning of the damage the pornography causes,' the suit reads. 'In using safari, the Plaintiff accidentally misspelled ""facebook.com"" which lead him to ""f***book.com"" and a host of web sites that caused him to see pornographic images that appealed to his biological sensibilities as a male and lead to an unwanted addiction with adverse consequences.' He added: 'But for the Plaintiff's use of the Apple product, the quality of the Plaintiff's life would have been much better and injury would have been avoided.' Servier goes on in the complaint to . allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought . about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the . marital contract.' Accident? Servier claims he accidentally accessed the porn after mistakenly typing 'F***book.com instead of Facebook into Google . Unfair: Servier, pictured, goes on in the complaint to allege 'unfair competition' between the porn stars and his wife, brought about by his use of the Apple product, and thus 'interference of the marital contract' 'The Plaintiff became totally out of synch (sic) in his romantic relationship with his wife, which was a consequence of his use of his Apple product,' the complaint reads, according to Abovethelaw.com. 'The Plaintiff began desiring, younger more beautiful girls featured in porn videos than his wife, who was no longer 21.' He said his subsequent failed marriage caused him emotional distress to the point of hospitalization. Apple has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Later in the suit, Sevier goes on to point out that a preset porn-filtering software wouldn't just have saved him from his 'unwanted desires' it would help 'mom and pop' bricks and mortar porn shops because it would be harder for websites to survive. Failed marriage: Servier, pictured left and right, said his subsequent failed marriage caused him emotional distress to the point of hospitalization . 'Unregulated internet porn is hurting brick and mortar or 'mom and pop' porn shops,' he writes. 'This is no different than how illegal downloading of musical content and movie content has caused the collapse of traditional record stores and video rental entities, such as block buster (sic).' The complaint was filed the same month Servier was charged with aggravated stalking for incessantly emailing country music star John Rich. According to The Tennessean, one of the emails included a picture of a scantily clad Sevier draped in an American flag and covered in a substance 'believed to be representing blood.'","Chris Sevier, 36, claims the supposedly innocent spelling mistake resulted in him viewing a plethora of pornographic images .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of two schoolboys who killed themselves 15 months apart have criticised the school they attended for their muted response over the suicides. The two boys hanged themselves after their personalities changed, they began dressing in black and listening to music with 'dark', depressing lyrics, it has been claimed. Truman Edley, 15, hanged himself in his home, in Rotherham, and just over a year later Oliver King, 16, was found dead in similar circumstances. Truman Edley (left), 15, hanged himself in his home, in Rotherham, and just over a year later Oliver King (right), 16, was found dead in similar circumstances . Two months after that a 14-year-old attempted to hang himself but failed. All three were students at Wickersley School and Sports College, in Wickersley, near Rotherham. The parents of a fourth youngster, also thought to be a member of the 'friendship group', were alerted when he was overheard by friends talking about suicide. Police and medical experts in the town have investigated but say there is no criminal link between the three incidents and now the school has regular visits from a mental health counsellor available to speak to youngsters. Truman was found dead at his home in November 2011 and Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis recorded a suicide verdict last year. Last week the same coroner recorded the same verdict at an inquest into Oliver’s death in February last year. Oliver’s mother Diane King contacted Truman’s mother Nicola Edley on Facebook when the parallels between the two deaths - less than a mile apart - became apparent. Outgoing: Oliver pictured when he was on holiday on the Greek island of Zante in 2009 . The parents of both boys want to remove the stigma around discussing the issue of suicide.They have also criticised Wickersley School over their muted response. Oliver's father Adrian King, 44, said: 'You might think that because you’ve protected your children and kept them away from what you consider to be the dangers, they won't be affected by things like this. 'It’s difficult to give advice, but if anything I would say act sooner and talk about the topic.' Mrs Edley said: 'You send yourself crazy wondering about what’s normal because suicide is a taboo subject. It’s not something people speak about. 'I had nothing from the school other than a letter, just a couple of lines saying sorry to hear what had happened. Truman was found dead at his home in November 2011 and Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis recorded a suicide verdict last year in a hearing at a Rotherham court (pictured) 'Later, I emailed asking what measures had been put in place with regards to suicide and got no reply. They told students not to talk about it and it felt like they covered it up instead of using it to raise awareness.' Changes to both Oliver and Truman saw them lose weight, wear black clothing and start listening to ‘dark’ music. But the parents say that blaming bands with depressing lyrics in their songs is too easy and glosses over the real issues. Mrs Edley said: 'Focusing on the music covers up the underlying factors. It’s used like a scapegoat rather than looking at why they are listening to that sort of music.' Oliver King on a 2011 outing . Mr King added: 'I see music as effect rather than the cause. If you feel down you might put on a ""down"" song. If that’s all you’re listening to then I think it can have detrimental effect over time. 'It feels wrong to be drawing the conclusions that we are. You think these things only happen in cults or to those involved in the darkest recesses of society. 'All of us have learned the hardest way possible that these things, and these people, are much closer to home than we ever realised.' Dr John Radford, director of Rotherham Public Health said: 'We have responded in relation to the incidents in Wickersley. 'It has heightened our awareness of teen suicides and the importance of mental health and well being.' A spokeswoman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'An investigation was launched into the deaths of two young people from Flanderwell and Wickersley and the apparent attempted suicide of another person, all from the same friendship group. 'The investigation considered whether there was any link between the three incidents but concluded there was no criminal link. 'We have been working closely with its partners to provide support to the families and friends of those involved.' The school has increased the number of days a week when a mental health charity worker is available to pupils from two to five. Head . teacher David Hudson has earlier said: 'We express our sincere . condolences to the families of the young people affected, during what . has been a tragic and very difficult time.' Rotherham . Council chief executive Martin Kimber added: 'We are all working . together to develop an approach which supports the whole community to . identify young people at risk of suicide and self harm.' Oliver King, pictured in the Canary Islands in 2002 . Last week an inquest into Oliver’s death heard that the schoolboy was happy, gifted at art and enjoyed outdoor activities. He had a good relationship with his parents and younger brother until about eight months before his death. Family and friends say he became introverted, lost weight and wore dark clothing. His mother Mrs King, who separated from Oliver’s dad seven years ago, said she felt like they were being pushed away by Oliver. She told the inquest: 'I tried to talk to Oliver but got very little back. It upset me that he wouldn’t talk about anything. He was very secretive and pushed boundaries by not being home on time.' She found him hanged when she returned to the house in Flanderwell, Rotherham. His parents had become concerned about his progress in the sixth from at school and the amount of time he spent with his girlfriend, now aged 18. Mr King said: 'Oliver’s clothing had become darker. From that time onwards he was always in black it came after the change in friendship group. 'I had known that he’d been finding it difficult, pretty much from the start. We met with one of the teachers and felt their was some hope and he might be able to recover the situation.' Several of his friends spoke to police during an investigation into the death and one told them she thought Oliver was ‘trapped’. Det Con Ian Hampshire told the inquest in Rotherham: 'She felt he showed glimpses of paranoia and was emotionally unstable.' Weeks before his death Oliver sent a text to another friend saying: 'Screw it. I’m on the edge of killing myself every day.' Oliver’s girlfriend, who asked not to be named, denied seeing much change in him after they met in the summer of 2012. She said: 'Sometimes he got a bit paranoid that I was going to break up with him. Sometimes he got that into his head. 'He always said he never felt comfortable at home. The main unhappiness and stress he displayed was about school and the sheer workload of starting A-levels.' Asked about his music taste she said: 'I don’t see it as dark music, I just see it as music.' Patrick Butterell, who was head of sixth form at the time, said: 'He was very quiet, well behaved but didn’t do homework. He wasn’t always very responsive in class.' Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis recorded a suicide verdict and said: 'He had been through some dark periods.That evening it culminated in a decision to take his own life. He was trapped with no one to turn to for objective advice. 'He was putting himself under pressure with his girlfriend who was perhaps not best equipped to recognise his problems and still less deal with them.' An inquest a year ago heard that GCSE student Truman was a ‘happy bubbly joker’. A few weeks before his death his mother noticed scratch marks on his arm and two friends said there had been evidence of self harm and advised him to seek help.","Truman Edley, 15, hanged himself at his home in November 2011 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A family who grow medicinal marijuana face up to 40 years in jail after the federal government accused them of being armed drug traffickers. The home of Larry Harvey, 70, and his wife Rhonda Firestack-Harvey, 55, near Kettle Falls, in Washington State, was raided by authorities in August 2012 after police were alerted to their marijuana plants by a Washington State Civil Air Patrol fly-by. Seventy-four marijuana plants were found on the property, along with $700 in cash and legally owned firearms. Accused: Larry Harvey, 70, and his wife Rhonda Firestack-Harvey, 55 . Following the raid, Mr Harvey and Mrs Firestack-Harvey – along with two other relatives and a friend - were charged with six felonies each, including manufacturing, possession and distribution of marijuana, and the possession of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, according to the indictment. Prosecutors claim that the guns are evidence that the family was trafficking their crop. If found guilty, the couple, along with their son, Rolland Gregg, 33, Gregg's wife Michelle, 35, and family friend Jason Zucker, 38, could receive jail sentences of up to 40 years each. The couple claim that, along with their friends, they were growing the plants for their medicinal use in compliance with state law. Michelle Gregg, 35, pictured left with Ms Firestack-Harvey, and her co-accused face up to 40 years in prison . Ms Firestack-Harvey with her son Rolland Greg, 33, who also uses marijuana for medicinal purposes . Federal case: Mr Harvey and Mrs Firestack-Harvey ¿ along with two other relatives and a friend - were charged with six felonies each, including manufacturing, possession and distribution of marijuana . And they argue that the firearms are used for hunting and fishing and protection against the region’s various predators, such as bears and cougars. It has been legal to use marijuana in Washington State since 1998, and to use it recreationally since 2012. The law allows for a patient to grow up to 15 plants, but no more than 45 plants can be grown in one garden. However, marijuana is still illegal in the U.S. under federal law – regardless of its intended use - and this has created an ‘equal justice disparity’, the family’s attorney said in a letter to the Attorney General, Eric Holder. The family and Mr Zucker are being denied a medical marijuana defense at their trial, which takes place next week. According to Huffington Post, U.S District Judge Fred Van Sickle, of the Eastern District of Washington, said: ‘The intent of the defendants is not relevant to the issues. There's this concept of reliance on state law and the like. That's not relevant either.’ The defendants’ attorney said: ‘All of the patients involved had a valid recommendation from a Washington state physician that authorizes the use of medical marijuana. 'The evidence seized is consistent with the type of strict medical dosage that occurs with a doctor’s supervision... If this case were tried in any other court of law with jurisdiction over this issue, we would be able to present a complete and provable defense that would inevitably lead to full exoneration of our clients.’ Americans for Safe Access, a group that campaigns for the medical use of marijuana, told MailOnline: 'The Obama Administration's prosecution of the Kettle Falls Five is outrageous not only for its cruel treatment of a family that was doing nothing more than growing marijuana for their personal medical use in accordance with state law, but also because the White House has repeatedly told the American public that it isn't interested in using Justice Department funds to go after individual, sick patients.'

Peter Milos, 26, was found dead in a room inside a garage at Morningside in Brisbane on Tuesday afternoon. The chef, who had once co-owned a fine-dining Brisbane restaurant, had been kicked out of his Fortitude Valley apartment in February after police raided it when they suspected him of dealing drugs at a music festival, the Courier Mail reports. Upcoming chef: Peter Milos, pictured here with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, was found dead in a Brisbane garage on Tuesday afternoon . His landlord threw him out following the raid and a fight that took place in building where Mr Milos allegedly attacked a man with a metal bar. Police are investigating the 26-year-old's death . Police visited the apartment on Wednesday to ask neighbours about the alleged attack and people who may have visited the apartment while Mr Milos was living there. Mr Milos and his brother Daniel owned popular restaurant Mariosarti and had been photographed with celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. His older brother Allen was arrested on drug related charges last year and is serving 13 years in jail.

His said he would be shocked if police focused on drugs in their investigations surrounding Mr Milos' death. 'He is no big drug kingpin. Everything he owns is in a tiny little bedroom,' Daniel told the Courier Mail. 'They can look all they want. My brother hardly has a penny to his name.'

A teenager nicknamed 'Nando's' because of his love of the fast food chicken chain has had its logo tattooed on his bottom, only for his request for free meals to be given the cold shoulder. Nando's superfan Bradley Holman had the cockerel mascot Barcelos permanently etched on his right buttock as a sign of his love for the restaurant. However, when the 19-year-old from Lower Kingswood, Surrey, contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty, his request was rebuffed.

'Ever . since I first tried their Peri-Peri chicken five years ago, I’ve been . crazy about Nando’s. I’m a huge fan,' said Mr Holman, who estimates that . he spends more than £1,500 at Nando’s every year. 'Whenever . I go out for a meal now, it’s always Nando’s. I order the same thing . every time - an extra-hot whole chicken to myself, garlic bread and a . bottomless drink. Nothing beats it. 'My friends and locals around my hometown call me ""Nando’s"" because I love it so much. People are always asking me to get my bum out so they can see my tattoo.' The Assistant Store Manager got the inking done during a holiday to Malia, Crete in July 2013. The etching took two hours and cost him 90 euros. 'I was feeling hungover after a . night out and all week, I had been craving a nice Nando’s. I was telling . my mates about it and they suggested I get a tattoo of it. I thought . that sounded right up my street. 'So . I went to the nearest tattoo parlour and asked for the Nando’s cockerel . on my bum cheek. The whole process was painful especially after the . alcohol had worn off but it was worth it.' After having the inking done, Mr Holman contacted Nando’s in the hope they would offer some thanks for his dedication. 'I . emailed Nando’s to tell them that I got the tattoo of their chicken on . my bum because I really liked the restaurant,' he said. Worthwhile: Mr Holman said that while getting his tattoo had been painful, getting the inking was still 'worth it' 'I . asked if they rewarded customer loyalty like this and they snubbed my . questions saying they don’t give any free meals or vouchers to . customers. 'I’m really angry . about it. Surely I’m due something for my commitment to Nando’s. I just . wanted a small token so I was gutted when they gave me nothing. 'You . always see Nando’s giving free stuff to celebrities and footballers but . they never reward ordinary, loyal customers like me.' Mr . Holman said his ideal prize would be the much-celebrated ‘black card’, . which guarantees free food for life at Nando’s and is rumoured to have . been given to stars such as Beyonce, David Beckham and JLS, while singer . Ed Sheeran and boxer David Haye have posted pictures online of their prized 'High Five' cards. 'If . Nando’s gave me the black card, I’d get the image of the card tattooed . on my left bum cheek to complete the look,' said Mr Holman. Rebuffed: When Mr Holman, from Lower Kingswood, Surrey, contacted the company asking for a reward for his customer loyalty, his request was rebuffed . Response: Instead of the card, or a voucher, Mr Holman instead received an email stating: 'While we love your dedication to Peri Peri, we unfortunately can't give you a Black Card or a voucher' Threat: Mr Holman replied to Nando's and said he would be inclined to turn to a rival chicken chain . Egged on: Mr Holman's friends encouraged him to get the tattoo after he told them he was craving Nando's food . 'The staff can scan my behind when I come in to the restaurant.' Instead of the card, or a voucher, Mr Holman instead received an email stating: 'While we love your dedication to Peri Peri, we unfortunately can't give you a Black Card or a voucher.' Despite Nando’s ignoring his efforts, Mr Holman says he has no regrets about the inking. However he admits that his cheeky tattoo has received mixed reviews from the opposite sex. 'Some girls love it but others think I’m an idiot for having the tattoo. I don’t care though, they’re obviously not the right girl for me anyway. 'I always take girls out to Nando’s on a first date so it would be a nightmare if they didn’t like the restaurant.' Nando’s was founded in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1987 and operates over 1,031 outlets in 24 countries. In 2012, the restaurant chain reported sales of £350million ($650m). Fans: Rumoured Black Card holders JLS in a London branch of Nando's . Only openly acknowledged by Nando's in 2010, the chicken chain's fabled High Five card, or Black Card, is so prized as it grants its very select list of owners and their friends unlimited free meals at the restaurants. Many owners are discreet about the cards, but celebrities including David Beckham, JLS, Ricky Gervais, Beyonce and Jay-Z, and even Oprah Winfrey are rumoured to have them. Singer Ed Sheeran has posted a photograph where he proudly poses with a Black Card, and has written a song with rapper Example (who claims he was the first person to ever get a High Five card) - entitled Nando's Skank. And asking for a card won't help fans of the chain to get their hands on them, as the company says anyone who has requested a card, 'no matter how politely', will ever receive one. 'Asking for one is simply the biggest taboo - a definite no no,' the chain states on its website in a post entitled 'High Five Card, Fact or Fiction'. The website also states: 'You've heard rumours about it - a card that magically provides free Nando's for a whole year. 'The mythical Nando's High Five card - can you be sure it really exists? Or, like unicorns and Robin Hood, is it just a legend - one created by Nando's to give fans a holy grail to yearn for?' When you consider that the average meal in Nando's costs around £10, including a bottomless soft drink, for a celebrity to eat there twice a month with five of their friends it would be worth around £1,200 a year.","Bradley Holman had chain's cockerel mascot tattooed on his right buttock .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A farmer has been cleared of manslaughter following the death of a walker in an attack by his bull. Paul Waterfall had denied manslaughter by gross negligence after Roger Freeman was attacked as he walked with his wife on a footpath across the farmer’s land in 2010. Prosecutors said a bull belonging to Farmer Waterfall attacked and killed 63-year-old Mr Freeman and that the farmer had known the animal posed a ‘deadly risk’. Mr and Mrs Freeman, who were married for 42 years, were experienced ramblers . Mr Waterfall had denied knowing the bull was aggressive or that it posed a risk to members of the public. A jury of eight men and four women took just over two and a half hours to find the 39-year-old dairy farmer not guilty following a four-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court. There were sighs of relief today from family and friends of the farmer. Following the verdict, Judge Gregory Dickinson QC told the court: ‘Whatever the verdict, I have no doubt all the jury felt enormous sympathy for Mrs Freeman and for family and friends. Write caption here . ‘I express my sympathies and condolences to the family, who have been through a horrible ordeal.’ The judge also criticised the time it took to charge Mr Waterfall following the incident. The farmer was charged last year following Mr Freeman’s death four years ago. Judge Dickinson said: ‘I struggle to understand how it took so long as to come to a decision to charge. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service should look very carefully at the history of this case to find out what lessons can be learned.’ Mr and Mrs Freeman were walking the 15 miles from Nottingham to Loughborough when the incident took place in this field in Stanford-on-Soar on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border . The judge also said the case questioned the importance of leaving health and safety issues to self-regulation. Mr and Mrs Freeman, who were married for 42 years, were experienced ramblers and were walking the 15 miles from Nottingham to Loughborough when the incident took place around 4.30pm on November 12, 2010 in Stanford-on-Soar on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border. The couple, who had seen cattle in the field, carried on walking on the public footpath across Mr Waterfall’s field when Mr Freeman was attacked. The court heard the farmer’s bull, Moonriver Zac Pi, was in the field with a number of cows of different breeds. Paul Waterfall's farm in Stanford-on-Soar on the Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire border. His bull Moonriver Zac Pi was later put down . Prosecutors claimed it was the bull who attacked Mr Freeman, charging at him and tossing him in the air, and stripping him of his walking clothing. Mrs Freeman, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, told police she believed a bull with 12in horns attacked her after she tried to defend her husband from the animal. However the trial heard the bull, known as Zac, did not have horns. Zac was put down after the attack on Mr Freeman. Giving evidence during the trial, Mrs Freeman said she was no longer sure the animal that attacked her and her husband had horns. Mrs Freeman, then 67, survived the attack by climbing over a fence and flagging down a passing motorist. The last thing she remembered hearing her husband say as he called on her to get help was: ‘I’m sorry my baby, I can’t get us out of this,’ she told Nottingham Crown Court. Paramedics found Mr Freeman’s body in the field. He was wearing only his boots and underwear. A post-mortem examination revealed he suffered broken ribs, shoulders and upper arms, and fractures to his vertebra. Mrs Freeman had to undergo surgery for chest and abdominal injuries. Mrs Freeman needed hospital treatment for abdominal and chest injuries. Mr Waterfall told the court he had thought of Mr Freeman and his family every day since the fatal incident. The father-of-two denied that Zac was aggressive and said it would have been culled if it had shown aggression. After today’s hearing, Mr Waterfall declined to comment out of respect for the Freeman family but said he was relieved the case was over .","Roger Freeman, 63, was experienced rambler and been married for 42 years .

"By . Ted Thornhill . The principal of one of America’s top high schools has warned students over their tradition of picking prom dates based on an NFL-style draft system, saying that it may lead to girls being objectified. Boys at Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach have been picking dates for their proms using their version of the draft system for years. It’s not endorsed by the school so they would often do it in secret. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Boys at Corona del Mar High School in Newport Beach have been picking dates for their proms using their version of the draft system for years . But the school’s principal condemned the practice in a letter to parents and students after it was increasingly conducted in public, with the help of social media sites. Some students posted messages on Twitter urging girls to look their best in the weeks leading up to the prom. One wrote ‘many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for #freeagents so dress nice ladies’, according to the Orange County Register. The NFL . draft system is designed to level the playing field in American . Football, with teams at the bottom of the league able to cherry-pick the . best college students for the following season. The boys at Corona del Mar High would mimic this system by picking numbers from a bowl, with lower numbers enabling them to approach girls deemed the most desirable. But money is involved, too. It was reported that some students were paying over $100 in order to select their ideal prom dates, with some attending proms with girls they barely knew. Levelling the playing field: The draft system allows teams lower down the league to cherry pick the best up-coming footballers . Last week Principal Kathy Scott said in a letter to parents and students: ‘I am sure that the intention of this ""draft"" is not to be harmful, but it may be. 'It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way.' A feminist organization at neighboring Estancia High School slammed the prom draft as 'insulting'. However, the system has many fans, including girls. Sophomore Jessie Harris told the Register that 'it is all just a fun way to decide who you will be going to prom with'. She added: 'It is not meant to harm those who are picked and I do not believe that it does.' Corona del Mar High School was ranked 127 out of 21,786 high schools by U.S. News and World Report for maths and science.","Some Corona del Mar High boys pick prom dates using a draft system .

"By . Snejana Farberov . One year after their escape from a ramshackle house in Cleveland where they had been held captive for years, Amanda Berry and Georgina DeJesus were honored at the annual Hope Awards in Washington DC Tuesday night. The gleaming ballroom at the Ritz-Carlton hotel, which hosted the event organized by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, erupted in applause when the two young woman took the stage. The honorees briefly addressed the large crowd, with Berry tearfully delivering a simple yet powerful message: 'Never give up hope.' Scroll down for video . Emotional moment: On the one-year anniversary of their escape, Amanda Berry, right, wipes tears from her eyes with Georgina DeJesus by her side as they are honored at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Hope Awards dinner Tuesday . Unbreakable: The 28-year-old kidnapping survivor spoke of the importance of keeping  hope alive . Guardian angels: Berry and DeJesus took the stage at the Ritz-Carlton in DC accompanied by their relatives . On May 6, 2013, Berry, DeJesus and a third woman, Michelle Knight, were freed by police from Ariel Castro's real-life house of horrors where the three women had been repeatedly beaten, raped and kept in chains for more than a decade. Although the survivors are now grown women, they were honored by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children because they were kidnapped by Castro, a school bus driver, when they were teenagers. Earlier Tuesday, Berry and DeJesus had lunch with Vice President  Joe Biden , and also got to meet President Barack Obama, according to The Plain Dealer. During the Hope Awards ceremony, an emotional DeJesus and Berry, both dressed in festive evening gowns, took the stage surrounded by their relatives. ‘It’s an honor to be here tonight,’ Berry said. ‘It is really special to be here with Gina and our families. It means more than you’ll ever know.’ The 28-year-old woman, who had spent a decade of her life in bondage, had to pause after being overcome with emotion. Life-affirming message: DeJesus, 24, also spoke about the importance of keeping hope alive . Special honor: Even though DeJesus and Berry are now adults, they were honored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children because they had been kidnapped as teenagers . Ray of light: John Walsh, the host of Americ'a Most Wanted, called Berry and DeJesus 'a lightning bolt of hope' ‘If I could say only one thing,’ she continued, ‘it would be this: Never give up hope.’ When it was DeJesus' turn to address the crowd of about 500 guests, the 24-year-old also spoke about the importance of keeping hope alive against all odds. John Walsh, the host of America's Most Wanted who introduced the two honorees, called Berry and DeJesus 'a lightning bolt of hope' for other families. He also mentioned the plight of Michelle Knight, saying that no one was even looking for her because she was kidnapped at age 21. Knight, Berry and DeJesus’ getaway and subsequent recounting of the horrors they suffered during their time in captivity drew international attention. Decade of horror: Berry (left), DeJesus (center) and  Michelle Knight (right), pictured here in February, disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004 in Cleveland, and were rescued in May 2013 after Berry broke through a screen door . Ariel Castro pleaded guilty to hundreds of charges including kidnapping, rape and murder for forcing Knight to miscarry. He was sentenced to life without parole, plus 1,000 years, but hanged himself in his cell in September. Craig Weintraub, one of two attorneys who represented Castro, said that Castro decided not to kill the three women because he had become close to the child he had with Berry. The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004. Berry was 14, DeJesus was 16 and Knight was 20. They were rescued from Castro's run-down house May 6, 2013, after Berry broke through a screen door. Going on record: Michelle Knight's new book, Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed, was released Tuesday . Police found DeJesus and Knight upstairs where there were bedrooms outfitted with chains and locks. According to police documents released this week, Berry told authorities after she escaped: ‘He [Castro] didn't lock the door, he always locks the doors. I thought it was a trick but I had to take that chance.’ Another document recounted a conversation Castro had with a police officer shortly after he was arrested. The officer, who had known Castro since childhood, asked him how he had kept the women for so long without anyone finding out. ‘It was hard, but it was my secret, and I'm glad that it is over,’ Castro told the officer. ‘Now I can die in prison, but I'm a victim, too.’ Castro told investigators that he was sexually abused by a man when he was a young boy, the documents said. Berry and DeJesus said in statements Monday that they were thankful for support from their families and the community and that they growing in many ways. Michelle Knight said in an interview on NBC's Today Show Monday that Castro deserves forgiveness because she'd want to be forgiven if she did wrong, and ‘that's the way of life.’ She added, ‘He is a human being and every human being needs to be loved,’ even if he did wrong. On the last page of her new memoir, Finding Me: A Decade of Darkness, a Life Reclaimed, Knight writes: 'If I don't forgive him, then it'll be like he imprisoned me twice. Forgiveness is the only way I can truly reclaim my life.' Knight recounted being chained up, beaten, raped and mentally tortured for years by Castro, who pointed to high-profile searches by the families of co-prisoners Berry and DeJesus as proof that no one cared about her.

Torture chamber: Police conduct a search at the home of Ariel Castro on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio,  May 7, 2013; the house has since been razed to the ground . Those words . hit home for her, she wrote. 'Even if I escape from this bastard, I . often thought, what kind of life will be waiting for me in the real . world? After this mess is over, who will really be there to love me?' Knight, . who is changing her name to Lillian Rose Lee, referred to Castro only . as 'dude' throughout the book, but wrote that she cried after hearing . about his suicide. Knight's new book was released Tuesday to coincide with the one-year anniversary of her escape. Berry and DeJesus are collaborating with two Washington Post reporters on a book due out next year. Charles Ramsey, the man credited with helping the women escape from the house, also has written a book. On Tuesday night, Ms Knight went on CNN's AC360 to talk about her experiences in Castro's home, telling Anderson Cooper that she was 'the punching bag' for the kidnapper. Knight, who was lured by Castro with the promise of 'puppies,' said that the school bus driver treated her worse than the other two captive girls, beating her day after day. The 33-year-old survivor recalled that Berry got better food, blankets, 'basically whatever she wanted, except for home.' Survivor's narrative: Michelle Knight went on CNN's AC360 to talk about her experiences in Ariel Castro's home . Singled out: Knight, 33, said that she was Castro's punching bag and was treated worse than Amanda Berry because Castro was fascinated with the younger girl . ‘He had a fascination with her, more than me,’ Knight said. ‘She was the wife-type person. I was the punching bag.’ When in April 2004 Castro kidnapped then-14-year-old Gina DeJesus, he chained her to Knight. The two captives would form a close bond, encouraging one another in order to keep hope alive that one day their torment will be over. Knight's toughest test came when Amanda Berry went into labor with Castro's child. It was her job to deliver the baby, and Castro had warned her that if the newborn died, he would kill her. Berry's baby came out of her womb not breathing, but the amateur midwife helped revive the newborn. Throughout the entire decade-long ordeal, Knight remained defiant in the face of daily beatings and humiliations. ‘All my life, I was made to feel insecure, like I was worthless,’ she recalled. ‘And for the first time in my life, I stood up to a person that was a demeaning person.’ She added, ‘And it felt good to stand up for myself, [because] I never did before.’ The following statements were released separately Monday by Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus about the one-year anniversary of their escape from a house in Cleveland. Amanda Berry: . I would like to thank all the people who have helped and supported my family and me. You have changed our lives in ways you'll never know. On this day, we decided that the right place for us to be was with other families who have gone through what our family has gone through. I want these families to know they will always have a special place in our hearts. So much has happened this past year. I have grown. I am strong. And I have so much to live for, to look forward to. The future is bright. Gina DeJesus: . I want to thank everyone who donated to the Courage Fund and sent gifts to me. You have made such a difference in my life.This past year has been amazing, full of healing and hope. I am spending time with my family and working with Amanda on a book that we are really excited about.I have also been enjoying new experiences, such as learning how to use new technology and how to drive.

"By . Patrick Collins . At 28, Matt Jarvis has made a considerable name in top-class football. He has performed with distinction, he has represented his  country, and clubs have paid more than £10million for his  services. Yet when his career is done, he may be remembered for a single, instinctive decision, taken on a spring evening in East London. The circumstances are swiftly recalled: West Ham and Arsenal were without a goal at Upton Park when Jarvis ran into the penalty area and the Arsenal full-back, Bacary Sagna, responded with an artless lunge. His studs connected with the attacker’s knee, and we awaited the tumble and the  inevitable penalty. Instead, Jarvis did something extraordinary: he stumbled, staggered… and stayed on his feet. The ball ran loose, the chance escaped and the bewildered referee took no action. West Ham went on to lose the match, whereupon the roof fell in. Clash: Matt Jarvis stayed on his feet after colliding with Bacary Sagna . At best, it was said, Jarvis was woefully naïve; at worst, he was criminally negligent. For by electing to do the decent thing, he had transgressed football’s most sacred code; the one which states that cheating is not merely acceptable but, where a penalty is at stake, it is compulsory. Here we should have some sympathy with Sam Allardyce, which is not a phrase which trips off the keyboard. The West Ham manager expressed his position with clarity. ‘A foul is a foul,’ he said. ‘You get slaughtered for diving but when someone is honest, you don’t get what you should get. There’s no reward for being honest.’ But he concluded, ruefully yet generously: ‘You can’t ask players who are honest to be any different. It’s against their nature. So you just hope the referee gives you the  decision you deserve.’ Indeed you do and, by failing to meet those reasonable expectations, the referee, Kevin Friend, deserves the harshest criticism. Given the clearest of views, Friend declined  to act upon the evidence of his eyes. With cheating so rife, we do not expect infallibility from our  officials but we do expect a  minimum of competence. Criticism: Jarvis was labelled as naive for staying on his feet and not trying to win a penalty . It was at this stage that Gary Neville intervened and transformed a spat of small consequence into a curiously important debate. In the course of his brief media career, the former Manchester United captain has earned a reputation as a perceptive pundit. But from time to time his basic instincts emerge, and he reprises his rabble-rousing, ref-baiting glory days. Neville didn’t begin to understand or even recognise the problem. Instead, he embraced the role of  the old pro: hard-nosed, telling it like it is. He sneered at poor, misguided Jarvis: ‘You can be an angel and do what Matt Jarvis did, and he can get a pat on the back from his Nan when he goes home tonight. Or he can win his team a penalty. And a professional in the game must say: You gotta go down.’ In other words, you’ve got to cheat, because you’re a pro. It doesn’t come naturally, mind. Not to an  Englishman. ‘You’re not brought up in England to think about diving,’ says Neville. ‘We’re the only country that thinks the way we do. Every single country in Europe and the world would have said, “He’s mad.”. We naturally think, “Fantastic. Well done, son. You stayed on your feet”. ‘But when you’ve been through the professional game and you’ve been stitched up by foreign players so many times … If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em’. He seemed dimly aware that his attitude might raise a few eyebrows. But old pros care little for the  disapproval of civilians. ‘I suppose in some ways people can say, “It’s disappointing to hear you say that, Gary”,’ he acknowledged. ‘Well, be disappointed. Because ultimately, that’s the game. That is the game!’ It is the kind of justification we have heard from cricketers who refuse to walk or sprinters who dally with stimulants. Everyone does it. That’s the game. And I’ve no doubt that Neville meant every word. On target: Jarvis (left) scored but West Ham were still beaten by Arsenal at the Emirates . Equally, I’ve no doubt that he was talking dangerous nonsense. For he is not merely a media figure, he is a man who won 85 England caps and who now helps coach the national team. And the message from a national coach is that it’s  perfectly acceptable to dive and cheat, because that’s what Johnny Foreigner does. I cannot imagine how that goes down with all those teachers who attempt to instil honest values, all those parents who endlessly encourage their children because they believe that the game has uplifting lessons to impart, and all those young people who are entitled to expect civilised direction from a national figure and are given instead the cynical cliches of a disaffected old pro. Before the week was done, Jarvis was starting to  reconsider. ‘Maybe I should have been a bit cleverer and do what other players have done. Perhaps then, I could have got the penalty,’ he said. I hope the thought was swiftly banished, because clearly he is much better than that. For Matt Jarvis has been tested. In the course of those few micro- seconds, he weighed his decent instincts against his bogus ‘professional’ obligations. And, to his undying credit, his instincts won. The game was enriched by his decision. Cardiff conjure their own tales of the unexpected . Cardiff City believe that Crystal Palace tried to discover their starting line-up at least a day before the teams met in Cardiff on April 5. In a furious letter to the Premier League, they claim that this constituted ‘an attempt to obtain a sporting advantage’. They note that ‘Palace succeeded in their efforts and achieved an unexpected 3-0 win’. And they reflect: ‘We will never know the extent to which the confidential information affected the outcome of the match.’ Personally, I haven’t the faintest idea if their complaint is well-founded. But I do wonder why anybody should take great risks in order to win ‘a sporting advantage’ over Cardiff. I marvel at the suggestion that advance knowledge of the teamsheet could deliver a decisive advantage. And I smile at the notion that any away victory in Cardiff could be described as ‘unexpected’. Advantage: Crystal Palace beat Cardiff 3-0 in Wales at the start of April . But if that really is the case, then the League might scrutinise some of this season’s other, inexplicable shocks at the Cardiff City Stadium. Such as Spurs (0-1), Newcastle (1-2), Arsenal (0-3), Southampton (0-3), West Ham (0-2), and Hull (0-4). And I scarcely dare mention Liverpool (3-6). For fear of starting a scurrilous rumour. It was a lively Friday in Blackpool, with a pitch invasion, a barrage of tangerines and tennis balls and the home coach sent  off for thumping one of his own substitutes. Amid all the uproar, Blackpool lost to Burnley, and now stand on the brink of Championship relegation. And this at a club that enjoyed a season in the Premier League just three years ago. How has it happened? The clues may be found on a banner flaunted at the Burnley game. It read ‘Oyston’s Cash Cow’, and it contrasted the fortunes of the Oyston family with those of the club they control. There is a strong local feeling that the Oystons have taken a great deal out of the charming old club while giving precious little in return. Of course, there may be counter-arguments to be made. But nobody was listening in Blackpool on Friday. Flashpoint: A TV grab of Blackpool coach Bob Malcolm pushing Stephen Dobbie in the face .

The week’s most delicious statistic could be found in a new list of sporting salaries. Last season, Queens Park Rangers won four matches out of 38 and finished bottom of the Premier League, 14 points from safety. By contrast, Atletico Madrid finished third in La Liga, behind Barcelona and Real Madrid. They also won the Spanish Cup. Crazy: Atletico Madrid's title-chasing stars were paid less last year than QPR . Yet Atletico’s players were paid an average salary of £1,734,067, while their counterparts at QPR received an average of £2,142,611 — a difference of more than £400,000. Were the high achievers of Atletico undervalued, or were the non-achievers of QPR grotesquely overpaid?  I know what I think.","Jarvis stayed on his feet after colliding with Bacary Sagna in the area .

"By . Ruth Styles . 'That man’s evil, he’s a beast, he’s a . paedophile. In fact jail’s too good for him,' says Tracy Brown. 'I feel bitter towards him . because he’ll never realise what he’s done.' Tracy and her twin sister Rachel Steadwood, now 38 and from Edinburgh, were just six years old when their childhood came to an abrupt end. Unbeknown to each other, both had been attacked and brutally raped by a man they considered to be family, the husband of their Aunt Mary, John McCallum. Harrowing: After suffering in silence for almost 30 years, Rachel (left) and Tracy (right) finally spoke out . Innocent: The twins were just six years old when they were first raped by Mccallum . Appallingly, the abuse continued for more than a decade, only ending when Mary divorced her husband. It took another 20 years before the twins plucked up the courage to go to the police and last September, the pair were finally given the justice they craved when McCallum was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his crimes. Despite the verdict, however, the pair say they will never get over what happened to them and will never forgive their 'monster' uncle. The girls' ordeal began in the summer of 1978, while they were staying with their much-loved Aunt Mary, then 16, who was married to a 19-year-old traveller named John McCallum. For the twins, the carefree summers spent travelling were the highlight of their year, with both remembering golden days spent roaming the countryside around Loanhead in Midlothian. 'Aunty Mary was like a second mum,' remembers Tracy. 'Even . now I love her to bits.  She was always there, we used to like school . holidays, constantly we used to go with her.' 'We went all over the place,' adds Rachel. 'We'd stay in caravans, trailers, as you would class them.  It was totally exciting.' But the idyll was about to turn into a nightmare as McCallum, previously thought of as a 'nice man' by the twins, turned his peverted attentions to first Tracy and then Rachel. 'After raping me, he opened the door and acted as . normal,' remembers Tracey of the first time her uncle attacked her. Tracy, who, like her sister, was repeatedly abused between the ages of six and 13, adds: 'I remember him turning round and saying that there could be blood there as well. And I remember that I cried myself to sleep that night. 'I thought I must have done something wrong. I must have done something for him to have done that . because you just don’t do that to people. 'It took me a . long time to realise I never done nothing wrong.  It wasn’t me, it was . him.  He was in the wrong.' Evil: John McCallum, from Midlothian, was sentenced to 10 years for his crimes in September 2013 . She adds: 'You’re only a wee child, and how do you know that’s not normal?' It wasn't long before Rachel too fell victim to McCallum. 'Aunty Mary was away - I think she was at . my granny’s,' she recalls. 'And John shouted me to come . through to his bed. And he got himself on . top of me. His exact words, on my telling him it was sore, him telling me it would be alright, it’d only hurt for a minute. 'It wasn’t my fault, I didn’t have a choice,' she continues. 'This man done what he did to us, and there was nothing I could do about it. 'I wasn’t strong enough then.  Then I didn’t think I’d have been believed . because, well, I was feared I was feared of destroying everybody’s life, . my Aunty Mary’s life.' The abuse continued for more than a decade but, incredibly, neither twin knew what was happening to the other. Both, however, began struggling at school, regularly missing classes, and grew apart with both harbouring resentment towards the other. 'I never thought that it was happening to Rachel,' says Tracy. 'I just believed it was happening to me because I was his special twin. Childhood: The girls spent childhood summers staying with their aunt Mary on a traveller camp like this one . 'I’ve blamed her, I thought I was the . only one, and I’ve blamed her all my life basically for not getting . anything what I got. But you know what? She got it too - she’s been punished . all her life as well.' Their ordeal finally came to an end when their Aunt Mary, fed up with her husband's womanising ways, divorced him in 1986 when the girls were 13. Although they soon lost contact with McCallum, both suffered flashbacks and Tracy succumbed to severe depression. Rachel, meanwhile, found herself spiralling into a vicious circle of drugs, unstable relationships and even contemplated suicide. 'I never dealt with it because it’s there . every day of your life,' she says. 'I thought I was getting through life OK but I wasn't because I ended up taking . drugs, I tried to take my own life twice. 'I’ve fought eating disorders, . I fought depression, so I’ve had a multitude of things, all while thinking that I . was coping when I wasn’t coping, but that was my way of getting through . what had happened to me.' For more than 17 years, the sisters kept the truth about McCallum to themselves, telling no one - not even each other - until, during a rare meeting at their brother David's funeral - they finally plucked up the courage to confide in each other. Idyll: The girls' childhood in a beautiful part of Scotland were ruined by McCallum's appalling crimes . 'We were sitting at the front door, and I . asked her had any bad things ever happened to her, and she says “yes.”,' recalls Tracy. 'We never spoke about it again. I was so sad - even now we’ve never really sat down and really spoke about it.' While the sisters struggled to come to terms with what had happened, McCallum remained free and continued as he always had. But after a chance conversation between Rachel and her aunt Mary, his trouble-free lifestyle was about to come to an end. 'I thought she thought that we . had been with him in that [sexual] sense, so I looked at her and I went: “It’s not . what you think.” 'And she looked at me and she went: “What do you . mean?”  I went: “We didn’t have a choice.”  She went: ""What do you mean, . you didn’t have a choice?” 'I went: “We didn’t, he raped us, sexually abused us.”  And that was it, that was the start of it.' Days later, the sisters finally reported McCallum to the police and he was arrested within hours. In September 2013, he went on trial for the rapes and sexual assaults of his two nieces more than 30 years earlier. Despite protesting his innocence and later offering to take a lie detector test, the 15-strong jury found him guilty on two counts of rape and four other sexual offences, and he was handed a 10 year prison term. For the sisters, the overwhelming emotion was one of relief. 'Finally, I could speak out and tell everybody . what an animal he was,' says Rachel. 'I didn’t have to be scared of him any longer. I could stand up and shout as loud as I . wanted: “That man raped me, that man sexually abused me, that man’s a . monster.""' 'That man took my life, that’s . what he done,' adds Tracy. 'He put me in the dark but now I’m out of the dark . and I’ve got my life back.' And the twins, torn apart by what happened to them, have since revived their relationship and say they're now closer than ever. 'I . could never have done this without my sister, she’s my world, she’s my . twin now,' adds Tracey. 'I used to have a sister, but now I’ve got my twin - something I . should have had all my life, but he destroyed that. 'But now . I’ve got her and he can’t destroy it anymore.'

"By . Snejana Farberov . Actor Jason Patric arrived in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday for a hearing in a heated custody fight with his former girlfriend who had conceived their son from his sperm donation. Patric, 47, best known for his starring role in the 1980s film The Lost Boys, has filed an appeal seeking to be recognized as a father of Danielle Schreiber's 4-year-old son, Gus. In February 2013, the actor lost a court battle to gain visitation rights with Gus under a California law that grants the mother full custody in the absence of a written agreement establishing parental rights before conception. Legal battle: Actor Jason Patric (right) and his attorney Fred Silberberg (left) speak following a custody hearing concerning his son Gus at the 2nd District Court of Appeals in Los Angeles May 8 . Bitter fight: Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle Schreiber, seen in court Thursday, barred the actor from seeing their son on the grounds that as a sperm donor, he has no parental rights . He said, she said: Schreiber said Patric offered to help her conceive a child under the express condition that he would have no parental rights, but the 47-year-old actor claims he signed forms promising 'an intent to parent' Ms Schreiber, 41, a massage therapist and the daughter of a prominent Connecticut lawyer, said her on-again, off-again boyfriend never signed their son's birth certificate. Moreover, the woman said in a statement to ABC News that Patric offered to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization under the express condition that his sperm donation be kept secret, and that he would have no parental rights or obligations. A judge in a lower court sided with the mother, striping Patric of visitation rights. The former teen heartthrob, however, insisted that he has been a father to Gus from the day of his birth. His lawyers will argue that the actor signed forms at the family planning clinic promising 'an intent to parent.' Happier times: The Lost Boys star and his former girlfriend, pictured here on a family beach vacation, agreed to conceive a baby together in 2009 when they were already separated . Daddy's little boy: Patric, 47, seen with Gus in Hawaii a few years ago, says he has been a real father to the boy from the day of his birth . Bad breakup: In 2012, the couple's relationship came to an end, and shorty after Schreiber barred Patric from seeing Gus . Speaking to ABC News this week, Patric said the last time he saw his son was 63 weeks ago – even though he lives only 10 minutes away. ‘I said, “It's OK. I'll see you tomorrow.” I've never seen him again,’ he recalled. Mr Patric is seeking full custody of little Gus in a high-profile case that has raised serious questions about the parental rights of sperm donors. Last week, Patric scored a minor legal victory when a judge citing the First Amendment declined to grant Schreiber a restraining order in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from using their son's name in an advocacy group he had created called 'Stand Up for Gus,' according to The Hollywood Reporter. Patric’s public campaign has gained some traction in Hollywood, with A-listers like Mark Wahlberg, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm and Mel Gibson lending their support to the cause. The 47-year-old actor, who is the grandson of The Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason, has spent the past year going around giving interviews and speaking out about the rights of sperm donors at fundraisers for his foundation. Last July, Patric sat down with Katie Couric for an interview about his legal battle, telling the TV presenter that Gus was stolen from him because of an outdated legal stature that does not recognize the parental rights of sperm donors in those cases where the mother and father are no longer together. Activist: Patric (right), pictured with friend Carol Chodroff following a custody hearing, has started a foundation called Stand Up for Gus to push for a new law recognizing the parental rights of sperm donors . Patric and Schreiber first met in 2002 when he came to her for a massage and struck up a romance, The New York Times reported. In 2009, the Sleepers star offered his on-again, off-again girlfriend to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization. Gus’ birth had initially helped the couple rebuild their rocky relationship, but three years later they broke up for good, and soon after the actor says he was abruptly barred from having contact with his son. On her part, Schreiber said during an interview on NBC's Today Show last July that Patric doesn't deserve any rights to Gus. 'It's not about him having a relationship or contact with Gus. This is just about rights,' she said. 'Me preserving my right to be a sole legal parent, not having to share that with someone who has never intended to and never raised Gus, even when we were dating — Jason never did anything to raise Gus. He never changed a single diaper,' she said. But Patric - who refers to himself as Gus’ ‘Dada’ online – continues to insists that he has been a real father to the toddler, even taking him to be circumcised when he was eight days old.","The 47-year-old star of The Lost Boys was stripped of visitation rights last February when a judge sided with his ex-girlfriend .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two quick-thinking sisters have been hailed as heroes after getting 26 people, including students, off a smoking school bus moments before it burst into flames. Bettye Windom, 24, and Beth Insley, 29, were at a red light on a Mississippi highway last week when they saw clouds of smoke rising from the bus. Fearing for the safety of the passengers, the Georgetown sisters jumped into action. They followed the bus for a mile down Highway 28 in Copiah County, honking and screaming, before stopping their car in front it and forcing the driver to stop. Within minutes of the women evacuating the 22 students, three chaperones and driver, the bus went up in flames. 'We knew we had to . stop the bus, and the driver didn't see us,' Windom told The Good News blog. 'It took three minutes after we got everyone out for the bus to . burn down.' Scroll down for video .

Windom, a postal worker, said she spared no thought for the new sedan when she and her sister slammed on the brakes in front of the bus. 'I would much rather save the kids than the vehicle,' she said. 'A life means a lot more.' As the girls helped get the students and chaperones off the back of the bus, the driver tried to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher. But, Windom said, the bus was engulfed in flames within three minutes of the evacuation.

Despite rescuing nearly 30 people from an imminent inferno, the sisters say they are not heroes. 'People are saying we're heroes, but that's silly,' Windom said.

"By . Matthew Blake . A Japanese taxi driver with a fetish for women on the verge of wetting themselves has been arrested for plying female customers with biscuits laced with diuretics, then watching them squirm in his rear-view mirror. Toshihiko Nishi, 41, got sexual thrills from watching women desperate to urinate and found his job as a cab driver the perfect way to feed his fixation, police in the city of Osaka claim. He allegedly lured women into long rides in his cab - sometimes with the offer of a half-price fare - and then offered them crackers covered in a substance that would make them want to go to the toilet, AFP reported.

One alleged victim told police she had . got into Nishi's taxi in Osaka, western Japan, in October last year, . and been given a small paper cup containing water biscuits. A short time after eating the snack, she began to need the toilet. But when she told the driver to let her out of the car so she could relieve herself, he refused and instead passed back an absorbent sheet on which he encouraged her to urinate.

"By . Francesca Chambers . It's unacceptable to turn children of suspected illegal immigrants away from public schools, period, the Departments of Justice and Education said today. The federal government have been telling schools this since 2011, but the Obama administration was forced to revisit the issue this week after they received more than a dozen complaints from across the country that public schools were acting unlawfully. 'Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students . regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis . of race, color or national origin,' Attorney General Eric Holder reiterated in a statement on Thursday. Education Secretary Arne Duncan, right, and Attorney General Eric Holder, left, pictured here in March at an elementary school in Washington, D.C., issued a letter today reminding school districts that raising barriers to enrollment for children brought into the U.S. illegally violates federal discrimination laws . Schools can require parents to provide proof of residency within a specific school district. They cannot require them to provide Social Security Numbers or Birth Certificates, the departments told school districts in a joint letter. Furthermore, if a student's parent provides a foreign birth certificate, it cannot be used against the student. And if a school does ask for Social Security Numbers for other reasons, it must tell guardians that the information is voluntary. Not only are such enrollment practices a violation of federal law, they could 'chill or discourage the participation, or lead to the exclusion, of students based on their or their parents’ or guardians’ actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status,' it says. Besides, homeless children often do not have federal documentation proving their citizenry, either, the letter points out. The letter goes on to remind education employees of the restrictions on discrimination laid out in the Civil Rights Act and Phyler v. Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case that found it was unconstitutional that found that it was unfair to 'innocent children' to deny them the right to a primary and secondary education. Education Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters that the departments decided to remind educators of enrollment procedures after 17 instances of abuse of the law were reported to the Office of Civil Rights. 'We want to be sure every school leader understands the legal . requirements under the Constitution and federal laws, and it is our hope . that this update will address some of the misperceptions out there,' Duncan said in a statement. Immigrant reduction organization NumbersUSA criticized the Obama administration for encouraging people to violate federal immigration laws and protecting people living in the country illegally. 'It just seems to send a message to the world,''We are here to protect . those who break immigration laws and we're going to do almost nothing to . enforce it,"" ' the group's president, Roy Beck, told USA Today.

"By . Leon Watson . A fire battalion chief hunted for the killing of his fiancee is a keen outdoorsman and may be hiding out in the mountains, authorities said today. Police have been trying to find Orville 'Moe' Fleming, 55, since last week.

Fleming, who taught for several years at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's academy in Ione, was fired yesterday after not reporting for duty or calling in for five days, Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. Berlant said the termination was automatic because of Fleming's absence from work and has nothing to do with the allegations against him. Veteran: The lone suspect is a 24-year veteran firefighter that has risen to the rank of battalion chief . House of horrors: The street in front of the home where Douglas was killed has been roped off with police tape . A statewide manhunt continues for Fleming, who is believed to have fled the immediate area in an unknown vehicle. He also has keys to various gates, trails and Cal Fire facilities throughout the state, Bowman said. Fleming may have changed his appearance by shaving his head or mustache, and he has obvious tattoos on his left arm, Bowman added. He is also likely to have suffered cuts to one or both of his hands during the alleged killing, Bowman said, and he is believed to be carrying .45- and .25-caliber pistols.

"By . Associated Press . House Republicans on Thursday rammed through a measure opening a new investigation of the deadly assault in Benghazi, Libya, vowing to dig deeper in a search for truth. Democrats declared it merely a political ploy to raise campaign cash and motivate voters. A bitterly divided House voted 232-186 to establish the panel that Speaker John Boehner insisted would answer questions that linger almost 20 months after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission. Seven Democrats, many facing tough re-election campaigns, broke ranks and joined Republicans in supporting the probe. The panel's investigation will be the eighth on Benghazi and will examine the entirety of the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.  Independent, bipartisan and GOP-led probes have faulted the State Department for inadequate security at the outpost, leading to four demotions. No attacker has yet been brought to justice. Speaker of the House John Boehner is asked about the special select committee he has formed to investigate the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Thursday . Republicans say they're unsatisfied with explanations so far, and they have leveled a range of accusations against President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and other senior administration officials. Chief among them: that the administration misled the American people about the nature of the attack during a presidential election campaign and stonewalled congressional investigators. 'We will not take any shortcuts to the truth, accountability or justice,' Boehner said during House debate. Democrats remain divided over whether to boycott the select committee. They are concerned that their participation would grant legitimacy to what they believe will be a partisan forum. But they also worry that if they avoid it they won't have the chance to counter GOP claims and defend potential witnesses — including Clinton, a possible 2016 presidential candidate. Party leaders will meet with their rank and file Friday morning to decide on the next step. Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., leaves a closed-door Republican strategy meeting at the Capitol in Washington on Wednesday. Speaker of the House John Boehner has tapped Gowdy to chair a special select committee to investigate the attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya . Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of . Florida criticized the 'song and dance' she said came from Clinton when . House members wanted to question her about Benghazi a few months after . the attack. Clinton's testimony before the House Foreign Affairs . Committee was delayed when she missed a month of work toward the end of . her tenure after suffering a virus, then a fall and a concussion, and . then brief hospitalization for a blood clot near her brain. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., said no evidence uncovered in any of the . investigations thus far suggests wrongdoing by the administration. Republican claims have descended into 'the crass and unbelievable,' she . said. Rep. Adam Schiff, . D-Calif., said the questions 'have been asked and answered time and time . and time again,' and he added: 'Let's end the political circus.' Benghazi . has produced 13 public hearings, the release of 25,000 pages of . documents and 50 separate briefings. The select committee won't be the . only inquiry, as other GOP-led congressional panels continue their . probes, including a House Oversight investigation which just last week . took the extraordinary step of subpoenaing a Cabinet member. Secretary . of State John Kerry hasn't said when he might testify. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., followed by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., leaves a closed-door Republican strategy meeting in Washington on Wednesday . Democrats . deride the effort as a conservative campaign designed to energize . Republican voters in typically low-turnout midterm elections. Boehner's . legislation creates a select House committee through the end of the . year. It will have to be reapproved when a new Congress begins in . January or go out of existence. The select committee has no explicit . financial constraints. The . Obama administration says officials tried to provide the public with the . best information available after the attack at a time when U.S. embassies, consulates and other facilities were facing angry . demonstrations across the Muslim world over a YouTube video mocking . Islam's Prophet Muhammad. The administration originally attributed . Benghazi to a similar protest that extremists hijacked, but retracted . that account amid severe criticism. House . Democrats have issued several demands if they are to participate in the . select committee. Boehner already has rejected their call for equal . representation on the panel, deciding instead to fill it with seven . Republicans and five Democrats. The Democrats also seek guarantees . they'll have equal access to documents, say on subpoenas and right to . question witnesses. Negotiations continue.","House votes 232-186 largely along party lines to establish a select commitee to further investigate the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in the Libyan city .

"By . Jonathan Block . West Virginia's Attorney General is suing school officials in rural Mingo County over allegations they systematically covered up allegations of sexual abuse committed by two middle school boys against female students.A complaint filed Thursday by Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in Mingo County Circuit Court alleges the victims, female classmates of the boys, were 'subjected to repeated incidents of sexual abuse and/or sexual assault by two fellow male students, and then threatened with discipline and/or retaliated against by members of the Burch Middle School administration when each pursued punishment for the offenders.' The sexual conduct in question includes 'non-consensual fondling, groping and molestation, often times forcible in nature.' Mingo County school officials systematically covered up allegations of sexual abuses and assaults at Burch Middle School (pictured) by two boys whose relatives are allegedly board employees, according to an injunction filed on Thursday . According to one of the girls, 'some of the intrusion and groping was above the clothing and some ... was underneath the clothing,' the complaint said, adding that on one time, the girl alleges she was 'forcibly penetrated' by one of the boys on a field trip.The lawsuit seeks an injunction against administrators and employees of Burch Middle School in Delbarton, the Mingo County Board of Education and its superintendent, two juvenile males and the juveniles’ parents, WOWK reported. The station also reported that the parents of the two boys, who are seventh graders, work for the school district.Defendants named in the complaint include Burch Middle School Principal Melissa Webb, Burch Middle School Vice Principal Deanna Maynard, Guidance Counselor Hester Keatley, teacher and athletic coach Melvin Cunningham and Mingo County Schools Superintendent Randy Keatley.'Instead of a meaningful investigation by the school, upon information and belief, the female students have been disparately treated and punished, while the alleged male perpetrators have been ""taken care of,""' according to the complaint. West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is looking into allegations that school officials covered up sexual abuse claims made by female students against male classmates . The lawsuit says that after one of the alleged incidents, one boy told the other, 'Don't worry, (your relative) will take care of us.' One boy's relative was involved in investigating and deciding punishment for some of the allegations, according to WOWK.The complaint alleges that at a meeting with one of the female students and her parents, Cunningham made the case that since there were no witnesses, the girl could not prove she had been assaulted and 'threatened disciplinary action …. should she continue to complain without witnesses.' Even more shocking, the father of one of the male students at the meeting told Cunningham, the girl and her parents that his son admitted to the allegations.The West Virginia Human Rights Commission is also investigating the allegations, as is the West Virginia State Police.'The investigation of these crimes are a priority to us and we all need to take it serious and when there's an allegation this has occurred, it's very important this allegation be investigated thoroughly,' Lt. Michael Baylous of the State Police said. 'That's what we're going to do it. we're going to investigate it thoroughly and hopefully get to the bottom. Everyone should be alert and report these crimes as soon as they're made aware of them.'","Lawsuit filed by Attorney General Patrick Morrisey alleges school officials in Mingo County threatened the female students with retaliation for making the claims .

"By . John Hall . A 75-year-old woman who shot her husband in the back of the head in the mid-1970s has finally been convicted of murder. Alice Uden, from Chadwick in Missouri, faces 20 years to life in prison after being found guilty of second-degree murder, despite her defense that she killed 24-year-old Ronald Holtz because he was about to attack their two-year-old baby. Holtz's body was recovered from an . abandoned mine on a ranch between Cheyenne and Laramie last summer, with . Alice Uden arrested in September along with her current husband Gerard, . 71, who was charged separately with killing his own wife and two . children in 1980. Convicted: Alice Uden wore a grim expression as she left the courtroom in a wheelchair, looking frail in a white shirt and wire glasses. She faces 20 years to life for the second degree murder of her third husband . Actions of the past: Alice Uden listens to the judge during jury selection. None of her five children or other relatives were present for the verdict . Jurors found Alice Uden not guilty of . first-degree murder, which would have carried a life sentence, but . passed on the least-serious option of finding her guilty of . manslaughter. She wore a grim expression as she left the courtroom in a wheelchair, looking frail in a white shirt and wire glasses. 'It's . just been a long time coming. I don't think it's fully sunk in yet,' Uden's attorney, Donald Miller, said of her reaction to the verdict. He . added that they planned to appeal the conviction. Laramie County District Attorney Scott Homar indicated he was satisfied with the verdict. 'The jury made it clear that they believe she at least purposely and maliciously killed the victim,' he said. None of Uden's five children or other relatives were present for the verdict. In . a bizarre twist in the case, Uden's husband Gerard was arrested at the . same time as her, on separate charges of killing his own wife and two . children in 1980. Police . haven't linked the two cold cases that brought the elderly couple . quietly living out their senior years in rural Ozarks in Missouri back . to the state of Wyoming to face murder charges. Twist in the case: Gerard Uden (right) - the husband of Alice Uden (left) - was arrested at the same time as her on separate charges of killing his own wife and two children in 1980. He has already pleaded guilty . Prosecutors could not mention Gerald . Uden or his case at Alice Uden's trial, but Alice Uden testified she . remarried two years after Holtz's death. Juror Samantha Wallace, 33, said the jury was unfamiliar with Gerald Uden's case. 'I . don't think that would have persuaded us. But we kind of thought, . 'Where is her [current] husband? Who is her husband?' Wallace said. Alice . Uden testified she shot Holtz sometime in late 1974 or early 1975, just . as he was about to attack her toddler daughter. Prosecutors said Uden, . of Chadwick, Missouri, killed Holtz while he slept. Evidence of an unhappy marriage: A returned envelope containing divorce papers initiated by Alice Uden against the husband she murdered after only a few months together . At . one point, as many as 11 jurors favored a first-degree murder . conviction, but one insisted Alice Uden was guilty of no more than . manslaughter, Wallace said. They compromised on second-degree murder to avoid becoming deadlocked and risking a mistrial, she added. 'It . was hard to be in there. Emotions. People crying,' Wallace said of the . scene in the jury room as they deliberated for about 13 hours over two . days. Alice Uden testified . that after she shot Holtz, she emptied Christmas decorations from a . 55-gallon cardboard barrel and stuffed his 175-pound body inside. She . rolled the barrel from her porch into her car trunk and drove to a . ranch where she and a previous husband had been caretakers until his . death in 1973. Her trial . featured emotional testimony from one of her sons, who said Alice Uden . told him in the 1970s she killed Holtz as he slept. Reagan Uden, 10, left, and Richard Uden, 11, right, were shot in the back of the head by their stepfather Gerald Uden. He is now serving life in prison for their murders . While on the witness stand, Todd Scott also turned to his frail mother and said: 'I hate you.' Uden was married to Ronald Holtz, her third husband, for only a month or two. A nurse, she met the 24-year-old Vietnam veteran while working in the psychiatric unit of a Veterans Administration hospital in Sheridan. Hospital records cited at trial showed Holtz had a history of violent outbursts and drug use. 'He was extremely violent, unpredictable and impulsive,' Miller said in his closing argument on Tuesday. Murder: Gerald Uden said his wife Virginia Uden (pictured) had become 'intolerable' Alice Uden said Holtz became abusive soon after they married in September 1974. She said he had a job driving a taxi at night and, one morning, he flew into a rage when her two-year-old daughter began crying while he was trying to sleep. Uden testified that Holtz knocked her down while storming toward the girl's bedroom. She said she grabbed her .22-caliber rifle from a broom closet and shot Holtz in the back of the head as he stood above the child's crib. Prosecutors argued Holtz was asleep when Uden shot him. 'The fling she had started was no longer a good time for her. And Mr. Holtz maybe wasn't the man she thought he was,' Homar said in his closing argument. He also said Uden kept changing her story when investigators interviewed her. At one point she said she got the gun from a bedroom closet much further away from the crib - and much less readily available in the supposedly urgent situation. Wallace said she believed the shooting was premeditated. 'She thought about it... She knew that she was going to kill him. Whatever closet it was didn't matter,' she said. In the other case, Gerald Uden has already pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree murder for shooting his ex-wife, Virginia Uden, and her two sons in central Wyoming in 1980. When Alice and Gerald Uden met is unclear, but they married in November 1976, five months after Gerald and Virginia Uden separated. While entering his plea in November, Gerald Uden was vague about his motive but said Virginia Uden, 32, had become 'intolerable'.","Alice Uden, 75, found guilty of the second-degree murder of her husband .

"By . James  Nye . and Associated  Press Reporter . Dozens of residents angry that a police officer fatally shot a 93-year-old woman marched Thursday to police headquarters in the small Texas town of Hearne, where the longtime mayor greeted them and said he will recommend that the officer be fired. That didn't satisfy friends of Pearlie Golden, who authorities say appeared to be shot three times Tuesday night by Officer Stephen Stem after he responded to a 911 call about a disturbance involving a woman and a gun. 'There's no justification. Any police officer would know not to kill a 93-year-old fragile woman when they could have backed off,' said William Foster, 64, a retired professor in Hearne. 'She was no threat to him.' Outrage: K.K. Davis, left, and Tommy Jones of Hearne carry a sign with other protesters outside the Hearne, Texas police department on Thursday following the shooting of 93-year-old Pearlie Golden on Tuesday . Hearne police have said in a statement that Golden 'brandished a gun' when Stem arrived at her small brick home behind the railroad tracks that run through this mostly poor community of 4,500 people. Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said Thursday that a preliminary autopsy shows Golden was shot twice in the body and grazed by a third bullet. It's the second time Stem has shot and killed a suspect since joining Hearne police in 2012, Siegert said. Hearne Mayor Ruben Gomez said he will recommend Stem be fired at a city council meeting Saturday. Loved: Members of Pearlie Gold's (right) community have nothing but good things to say about their longtime neighbor . 'It's a loss of confidence in the community. We can't have an officer the citizens have lost confidence in,' Gomez said. Stem could not be reached for comment because a number for him could not be found. Siegert said he saw Stem's lawyer this week but didn't know his name, and Hearne City Attorney Bryan Ross didn't immediately return a phone message. A message was also left with Texas' largest police union. Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting and police have declined to comment beyond the statement issued this week. Hearne, Texas, police officer Stephen Stem fatally shot a man in 2012 but was later cleared of any wrongdoing by a grand jury . Candles left in vigil remained outside Golden's squat home two days after the shooting. Foster and others said she lived alone and that her husband had been a Hearne police officer himself. A doghouse made of plywood sat in Golden's recently cut yard. Next door, a neighbor lived in a trailer surrounded by a barbed wire fence. Hazel Embra, a geriatric nurse and a City Council candidate in Saturday's local election, said she saw Golden last week at the grocery store. She described a spry, sharp woman who was known by many people as 'Miss Sulie' and enthusiastically greeted friends with 'Hey, baby! How you doing?' Home: Golden, whose home is pictured here, was well-liked in her community of Hearne, where she has lived for at least 50 years . Authorities say a revolver believed to be the weapon Golden had at the time of the shooting was found at the scene. 'That lady should be living today. She should not have died like she did,' Embra said. The circumstances surrounding Stem's first fatal shooting on the job in Hearne were far different. Stiegert said several officers had responded to a call of shots fired and wound up chasing three men who fled on foot. The one who died wasn't armed when shot by Stem, Stiegert said, but had been during the pursuit. He said officers can be distinctly heard on tape yelling to put the gun down before shots were fired.","The mayor of Hearne in Texas has called for the police officer who shot dead a 93-year-old woman dead to be fired .

"By . John Hall . A 78-year-old great grandfather has been killed after being struck by a car while trying to save the life of his lifelong friend's dog. Animal lover Richard Kurtz, from O'Fallon in Missouri, spotted the whippet named Charlie standing without its owner close to the busy Highway N, and decided to cross the road and carry him to safety. Tragically Mr Kurtz was struck by a vehicle within seconds of reaching Charlie and died from his injuries while still holding the dog, which was also killed. 'Amazing man': Richard Kurtz spotted the whippet named Charlie standing without its owner close to the busy Highway N, and decided to cross the road and carry him to safety. Tragically the pair were then struck by a car . Mr Kurtz was struck while crossing the eastbound section of Highway N at about 1pm on Monday. The retired landscape gardener's body was found with the small dog still in his arms. 'It was just a shock to the family... he picked the dog up in his arms to start walking across and as he got in the middle of the road, some car was coming up, and it plowed right into him,' his sister Kathleen Tuttle told the New York Daily News. 'He was an animal lover and you'd teach your children to never do that but you know, when that happened, he didn't think of himself, he thought of the dog,' she added. Mr Kurtz - who recently underwent spinal surgery - was the father of three children, grandfather of 10, and great-grandfather of two - with a third great-grandchild due in the next couple of weeks. Scene: Mr Kurtz was struck while crossing the eastbound section of Highway N (pictured) at about 1pm on Monday. The retired landscape gardener's body was found with the small dog still in his arms . In the aftermath of his his death, one of Mr Kurtz's granddaughters wrote a tribute message on the official Facebook page of O'Fallon Police Department. 'My papa was an amazing man. He would go after any dog that ran across that road, he would put his life in danger to save anybody,' she said. Reacting to anger online over the death, she added: 'Please don't blame the driver for anything. My papa knows he tried to stop and I couldn't imagine. The driver now has to carry that with him for the rest of his life. The driver was also an elderly and would've done anything to save my papa.' Mr Kurtz's wife died four years ago and he had since retired from his family's landscape gardening business. In 1977 he and his brother were given an award at the White House by the then First Lady Rosalynn Carter for their work on the gardens at St. Louis Community College in Florissant Valley, Missouri.","Richard Kurtz, 78, was killed crossing the busy Highway N in Missouri .

"By . Adam Duggan . Western Australia hasn’t been a good place for sharks and whales to visit recently, with the state government trialling their controversial shark cull program. But one baby humpback was lucky to have encountered a group of fishermen from New Zealand when it was caught in cray pot lines near Geraldton, off Australia’s western coast. It took serious guts for one of the boat’s crew members to swim out and free the baby whale, which looks more like a large shark. Scroll down for video . 'Just cut the line': A fishermen rescues a baby humpback that got tangled in crap pot lines off Geraldton, Western Australia . The whale appeared distressed to begin with – attempting to swim lower to get under the net, before releasing air from its blowhole. Once the ship’s skipper swam away from the boat towards the struggling whale and attempted to liberate it, the baby humpback remained near the man and appeared to be slightly more relaxed. With the men on the boat cheering him on, the skipper attempted to cut the baby humpback free from the net. He struggled to release the whale, despite the suggestions from the men still on the boat. Distressed: The baby whale can be seen struggling to release itself from the cray pot line . What a good bloke: A charter boat's skipper swims out to free the struggling baby humpback . Keep Calm: The baby humpback appears to be less agitated as the fisherman swims closer so he can free it from the cray pot line . 'Cut it closer,’ the man holding the camera directed. 'Don't try and get it off, mate, just cut the line.’ The boat’s skipper attempted to cut the whale free from the rope with a knife, leaving some of the rope remaining – so as not to distress it by getting too close and allowing it to swim free. Eventually, the whale swims free and the men on the boat congratulate the man who did the hard work of actually releasing the baby humpback. 'That's it, go free baby!' the man holding the camera cheers. 'Well done little fella,’ he then said. Free Willy: The whale is able to swim free, after being cut from the cray pot line .

The whale was in the shit, so he jumped in and did it,’ Paddy Brogan said. Mr Brogan also added that his son, who has been working as a skipper for around six years, said releasing the whale was a wonderful feeling.","Distressed baby humpback caught in cray pot lines near Geraldton .
