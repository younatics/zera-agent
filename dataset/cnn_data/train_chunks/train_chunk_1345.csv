"A distraught father has opened up about his grief after his fianceé, three of their children and a family friend were killed when a truck plowed into her car on a Missouri highway. Joshua Hutchison revealed that he was sleeping and missed seven phone calls from Shante Hopkins, 24, after she pulled over on a dimly lit slip road late on Saturday. The devastating accident killed Hopkins, her two daughters, Ja Riah Hutchison, 2, Ja Nijah Hutchison, 1, their seven-month old son Tay Shawn Hutchison and their friend, 17-year-old Dominique Johnson. Scroll Down for Video . Crash: Shante Hopkins passed away in a massive smash on Saturday when an 18-wheel tractor trailer hit her stationary Mazda - killing her, three of her children and her friend . Tragedy: The driver of the truck was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and police think that Hopkins may have run out of gas . 'There is nothing I can do right now I can barely eat, sleep. I am scared to drive myself,' said Hutchison to KCTV5. 'At that time she was calling me and letting me know that she was still on the highway and she needed me. 'She needed my help, but i couldn't help her at the time.' Hopkins, who police revealed was driving on a revoked license was on Interstate 435 at around 5pm when her Mazda came to a halt on the far right traffic lane. Minutes after her last call to her fiancé, Hopkins car was smashed from behind by an 18-wheel tractor trailer - which killed two of the occupants at the scene while the other three died later in hospital. Christmas tragedy: Ja Riah Hutchison, 2, Ja Nijah Hutchison, and seven-month old son Tay Shawn Hutchison were killed in the tragic crash . The driver of the truck has tested negative for drugs or alcohol and has been cooperating fully with police. Kansas City police have said that witness statements and an examination of the crime scene suggest that Hopkins inexplicably stopped in the lane of traffic, despite her car having no history of faults. On Monday, investigators said they were looking into the possibilty that the Mazda suffered a sudden mechanical failure or if the car simply ran out of gas. Speaking to KansasCity.com, Hopkins' parents, Paulette Kelley and Riccardo Smith said that they were beside themselves with grief.

"A council has sent out leaflets telling locals to ‘take a shopping list’ when they go out to buy food - and to put their purchases in the fridge or cupboard. Watford Borough Council sent out the guide - called Your Guide to Reducing Food Waste - to more than 30,000 locals. Some people in the town in Hertfordshire described it as ‘incredible’, while others said they thought it was a ‘prank’. Scroll down for video . 'It's as easy as 1, 2, 3': Watford Borough Council sent out the guide - called Your Guide to Reducing Food Waste - to more than 30,000 locals . Advice includes how to ‘go shopping’, where to put your food and how to use up any leftovers. The leaflet states: ‘Write a shopping list for your meal plan so you only buy what you really need.’ It says in the ‘store correctly’ column: ‘Keep essentials in the cupboard, fridge and freezer and keep an eye on use by and best before dates. 'Did you know you can freeze bread, cheese and milk?’ And advice on leftovers states: ‘Use up leftovers and pull together a delicious meal by combining them with your favourite ingredients.’ Other advice in the leaflet includes how to measure out the correct amount of rice, spaghetti and pasta - so you do not make too much. 'Plan ahead': Advice includes how to ‘go shopping’, where to put your food and how to use up any leftovers . Locals say the advice is ‘insulting’, adding that it seems to be aimed at children rather than adults. One resident, Craig Saunders, 34, said today: ‘When I got the leaflet through the door I thought I’d give it a glance before putting it in the recycling bin. ‘When I read that it said I should put food in the fridge or cupboard and that I should write a shopping list I assumed the leaflet was for children. ‘But no, it’s for us council taxpayers who are too dumb to work out how put away food. 'It’s incredible really, although I didn’t realise you could freeze milk, so I suppose I learned something at least.’ Another local, Sarah Carson, 46, said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I read the leaflet - I thought it was a prank really. HQ: A spokesman for Watford Borough Council (whose Town Hall is pictured) said the leaflet was aimed at reducing the amount of food waste . 'Surely everybody knows to put some foods in the fridge and others in the cupboard. 'And most people are aware that a shopping list is reasonably important when going shopping. 'I know the council might be trying to be helpful, but this leaflet is really just a massive waste of our council tax money.’ A spokesman for the council said the leaflet was aimed at reducing the amount of waste. She added: ‘Recent analysis showed 30 percent of residents’ black bin content is food waste. ‘This costs council taxpayers money in landfill charges, and costs us all in terms of the environmental impact.’ The council's press office did not immediately answer a request from MailOnline to establish how much money was spent on the leaflets.","Watford Borough Council sends Your Guide to Reducing Food Waste guide to 30,000 locals .

"For the 10 per cent of the world's population who are left-handed, writing left to right on paper is a chore; as their hand moves across the page, it often smudges the ink. But a left-handed woman fed up with smudging letters whenever she writes in ink has invented a special glove that will stop 'lefties' from blotting their copy books. The garment covers half of the hand and just the little finger and creates a barrier from the paper to stop any smudging. An entrepreneurial mum inspired by her son has invented a glove to stop left-handed people covering their fingers in ink or pencil while writing. The revolutionary contraption covers half of the hand and the little finger and creates a barrier from the paper to stop any marks staining the skin . Called SmudgeGuard, the glove is made from spandex and nylon and stops any perspiration from the skin touching the page, which is the usual cause for stains. The glove will protect a hand from a variety of substances such as ink, paints, crayons and chalk. It has been invented by Jeannie Lit from New Jersey, who struggles whenever she writes as her hand drags along the page and becomes covered in ink. When she realised her son was also left handed, she decided to invent something that could help him. She made a prototype by cutting up a sock and has now developed the product, which retails at £9.65 ($14.99). Jeannie, 43, from New Jersey in the US, said: 'I'm left handed and when I was writing in school the little finger and underside of my left hand would get graphite or ink on it. 'When I found out my son was left handed too that's when I realised he would have the same exact problem as me. 'I searched high and low online for a solution and I couldn't find any product that could help solve it. 'I made a prototype with a sock which I cut up and made a covering for the little finger, and tested it by writing with pencils, pens, markers and crayons. 'The glove got dirty, but not my hand or the page and that was my ultimate goal. I named the product the SmudgeGuard.' The glove will protect a hand from a variety of implements such as pen, pencil, paints, crayon (shown) and chalk. The gadget is made from spandex and nylon and stops any perspiration from the skin touching the page, which is the usual cause for stains . Frustrating: Using an ink pen when left-handed can make writing neat messages almost impossible . When a person writes their hand can perspire, which makes ink or graphite adhere to the moist skin and causes smudges to appear. Perspiration from a person's hand will then re-smudge the paper. But according to Ms Lit, wearing the SmudgeGuard 'keeps the sweaty hand away from ink or graphite and it will allow your hand to glide over the paper more easily.' The outer fabric also remains dry, making it less likely to re-smudge the paper. The SmudgeGuard comes in two varieties; one style covers just the little finger and the second type covers two fingers. The glove can also be used by tablet users (shown) to prevent their hand sticking to their device. It was invented by Jeannie Lit, who is left handed and struggled when she was writing at school because her hand would drag along the page and become covered in ink . Designers have come up with an eco-friendly alternative to the traditional hairdryer - a pair of revolutionary gloves made from hi-tech microfibres (shown above). The 'Hair Drying Gloves' look just like ordinary gloves and their makers claim they dry wet hair twice as fast as the traditional bathroom towel. The microfibres in the gloves are apparently specifically designed to absorb the water and leave hair completely dry; they even work without removing styling products such as hair gel and hairspray. Online retailer Hammacher Schlemmer, which is selling the gloves for around £13 ($20), say they are the best way to dry hair. Those who get caught in heavy showers can also dry their hair quickly by putting on the handy gloves and rubbing their wet tresses, say the makers. According to Ms Lit, wearing the SmudgeGuard 'keeps the sweaty hand away from ink or graphite and it will allow your hand to glide over the paper more easily.'

"RBS Ross McEwan said he did not wish to be considered for the pay-out in his first full year in charge . The boss of Royal Bank of Scotland is facing a fresh row over fat cat pay as he prepares to collect a £1million windfall. In a bid to avoid negative publicity when he took the helm in October last year, Ross McEwan said he did not wish to be considered for the pay-out in his first full year in charge. But the show of restraint from the New Zealander will cease next August, despite RBS being fined almost £400million last month for rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. It is understood chief executive officer Mr McEwan has no intention of waiving a £1million shares windfall, equivalent to one year’s salary. It would take his maximum pay package for 2015 – including salary, pension and performance-related long term bonuses – to almost £4million. Last night one MP described the award as ‘wholly inappropriate’ and said Mr McEwan and fellow bosses should show some ‘moral backbone’ and forfeit their windfalls. To get around the bonus cap, most of the major banks introduced additional payments – known as fixed ‘role-based’ allowances – on top of annual bonuses to ensure top executives are not left out of pocket. The EU bonus cap limits banks to paying a maximum of one year’s fixed pay, rising to twice this if shareholders approve. But the new pay-outs are guaranteed and count as part of an executive’s basic pay package, pushing up the maximum bonus that can be awarded. Last night one senior banking insider suggested Mr McEwan would be unable to waive his pay-out even if he wanted to, because this would breach ‘the spirit’ of the EU laws which dictate these payments are not discretionary, unlike bonuses. But John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury Select Committee, described this as ‘nonsense’. He said: ‘It is wholly inappropriate for a taxpayer-owned bank that’s mired in scandal to be awarding bonuses at all. 'Claiming that “Europe made us do it” is total nonsense. It’s about time these bankers showed some moral backbone.’ The UK’s big four high street banks have handed out £30million in share awards to their top management this year in their efforts to sidestep Brussels’ cap on banker bonuses. The biggest award of role-based allowances to a management team was at HSBC, which handed chief executive Stuart Gulliver £1.7million in share awards. In a bid to avoid negative publicity when he took the helm in October last year, Mr McEwan said he did not wish to be considered for the pay-out in his first full year in charge . RBS handed out shares worth almost £5.5million to its ten most senior bankers – with the exception of Mr McEwan. His £1million windfall will be paid in instalments over five years. RBS has squandered every penny of taxpayers’ rescue cash after racking up £46billion in losses since the financial crisis – more than £1,500 for every taxpayer in the UK. It made losses of £8.2billion last year but still paid out £588million in bonuses. It is expected to be even more generous this year as it is on course to make its first full year profit since the financial crisis. Luke Hildyard, of campaign group the High Pay Centre, added: ‘RBS is a government-owned bank – so Mr McEwan is a public servant. To be raking in such a preposterous sum of money will be completely unpalatable to taxpayers.’ He added: ‘These bonuses are clearly not rewarding good behaviour as banks are rotten to the core with scandal and bad practice. More than six years have passed since RBS was bailed out to the tune of £46billion, yet there is precious little sign of taxpayers getting their money back. In the meantime, RBS has lurched from one scandal to the next – from duping thousands of customers into buying worthless insurance, to allegations it deliberately drove small businesses to the wall to boost its profits. Most of the fiascos happened before Mr McEwan took over – and he has pledged to clean up the bank. Last month RBS was fined almost £400million for rigging the foreign exchange market. It was also fined £700million for manipulating ‘Libor’ interest rates – used to set mortgage rates for millions of homeowners. And so far it has set aside £3.3billion to compensate customers who were mis-sold payment protection insurance. All the efforts to circumvent the bonus cap and keep paying these huge bonuses show banks are being run in the interests of bankers.’ The UK’s biggest high street lenders will start announcing their bonuses for the past year in the coming weeks. Last month George Osborne withdrew a legal challenge to the EU bonus cap after it was rejected by a key adviser to the European Court of Justice. The Treasury had argued the cap would inflate basic pay, making it harder for banks to trim costs in lean years, while also causing top staff to move to US and Asian rivals. RBS declined to comment on Mr McEwan yesterday.","Ross McEwan did not accept the pay-out in his first full year in charge .

"A terrified couple on board the faulty Virgin Atlantic jet which made a dramatic emergency landing at Gatwick yesterday have revealed how they sent text messages with their final goodbyes to relatives. Plumber Dean Turner and his wife Stacy sent the messages after cabin crew on board flight VS43 told them to brace as the plane came into land with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop. The couple were on board the Boeing 747 bound for Las Vegas with their three children Khenya, 16, Ellie 13, and four-year-old Maisie. Scroll down for video . Dean Taylor, with wife Stacy and daughters Khenya, Ellie and Maisie. The family sent text messages with their final goodbyes to relatives when the Virgin Atlantic jet they were travelling on was forced to make an emergency landing at Gatwick airport yesterday . But after the jet took off from Gatwick, it developed a problem with the landing gear, and for several hours, the plane circled the airport and made several low-altitude passes so engineers could inspect the problem. And after the passengers were told to brace for an emergency landing, Mr Turner, 42, and Mrs Turner, 40 from Haverigg in Cumbria, the couple were left wondering if they were going to survive. Mr Turner said: 'We text our final goodbyes on the plane to family saying we didn't know if we would survive. Me and my husband just looked at each other and thought ""this is it"". It was horrific.' The family had initially planned to go to New York to bring in the New Year but when they discovered there were no hotel rooms in the city available, they decided to switch their trip to Las Vegas instead, paying £6,500. The Virgin Atlantic jet was forced to make the landing at Gatwick after t developed a problem with the landing gear and touched down with only three quarters of its landing gear down . Mrs Turner said: 'Khenya had major surgery in the summer because she had scoliosis and had to have spinal fusion. This was supposed to be a treat for her. 'She has a heart defect and previously had open heart surgery and survived meningitis. And now with this too, we think we must have a guardian angel watching us. She's blessed. 'We weren't even supposed to be on that flight because we had originally booked to go to New York but had a refund when there were no hotel rooms left.' Administrator Mrs Turner and her husband said the holiday had been 'doomed' from the start after a nearly 10 hour drive from Haverigg to Gatwick to arrive at a hotel which had no gas. Then an hour into the 11.30am flight yesterday, the pilot announced they would have to turn back to Gatwick. For several hours, the plane circled Gatwick and made several low-altitude passes so engineers could inspect the problem with the landing gear . On landing at Gatwick, Mrs Turner said passengers cheered for the pilot of landing the Boeing 747 safely . She said: 'About 10 minutes later the pilot said we were going to have to dump some fuel. We spent about an hour pouring fuel off the wings. It was horrific. We didn't know the extent of the problem. 'They said we would be landing at 1.15pm but it came and went. 'We started to think something's not right. They started to take pictures under the plane while we were in the air so they could see what the problem was and then they said one of the wheels was stuck. 'The pilot said they were going to shake the plane to get the wheel down. It was the worst feeling you can imagine. 'He went extremely fast from one side to the other four or five times and that freaked people out. 'We knew he was going to do it but it was horrific. It didn't work so he told us he was going to put on full throttle and drop. It was like zero gravity. It was so quick. It was like being on the world's worst roller coaster. 'People were being sick and people had nosebleeds. There were a lot of scared people. Ellie thought she was going to die. She was screaming on the plane. Emergency services were on stand by at Gatwick when the plane came into land after passengers were told to brace for landing . 'The shaking didn't work so the pilot said he was going to have to burn fuel by flying round and round to make the plane lighter. 'We had been on there for quite a long time by this point and people were desperate for the toilet so he levelled it out and the queue was all the way down the aisle. 'He then told us we were going to do an emergency landing. 'At this point we were terrified. We had to get into the bracing position and the plane went deadly silent. 'They shouted ""brace, brace, brace"" and then ""head down, feet back"" over and over again. 'They thought we were going to go off the runway because the wheel hadn't come down so it was harder for them to break. 'But when we landed it was really smooth, just like any other flight and everybody cheered. 'The cabin crew and pilot were brilliant. I couldn't fault them.' The family have since been given a complete refund for the flight and were last night put up in the Hilton hotel. Mrs Turner explained: 'They had clean clothes and dinner waiting for us. They offered us another plane but we were all traumatised. 'They've offered counselling and a course to help us get over our fear of flying now. If we get on a plane again it will have to be a very short flight. 'We've watched things like this on the news but we never thought it would happen to us. My dad was tracking the plane and friends were watching the news. The hero pilot who landed the flight was today revealed to be father-of-three David Williams, pictured, who said he was 'just doing my job' 'Maisie slept through most of it. She had no idea what was going on when I told her to put her head down. Then when we got off the plane she said to me ""is this Las Vegas?""' Today the hero pilot who safely landed the stricken Virgin plane was revealed to be 47-year-old senior pilot David Williams. The father-of-three, who has more than 20 years' flying experience, remained modest about his heroics - but admitted the incident had been 'out of the ordinary'. In a brief statement, he said: 'All of our pilots at Virgin Atlantic are trained to the highest standards and we go through regular testing to deal with any scenario that may arise. 'Clearly this was an out of the ordinary landing but I was just doing my job and any one of our pilots would have taken the same actions.' He added: 'I'm really proud of my colleagues on the ground and in the air and the support they gave me during this event – everyone worked really hard in a difficult situation and we are delighted that our customers were able to travel to Las Vegas the next day for their New Year's Eve celebrations. 'Thank you for your interest and I hope you can respect my request for privacy as I am keen to spend some private time with my family over the New Year.'","Dean and Stacy Turner were due to fly to Las Vegas with their daughters .

"The son of a North Korean aide linked to Kim Jong-un's executed uncle is believed to be on the run in France after evading abduction by agents of the communist regime. According to diplomatic sources, the man - identified only by his surname Han - has escaped detection amid fears he may be forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed. The architecture student has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason in December 2013. Scroll down for video . The student disappeared after his father was executed by the regime led by Kim-Jong-Un (pictured) He disappeared last month while studying at Paris' prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette and speculation was rife as to whether the student had been captured or was hiding out in France. But now a diplomatic source has revealed that despite attempts to force Han to return to North Korea, the student has evaded capture as is 'somewhere in France', The Telegraph reported. Park Sung-jin, Paris correspondent for Yonhap, South Korea's biggest news agency which broke the story, told the newspaper: 'Since the 1980s, when the regime changes and someone is executed and his relatives and friends and family are studying abroad, they are brought home. 'If Han returned he would likely be kept in a political prison or executed. That has happened many times. He knew what was awaiting him, so he escaped.' Han disappeared last month while studying at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette (pictured) There are fears that the student may be forcibly taken back to the North Korea to be executed (pictured, Kim Jong-Un during a ceremony for officials and personnel in the fishery field of the Korean People's Army) Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer. The student had been enrolled at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government. The disappearance comes amid high tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in the wake of the Sony Entertainment hacking scandal and the release of The Interview, a film about the assassination of Kim Jong-un. As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations. However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities. Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup. Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors . According to reports the student may have escaped his captors, but it is not known if he was recaptured or if he is hiding somewhere in France (Kim Jong-un pictured on a visit to a fish factory in North Korea) In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'. Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out. There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks. However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle.","The student - identified only as Han - disappeared in Paris last month .

"A suburban New York  judge smashed into another car while driving drunk in Manhattan following a Christmas party and then tried to persuade police to let him go because of his position, according to reports. Harrison Town Justice Marc Lust, 63, was arrested on driving while intoxicated and other charges on December 19, shortly after 5pm. Police said his Jaguar rear-ended another car in midtown Manhattan and then he tried to drive off from the accident between 34th and 35th streets on 10th Avenue. Lust told police that he was a judge and would 'take care of this'. Harrison Town Justice Marc Lust was arrested on driving while intoxicated and other charges on December 19 in Manhattan. Police said that he tried to use his powers as a judge to get out of the charges . He was unsteady, slurred his words and told them he'd had three drinks at a Christmas party, according to police. The judge refused to take a breathalyzer test, according to lohud.com. The judge was charged with misdemeanor DWI and violations, driving while ability impaired and leaving the scene of an accident. He was held in a cell overnight and arraigned the following day. The judge was released on $2,500 bail and had his license suspended. He is due back in Manhattan Criminal Court on January 22. He is allowed to continue to serve as a judge because he has not been charged with any felonies, lohud.com reported. Lust's lawyer, Andrew Quinn, says prosecutors inaccurately characterized Lust as trying to trade on his judgeship. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Mr Lust on Tuesday. Lust is one of Harrison's two part-time justices. He was first elected in 1999. He ran on both the Republican and Democratic lines in 2011. He is also a partner at DOPF, P.C., a powerful defense litigation firm in New York City.

Samsung is set to unveil the two new speakers - called WAM7500 (left) and WAM6500 (right - at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week. They use ‘breakthrough’ Ring Radiator technology, which the Korean firm claims allows ‘sound to flow in a 360-degree radius’ Samsung also said this technology creates the perfect balance between treble and bass - but did not reveal more about how its proprietary version of the technology works. The two speakers are called WAM7500 and WAM6500, and both claim to fill entire rooms with sound. The former is a stand-type speaker, which means it is typically fixed to one location, while the latter is a portable version with a built-in battery. Both are Bluetooth enabled, and can be connected to TVs, mobiles, tablets and soundbars. Speakers typically produce sound using an electromagnet that moves a cone to create sound waves. Drivers are then used to translate electrical signals into physical vibrations that produce the sound. These include a tweeter, which creates a high frequency, a midrange, and a woofer which creates low frequencies. A dome tweeter is made using a voice coil attached to the dome, with a front plate connected to the magnet. As a result, they usually direct sound in limited directions. In a ring radiator, however, the cone or dome is suspended, which means there are less restrictions on which direction the sound can travel and flow. ‘We know how much people love music and that’s why we are expanding our portfolio to bring high-quality, wireless audio into the home,’ said Jurack Chae, senior vice president at Samsung Electronics. ‘With the new WAM7500/6500 people can enjoy a vibrant sound wherever they are.’ Speakers typically produce sound using an electromagnet that moves a cone to create sound waves.

"Apple has patented a 'smart pen' that can capture handwriting and drawings and send them to an iPad or iPhone. The 'Communicating stylus' application outlines a pen that uses accelerometers, wireless communication hardware and onboard storage to transfer hand-written notes and drawings to a tablet. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office drawings, revealed today, show the pen could be used in a meeting to automatically send images to all participant's phones, for instance. Apple's pen would capture writing and pictures and send them to an iPad or iPhone . Apple's stylus is based on efficient accelerometers or other motion-sensing hardware. In practice, Apple's pen activates only when picked up, its nib is pressed to paper, withdrawn from a dock or manually turned on by the user. From there, onboard sensors track position changes in relation to an initial zero point, allowing the device to send realtime data for translation and graphical representation on an iOS device's screen. 'The technology to build a 'communicating stylus' has long been available should Apple decide to build such a device,' said Apple Insider, which discovered the patent. 'Indeed, most of the hardware mentioned in the patent are already being used in current-generation iPhones and iPads.' Several companies already sell similar products, most notably Livescribe's 'smartpen,, whch uses an infrared camera located in its tip to capture handwriting. This is then stored on the pen's own memory, or sent via wifi, although it needs specialized paper. Apple's stylus is based on  accelerometers or other motion-sensing hardware. It activates only when picked up, its nib is pressed to paper, withdrawn from a dock or manually turned on by the user, according to the filings. From there, onboard sensors track position changes in relation to an initial zero point, allowing the device to send realtime data for translation and graphical representation on an iOS device's screen. However, Apple founder Steve Jobs famously despised stylus pens. 'Who wants a stylus?' Jobs said at the 2007 MacWorld conference. 'You have to get 'em, and put 'em away. You lose 'em. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.' Despite this, Apple's filing shows the stylus can be configured to transmit movement data after a certain amount is collected, at predefined intervals or continuously, depending on user need. the stylus could be used with different nibs or pen heads to write on different materials . Another option is sending out stylus data to multiple devices, perhaps as meeting notes. The patent also includes details of how the stylus could be used with different nibs or pen heads to write on different materials, so that it can be used with ink in notebooks, or with graphite for pencil drawings, or with markers for whiteboards. Apple's invention can even be fitted with multiple accelerometers to measure movement in three dimensions, thus producing an accurate digital copy of stylus motion at any angle, whether it be on a desk, wall or in the air. Apple says users can transmit data to a computing device that remains in their pocket or bag, a seamless solution for saving digital backups of physical notes. A capacitive version that can be used as a traditional iPad stylus is also mentioned. Apple's smart pen patent was first filed for in January 2010 and credits Aleksandar Pance as its inventor.","Pen would capture writing and pictures and send to an iPad or iPhone .

"American parents are set to be given the option to have their the genomes of healthy newborn babies sequenced as part of a government-funded research program that could herald a revolution in medicine. The National Institutes of Health last year awarded a combined $25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns. Now, they are set to begin testing for some parents within weeks. Testing could even result in 'genetic passports' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment, such as choosing the most effective asthma medication. Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children's Hospital are set to begin testing within weeks. Parents of several hundred healthy and sick newborn infants will be offered genomic sequencing in a research setting beginning in early 2015, the hospital says. It will enroll 240 healthy newborn infants and their parents at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and 240 infants and their parents from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Boston Children’s Hospital in the scheme. Experts believe that genome sequencing could one day be part of routine testing done on every baby. This would provide doctors and parents a vast pool of data likely to reveal a wider range of potential medical risks than the traditional heel-prick test, in which a small sample of newborns' blood is taken to check for more than two dozen possible conditions. It could even result in 'genetic passports' which could be used years later to help develop personalized medical treatment, such as choosing the most effective asthma medication. The experiments coma after the National Institutes of Health last year awarded a combined $25 million to four projects looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborns. Participating hospitals include University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which expects in 2015 to begin investigating gene sequencing in both healthy newborns and ill infants, and University of California, San Francisco, which will sequence previous heel-prick samples with the aim of improving the accuracy of newborn screening. Brigham and Women's Hospital, together with Boston Children's Hospital, formed the BabySeq Project earlier this year. Pending final approval, it expects to begin offering gene sequencing next year to some parents of healthy and sick newborns. It also comes as a major new study suggests that if newborn genomic testing becomes available, there would be robust interest among new parents, regardless of their demographic background . The study, led by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Boston Children's Hospital, found that the majority of parents surveyed were interested in newborn genomic testing. As next-generation whole-exome and genome sequencing is integrated into clinical practice, researchers and clinicians are increasingly interested in genomic testing as a way to provide valuable personalized health information for newborns beyond what existing standard newborn genetic screening produces. But such testing, done shortly after birth, will require the interest and consent of new parents. a major new study suggests that if newborn genomic testing becomes available, there would be robust interest among new parents, regardless of their demographic background . 'Several other studies have measured parents' interest in newborn genomic screening, but none focused on new parents in the first 48 hours,' said Robert C. Green, MD, MPH, a geneticist and researcher at BWH and Harvard Medical School and senior author of the study. 'Since this is when genomic testing would be of the greatest value, it is especially important to study parents' attitudes immediately post-partum.' The researchers surveyed 514 parents at the well baby nursery at BWH within 48 hours of their child's birth. After receiving a brief orientation to the genome and its impacts on human health, 82.7 percent of parents reported being somewhat (36 percent), very, (28 percent) or extremely (18 percent) interested in newborn genomic testing. Results were similar regardless of parents' age, gender, race, ethnicity, level of education, family history of genetic disease, or whether or not the infant was a first-born child. Parents who had experienced concerns about the health of their newborn, however, were less likely to be interested in genomic testing. The study was also the first to investigate whether asking parents about their interest in newborn genomic testing would cause them to reject existing, state-mandated newborn genetic screening (NBS), one of the most established and successful public health programs in the world. Earlier this year the eleven English centres that will spearhead a genetic revolution in the NHS were named. The Genomic Medicine Centres (GMC) are the heart of the 100,000 Genomes Project, a bold plan to map 100,000 complete genetic codes of patients. Scientists and doctors hope the £300 million initiative will transform medicine by uncovering DNA data that can be used to develop personalised diagnostic procedures and drugs. More than 100 patients with cancer and rare inherited diseases have already had their genomes sequenced during the project's pilot phase. The first wave of GMCs will be linked to NHS trusts in 11 locations covering London, Manchester, Oxford, Birmingham, Cambridge, Southampton, Exeter and Newcastle. Ultimately the aim is to secure the participation of more than 100 NHS trusts over the project's three-year lifespan. Combining information from DNA samples with patients' health records will improve the prediction and prevention of cancers and rare diseases, experts believe. It should also aid the development of more targeted diagnostic tests and drug treatments tailored to patients' genetic make-up. Although strict security measures are in place to protect the identity and private details of patients, universities and drug companies will be allowed to use the data for research. Life Sciences Minister George Freeman described the establishment of the centres as 'historic'. 'If even one parent had rejected it, that would have been a problem,' said Susan Waisbren, PhD, lead author of the study and a psychologist and researcher in the Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston Children's and Harvard Medical School. 'But out of over 500 parents surveyed, not one of them questioned or rejected NBS.' The study was also the first to survey parents separately. Most couples were in agreement about their level of interest in newborn genomic testing. 'About 75 percent of couples were in concordance,' Waisbren said. 'This suggests that both parents should be involved when we are addressing concerns they may have about newborn genomic testing.' 'Parents' strong interest in genomic screening for their newborns, as demonstrated by this study, underscores the importance of further research exploring the public health impacts of actually providing this testing,' said Green, 'particularly as it continues to become less expensive and more widely available.'","Four US hospitals looking at different aspects of gene sequencing in newborn babies .

"Her children were left devastated after her husband - their father - passed away from lung cancer. So one Canadian mother found a way to keep his spirit alive - by making pillows out of his clothes. Using her late spouse's flannel shirts, the mother created memorial pillows, before attaching heartfelt notes 'from Dad' to the fabric. She then gave them to her two children as gifts on Christmas Day. Touching: A Canadian mother created this memorial pillow from her late husband's flannel shirt. She then fixed a note to it, reading: 'This is a shirt I used to wear. And when you hold it I’ll be there. Love Dad xoxo' One of the notes, written on brown paper by the woman's sister-in-law and sewn onto the pillow via a piece of string, reads: 'This is a shirt I used to wear. And when you hold it I’ll be there. Love Dad xoxo.' On Monday, one of the children posted a photo of their pillow to Reddit, saying: 'My father passed away from lung cancer in July. Mom had these gifts made for me and my brother.' The user, known only as Velaniswin, later uploaded a picture of their brother's pillow, as well as an image of their father donning the same flannel shirt that was used to create the keepsake.

"She is the girl who was shot in the head because she wanted girls to be able to go to school and he was the boy whose positive attitude to terminal cancer led people to donate millions to help other teenagers with the disease. Malala Yousafzai, 17, who was shot by the Taliban two years ago, and Stephen Sutton of Staffordshire, have been named as the most inspirational people of 2014. The pair appear on a list of influential figures and moments of the last 12 months, which also includes the poppy installation at Tower Bridge. The installation saw millions of people flock to see dozens of ceramic poppies placed in the moat to remember those who died in the First World War 100 years ago. Malala Yousafzai (left) has been voted the most inspirational person of 2014 for her work campaigning for all to have access to education, followed by teenager cancer victim Stephen Sutton (right), in a poll . The poll also asked people to name the most inspirational moment of 2014 - with the poppies installation at the Tower of London, where hundreds of ceramic poppies were placed in the moat - earning top place . Malala achieved the top spot on the list for her work campaigning for young people to have the right to an education. The 17-year-old, of Birmingham, was undeterred after she was shot by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2012 as she boarded a bus. Her work saw her become the youngest person ever to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The inspirational list was created from a survey of 2,000 people and is supported by the Discovery Channel TV station. Stephen Sutton, 19, of Burntwood in Staffordshire, raised £5million for charity after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. His positive attitude to his cancer diagnosis saw the teenager track his battle with the disease on a blog and post a 'final thumbs up' which was shared around the world and saw people donate millions to his chosen charity, Teenage Cancer Trust. The pair were placed above Prince Harry who claimed third place for his role in creating the Invictus Games which was an international Paralympic-style event for wounded and injured armed services personnel. Prince Harry appeared on the list of the most inspirational people after he organised the Invictus Games . Dozens of flags were planted near Asnelles, France, to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings . The D-Day Anniversary and the UK remaining united following the Scottish referendum in September were also cited as being 'inspirational moments'. The research also explored the events we feel have most inspired the nation in the last twelve months. The famous poppy installation, named 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' which featured 888,246 ceramic poppies planted in the moat at the Tower of London and was created by artist Paul Cummins, topped the poll. Alex Salmond (right) stood down as Scottish First Minister following his defeat in the Scottish Referendum when the nation voted yes for Scotland to remain part of the UK, rather than an independent country . The D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations were the second most inspirational moment of the past 12 months. This was followed by Scotland failing to win independence in September and remaining in the UK. Same sex marriage and the Rosetta Probe landing on Philae Comet also featured in the list.

"A shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in 'conveyor-belt' healthcare according to experts . New mothers are sent home from hospital more quickly in Britain than anywhere else in the EU. A shortage of midwives and beds is resulting in ‘conveyor-belt’ care that can put mother and baby’s health at risk, experts warn. The average hospital stay for a normal delivery in Britain is just 1.5 days, a major report revealed yesterday, compared with an EU average of 3.6. French mothers typically stay for 4.2 days, while in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia they stay for five. Britain’s maternity wards have been under pressure for years, largely because the birth rate has outstripped government expectations – rising by almost a quarter in the last decade – meaning not enough midwives have been recruited. Staff are concerned that too many exhausted mothers are sent home before they have properly recovered from labour, or got to grips with basic baby care. Yesterday’s OECD report states: ‘The average length of stay for a normal delivery in EU countries ranges from less than two days, in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, to five days or more in [Slovakia], Romania and Hungary.’ It warns: ‘Too short a stay could also cause adverse effects on health outcomes, or reduce the comfort and recovery of the patient.’ Cathy Warwick, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘Midwives are under pressure to get women home earlier and earlier ... women in labour are basically queuing for a bed, so those in the post-natal wards have to be discharged far more quickly than we would like.’ She added: ‘Midwives say too often it feels conveyor belt-like ... they are under pressure to get a woman out and home.’ Elizabeth Duff of the National Childbirth Trust said: ‘This is a complex issue ... having a short stay may be the right thing for women who’ve had straightforward births as they often feel better at home.’ However, she added it is ‘crucial that women are not sent home before they are ready due to a lack of hospital staff, or leave because they want to get away from chaotic postnatal wards’. Simon Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale, said: ‘Even Mary was allowed to stay in the stable for longer than one-and-a-half days ... what the Government needs to do is recruit more midwives.’ The study, which examined every EU nation except Estonia, found that stays have become shorter ‘in nearly all countries over the past decade’, with Britain’s average falling from 1.8 days in 2000. The report did not distinguish between first babies and subsequent pregnancies, which typically result in quicker deliveries. Dr Catherine Calderwood, clinical director for maternity at NHS England, said: ‘Although many women prefer to go home as soon as possible, it is vital that they receive the care and support they need after they give birth. ‘This is why new mums will only return home once they are well enough and ready, and will continue to receive postnatal care from a community midwife for up to 28 days after giving birth.’","The average stay in hospital for a new mother after giving birth is 1.5 days .

"Parents who move house and shell out for private tutors are paying as much for their child's education as those who send them to private school, says a top headmaster. Alun Jones, the new president of the Girls' Schools Association has said that referring to independent schools as bastions of 'elite and privilege' is outdated as many mothers and fathers are supplementing their youngster school in other ways. He also added that a significant proportion of 'social apartheid' in the UK's schools is down to geography, with some families able to afford expensive housing close to an 'exclusive' state schools, rather than paying for private school fees. Alun Jones, the new president of the Girls' Schools Association, has said that parents who shell out for private tutors are paying as much for their child's education as those who send them to private school (file picture) Mr Jones is the principal of St Gabriel's school in Newbury and is the first man to be appointed to the post of president of the Girls' Schools Association. Speaking ahead of taking up the role, Mr Jones insisted that it is time to banish 'stereotypical, out-of-date' references to the independent sector. He said: 'It's going back to the old 1970s class war, it's so outdated, the reference to the independent sector as that type of elite and privilege. 'My school, like many, many other GSA schools, are real world schools where mum and dad are working very hard to prioritise their income to benefit their children. 'And it's funny, I would say 80 per cent of the social apartheid one sees in schools at the moment is actually because of geography, and some parents can access incredible education and incredibly successful schools because they can afford incredibly expensive housing in expensive areas of the country. 'There is a question over what is the greatest privilege - paying school fees or moving into an expensive area. 'Some parents will actually prioritise their household income in order to make significant sacrifices to send their children to independent school, other parents will choose to look at geographical locations of where to buy and will be able to afford incredibly expensive housing in what they consider to be a far better school area. Mr Jones is the principal of St Gabriel's Girl's School in Newbury and says that referring to independent schools as bastions of 'elite and privilege' is outdated . 'They supplement this with tutors and extra lessons in all sorts of other activities. 'This does mean that some state schools can end up being more exclusive than many independent schools.' Mr Jones also added that the independent sector is doing all it can to improve access, with GSA schools currently spending more than £63 million on offering bursaries to pupils. Over half of those that receive means-tested financial help have more than half of their fees paid for them. Mr Jones, who has been principal of St Gabriel's, an independent girls' day school, since 2001, said private schools also offer as standard a broad curriculum and range of extra-curricular activities to their pupils. One of his aims this year, he said, is to encourage greater engagement between fee-paying schools and government, adding that the independent sector is an important part of education in the UK. He added: 'I actually think, for example, this constant bashing that we're getting to start academies, a good number of our schools do that, and are doing it very successfully, but that's only scratching the surface, that's only part of the picture. 'I think at the moment, nine out of 10 GSA schools are working in partnership with the state sector, I certainly do in Newbury.'","Alun Jones says many parents are supplementing their child's education .

"The full chaotic state of Nick Clegg's flagship free school meals project was exposed last night. Freedom of Information requests by the Mail and a survey by Labour reveal that schools in a third of areas are still failing to give all their pupils a 'hot and nutritious' meal. Three months after the £1billion policy was supposed to have been implemented up to 30 per cent of pupils in some parts of the country are refusing the free meals and eating their own packed lunches. Nearly 300,000 four to seven-year-olds are failing to claim their free meal, with many parents concerned over the quality of lunches at some schools. Hot issue: Nick Clegg, pictured eating lunch at a primary school, as his flagship free school meal project was branded 'chaotic' Figures also show that councils have been forced to raid their budgets for millions of pounds to meet the cost of the project, despite the Lib Dems claiming it was 'fully funded'. Some schools have given up entirely on the idea of providing hot and healthy food at lunchtime. Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: 'Nick Clegg's 'free' school meals policy is clearly collapsing in chaos amid a litany of his failures to heed warnings and his broken promises to pupils and their parents. 'He announced the policy without doing the maths first and it is families who are paying the price. Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted. 'It is not acceptable that schools are forced to raid their budgets to pay for a policy that was introduced on a political timetable.' Mr Clegg secured funding for the free school meals project in exchange for allowing the Tories to fulfil their manifesto commitment to a tax break for married couples. The Government set itself the target for take-up of 87 per cent but even that level has been achieved only in about 40 per cent of local authorities. In total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch, compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal . In total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch, compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal. Southend in Essex said take-up on school census day in October was 70 per cent while Thurrock said it was 73 per cent. Doncaster in South Yorkshire, said its best estimate of take-up was 76 per cent. In Southampton, 78 per cent of eligible pupils took a free meal while in Hampshire take-up was 79.8 per cent. In Lincolnshire it was 79.35 per cent. Take-up in south-eastern England stands at 81.5 per cent and 83 per cent in the east of England and East Midlands. The Labour survey asked councils whether any schools in their area are failing to deliver a 'hot and nutritious meal' for all pupils at the start of the academic year. From the 146 local authorities which replied, 46 schools said they could not offer free meals. Of those, 40 per cent said they expected to be able to do so by the end of this year, 20 per cent said it would be achieved between January and April next year. But 15 per cent said they had no plans to achieve the aim, while 20 per cent said they did not know when they would. One third of councils said they have been forced to use existing funds to pay for the policy because the money from Whitehall did not cover costs. About £2.5million was spent by 15 councils on kitchens to make up the shortfall in funding. That includes £137,000 spent by Sheffield council in Mr Clegg's constituency of Hallam. Some schools have had to have kitchen 'pods' dropped in by crane while others are supplying cold, packed lunches which can be eaten at desks. At one unnamed school in Birmingham children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each. Pupils were rationed according to their age, city council member Valerie Seabright found, with Year One pupils receiving two nuggets and Year Two pupils only three. A Government spokesman said: 'We have made £150million available to fund new kitchen and dining facilities where needed. 'The fact is that more than eight out of ten infants are now enjoying a free school meal at lunchtime, giving them a better start to afternoon lessons and a healthy boost for their first years in school.'","Nick Clegg's £1 billion policy was introduced three months ago .

"Found: Hannah Skakle, 15, went missing on Friday from her home in Marlette, Michigan but was located three days later after allegedly going to stay with a 19-year-old friend she met online . The desperate search for a missing girl in small-town Marlette, Michigan has come to a close after the 15-year-old was found 200 miles away in Kalamazoo. Hannah Skakle disappeared from her home on Friday, December 26, and police at the time speculated that she could have run away to meet someone she connected with online. Marlette Police Chief Brian McGinnis believes their initial theories were true, and says she surfaced three days later when her online friend discovered she was both underage and wanted by authorities in her hometown. McGinnis says the teen left home around 6:30pm Friday and was taken to Kalamazoo by the online friend, who is allegedly 19 but has not been identified as either male or female. Skakle spent several days with this friend and even bleached and cut her hair to avoid recognition. However, McGinnis says on Monday her host read social media posts online showing that she was missing and just 15. Skakle's friend allegedly told her she needed to leave the house, and dropped her off at a women's shelter in the city. The shelter's staff called police, and she was held by local authorities until her parents were able to pick her up that evening around 7pm. Distance: Skakle left home around 6:30pm on Friday and surfaced the following Monday at a women's shelter in Kalamazoo, Michigan . McGinnis says they are continuing the investigate Skakle's disappearance and so far have not located her online friend. Police plan to issue search warrants to comb through the girl's emails, texting apps and other social media accounts for information that might lead them to the friend, who could face charges of accosting a minor. Skakle is in good health, according to McGinnis, who added that there is no evidence she was sexually assaulted during her three days missing. New hairdo: Marlette Police Chief Brian McGinnis says Hannah cut and bleached her hair during the three days she was missing to avoid detection . McGinnis says Skakle has been evasive with police during questioning, but that she is answering some of the questions. She told police that she had been in contact with her friend for about two months using phones she borrowed from her friends at school. When she initially went missing, her parents told authorities they did not believe she had her own phone. 'This was a scary situation for everybody involved. She did not have a phone, she borrowed friends’ phones to access this social media stuff and try to make contact with this person. So, parents just can’t be careful enough,' McGinnis told CBS Detroit. 'This could have had a very bad, tragic ending. We’re glad it didn’t, however it does not stop here. We just need to be more vigilant as parents and as law enforcement as well.' The Sanilac County Prosecutor's Office, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI assisted in the investigation.","Hannah Skakle of Marlette, Michigan was first reporting missing Friday .

"Homeowners have seen £800 wiped off the value of their property since the summer as the market cools, new figures have shown. The average home in England and Wales has now fallen from a peak of £177,400 in August to £176,600 in November, according to the Land Registry. House prices are still up by 7 per cent over the year, but have dropped steadily every month since August. The average home in England and Wales has now fallen from a peak of £177,400 in August to £176,600 in November . This means that as growth across many parts of Britain slows, the best time to sell your home may well have passed. In London, prices have dropped from £462,300 to £461,500 in three months, after peaking in the summer. Economists have claimed that the London market slowed as it reached an affordability ceiling after months of steep price rises. Experts also said the mortgage market review, which placed tougher restrictions on mortgage lending, had cooled the market. Introduced in April, the rules ensure banks carry out more checks on borrowers’ finances before agreeing to lend to them. Mark Harris, of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the figures offered ‘growing evidence of a slowdown in the housing market’. He added: ‘We expect uncertainty around the election to keep the housing market fairly subdued until after May.’ Estate agents Savills has predicted that property prices will flatline in London in 2015 but rise by 10 per cent on average elsewhere in Britain over the next 12 months. But as workers are forced out of the capital, prices have rocketed in neighbouring counties, rising by £11,000 in Surrey over the last three months. They also rose by £9,000 in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, about £6,000 in Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Kent and Hampshire and £5,000 in Essex. Prices in the north and midlands have also risen by at least £1,000 since August and are yet to peak, experts said. In London, prices have dropped from £462,300 to £461,500 in three months, after peaking in the summer . Counties experiencing price hikes include large parts of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and the west Midlands. Richard Donnell, at market analysis firm Hometrack, said recently: ‘The pick-up in house prices that started two years ago has spread across all UK cities. ‘By the end of the year, we could well see monthly house price growth in London slipping below that of some of major cities outside the south east.’ Flats and terraced houses have suffered the greatest fall in value since the summer, averaging £1,360 less in November than in August. This compares to a more modest fall of £530 for detached homes, and a rise of £720 for semi-detached houses, according to Land Registry. Separate research found yesterday that the gap between London house prices and the rest of the country is at an all-time high. The gap has doubled in the last six years from £100,000 to almost £219,000, Nationwide said. The gulf has grown steadily since the 1990s but surged last year as London prices accelerated far beyond the rest of the country. The most expensive sale in November was the London borough of Camden, where a home sold for £8.5million . The building society blamed a lack of supply in London and a rise in foreign investment, which pushes up prices. The gap between London and the rest of the UK is now 116 per cent, meaning it costs more than double to buy in the capital than elsewhere. This compares to 20 years ago when homes in the capital cost 29 per cent more and the gap was just £15,700, 14 times less than the current £219,000 difference. The most expensive sale in November was the London borough of Camden, where a home sold for £8.5million. The cheapest sales were in Burnley, Lancashire where two properties sold for £15,000 each. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: ‘The gap is the largest it has ever been. One factor which may have boosted demand in London more than elsewhere could be the foreign demand in property, which has boosted the market. ‘There may also have been better wage growth in London and demand may be more likely to outstrip the supply.’","The average house price in England and Wales has now fell to £176,600 .

"A former television presenter in Turkey has been held by police after posting a tweet suggesting a cover-up in a government corruption scandal. Sedef Kabas revealed she was being questioned after telling her Twitter followers not to forget the name of a judge who dropped a corruption and bribery probe in the country earlier this year. She later confirmed that officers had seized her laptop computer, her iPad and her telephone, according to reports in Turkey. Former television presenter Sedef Kabas (pictured) has been held by police after posting a tweet suggesting a cover-up in a government corruption scandal . The government has yet to confirm the detention of Kabas amid claims of deteriorating media freedoms in the country. The corruption scandal, which broke last year, implicated people close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and led to the ouster of four ministers, AP reports. The government - pointing to an alleged plot to remove it from office by followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential US-based Muslim cleric - moved to reassign hundreds of police, prosecutors and judges, including those involved in the case. The case was later dropped, leading to accusations from the opposition of a cover-up. Meanwhile, a judicial body which oversees judges and prosecutors has suspended four prosecutors  who had initiated the corruption probes, pending the outcome of an investigation into whether they had abused their powers. The corruption scandal, which broke last year, implicated people close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured) and led to the ouster of four ministers . The prosecutors, whom the government has accused of being close to Gulen, face possible ouster from their profession. Earlier this month, police raided a newspaper and a TV station close to Gulen's movement, detaining journalists, producers and even scriptwriters, sparking criticism from the European Union and the United States. Last week, a teenager was briefly arrested at his school for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a student protest.","Sedef Kabas questioned by police after posting message on Twitter feed .

"An Alabama couple say they ended up in a modern-day equivalent of a debtor's jail after they had failed to pay court fees in connection to a minor traffic violation as their young son lay dying in the hospital. Tim Fugatt, a music pastor from Sylacauga, Alabama, was pulled over in Childersburg in December 2010 and issued a ticket for driving with an expired tag on his license plate. At the time of the traffic stop, Mr Fugatt was returning home from visiting his terminally ill infant son, Cole, suffering from a rare brain disease. When it rains, it pours: Tim Fugatt, a music pastor from Alabama was driving home from visiting his dying son, Cole (pictured) in the hospital when he was pulled over for driving with expired tag on his license plate . Fined: Kristy Greer-Fugatt (right) also had received fines for a pair of traffic violations around the same time . Fugatt's wife of 12 years, Kristy, also had received tickets for two traffic violations, and both husband and wife were ordered to appear at the Childersburg Municipal Court. The couple told a judge about their gravely ill child and were both found not guilty, but the judge ruled they still had to pay $500 in court fees. Mr Fugatt, who also has two older children, said at the time of his young son's illness he could not hold down a steady job because he was spending much of his time at the hospital, according toPBS' NewsHour. When the family were unable to come up with the necessary funds to cover the court costs, their case was turned over to the Judicial Corrections Services, a private company that collects fines for the City of Childersburg. A short time later, Mr Fugatt said he received a notice from the company threatening him and his wife with jail. 'They would just plain out say, you know, “If you can’t pay then they’ll issue you a warrant for your arrest,""' Fugatt recalled in an interview with NewsHour, which initially broke the story in April. The debt collectors made good on their threat in 2012 when the Fugatts stopped making payments and Kristy Greer-Fugatt missed one of their court dates. ‘I felt completely like a criminal,’ the Alabama pastor recalled. ‘I mean I didn’t sell drugs. I didn’t break into anyone’s home. I didn’t kill anybody. I had an expired tag.’ The couple were sprung from jail a few hours after being taken into custody when a relative paid a portion of their debt. Verdict: When the couple explained to a judge that their son was dying from a rare brain disease, the Fugatts were found not guilty of the traffic infractions, but they were still ordered to pay $500 in court fees . Hard times: Fugatt he could not hold onto a steady job because he was spending much of his time with his ailing son at the hospital . Fuggat's son, Cole, passed away June 10, 2011, from his brain disease, survived by his older brother and sister. The couple have since joined a class action lawsuit filed by the non-profit civil rights organization the Southern Poverty Law Center against the Judicial Corrections Services and the City of Childersburg. The suit alleges that jailing people who cannot afford to pay fines is in violations of the US Constitution. In 1971, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution prohibits imposing 'a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.' In the Fugatts' case, they were found not guilty of committing traffic violations but still ended up behind bars when they were unable to pay the court fees. David Dinelli, deputy legal director of SPLC, estimates 1,000 people are sent to jail every month in Alabama because they cannot afford to pay a fine . ‘Everyone thinks that debtor’s prison is over, it’s behind us,’ he told NewsHour. ‘It isn’t. As a matter of practice, and in some cases, policy, the courts ask one question, “Can you pay the fine.” If you can’t then you have to what’s called “sit it out in jail.”’ Debtor's jail: In 2012, Tim and Kristy Fugatt (pictured here with their two surviving children) were briefly thrown in jail for falling behind on their payments to a private debt collector that had taken over their case . Striking back: Mr Fuggat, seen here with his daughter, has filed a lawsuit against the Judicial Corrections Services claiming that jailing people who cannot afford to pay fines is in violations of the US Constitution . Private contractors like JCS do not charge the city anything to collect debts, but they pass the cost of doing business onto offenders like the Fugatts, charging them $45 a month on top of a start-up fee until the entire debt is paid in full. In the first four months after the court ruling, the family managed to pay off $300 of the $500 they owed in court fees. But then things took a turn for the worse. After their son passed away in June 2011, the family lost their home to foreclosure. The parents were in deep mourning, and Tim Fugatt said he appealed to the JCS to work out a deal with him in light of the circumstance, but his plea fell on deaf ears. Still in debt: The couple still owe money to the private contractor after paying down $1,300 . Over the next eight months, the family racked up additional $2,500 in fines for failure to appear in court, and finally in February 2012 a warrant was issued for their arrest. Two years later, the family still owe the private contractor money after paying down $1,300.","Tim Fugatt, music pastor from Alabama, and his wife were arrested in 2012 over failure to pay court fees .

"Apple’s Watch is expected to be the most high profile smartwatch to go on sale next year and will feature a Yahoo news app. But the internet giant has not ruled out creating its own smartwatch too.

Yahoo’s senior vice president of mobile has revealed that the company would consider launching its own smartwatch if a key feature was missing from rival offerings on the market. A stock image of the new company is logo is shown on a tablet, as the firm focuses on making its online offerings more mobile friendly . Speaking to The Financial Times, Adam Cahan admitted that while developers are often reluctant to make hardware, he could ‘never say never’ to Yahoo to making a smart watch. In the meantime, the Californian company, which has one of the most popular websites in America and is known for its search engine and web portal, believes that the Apple Watch presents a big opportunity for Yahoo to attract new mobile users. Yahoo believes that the Apple Watch (pictured) presents a big opportunity for Yahoo to attract new mobile users . A version of Yahoo’s News Digest app, was spotted on the home screen of the Apple Watch which launched on September 9, when the iPhone 6 was also unveiled. The app, which summarises the daily news and links to content, came about due to the acquisition of Summly software, which was created by British teenager Nick D’Aloisio, who is now a product manager at Yahoo. Mr Cahan told Hannah Kuchler that he expects the company and the industry to benefit from growth that will come about from the adoption of wearables such as smartwatches and the internet of things, where household appliances are brought online. He said that Apple is ‘on to a hit’ and that he is ‘very excited about consumer adoption’ and reaching new users. It is rumoured that mass production of the Apple Watch will begin next month, which means it could go on sale this Spring  – and that users could then get their news from Yahoo’s app. The device will cost from $349 (£225) and is the company's foray into wearable computers. Samsung, LG, Motorola and Microsoft are among the companies that have already launched their own smartwatches, but Apple is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch when it finally goes on sale. Yahoo’s Chief Executive, Marissa Mayer, joined the firm from Google in 2012 and has focused on broadening the company’s reach beyond its ‘traditional’ websites to better appeal to smartphone and tablet users. She appointed Mr Cahan to head up the mobile division, which has so far increased its user base from 150 million monthly users to 550 million users and generated $200 in revenue in the last quarter from its mobile products. ‘We started with no team, no products, no users and no revenue and created the whole revolution internally,’ he told The FT. However, the company’s total revenue continues to decline, primarily due to poor advertising figures on its main sites.","Yahoo’s Senior Vice President of Mobile, Adam Cahan, said that he would 'never say never' to the internet giant making its own smartwatch .

"More Australians could choose to holiday domestically after the AirAsia flight QZ8501 disaster caps off the air industry’s deadliest year in a decade, tourism experts say. The Airbus A320-200 was 42 minutes into its flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore, on Sunday, when it vanished with 162 people on board. As bodies of passengers are discovered floating in the Java sea, off the coast of Borneo Island, Australian travellers are expected to reconsider travel plans in the short term. ‘I think what will happen is the safe havens in the world, like Australia, will become more popular… so what we are likely to see is a particular move out of Asia and a much bigger focus on destinations that are very safe,’ economics and tourism expert Brian Haratsis told Daily Mail Australia. The doomed AirAsia flight comes after 1,050 aviation fatalities were already reported in 2014, including two Malaysia Airlines incidences. Air Asia are seen queuing for a plane at Soekarno Hatta International Airport on December 28, on the same day as the AirAsia flight QZ8501 disaster . AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes, center, talks at the crisis center at Juanda International Airport in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia . In July, 298 passengers and crew were killed when Flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine – in an area controlled by pro-Russia separatists – while it was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam. And 239 passengers and crew are missing and presumed dead after Flight MH370, travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, veered far off course and disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March. No wreckage has been found. Mr Harastsis, chairman of planning company MacroPlan Dimasi, said: ‘It is likely in the short run that the Australia dedication to outbound travel will change. For example, the implications of the Bali bombings in the short run saw it drop off but then it returned again.’ ‘The biggest impact on travel will be on the Australian dollar but the disaster will keep more people home too,’ he explained. Mr Harastsis predicted ‘we may have 18-24 months in Australia of more domestic travel’ and a return to families holidaying in traditional Australian beach resorts. Relatives of missing Air Asia QZ8501 passengers cry at the crisis centre of Juanda International Airport Surabaya on December 28 . The Airbus A320-200 was 42 minutes into its flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore, on Sunday, when it vanished with 162 people on board . Australian tourists are expected to reconsider travel plans in the short term . ‘Domestic tourism on the Gold Coast has been declining over five years but now we are likely to see a return to those destinations, they are relatively inexpensive and accessible. ‘There is a perceived increase in complexity in travelling to Asia in total and that combined impact means that people look at alternative destinations. ‘Over the last few months outbound domestic travel has been dropping,’ he said. Mr Harastsis also expects more Australians to look at holidaying in America - another place perceived as ‘safe’. ‘People may also look at holidays to the USA. Direct flights into Dallas have been very successful, so much so Qantas has put on more capacity. And LAX airport has been upgraded very significantly. Our views of the USA have changed dramatically.’ He believes that Australian flyers may return to more expensive airlines such as Qantas for perceived peace of mind. The AirAsia disaster occurred in South East Asia, the same region where MH370 disappeared in March . Co-pilot and Squadron Leader Brett McKenzie of the Royal New Zealand Airforce (RNZAF) P-3K2-Orion aircraft, helps to look for objects during the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 during a flight over the Indian Ocean on April 13 . ‘People see it as a price for safety. For a few hundred extra dollars people will weigh it up… it’s also a question of how certain you can be of cancellations and when you can travel. ‘It’s ok for a backpacker to sleep on the floor but if you are family you can’t do that… Qantas, Emirates, Singapore airlines all might do quite well.’ However, spokesperson for Flight Centre, the largest retail travel outlet in Australia, Hadyn Long, said that unlike around the time of the MH17 and MH370 disasters they haven’t seen people cancelling flights or bookings with AirAsia since Sunday. ‘We haven't seen any changes in booking patterns and wouldn't really expect to, based on previous experiences over the years,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. A pro-Russian gunman (L) passes by Dutch investigators placing a sign near parts of the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 plane at the crash site near the Grabove village in eastern Ukraine . Workers remove parts of the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines passenger jet MH17 . ‘I think people recognise that air travel is generally very safe and I think they also recognise that Air Asia is a good airline with a good reputation.’ AirAsia currently flies into Darwin, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and the Gold Coast but recently withdraw flights to Adelaide due to cost cutting. In August, the airline launched flights from as little as $13 in the wake of its rival Malaysia Airlines’ double disaster. AirAsia offered sales fares from Australia to the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur from $159, with onward flights from their costing as little as $13. In the same month, Malaysia Airlines slashed its prices for long-haul routes as it struggled to hold onto customers and crew following the two air tragedies that killed hundreds of people. The beleaguered airline offered a sale from London Heathrow Airport to Kuala Lumpur and nine other destinations in Malaysia, with return economy class flights selling for as little as £570 on select dates. It is also offered cut-price deals to customers in Australia and New Zealand.","AirAsia flight QZ8501 crashed on Sunday with 162 people on board .

"Hasbro is under fire from parents who are outraged over a penis-shaped part in a Play Doh cake decorating set. The toymaker has been attacked by moms and dads who bought the innocent-looking Sweet Shoppe Cake Mountain Playset for their loved ones - and were shocked at the toy's phallic connotations. The piece in question, which is around the length of a thumb, is a mock frosting applicator, which the company refers to as an 'extruder'. It is one of many parts in the $20 set. Scroll down for video . Unfortunate: Parents reacted with shock when they realized this Play Doh attachment is shaped like a penis . 'Extruder': The item is meant to squeeze out colored 'frosting' for toy cakes when squeezed against a plunger, shown above inside the device . In action: One parent - who was not put off by the design - posted the above photograph of the toy in action to the Play Doh Facebook page, which has been the target of irate consumers . Children are supposed to fill the tube with colored frosting, inset a plunger, then squeeze the synthetic goo out of one end, by pressing down against two protrusions at the base. Angry consumers flocked to the brand's social media channels to blast the company for the ill-thought out design. Mom Mari Ramirez said: 'As a customer as well as being a mom I'm very disappointed in you guy.....my kids love your product....shame I have to start to re look at u guys before I buy!!!! Plz change . Diane Goss Lamb wrote to the company: 'It is so obviously inappropriate, that I have a hard time believing that no-one in your company stopped this from being approved and distributed in the first place.' Size: The item, about the length of a thumb, prompted a re-think from Hasbro, who have now replaced the part . Chrismtas gift? Jennifer Turner wrote: 'This is NOT okay - this completely ruined our Christmas.' But some parents saw a funnier side to the controversy, and said they were happy with the product as it was. Take two: Hasbro later said it had replaced the part with a less suggestive one - believed to be the above banana-shaped device . XZY said:All these people complaining. Pretty sure your kid did not know or notice what this may or may not resemble. These issues belong to the adults. Wait till they start asking for bananas to be made in a different shape. Kasey Marie said: 'Just want to say that while we did notice later on what the extruder kinda looks like, we aren't bothered by it because it's a kids' toy. 'Those making a fuss are people who look for something to complain about in everything.' The deluge of complaints eventually prompted Hasbro to create a replacement part, which resembles a banana.

"A David Bowie fan has spent over £20,000 creating a shrine packed with the singer's memorabilia. Louise Moody has been dubbed the 'Keen Genie', in reference to the glam rocker's hit Jean Genie, due to her devout obsession with the musician. The 24-year-old from Stretford, Manchester, has spent £5,000 having pictures of the star's face and Space Oddity designs tattooed on her body - even though at 67 he is 43 years her senior. Louise Moody, 24, Manchester, has built up a David Bowie collection worth £20,000 since the age of 11 that includes signed pictures and books. She has also spent £5,000 on tattoos dedicated to him . She has also splashed out on Bowie clothes, signed photos and magazine cuttings of her idol, which adorn her bedroom walls at her home. The superfan began building up her vast collection from the age of 11, by getting her hands on everything and anything Bowie-related. Louise's obsession began when she heard her mother Jane play his greatest hits album over dinner and was captivated by him. Three years later, she was able to see the music legend in person with her mother as they watched him live in concert at the MEN Arena in 2003. She said: 'I started collecting clippings and T-shirts with the little pocket money I had when I was a kid and my mum surprised me by taking me to see him live in 2003 when I was 14.' 'It was the most incredible experience of my life and since then I pledged to see him again one day, however he has hardly toured since.' Louise is so dedicated  that she transforms herself into his alter ego Ziggy Stardust, for nights out (right) It has taken Louise 13 years to put together her collection of books, magazine clippings and signed albums . Louise's love of the Aladdin Sane artist started at the age of 11 when her mum played his greatest hits . While her friends at school would listen to Arctic Monkeys and The Killers while debating the latest number one chart hit, Louise would listen to what her pals would playfully describe as 'dad rock'. Louise admits that her ever-growing collection has now begun to take over her home. She said: 'All of my memorabilia spreads through the house, my books and DVDs go on the shelf but my magazine cuttings are stored in loads of folders - I have even had to put them in folders that I keep recipes and things in because I have so many. 'I am hoarding them for no reason as I don't use them. The project designer now owns every single David Bowie album available, many as vinyl records . As well as her music and book collection, Louise has adorned herself with £5,000 worth of tattoos . Much of Louise's clothing features David Bowie logos or motifs including his face, birth date and guitar . 'If there was a fire in the house, the first thing I would save would be my expensive Bowie stuff, my signed picture would definitely be up there. I would get as much as I could get really. 'In my old room, the walls were lined with pictures and posters of him. 'A lot of people say it's strange that a young girl can have such an obsession with an artist in a completely different generation, but I fell in love with him the minute I heard his music.' As well as dedicating her interiors to the icon, project designer Louise has even styled her appearance to look more like her idol. Louise  regularly goes on nights out dressed as Bowie's iconic character Ziggy Stardust and has modelled her dyed red hair to match his iconic look. Louise says that she has written to her idol on several occasions but is yet to receive a reply . She said: 'David Bowie has influenced my life so much, I dress like him and my hair is the same colour as his on one of his album covers. 'I dyed it that colour a few years ago and was gutted when I had to dye my hair brown for my job but since I have moved jobs I have been able to dye my hair back.' Louise said that her obsession became so great that she even took to copying some of his lifestyle choices to be more like him. 'I even started smoking Marlboro lights when I found out he smoked them. I just love everything about him. 'It is my dream to meet him and I wouldn't even think about shelling out more than £1,000 to see him live again.' Some of Louise's most prized possessions include those that have been personally signed by Bowie . Louise now owns every album and single he has ever made and admits that she still holds out hope of meeting him one day. She said: 'I think if I met him I would scream and faint, it's giving me goosebumps just thinking about it. 'All I ever think about is him and I don't think any other music I have heard.' However, Louise says that every attempt at contacting the star has so far been fruitless. She said: 'I have written letters to his fan club but never heard back - at the time I was only a teenager and it really upset me but it never lowered my hopes of one day meeting him. 'I can't help myself, if I see anything with his face on it I must have it, regardless of the price.'","Louise Moody has collected David Bowie memorabilia from the age of 11 .

"A neglected puppy who gnawed off her leg in a fight for survival  is now on the road to recovery. Five-month-old Elsa was taken into the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee on December 22 and given immediate treatment for the horrific wound. The terrier's previous owner had apparently left her unsupervised for two days and during that time, she'd bitten through her rear left limb to set it free from tangled curtain cord. Scroll down for video . In a spot of bother: Five-month-old Elsa was taken into the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee on December 22 after gnawing off her hind leg . The terrier's previous owner had apparently left her home alone for two days and during that time, she'd bitten through her rear left limb to set it free from tangled curtain cord . Despite the injury, vets said Elsa was 'full of kisses' with her 'tail wagging away' when she arrived at their facility. She was given pain medication and antibiotics to treat signs of infection. Further amputation was needed to clean up the stump and Elsa went in for surgery the very next day. Footage of the canine shows she is already adapting well to being on three legs and can run at a good pace. Angela Speed, a spokesperson for WHS, said that young amputees usually learn to function 'very well' and can keep up with their able-bodied counterparts with no problem. Ever the optimist: Despite the injury, vets said Elsa was 'full of kisses' with her 'tail wagging away' when she arrived at their facility . On to a new home: Elsa is expected to make a full recovery and will go up for adoption this week . 'We know from experience that a leg amputation doesn't necessarily affect a dog’s mobility,' Speed noted. Elsa is expected to make a full recovery and barring any medical complications, she will go up for adoption this week. Humane Society officials say Elsa’s story highlights the importance of not leaving young dogs alone. A note on the non-profit's Facebook page reads: 'Please note that puppies can easily get into trouble. 'Always supervise play time, and confine your puppy to a safe room or kennel when you need to leave the house.'","Five-month-old Elsa was taken into the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee on December 22 .

Pulkownik had just left a friends house where he allegedly consumed two or three beers., according to Florida Highway Patrol. He was driving his Ford Explorer the wrong way on Park Boulevard when he rammed into the Martins' car - killing 84-year-old Joao Martins, his 82-year-old wife Arminda, and their 58-year-old daughter-in-law Isabel. Isabel died at the scene while her in-laws died later after being transported to Bayfront Medical Center. Before being taken to the hospital himself, Pulkownik was asked by authorities to show his drivers license and that's when they first noticed he was intoxicated. According to a search warrant, Pulkownik fumbled through his wallet trying to find his ID and mistakenly handed officers his credit card first. They said Pulkownik slurred his speech, smelled of alcohol and that they found  one empty and one full can of Natural Ice beer in his vehicle. Pulkownik was treated for minor injuries in the collision and arrested four days later on December 29 with three charges each of DUI-manslaughter and vehicular homicide. He was also charged with one count of misdemeanor DUI-property damage and a handed a citation for driving on the wrong side of the road.

"A Californian high school basketball team will be allowed to wear 'I can't breathe' protest shirts after a school district reversed the decision to  ban them from playing. The players from Mendocino High School had been told that they would not be able to wear the T-shirts in memory of Eric Garner by officials at the Fort Bragg School district. But the decision was reversed on Monday, and high school players will be allowed to wear the shirts during warm-ups as long as they do not cause problems, lawyers said. Scroll down for video . Shirts: Mendocino High School girls basketball team wear the 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirts before a recent game . Decision: The athletic director for Mendocino High School (pictured) had been informed by his counterpart at Fort Bragg High School this week that neither the boys nor girls teams would be allowed to participate in the three day tournament hosted by Fort Bragg High but this decision had now changed . Karen Boyd, a First Amendment lawyer who represented one of the players, said the reversal by the Fort Bragg School District came just moments before she intended to file a federal court motion. Boyd said she intended to arguing that barring the shirts violated the free speech rights of student athletes. Death: Eric Garner, pictured, is the New York man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold . The agreement will stand as long as the shirts do not cause any serious problems at the tournament. It also allows spectators to wear the shirts, which several did as the tournament got underway Monday at Fort Bragg High School, Boyd said. 'This is always my preference, if we can get things worked out without a lot of court stuff,' she said. The T-shirts feature the last words of Garner, a New York man who died after an officer put him in a chokehold. In amateur video taken of the arrest,  Garner was seen being forced to the ground and held down while he was being cuffed. The father of six, died after saying: 'I can't breathe!' His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in cities worldwide after officer Daniel Pantaleo was not indicted. School district lawyer Patrick Wilson said Fort Bragg officials had changed their decision because they wanted to avoid the cost of a legal battle. They were also concerned the shirts could cause disruption in the community because it was still mourning the death of a sheriff's deputy who was killed in the line of duty in March. Support: Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, left, warms up before an NBA basketball game against the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center wearing a T-shirt with the protest message and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers also wore the T-shirt on the court before a game against the Sacramento Kings . Silent protest: Members of the Georgetown basketball team stand for the National Anthem wearing 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirts before an NCAA college basketball game against Kansas . 'The concern is, you are in a packed auditorium, this is a polarizing issue and it's about something that happened in New York,' Wilson said. 'I think it's fine for people to protest about it, but emotions are still raw in that area.' Jone Lemos, whose daughter, Jin Jackson, is a team co-captain said some of the female players and about 100 supporters rallied outside the tournament. Lemos said: 'I'm so proud of them for becoming involved in these issues.' Georgetown basketball team became the first college sports team to stage an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt demonstration earlier this month. Professional basketball players such as LeBron James, Derrick Rose and Kyrie Irving have also worn 'I Can't Breathe' shirts during warm-ups without repercussions from the NBA.

"A man was out to get more than just an eyeful at an iconic nudist beach but his plans were laid bare after sunbathers spotted he was using a hidden camera inside an esky to film them. Unlike the other sunbathers at Adelaide's Maslin Beach, it was suspected that he actually had something to hide, so he was chased down by around eight people and surrounded before police arrived. 9 News reported the man first aroused suspicion when he was spotted positioning his esky towards an unclad couple at Maslin Beach on December 21. Sunbathers at Maslin Beach in Adelaide chased down and surrounded a man they suspected was secretly filming them from a camera hidden inside an esky . A female sunbather walked past and noticed the naked truth when she claimed she saw a video camera set up inside the esky. The video camera was apparently filming through some holes in the esky's wooden frame. Except for wearing an Akubra hat and a smile, the man was also naked and aged in his late 40s or early 50s. After being challenged the man moved several hundred metres down the beach. But in a flash he again pointed his esky towards another couple. A group of about eight people then began to chase the man, calling out 'he's got a camera', and surrounded him until police arrived. Maslin's iconic nudist beach in South Adelaide was the scene of a citizen's arrest by sunbathers . South Coast Police examined the camera in the man's possession and no recorded vision was found. Police spoke with the man and investigated the allegations that he was filming people at the beach. These enquiries and the absence of vision led police to determine there was insufficient evidence to support a charge of indecent filming. The man was cautioned and was asked to leave the beach. The southern section of Maslin Beach was designated as Australia’s first nude beach in 1975. The man allegedly had a video camera hidden in his esky.

"Nathan Lloyd posted an explicit image and video on his former girlfriend's Instagram page and then changed her account password . A jilted boyfriend took revenge on his ex-girlfriend by posting a photograph of her posing in her underwear on her own online account, and changed her password so she could not remove it. Nathan Lloyd, 22, had been sent the picture of his girlfriend wearing racy underwear when they were still together. But when she ended their relationship Lloyd logged into her Instagram account and uploaded the picture, and then changed her password. Lloyd, of Narberth, West Wales, also posted a video 'of a sexual nature' onto the page, Haverfordwest magistrates court heard. Prosecutor Peter Lloyd said: 'When they were together the defendant had access to the victim's Instagram account. 'Lloyd then changed the victim's Instagram password and posted the picture and later a video of a private sexual nature.' Lloyd admitted breaking the Telecommunications Act by posting the image. He will be sentenced later at Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court. He was given bail on the condition he did not use any social networking websites before his next court date. The maximum sentence for the offence, which falls under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003, is six months in prison. At a hearing at Haverfordwest Magistrates Court Lloyd, 22, admitted breaking the telecommunications act . Lloyd's case comes as new legislation is expected to come into force next year that makes revenge porn - a specific offence which could carry a maximum sentence of two years. It is due to be made into law next year. Yesterday the CPS launched new guidelines on tackling domestic abuse which will include using technology to inflict misery on former partners. Under the new guidance issued prosecutors will be encouraged to consider how revenge porn can be treated as a form of domestic abuse. Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Luke King was jailed  for posting the explicit image . Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Earlier this year Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images. King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.","Nathan Lloyd, 22, took revenge on his former partner after she dumped him .

"After 132 years of only baby boys in the Waring family, no one thought the next arrival would be a girl. But then Annabelle Rose was born, to the delight of parents Deborah and Lee. She is the first girl in five generations of Warings, who haven’t welcomed a member of the fairer sex to the family since the birth of Annabelle’s great-great grandmother Margaret in 1882. Mrs Waring, 33, a senior project engineer, said: ‘I didn’t find out what we were having at the scan because I wanted it to be a surprise. There’s a lot of girls on my side of the family but none on Lee’s side. Annabelle Rose is the first girl born in the Waring family since 1882, pictured with parents Lee and Deborah . Lee Waring's great grandfather Harry, left, and grandfather Frank, right . ‘I’d read that the sex of the baby comes more from the male side so we didn’t expect it. My husband is one of three boys, his middle brother has got three boys, so there is not a girl in sight.’ Deborah and Lee, 33, a senior web designer, from Leyland, Lancashire, who also have a three-year-old son, Lewis, said Annabelle has been ‘spoilt rotten’ by relatives since her birth last month. Mrs Waring said: ‘Everyone expected it to be another boy. We are all really happy and everybody is buying pink things. ‘I think all our family are enjoying being able to shop in the pink department for a change. Lewis loves her too and really looks after her.’ Since the birth of Mr Waring's great-great grandmother, the subsequent generations in the Waring family have included: John (1870-1957), Harry (1893-1980), Frank (1921-2002), Neil (1950 -present), .

'Lee is delighted and he calls her his ""little sweetheart"". Lewis loves her too and he really looks after her."" Annabelle was born on November 15 at Chorley Birth Centre, in Lancashire, . weighing 6lb 12oz. Mrs Waring added: 'She came really quickly. I was walking around the park on the Saturday morning, then came home and realised I was in labour and it was progressing quite quickly. 'She was born via water birth and she was born in her water sac into the birthing pool, which was really special for my husband to see - it's meant to be lucky. 'I think the birth centre heard more about her being a girl than actually delivering her! 'I think if we had been any later she wouldn't have been born in the birthing pool.

"Like most parents, Dean Baker just couldn’t resist splashing out at Christmas time. But when he checked his bank balance, he was shocked to find he had made a purchase for nearly £60,000. Frantic inquiries revealed he had been charged the sum for just four rolls of wrapping paper and a pack of gift cards on December 22. Dean Baker, from Birmingham (pictured with daughters  Harriet and Eden) was left £52,000 overdrawn after a shop assistant charged him 10,000 times the correct price for wrapping paper . An assistant at the Card Factory shop in Birmingham had accidentally arranged for £59,416 to come out of Mr Baker’s account instead of £5.94, when he handed over his debit card and punched in his PIN without checking. The father of two, 32, complained his Christmas had been ruined as his account was frozen and he was unable to use his card to buy last-minute presents for daughters Eden, seven, and 18-month-old Harriet. The cable engineer, from Erdington, Birmingham, said: ‘The girl on the till was a trainee. When I first put my card in the machine to pay she said it hadn’t worked and asked me to do it again, so I did. I didn’t think of it any more.’ He only became aware there was a problem when his card was declined at a restaurant where he had lunch on Christmas Eve. ‘I went to a cashpoint nearby and couldn’t believe my eyes when the balance came up on the screen as being nearly £60,000 overdrawn,’ he said. Mr Baker, who is married to IT worker Joanne, immediately contacted his bank, TSB. He was initially told the money might not be refunded until January 12, leaving him unable to buy food or petrol. Mr Baker was shocked to see the huge sum being charged to his TSB debit card after the mistake by a sales assistant at Card Factory in Erdington High Street, Birmingham . A bank statement shows Mr Baker was charged £59,416.26 for the paper - leaving him massively overdrawn . He says both the shop and the bank were reluctant to sort out the issue, ruining his family's Christmas . He took time off work to try to resolve the issue, but the funds have now been returned to him after a local newspaper became involved. But it was too late to salvage his family Christmas. ‘I was supposed to be buying an iPad for Eden but obviously I couldn’t do that and we ended up having to beg food off relatives to pull a Christmas dinner together,’ Mr Baker said. IT seems astonishing that Mr Baker’s £59,416 payment went through so easily. But the issue of security checks is shrouded in mystery. Credit and debit card companies such as Visa and Mastercard are coy about revealing what can lead to a payment being declined. Identity theft expert Robert Siciliano said: ‘That’ll only give the bad guys the edge.’ A mass of data about an individual can be used by banks and card issuers to flag up suspicious activity. Fraud screening systems look at a person’s normal spending profile and use it to detect any unusual patterns. Things that might raise concerns include making several purchases quickly or unusually expensive transactions. If the programmes detect a potential fraud, the card company will usually contact the account holder and a block can be put on the card. He complained about being ‘passed from pillar to post’ by TSB and Card Factory when he contacted them about the error, which meant he was charged more than 10,000 times what he should have paid. ‘I’m disgusted by how the whole thing has been handled. I have barely been able to sleep through the worry of it all,’ he added. ‘People at Card Factory had promised to phone back on a number of occasions but never did and the bank initially said it could not do anything either.’ Last night Mr Baker received an apology from TSB. A spokesman said: ‘We apologise for the inconvenience that Mr Baker has been caused. We have been in frequent contact with Card Factory and are now pleased to confirm that Mr Baker’s money has been refunded.’ The bank also confirmed that Mr Baker had not incurred any overdraft charges or late payment penalties. A Card Factory spokesman also apologised for the inconvenience, adding: ‘We can confirm that an administrative error made in our Erdington store on December 22 led to a significant overpayment by a customer. ‘We became aware of the error on December 23 through our card service provider and acted immediately to initiate a reversal of the transaction.’ In a similar mishap earlier this year, a teenager was charged nearly £180,000 for a pizza. Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, used his debit card to pay what he thought was a mere £17.99 charge at a Domino’s in Newport, Gwent, in July. But he was later horrified to discover £179,932.32 had been taken from his account. Mr Bolwell, a packer at a food company, was later told that a bank card authorisation code had accidentally been added to the price of the takeaway.","Father bought wrapping paper without realising shop worker's blunder .

"The ruins of Pompeii in Italy are a popular tourist attraction, but it appears some visitors leave with more than just memories and photos. Thieving visitors, who have been taking artefacts from the ancient site for decades, have now begun returning their stolen wares to the museum. In October, a 70-year-old woman returned an ancient decoration that she took from the attraction back in 1964 - and local archaeologists claim this is a common occurrence. Stolen artefacts that have since been returned to the Italian ruins (pictured) include tiles, painted plaster, stones and bricks. Director Massimo Osanna: 'We have been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments now for years. People write expressing regret, having realised they have made a terrible mistake' The unnamed woman picked up the small decoration during her honeymoon, and it is said to have formed part of the entrance to a theatre. Director Massimo Osanna told Il Messaggero: 'We have been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments now for years. 'People write expressing regret, having realised they have made a terrible mistake and that they would never do it again.' In October, a 70-year-old woman returned a relic that she stole from the attraction back in 1964 - and local archaeologists claim this is a common occurrence. Other stolen artefacts that have been returned include tiles, painted plaster, stones and bricks. And a fresco fragment, said to have been crucial to archaeologists hoping to restore the Casa Del Frutteto on the site, was returned in March after two decades. Other artefacts have been recovered by customs. In September, a large stone taken from the historical site was seized at Rome's Fiumicino airport after two Americans tried to take the 4-stone 10lb (30kg) artefact home in their suitcase. Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania that was destroyed by a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79AD. Reports claim that two thousand people died, and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748. Many of the buildings, artefacts and skeletons were found intact under a layer of dust of debris. It is now classified as a Unesco World Heritage Site and more than 2.5 million tourists visit each year. In November, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town found raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster.

In November, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town found raw clay vases (pictured) that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster . The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired, Discovery News reported. It looks as if they were dropped as frightened potters saw the smoke and smelt the sulphurous fumes that would have been spewed out by the volcano - and decided to make a run for it. Historical accounts and archaeological evidence show that many Pompeians took to the streets in a bid to leave the city, braving hot ash and pumice stones ejected from Vesuvius, with some collapsing from inhaling poisonous fumes. The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired. This sketch shows the patternation applied by the potters before they fled their workshop . Roman writer, Pliny the younger, described the panic during the eruption of Mount Vessuvius. Terrified Romans (illustrated) living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them, he said . The scene at the pottery, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate. One of the kilns (pictured left) and a reconstructed broken vase (right) are shown . The pottery was discovered in an area of the town outside its Herculaneum Gate and comprises three rooms housing two large kilns. The scene at the workshop, with its abandoned kilns, reveals a terrifying moment frozen in time when the potters decided to evacuate. Dig director Laëtitia Cavassa, from the Jean Bérard Centre, said: ‘They abandoned the workshop and everything they were doing at that moment.’ An administrator and poet called Pliny the younger watched the disaster unfold from a distance. Letters describing what he saw were found in the 16th century. His writing suggests that the eruption caught the residents of Pompeii unawares. He said that a column of smoke 'like an umbrella pine' rose from the volcano and made the towns around it as black as night. People ran for their lives with torches, screaming and some wept as rain of ash and pumice fell for several hours. While the eruption lasted for around 24 hours, the first pyroclastic surges began at midnight, causing the volcano's column to collapse. An avalanche of hot ash, rock and poisonous gas rushed down the side of the volcano at 124mph (199kph), burying victims and remnants of everyday life. Hundreds of refugees sheltering in the vaulted arcades at the seaside in Herculaneum, clutching their jewellery and money, were killed instantly. As people fled Pompeii or hid in their homes, their bodies were covered by blankets of the surge. While Pliny did not estimate how many people died, the event was said to be 'exceptional' and the number of deaths is thought to exceed 10,000. The pottery was discovered in an area of the town outside its Herculaneum Gate and comprises three rooms housing two large kilns. This image shows its floor and the location of smashed raw pottery . Mount Vesuvius erupted (illustrated) on August 24 in 79AD, and the tragic events are immortalised beneath ash spewed from erupting volcano. People tried to flee the town, but many were buried by ash and pumice . Archaeologists found pottery wheels as well as the tools needed to create the elaborate patterns and textures on the pots and vases. A floor showing the location of posts is pictured . Archaeologists found pottery wheels as well as the tools needed to create the elaborate patterns and textures on the pots and vases. They believe that the 10 smashed vessels discovered were intended to be used to hold water and wine. Dr Cavassa said: ‘They are really unique items. The potters made them with clay, embellished them with decorations, and were ready to place them into the kiln when the Vesuvius erupted.’ She explained that the vases are evidence that the workshop was active at the moment of the famous eruption. The city of Pompeii (pictured) is an invaluable resource to historians because so many tiny details of daily life, from food to objects in houses, were preserved by hot ash when Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city .","Stolen artefacts that have been returned include tiles and painted plaster .

"An ambulance service has apologised to an elderly woman suffering a brain haemorrhage who was forced to wait for almost an hour and a half for an emergency crew to arrive. Christine Campbell, 64, started feeling sick and getting headaches before collapsing at her home in Purbrook, Hampshire, prompting family members to immediately dial 999. However, an ambulance failed to reach the grandmother until 86 minutes later, during which time her concerned family made two more 999 calls. Brain haemorrhage: Christine Campbell (left) felt sick and had headaches before collapsing at her home. Her husband Chris (right) has since received an apology letter from South Central Ambulance Service . Following an investigation into the incident, it emerged an ambulance originally dispatched to Mrs Campbell was diverted elsewhere. The enquiry also found the worker who took their call failed to find out enough about Mrs Campbell’s condition before deciding how best to treat the situation. The family spoke to an NHS 111 call handler tasked to receive 999 calls from the public and take essential details about the patient’s condition and their exact location. However, the investigation found Mrs Campbell’s condition should have been ‘further probed’ over the phone. That worker has now been given further training. South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) has now written to her husband Chris Campbell - who has had to quit his career to become her full-time carer - to offer its ‘sincere apologies’. Mr Campbell, 63, a coach driver for the Ministry of Defence, said: ‘I’m not very happy. It seems SCAS is just going through the motions to keep me happy. ‘It seems they are just making excuses for their incompetence. That said, however, there’s not a lot of point in pursuing the matter any further as SCAS isn’t going to change what it’s already said and we’ll just have to accept this and get on with it. ‘Hopefully SCAS will take more care with the way calls are handled.’ Since her collapse at her £87,000 one-bedroom flat home in Purbrook, Mrs Campbell has continued to receive hospital treatment for her brain haemorrhage. In fact, Mr Campbell had been admitted to hospital hours before his wife, who retired in May, after being diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy. The couple, who have two children and five grandchildren together, were both eventually transferred from Queen Alexandra Hospital to Southampton General Hospital. When his wife fell ill, their daughter Claire, 40, who lives nearby in North End, Portsmouth, was able to drive to their home and call 999 - which she then did twice more. Treatment: Mrs Campbell was eventually taken to and treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital (pictured) in Cosham, Hampshire, after her family had made a total of three separate 999 calls . A little over a week after being first admitted to hospital, Mrs Campbell, a former medical secretary, had brain surgery and was kept at Southampton General for three weeks. After coming out, she was re-admitted several weeks later when she suffered from vertigo, her husband said. He added: 'Luckily they were very good at the hospital. I don't believe the delay impacted on her condition and she's been improving steadily. ‘I myself had chest pains that morning and went to hospital but Christine messaged me to say she was ill. Our daughter came round from North End who called for the ambulance. ‘It's been a little bit awkward these past four months as I have been doing everything for her and running around after her. Fortunately it's not so bad now as she's getting more mobile. It's not how we planned to start our retirement together.’ In a letter to Mr Campbell, who complained about the treatment of his wife, the ambulance trust admitted failing to meet the targeted response time of 30 minutes. It admitted the first call was made at 11.53am on September 7 this year by Mrs Campbell’s family and that a clinician called the family back at 12.40pm when they were able to do so. The clinician told the family an ambulance would be sent out and with them within 30 minutes and one was dispatched at 1.05pm. But it was diverted to another emergency just two minutes later at 1.07pm. At 1.12pm another ambulance was sent and reached Mrs Campbell at 1.19pm, 39 minutes after the family was told one was coming and 86 minutes after the first 999 call. Eventually, she was taken to and treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Cosham, Hampshire, after her family had made a total of three separate 999 calls. In its apology for its shortfalls, SCAS also said a rapid response vehicle was not sent out throughout this time as none were available. Luci Stephens, assistant director of operations, wrote to her husband: ‘I would firstly like to offer you my sincere apologies for the distress caused because of this incident, not only for your wife but also to you and your daughter who was with your wife at the time. ‘I would also like to apologise for the delay in responding to you.’","Christine Campbell started feeling sick and getting headaches at home .

"Defence chiefs were warned of significant security risks to the UK of allowing Libyan soldiers off their base in Cambridgeshire, according to newly released documents. A report prepared before the troops’ arrival on British soil warned of immigration, security and reputational risks if the cadets were allowed to leave the camp for ‘recreational visits’. But despite the warnings, the Ministry of Defence admitted its rules that cadets should only be allowed outside the camp on supervised trips had been relaxed. More than 300 cadets arrived at Bassingbourn Barracks in June to undergo training but it was cut short in November after five were charged with sexual assaults . More than 300 cadets arrived at Bassingbourn Barracks in June to undergo training as part of an effort to support Libya’s beleaguered new government. Initially local residents were assured that the cadets were only allowed out on escorted trips but these rules were later relaxed and they were allowed out on both supervised and unsupervised visits. Their training was cut short in November after five were charged with sexual assaults. Hundreds of them – except a handful who claimed asylum – were sent home in disgrace amid the allegations of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft. It has now emerged a security and risk assessment document produced prior to the soldiers’ arrival warned of the potential danger of allowing unsupervised visits. The report by the Cross-Whitehall Libya Security Compact Delivery Group, and obtained through a Freedom of Information Request submitted by the BBC, read: ‘Outward recreational visits pose significant immigration, security and reputational risks to the UK.’ David Cameron has previously hit out at the 'completely unacceptable' breakdown of discipline among Libyan soldiers in Cambridgeshire . It also acknowledged it was ‘unrealistic and a risk to morale and discipline to confine persons to camp’ for the duration of their 24-week training. Despite agreements that soldiers would not leave the camp unsupervised, the report shows the MoD was aware of three occasions when small groups were seen outside camp attempting to buy alcohol. Asked about specific incidents involving Libyan cadets off base, the MoD said sightings of them in local villages were reported on August 8,9 and 10. All of the recruits were located and returned to base. The pre-training security report pointed to ‘widespread’ sexual violence during the period of conflict in Libya, and added there was ‘some evidence that it is a significant domestic problem which could be reinforced by cultural attitudes and entrenched by a lack of justice for those affected and for perpetrators.’ Before arriving in the UK, all cadets were subjected to a vetting process. However, the report said ‘full background information’ on trainees was unlikely to be available. The report went on to say: ‘The risk of bad behaviour of trainees outside Bassingbourn Camp is mitigated by the provisions of their visas, the supervisory measures in place for limited excursions and the security arrangements between the MoD, police and [the] Home Office.’ Despite concerns about recruiting a balanced ethnic mix of cadets and their future once back home in Libya, the report’s writers concluded: ‘There is a much larger risk of not going ahead with training. ‘The prime minister has signed up to the General Purpose Force initiative. This commitment was made almost one year ago. The reputational risks for the UK proceeding with training are assessed as much lower than not doing so.’ A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘We have been clear that the behaviour of a small number of the Libyan trainees was completely unacceptable and had a serious impact on members of the local community. ‘Following the conclusion of the training the prime minister tasked the MoD with producing a report on the programme at Bassingbourn, including disciplinary issues.’ Parliament was likely to be informed of the results of the report in the new year, he added.","300 cadets arrived at Bassingbourn Barracks in June to undergo training .

"Police say a man shot dead his girlfriend and killed two of her teenage daughters before turning the gun on himself in a suspected murder-suicide case that rocked a small Texas town this weekend. Crowley Police Chief Luis Soler said Tuesday that investigators are still working to determine what led 36-year-old Samuel Morales to target the three at the home they shared south of Fort Worth. Soler says 34-year-old Xiomara Leon was shot multiple times Sunday, as was her daughter, 18-year-old Linda Gonzalez. Thirteen-year-old Yasmine Zavala was strangled to death. Scroll down for video . Domestic violence: Police in Texas say Samuel Morales (left), 36, shot dead his girlfriend Xiomara Leon (right), 34, before killing two of her children and then himself . Family slain: Miss Leon (center) was shot multiple times Sunday, as was her daughter, 18-year-old Linda Gonzalez (left). Thirteen-year-old Yasmine Zavala (right) was strangled . Lone survivor: The only person to escape the carnage unharmed was Leon's 9-year-old son (center), who was the one who called for help after seeing the bodies of his mother and sisters (pictured) The bodies were found by officers responding to a report of a suicide attempt at the home. Soler says another of Leon's children, a 9-year-old boy, witnessed part of the attack and called a relative, who then called 911. The boy was not physically harmed. Police are not sure at this time why the child was spared by the gunman. They say he did not see much of the attack but witnessed the gruesome aftermath. 'The brave 9-year-old boy is doing the best as he can under these circumstances,' Crowley Police Chief Luis Soler told reporters Tuesday. 'He’ll be all right. … We’ll take care of him.' Investigators said Morales and Leon had been in a four-year relationship and lived together with the woman's children in the 200 block of Kennedy Drive. The 36-year-old was not the biological father of his girlfriend's kids. Police also said that Morales had a concealed carry handgun permit and no criminal history. The station WFAA reported that Yasmine Zavala was a student in Crowley ISD; Linda Gonzalez graduated from Crowley High School last year and was working as a teacher's aide at her alma mater. Family friend Laura Gallardo recalled to MyFox DFW how tight-knit the family was, and how Yasmine would always wait for her big sister to return home from school.

The 9-year-old boy who was uninjured has been placed in protective custody and was interviewed by Crowley police on Sunday evening. Police said that family members have encouraged him to talk and to tell officers exactly what happened inside the house. 'The deaths will have 'a huge impact in this tight-knit community,' the chief said. Soler said detectives have spoken to the victims' relatives, who said that Leon and Morales had recently attended a family get-together and seemed 'fine,' reported Star-Telegram. Robert Arndt, a co-worker and friend of Leon’s, described her boyfriend as a 'fun' guy who acted as a father to her children, especially 9-year-old Nino who was like a son to him. Leon worked at an AT&T store where she was known to her co-workers as 'Mama Xio' because she was nurturing and caring. Amdt has launched a GoFundMe account to help raise money for his friend's sole surviving child. A makeshift memorial made up of letters and flowers has been growing outside the family's home since Sunday. A candlelight vigil honoring the slaughtered family was held Tuesday night at Bicentennial Park. Crowley, a city of about 13,000, according to its website, is about 15 miles south of Fort Worth.

"The murder trial into the killing of a Russian tycoon once dubbed Princess Michael of Kent's 'toyboy' is rapidly descending into farce after key evidence has gone missing, and witnesses have refused to testify because of 'threats', it emerged today. Furniture magnate Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, was shot dead driving his Mercedes near Moscow in 2012, but the truth behind his death appears no closer to being revealed. There are even claims that the suspected killer has 'escaped'. 'Toyboy': Mikhail Kravchenko (pictured right) with Princess Michael of Kent (left) together in Moscow in 2006 . Gunned down: Kravchenko, pictured here in April 2006 outside his Moscow furniture factory, was shot dead driving his Mercedes near Moscow in 2012 . The suave businessman caused a royal scandal six years earlier when he was photographed walking hand in hand with the princess - who will be 70 next month - in Venice during a four day holiday during which they allegedly enjoyed a gondola trip and shared a suite in Venice's Cipriani Hotel. Police arrested three suspects - including a former business partner of Kravchenko who had alleged gangland ties - in the aftermath of the killing. But now - following a dozen court sessions - a major Kremlin-friendly newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, has concluded bluntly: 'We should not expect a fair trial.' There are even fears the case could be aborted. A source in the Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, said: 'Witnesses are receiving letters with threats. They are hiding and do not want to speak in court.' One was approached in the street and told not to testify or 'things will get much worse'. State investigators 'have lost important physical evidence on the case', according to court sources, including an unspecified item 'even more important for establishing guilt than the actual weapon'. The newspaper stated: 'It became known that the evidence was missing about three weeks ago. But so far it does not affect the trial because the judge has not started studying the evidence yet.' On trial: Mikhail Ischenko (left), Alexei Pronin (center) and Vitaliy Antishin (right) are alleged to have been behind the hit. But the actual killer, named as Sergei Filippov, is said to have escaped after the crime . Framed? Pronin, a former security aide to Kravchenko is an alleged member of the 'Elephants' mafia ring. Kravchenko's friends have expressed doubts that he ordered the shooting, suggesting he was set up . The trial is going ahead regardless despite the absence of the suspected killer. Named as Sergei Filippov, he 'managed to escape from police and investigators after the crime', according to Interfax news agency. On trial are Alexei Pronin, a former security aide to Kravchenko who is an alleged member of the 'Elephants' mafia ring, and two associates Mikhail Ischenko and Vitaliy Antishin, who both work for a small Moscow security agency. Royal scandal: Kravchenko was photographed walking hand-in-hand with the princess. She said they were just good friends and that she was a 'tactile person, I do it all the time' People from Kravchenko's circle have expressed doubts that Pronin ordered the shooting, suggesting he was framed. Pronin denies any part in his murder. The princess maintained that she and Kravchenko were just good friends, famously adding when asked why they were holding hands: 'I'm a very tactile person, I do it all the time.' Yet there were also claims that she was 'mesmerised' by Kravchenko, while a loyal aide to the Russian tycoon, Marina Sherstyuk, said: 'Mikhail had charisma of such magnitude that no woman, or indeed man, could stay indifferent to him.' Sherstyuk had no idea whether their relationship became physical. 'How can you be 100 per cent sure?' Yet in the aftermath of the Venice scandal, the princess, this time with her husband Prince Michael, went on a Volga River boat trip with Kravchenko. After his death, a spokesman said Prince Michael and his wife were 'very distressed to hear of this tragedy'. Theories abounded as to why Kravchenko was murdered. There was even speculation from conspiracy theorists that it could have been a state-instigated assassination to strike at the British Establishment, linked to the close friendship between Prince Michael and his financial backer, exiled businessman Boris Berezovsky, who died in mysterious circumstances in Berkshire less than a year later. Berezovsky was seen as Vladimir Putin's sworn enemy. Some people close to Kravchenko fear he was killed in a bid by major business interests to grab control of his 'March 8' furniture empire. 'Tragedy': Prince Michael and his wife released a statement at the time saying they were 'very distressed' to hear of Kravchenko's death after he was murdered . Another theory was that the murder could have been a case of mistaken identity. The official version is that he was killed over a small-scale property ownership dispute in Ryazan region but one source who knew Kravchenko well claimed this was 'contrived and implausible'. The blunders over the trial show 'someone is trying to muddy the waters and stop the truth getting out'.","Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, was shot dead in his Mercedes in 2012 .

"A New York City mother died in the Catskills at the weekend after taking a strange fall from a ski lift. Police say that 44-year-old Olga Filkin, of Brooklyn, was riding the lift at Hunter Mountain alone when the incident occurred on Sunday afternoon. Filkin, described as a 'pretty good skier' and a regular at the resort, was on a trip with her husband and her daughter. She was on the D Lift alone when the three-person seat began to rock, according to The Times Union. Scene: Mother-of-two Olga Filkin fell 25 feet from a ski lift at Hunter Mountain ski resort in the Catskills on Sunday, after one of her skis became caught in a cable support pole, dragging her under the restraining bar . Somehow, one of Filkin's skis became caught on one of the lift's cable support poles. Even though the restraint bar was down at the time - according to the vice president of the ski resort - Filkin was dragged under the bar and fell to the ground below. The mother-of-two fell 25 feet, according to NBC. She was treated by medical personnel at the scene and in the resort's first aid room, but died soon after. 'All of us are devastated by this,' Hunter Mountain said in a statement. 'We send our deepest sympathy to her family and friends.' An autopsy performed Monday showed that the cause of death was from injuries consistent with the fall and accidental. There were approximately 3,000 at the resort on Sunday. 'Safety is a top priority for Hunter Mountain, and we have a wide variety of programs and protocols in place,' said Gerry Tschinkel, Hunter Mountain vice president of sales, marketing and sponsorships. 'These touch every aspect of our operations.'

"The search for a 14-month-old Houston boy came to a successful but bittersweet end late Tuesday morning when authorities found him safe in Arkansas, but only after his father committed suicide. An Amber Alert for 14-month-old Tyemetheus Pack was issued by authorities just hours after the body of the boy's mother, Angel Jackson, 26, was discovered in an apartment complex Tuesday on Pinemont Drive. She was last seen on Christmas Eve and sent a text message saying she'd been shot before police found her body Tuesday morning. Jackson's head reportedly exhibited evidence of trauma. Little Tyemetheus was nowhere to be found at the scene, which prompted the Amber Alert. Scroll down for video . Bittersweet: The frantic search for 14-month-old Tymetheus came to a bittersweet end late Tuesday morning when the boy was found safe in Arkansas, but both his parents are now dead . Investigate: Here, authorities investigate the scene after the body of Angel Jackson, 26, was found in an apartment complex . Authorities suspected the toddler was with his father, Tumetheus Pack, a person of interest in the case, and at 10.30am Tuesday, their suspicions were confirmed, according to the Houston Chronicle. Pack drove the child more than 300 miles, to his home town Prescott, Arkansas,Click2Houston reports. Arkansas State Troopers looked for Pack at his home and discovered he had switched his green Chevy Suburban for a white Impala. Police spotted the car on Interstate 30 and stopped the vehicle to find the toddler in the car with Pack, a woman, and two other children. Bill Sadler, Arkansas State Police spokesperson, told the Chronicle that during the stop, Pack stepped out of the vehicle and fatally shot himself. Pack died later at the Wadley Regional Medical Center at Hope in Hope, Arkansas. Father: Authorities found the toddler in a vehicle with his father, Tumetheus Pack, (photographed). When authorities approached Pack, he fatally shot himself . Found: Jackson was found fatally shot with her head exhibiting evidence of trauma . The toddler is now with child welfare workers in Arkansas and his aunt, Daviana Standokes, told Click2Houston that the family is looking forward to making a good home for the boy in Louisiana. 'He's going to be with us, he's going to remain with family, our family. He's going to be more than okay, Standokes said. 'I know we could never replace his mom, but we're sure as hell going to try.' No one else in the car was harmed, and KHOU reports that police say they never fired any shots at Pack. Investigators are now working to piece together both the circumstances surrounding Jackson's death and Pack's trail out of Houston with the child, according to the Chronicle. Nowhere: Little Tyemetheus was nowhere to be found in the apartment complex where authorities found his mother's body . Son: Jackson also has an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship who is reportedly living with his biological father . Houston police are headed to Arkansas to question the woman who was in the car Pack when police pulled him over. Police still do not know if the woman and children in the car with the boy's father are related to him. Initially, police did not classify Jackson's death as a homicide and wanted simply to talk to Pack in an effort to gather information about Jackson's death. However, now police suspect that Pack killed Jackson then took off with little Tyemetheus, according to KHOU. Jackson also has an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship who is reportedly living with his biological father. ABC reports that Pack had been on the run since June 2012 after violating his parole. He had previously been released after serving an eight-year sentence for a kidnapping charge.","The search for 14-month old Tyemetheus Pack came to an end late Tuesday morning when authorities found him safe in Arkansas .

"A beach walker has unearthed a 7ft (2.1 metre) fossil of a fierce marine monster in south Wales. Jonathan Bow, 34, stumbled upon the complete 200 million-year-old ichthyosaur remains while walking along the Penarth shoreline. The computer programmer and his brother spent a full day digging up the 132lb (60kg) fossil, which Mr Bow described as 'a whopper'. Scroll down for video . Jonathan Bow, 34, found the complete 200 million-year-old ichthyosaur remains while walking in Penarth area . Now Mr Bow has replaced the coffee table in his home with the fossil of the carnivorous icthyosaur to show off his find to friends and family. Ichthyosaurs, also known as fish lizards - despite being neither fish nor lizards - were reptiles that swam the world's oceans in the Jurassic period while dinosaurs walked the land. They died out around 25 million years before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and were replaced by plesiosaurs, a long neck marine reptile . 'It was a particularly low tide and we were just leaving after failing to find anything interesting,' said Mr Bow.

Pictured is an artists's impression . Ichthyosaurs, also known as fish lizards, were reptiles that swam the world's oceans in the Jurassic period while dinosaurs walked the land . Ichthyosaurs, also known as fish lizards, were reptiles that swam the world's oceans in the Jurassic period while dinosaurs walked the land. The species varied from 3.3ft (1 metre) to over 52ft (16 metres) in length. They looked similar to dolphins with some species posessing a dorsal fin. Their heads were pointed, and their jaws were often equipped with conical teeth to catch smaller prey . They died out around 25 million years before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and were replaced by plesiosaurs, a long neck marine reptile . These fish lizards are thought to have evolved from an as yet unidentified land reptile that moved back into the water. They quickly became streamlined, and one species had a cruising speed of 22mph (36 km/h). 'Then something caught the corner of my eye and when I investigated I couldn't believe it - it was an incredible find.' While complete remains of ichthyosaurs have been discovered in Dorset and elsewhere, this is the first time a full specimen of the lizard has been found in Wales. The stone around the skeleton had to be carefully removed before Mr Bow alerted experts at National Museum Wales. The fossil hunter still has about 100 hours of patient work on the specimen in his workshop at his home in Porthcawl before it is ready to be displayed. 'Something this large and complete is a once in a lifetime find. It was quite a whopper.' He said. 'Anyone walking their dog on the beach could have found it - it just fell to me to be lucky.' Mr Bow has also discovered part of a jaw of a plesiosaur since he started his hobby several years ago. National Museum Wales palaeontologist Cindy Howells said: 'The ichthyosaur is potentially a very, very important find because it is so complete.'

"A photo of a woman in the United States Air Force tongue-kissing the Prisoners of War Missing in Action symbol has outraged members of the military, the blogoshpere and the general public. The photo was taken roughly three years ago at an unidentified location, but it just recently has gone viral on the Internet and has prompted an investigation into the woman in the picture, Staff Sergeant Cherish Byers, a member of the 92nd Security Forces Squadron based in Spokane, Washington. Following the command-directed investigation, the military will determine what - if any - disciplinary measures will be taken.

"Forget Twiglets or cheese and pineapple on a stick, the oyster is fast becoming the party food of choice for hosts who want to surprise and indulge their guests. Waitrose is reporting a 78 per cent increase in sales of fresh oysters this December compared to a year ago, while it is also possible to buy them in tins or at budget chains like Lidl. The slippery canapés are best served with chilled fizz, which is also seeing something of a boom as we approach the New Year’s Eve parties. Waitrose has reported a 78 per cent increase in the sales of Oysters charging just 79 pence each . At one time, they were the exclusive preserve of the millionaire classes, however supermarkets are bringing them to the high street with Waitrose charging 79p each. They are even cheaper at Lidl with a pack of six fresh Pacific oysters coming in at £2.49 – 42p each. Oysters feature on the menus in some of the country’s finest restaurants, including Richard Corrigan’s, J Sheekey’s and the Soho stalwart Randall and Aubin, but they are now being incorporated into the festive season. Sales of the shellfish at Christmas come only second to Valentine’s Day, where there claimed aphrodisiac qualities are the key selling point. As well as being associated as a food of romance, oysters are also rich in minerals and vitamins, and a good source of Omega-3. Oysters are something of an acquired taste, however they promise to give any party spread an impressive focal point if only because of the confusion about how best to eat them. Traditionally, oysters have been seen as a luxury item found it in class restaurants such as celebrity chef Richard Corrigan's, pictured who is renowned for the quality of his shellfish . The cognoscenti seem to favour swallowing them down whole, while others favour chewing on them. Waitrose buyer, Andy Boulton, said: ‘Some insist on swallowing oysters in one but oysters have a lovely texture and chewing them as you would a piece of meat releases the full flavour – but each to their own. ‘The juice from the shell complements their natural flavour and a touch of lemon juice or Tabasco can complete the experience.’ He added: ‘One of the most appealing things about oysters for festive entertaining is that they’re completely self-contained and self-serve which means they make the perfect starter or canapé.’ Reared and hand-picked in the clean waters of remote sea lochs on the west coast of Scotland, the oysters grow naturally by feeding from the nutrient-rich tidal flows of the clean seas around Scotland. They reach maturity at three to three-and-a-half years when they are carefully harvested by hand from the growing trestles, each one individually checked for quality and then purified in holding tanks.","Waitrose has reported a 78 per cent increase in the sale of fresh oysters .

"Six relatives including two pregnant women were rushed to hospital after a family of 20 piled onto a wooden staircase to take their annual Christmas photo - only for it to collapse. Marcella and Kenny Gillenwater were delighted when their children, grandchildren, siblings and other family members arrived at their house in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, on Christmas Day. In keeping with their family's tradition, they all gathered on the steps of their 20ft outdoor staircase after lunch to pose for a picture. But before the snap was taken, the staircase collapsed. Following the disaster, believed to be weight-induced, six family members, including the Gillenwaters' heavily pregnant niece, Tara Baker Calhoun, and another expectant mother, were taken to hospital. Scroll down for video . Tradition: Twenty members of the Gillenwater family piled onto a staircase to take their annual Christmas photo last Thursday- only for it to collapse.

Mr Gillenwater's brother - who was standing near the top of the staircase and plunged almost 20 feet - broke his femur and heel, while one of his nephews suffered a broken ankle, according to WLKY. They are both currently awaiting further surgery at UofL Hospital. Meanwhile, the two pregnant women - who were positioned near the bottom of the staircase - were released after being checked over. Remarkably, Ms Baker Calhoun has since given birth to a healthy son at Baptist Hospital East. Her relatives do not believe the collapse caused her labor since her due date was in early January. Two other relatives were injured in the incident at the Four Seasons subdivision, but not hospitalized. On Tuesday, Mr Gillenwater's elderly mother - also on the staircase at the time - said the incident seemed to happen in 'slow motion'. She said they all heard a 'pop' and then the wood gave way.

"Paying for your fuel could soon become much easier if Apple has its way. As of next year, if you happen to be filling up at a Chevron station, you can choose to purchase your fuel using Apple Pay. The move was recently confirmed by Chevron who tweeted: 'We are working alongside Apple to develop solutions to integrate with Apple Pay at the pump by early 2015.' Paying for your fuel could soon become much easier if Apple has its way. As of next year, if you happen to be filling up at a Chevron station, you can choose to purchase your fuel using Apple Pay (pictured) The California-based energy firm, however, did not mention when exactly its roll out of Apple Pay would be taking place. Chevron has so far supported Apple Pay in its convenience stores and under its Texaco brand since the launch of the mobile payment platform in October. By next year, Apple Pay is expected will be available on the Apple Watch as well as the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. The service works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The California-based energy firm tweeted confirmation of the news. However, it has not clarified when exactly its roll out of Apple Pay will be taking place . As of next year, if you happen to be filling up at a Chevron station, motorists can choose to purchase their fuel using Apple Pay . Article 115 of the General Traffic Regulations prohibits 'keeping the engine, lights, as well as electrical systems such as the radio or devices that emit electromagnetic radiation turned on'. But mobile phones are low-power radio-frequency transmitters (between 450 and 2700 MHz), with a peak power value that ranges between 0.1 and 2 watts, according to Telefonica. Because these devices a tiny amount of energy, the company says that it is unlikely it would trigger an explosion unless it had a defective battery. BP, however, claims that if you drop your mobile phone, a spark can be produced when the batteries are knocked loose. This could be hazardous because of the flammable vapours produced by petrol products. The United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association (UKPI) also says mobile phone are dangerous at a petrol station as they can distract a driver. They say: 'Mobile phones are not designed and certified for use in explosive atmospheres which exist temporarily around the pump and nozzle during refuelling as well as around the fill and vent pipes during petrol deliveries. 'Whilst the risk of incendive sparking from mobile phones is low, they are not intrinsically safe devices and should not be used in those hazardous areas that exist on a forecourt.' This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. There remains, however, some debate over whether the use of mobile phone is safe on a petrol station forecourt. When Apple Pay launched in the US earlier this year, the tech firm was tight-lipped about when the service would roll out to other regions. But a recent job listing inadvertently let slip the service is on its way to Europe, the Middle East, Asia, India and Africa. The listing, first spotted by iClarified, has since been taken down suggesting either the position has been filled, or Apple wasn't ready to make the announcement. Apple boss Tim Cook announced Apple Pay at the launch event for the firm's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September. The service launched in the US in October and is currently accepted by more than 220,000 retailers, and 17 banks in the country. Visa's Pedro Sousa announced shortly after the launch that it was working to bring Apple Pay to the UK 'early next year', but no specific details were given. However, the roll out may be gradual, especially in Europe, as Apple will need to get the approval of the European Union Council of Ministers, in addition to signing deals with multiple retailers and banks. The rollout could equally be brought forward following the news earlier this month that Samsung is looking to launch an Apple Pay rival. Sources told Re/code that the South Korean tech giant is in talks with start-up LoopPay to let people pay for goods using their phones.

"Student: Kevin Hayes, pictured, sued the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in Prince George's County Circuit Court for battering, hazing, false imprisonment and gross negligence. A University student has filed a $3 million lawsuit against a fraternity who he alleges beat him so severely  that he was left with bruises on his buttocks. Kevin Hayes filed the lawsuit against Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in Prince George's County Circuit Court in Maryland for battering, hazing, false imprisonment and gross negligence during pledging. The Bowie State University student alleged that  APA members Mike Ross, Keenan Goins and others punched, hit, slapped, body slammed and paddled him during the fall of 2013. He told WUSA-TV: 'It broke me down. It hurt. It was something that I had never experienced before.' At the time of the incident, Goins was a graduate student and Ross was not a student at the time, according to the lawsuit. Hayes said that he was told to  attend five-to-eight-hour meetings, in which he had to learn chapter and fraternity information. However, he was beaten if any of the information was wrong. The junior college student  said the punishments included Jewel Shockers (side slaps), Back Racks (back slaps), Fat Joes (chest slaps), as well as taking 'wood' (paddling). The pledges were also told to only wear specific colors and not to report what they were experiencing during hazing. However, after he gave a frat leader photographic evidence of the abuse, he was told there would be changes to the way pledging was carried out. But then things changed and Hayes said he was branded a 'snitch.'. According to the lawsuit, Hayes said that fraternity members threatened him and his mother, saying they would 'come by her house and see her.' He added: 'They said 'You're a snitch. Oh, you're always talking. We're never going to accept you. We're going to black ball you. Then they began to ostracize me.' Hayes told WUSA-TV: 'It broke me down. It hurt. It was something that I had never experienced before.' Bruise: The Bowie State University student alleged that this is the bruise, which has been blurred, left on his backside after APA members punched, hit, slapped, body slammed and paddled him during the fall of 2013 . Policy: Bowie State University said it has a 'stringent anti-hazing policy that is coupled with a strong anti-hazing education program.' The student said that he was ignored by other fraternity members and their friends. But his mother did not report the physical abuse to the police. Hayes' attorney Jim Bell, pictured, told WUSA-TV: 'They [the police] have a duty under Maryland law to keep him safe.' Hayes' attorney Jim Bell told WUSA-TV: 'They [the police] have a duty under Maryland law to keep him safe.' Maryland has strict anti-hazing laws which prohibit anyone from putting a student at risk of' serious bodily injury for the purpose of initiation.' In a statement, Bowie university acknowledged the lawsuit. It said: 'Bowie State University is aware of the the lawsuit filed today alleging an incidence of hazing by a fraternity on our campus. 'We understand that the university is not named as a party in the suit and we are not able to comment about any allegations cited in the suit,' the university said in a statement. 'Bowie State University has a stringent anti-hazing policy that is coupled with a strong anti-hazing education program. 'The university considers hazing to be indefensible and contrary to the interest of the university community. 'We work continuously with Greek and other student organizations to assure understanding that no activity that causes mental, physical or social harm will be tolerated.' However, the lawsuit alleged that school advisers never had anyone examine Hayes after the allegations were made.

"A wealthy Chinese businessman has been jailed for 13 years for hiring poachers to kill three tigers so he could eat their penises and drink their blood. China's official Xinhua news agency said Xi Pat had 'a special hobby of grilling tiger bones, boning tiger paws, storing tiger penis, eating tiger meat and drinking tiger blood alcohol'. A court heard he ate the genitals and drank the animals' blood before giving the rest of the meat to his business friends and partners. Xi Pat has been jailed for killiing and eating three tigers - he was caught out when one of his accomplices filmed the entire process with his mobile phone (pictured). The footage was later obtained by police . The court heard he organised three separate trips last year for 15 people, including himself, to Leizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, where they bought tigers for a 'huge amount of money' that were killed and dismembered as they watched. One of the group filmed the entire process of a tiger slaughter with his mobile phone. The footage was later obtained by police. Police then seized eight pieces of animal meat and bones from a refrigerator in Xi Pat's home, some of which were later identified as tiger parts, including a penis. The police report added exotic meats including gecko and cobra were also found in the fridge. A court in Guangxi convicted the 15 of 'illegally transporting precious and endangered wild animal products'. The court heard Xi Pat insisted on the big cats being caught alive so when they were killed they could be bled and he was able to drink the blood. A court heard Xi Pat had eaten at least three tiger penises and drunk 'several litres of tiger blood' The court heard Xi Pat had eaten at least three tiger penises and drunk 'several litres of tiger blood'. Prosecutors claim the illegal poaching operation saw at least 10 tigers being killed and eaten. They said that the tigers had been killed by electrocution so that the hide could be removed and used to create trophies that were handed out to his friends. Xi Pat was sentenced to 13 years in prison and handed a fine of 1.55 million yuan ($25,000), gxnews.com.cn said, with the others were jailed for terms between five and six and a half years. Tiger meat is not only sought after on the black market but is often used in Chinese medicine. It is a long-held belief across parts of Asia that penises of animals such as tigers and seals can boost men's sexual performance. Decades of trafficking and habitat destruction have slashed the tiger population from 100,000 a century ago to approximately 3,000, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species, where the tiger is classed as endangered.

"EasyJet cabin crew in France are set to strike on New Year's Eve and New Year's day that will cause delays and cancellations to flights. The airline's French cabin crew unions will follow up a Christmas strike over profit sharing and rotas with another two days of industrial action, a union source has said. The initial strike, which began on December 25, led to around 40 cancellations at the UK airline's French operations on Friday. French cabin crew for easyJet are unhappy with their profit share and rota scheduling (File Photo) 'The responsibility for this new call for strike action rests with management, which has not contacted us,' an SNPNC-FO union source said. French cabin crew unions called the initial strike to demand a larger share of Easyjet's French profits for employees and improved management of staffing rotas. Staff voted to strike soon after the opening of annual negotiations on pay and conditions, according to the company. The airline has said it remains open to discussion and committed to finding an appropriate solution with unions. Easyjet said its crews were 'among the best paid in the profession in France' and that staff had benefited from above-inflation pay rises since 2008. Laurent Nicolas, a representative of the SNPNC-FO union that represents 600 easyJet flight attendants, said workers are upset over schedules that 'can change 20 times per month'. He said the scheduling makes it impossible for employees to spend quality time with their families. The union argues that the airline can afford a pay increase for flight attendants as its operating profits were up 21 per cent this year, reaching €728m (approximately £571m). That has translated into huge bonuses for management and income that is up to 300 times the average salary of an easyJet flight attendant, the union claims. Passengers flying from French airports on easyJet flights may be subjected to cancellations and delays . Thirty-eight easyJet flights were cancelled from French airports on Boxing Day, with British staff drafted in to help with the remaining flights. A spokesperson for easyJet told MailOnline Travel: 'EasyJet has been advised of an easyJet cabin crew industrial action in France from December 31, 00:01, to January 1, 23:59, local time and can confirm that no UK flights will be affected by cancellations on 31st December. 'A small number of flights will be rescheduled so passengers are advised to check www.easyjet.com/flighttracker for the latest information. 'We would like to apologise and reassure customers that we are doing everything possible to minimise any disruption as a result of the industrial action.

Mr Habib offered to help negotiate with the gunman during the siege, and maintains that Monis, while 'sick and disturbed' was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children. He insistently told Fairfax that he believed Monis had no intention of harming any of the 18 people he took hostage at the Lindt Café in Martin Place on December 15, nor that his attack was associated with motivations linked to terrorist organisation the Islamic State. His offer of help police negotiate with the 50-year-old was one of many put forward by other Muslim community members, including the Grand Mufti, Ibrahim Abu Mohamed.

Meanwhile, Monis' body has finally been claimed by some of his anonymous acquaintances, and is to be buried somewhere in Melbourne within the next few days, according to News Corp. It comes after claims from the Muslim community, that no Muslim funeral home would accept him as his body remained in the morgue unclaimed, days after the siege had ended. Contrastingly, an Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished  Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia. Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16 . Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16.

He did so 'by acting alone and striking the kuffar (non-believers) where it would hurt them most - in their own lands and on the very streets that they presumptively walk in safety,' the magazine states. 'It didn't take much; he got hold of a gun and stormed a cafe taking everyone inside hostage. 'Yet in doing so, he prompted mass panic, brought terror to the entire nation ... The blessings in his efforts were apparent from the very outset.' An Islamic State propaganda magazine lavished Monis' with praise for the siege, labelling the hostage crisis a 'daring raid' and calling for more lone wolf attacks in Australia . At the start of the siege, a black flag with Arabic writing was visible in a window of the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place. Dabiq declared this was 'a testament to his sincerity'. It said Monis joined other Muslims who answered a jihadist call 'to strike those waging war against the Islamic State wherever they may be'. In October, Dabiq published calls for lone wolf attacks across western nations, especially US, UK, France, Australia and Germany. It repeated that statement in the latest edition. 'There will be others who follow the examples set by Man Haron Monis and Numan Haider in Australia,' it said.","Mamdouh Habib employed gunman Man Haron Monis in 2007 when he sought Labor's seat in Sydney's western suburb of Auburn .

"A woman was shamed into losing 10 stone after receiving size 22 jeans from her husband on Christmas Day - which didn't fit. Amy Gordon made a New Year’s Resolution to beat the bulge after that mortifying moment. The 29-year-old said: ‘They were designer jeans, and my husband Andy said he wanted to treat me, but they were a size 22 and I felt so ashamed. 'What was worse was that I couldn’t actually get them over my hips. 'I pretended I was saving them for a special occasion - and felt humiliated all over again.’ Scroll down for video . At her heaviest, Amy Gordon was a size 22 and 18 stone, due to a diet of pizza, crisps and comfort eating. She vowed to lose weight after failing to get a pair of size 22 jeans over her hips - and taunts about her weight . The 29-year-old has dropped seven dress sizes and now weighs just 9st 6lb after 16 months of dieting . And when a comedian laughed at her for being fat on a night out, it was the final straw. The excruciating moment came when she was out with friends and and suddenly found herself in the spotlight. 'The comedian had made a few fat jokes already, but then he spotted me,’ she said. 'I tried to hide but it was impossible. He said “On a night out you can always pull a fat bird” and “Don’t worry, love, you can always be fat and pretty”. Mrs Gordon, of Wolverhampton, said: ‘I’ve always been a big girl but after the comedy show I felt humiliated. 'It reduced me to tears but I knew I had to do something about my weight. It wasn’t easy though.' Then a size 22, she tried a few weight loss plans with little success. ‘I began to live on toast, fruit and salads but although I lost weight, my periods stopped,’ she said. ‘My mum was worried about me and she made sure I ate. 'But I went from one extreme to another. I started bingeing on pizza, chips and cake and before I knew it, I was huge again.’ Looking back, she realised she had been doing this all of her life. ‘Mum had always cooked me dinners like shepherd’s pie. But I couldn’t resist buying chocolate and crisps from the tuck shop.' Her size also made her a target for cruel comments. 'My classmates would laugh at me, call me Fatty and Dawn French and roar ""hide the sweets"" when I walked past. 'I put on a brave face, but back home I cried and comfort ate, making things worse.’ The excruciating moment came when she was out with friends and a comedian saw her and said: 'Don’t worry, love, you can always be fat and pretty' After marrying husband Andy in April 2011, Mrs Gordon went from a size 16 (pictured) to size 22 again . Despairing, Mrs Gordon went on another diet and later met her husband-to-be, Andy, when she was a size 16. But happy and in love, the weight soon piled on again. She said: ‘After gaining weight I slimmed down for our wedding to a 16 again. ‘I got married in April 2011 and I walked down the aisle in my dress feeling amazing. 'But afterwards I pigged out yet again and, lo and behold, I went back up to a size 22.’ It was Christmas 2012 that her new husband bought her the designer jeans which didn't fit. ‘He told me he wanted to treat me as I don’t buy many clothes,’ she recalled. ‘Looking at the size 22 label, I was so embarrassed, but I thanked him anyway. 'But when I tried them on I couldn’t get them over my thighs.’ It was this that inspired her to attend weight loss classes. 'When I joined Weight Watchers, I was just determined not to be the ""pretty fat bird"" any longer,' she said . 'I decided after that to go on a proper diet once and for all. So in the January, I joined the local Weight Watchers. ‘When the leader, Dawn, told me I was 18 stone, I wasn’t surprised. 'I was just determined not to be the ""pretty fat bird"" any longer.’ She began to follow the plan, which encourages dieters to choose healthy alternatives and limit portion size. Back home, she began to eat more fruit and vegetables, brown bread and pasta - and her husband joined in with her new, healthy diet to support her. The pair also joined the gym together. ‘By the following Christmas, Andy bought me size 12 jeans, not 22. It was brilliant,' said Mrs Gordon. This May, 16 months after beginning her weight loss challenge, she reached her target of 10 stone. She is now a svelte 9 stone 6lbs and a size 8. ‘It still amazes me,’ she said. 'I now actually look forward to getting clothes and lingerie.'","At her heaviest, Amy Gordon was a size 22 and 18 stone .

"Former President George H.W. Bush was released from a Houston hospital Tuesday after a stay of about a week for treatment of shortness of breath. The 90-year-old left Houston's Methodist Hospital, was resting at home and is 'grateful to the doctors and nurses for their superb care,' family spokesman Jim McGrath said in a brief statement. Bush, the oldest living former U.S. president, was taken by ambulance to the hospital a week ago today for what was described then as a precaution after experiencing shortness of breath. His hospital stay included Christmas. Scroll down for video . Former President George H.W. Bush was released from a Houston hospital Tuesday after a weeklong stay for treatment of shortness of breath . Bush is pictured here at a Nov. 23 NFL game during which the Houston Texans played the Cincinnati Bengals at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. Bush served as the coin-toss captain during the game. It was his last public appearance before his hospitalization last Tuesday . The former president also spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013 after a nearly two-month stay. Bush made two public appearances last month. He was at Texas A&M University where his son, former President George W. Bush, talked about his book about his father. He also served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the U.S. Armed Forces. He spent Sunday at the hospital watching the Texans game on television. The elder Bush was a naval aviator in World War II — at one point the youngest in the Navy — and was shot down over the Pacific. He served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy. His son eldest son, George, went on to succeed Clinton in office, serving two consecutive terms as president from 2000 to early 2008. His second son, Jeb, is mulling a bid for the presidency himself, announcing a few days before his father's hospitalization that he would 'actively explore' the possibility. Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston, Texas. Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, has a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. On Monday his spokesman said his breathing had 'returned to normal' but he would remain in a hospital for at least another night pending approval from doctors for him to return to his Houston home. The former president and first lady Barbara Bush want to 'thank everyone for their good wishes and prayers,' McGrath said Monday.","The 90-year-old left Houston's Methodist Hospital on Tuesday and is now resting at home .

"Workers carrying out renovations have uncovered the grisly remains of eight human bodies believed to have been killed by Indian security forces as recently as 20 years ago. The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital of India's northeastern Manipur state. They appear to have been buried somewhere between 20 and 40 years ago when the area was used by the police force and later by a commando unit of the Indian army. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . The skeletons - including eight human skulls - were found buried in the grounds of the Tombisana High School in Imphal, the capital India's northeastern Manipur state . It was around this time that there were a large number of 'enforced disappearances' of people in the region, believed to have been victims of 'extra-judicial executions' by security forces. The executions of, mainly young, Indians that occurred in Manipur were part of 'shoot to kill' policy aimed at clamping down on the activities of insurgents. Under the Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (Afspa) 1958, security forces have unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared disturbed. Even a non-commissioned officer is granted the right to shoot to kill based on mere suspicion that it is necessary to do so in order to 'maintain the public order'. The remains appear to have been buried somewhere between 20 and 40 years ago when the area was used by the police force and later by a commando unit of the Indian army . Rights groups have claimed that security forces used the act as a shield while they carried out human rights violations including arbitrary killings, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and enforced disappearances. The Indian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act  allows soldiers unrestricted and unaccounted power to carry out their operations, once an area is declared 'disturbed'. This gives the army sweeping powers, including the power to shoot to kill in certain situations and to arrest people without warrants. The Act also provides virtual immunity from prosecution by requiring prior permission to prosecute from the Central Government. It has been put into force in parts of northeast India - including Manipur - since 1958. Amnesty says the law has 'facilitated grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, rape and torture and other ill treatment'. The Extra Judicial Execution Victim Families Association (EEVFAM) Manipur and the The Families of the Involuntarily Disappeared Association, Manipur (FIDAM) noted that the compound had been used by the 49 Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for more than 20 years and later by a commando unit. According to the EEVFAM, some 1,528 people were killed in Manipur in extra-judicial executions between May 1979 and May 2012. However, those demanding an investigation into the uncovered remains have said it is unlikely that even if the killers are identified that there will be any action. But there is now huge pressure in the region  to identify the dead bodies with DNA tests on each skull and the remains. It is hoped that this could bring closure to at least some of the families of the hundreds of  people who have gone missing in the state. Manipur has had a long record of insurgency and inter-ethnic violence with various separatist groups including the communists, the People's Liberation Party, the People's Revolutionary Army and the United National Liberation Front. Individual groups have been responsible for armed robberies and attacks on police stations and army bases as part of their campaign to be free of Indian control. In 1980, the central government brought the entire state of Manipur under the AFSPA because the state government claimed that   local police needed the help of the Armed Forces to maintain law and order. There is now huge pressure in the region to identify the dead bodies. It is hoped that this could bring closure to at least some of the families of the hundreds of people who have gone missing in the state .

Ms Bennett spoke after the article was seized on by critics on Twitter, with Ukip leader Nigel Farage tweeting about her reported comments.

"A New Hampshire woman in her 80s got the shock of her life when she found a Ku Klux Klan robe belonging to her father from the 1920s. The woman, who would not reveal her name was rummaging in her attic for vintage items to auction off when she found the robe. Nobody in the family knew her father was affiliated with the Klan. The white robe bears the KKK's distinctive round, scarlet patch with a white cross. For years, it sat in a bag, assumed by family members to be an innocuous garment and not a feared symbol of the white supremacist group. The white robe of a Ku Klux Klansman from Rochester (pictured) is now on the auction block . Auctioneer Scott Morrill said when the woman found it and considered selling it, she removed the patch to wash the garment. On the back of the patch was her father's name. Now tucked between children's Victorian-era button-down shoes and a World War I collar bag with collars, the item stands out on an auctioneer's website touting an end-of-the-year sale. Morrill, who has been in the business for 26 years, said he has never seen one sold at auction and does not know what to ask for it when the auction kicks off Tuesday night. He already has received some bids by phone. 'It's not the sort of thing people would readily buy in front of their neighbors,' Morrill said. The KKK, a secretive society formed in the post-Civil War South, emerged briefly in Rochester from about 1923 to 1925, according to Martha Fowler, president of the Rochester Historical Society. Fowler told Foster's Daily Democrat that the Klan held a meeting there in June 1924, when about 10,000 members from New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts gathered. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan pictured lighting torches to ignite a cross during a Ku Klux Klan rally and cross burning on a hog farm outside of New Orleans in 1977 (library image) Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the Klan has shrunk nationally from about 4 million at the time of that Rochester meeting to about 4,000 now. There are single chapters in New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. Potok said finding a robe at an auction is fairly rare: He estimates it's happened half a dozen times in the past 10 years or so. The SPLC, a civil rights advocacy group that tracks hate groups, believes museums are better destinations for robes and other Klan artifacts. 'I think it is true that we can't ignore or suppress our history,' he said. 'We have a very racist past and the Klan was a part of that.' Morrill said he wrestled with whether to sell an item that represents hate but, as he has done with Nazi paraphernalia, decided the historical significance of the robe outweighed other concerns. 'My first reaction was, 'I really don't want anything to do with it,'' Morrill said. 'I find it offensive myself. But what we really do here is sell history. And the way you learn from mistakes you make is to not destroy it. After a little soul-searching, I decided it should be sold.' Besides calls from potential buyers, he has gotten angry calls from people outraged that he would sell such an item. He is not sure what to expect at the auction. 'I'm hoping people will be adult about it,' he said.","The unnamed woman had no idea her father was affiliated with the Klan .

Coffey has also entertained people at private functions for late media mogul Kerry Packer, entrepreneur John Singleton and former prime minister Paul Keating. The entertainer's act merges juggling, fire-eating and death-defying feats, which are 'all wrapped up with non-stop humour'.

"A photographer has created a wonderfully unique family album by recreating a series of portraits of seven different generations of her female relatives. Los Angeles-based Photoshop expert Christine McConnell used a series of detailed editing techniques in order to create perfect copies of the original images, which all feature members of her mother's family and were taken over a period of 200 years. The 33-year-old then displayed the two images alongside each other, so as to demonstrate her remarkable resemblance to each of the original subjects. Scroll down for video . Kathryn, born 1957: Photographer Christine McConnell (R) captured a variety of fashion styles and beauty trends in each of the portraits, which were taken over a period of 200 years . Mildred, born 1928: The 33-year-old (R) used portraits of various women from her mother's side of the family . The portraits also offer a fascinating glimpse into the changing styles and fashions of each period; the earliest image, of a woman called Mary who was born in 1821, sees the subject wearing a very simple black dress, with her hair pulled back from her face. Fast forward to one of the more recent photos of Kathryn, born in 1957, and the glaring changes in style are easy to see. Gone are the drab and dowdy clothes of old and in their place, a vibrant and detailed red dress, big, bouncy hairstyle and over-the-top gold jewelry. The beauty trends for each era are also clearly visible, with Mildred, born in 1928, modeling a deep red lip and full hair, while Attie Mae , born 1898, opted for a much more subtle look, complete with softly styled hair. Eager to include herself in the line-up, Ms McConnell also included a single portrait of herself in the collection, dolled up in the style of her birth year, 1981. Martha, born 1821: The images have earned Ms McConnell (R) high praise from her fellow Flickr users, with many praising her incredible editing skills . Christine, born 1981: The photographer also included an image of herself, taken in the style of her own year of birth . Attie Mae, born 1898: Each of Ms McConnell's own portraits are showcased alongside the original so as to best demonstrate her resemblance to her relatives . And clearly unable to resist the chance to include a humorous element in the project, the last collection in the portrait sees Ms McConnell attempt to impersonate a horse called Flicka. The portrait, in which the photographer poses in a checked shirt, complete with straw in her mouth, is the final picture in the series, which has thus far proved incredibly popular with fans. 'Fantastic series! Proves you can actually replicate any era, or indeed creature,' Flickr user Iain S Wallace commented on the images. 'This is a hoot! Love it. You come from a family of pretty women - and one mare,' Jill Farmer added. It is not the first time that Ms McConnell's unique editing skills have earned her praise. Jane, born 1858: Everything from the hairstyles to the clothing was carefully recreated . Flicka, 2015: Ms McConnell couldn't help but include one humorous image . In July, the photographer became an overnight social media sensation after posting a series of images on Instagram which combined traditional 1950s female stereotypes with classic cult horror movies. At the time, she told Buzzfeed that her work was inspired by her love of the different time periods, and the unique cultural phenomenons from within each era. 'I’m very enamored with the style of the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s,' she said. 'But I love the goofy sense of comedy that came out of the 1980s. 'So my work is kind of a pretty/spooky combination of those things.'","Christine H McConnell, 33, used Photoshop in order to perfectly copy the style of each picture .

"Disgruntled tourists are taking to TripAdvisor to slam an extinct volcano that overlooks the centre of Edinburgh for not having wifi, gift shops or enough places to sit. With a rating of 4.5 the natural beauty has been voted the top attraction in Scotland’s capital after more than 4,500 user reviews on the travel website. But there are some sightseers who aren’t happy that the windswept peak doesn’t offer an internet connection for their devices or benches to sit on while enjoying the breath-taking views. One visitor wrote a one-star review on TripAdvisor after visiting Arthur's Seat and finding no wifi connection . One of the one-star reviews of the famous hill lashes out at the absence of any seat at the top ‘for photographs’. In a TripAdvisor review, one of the visitors wrote: 'Despite the great views after a strenuous walk, what really lets this place down is the lack of amenities. No gift shop, no free wifi. Nowhere to sit unless you want to sit on the floor. The user added: ‘Could really do with something like a Tesco Express up there so you could buy snacks and things, probably a Starbucks too for a sit down and a coffee’. Another, who climbed the ancient 822ft slope, added: ‘It was too high and at the top no seat. ‘With the name Arthur's Seat we had expected a chair for photographs.’ With a rating of 4.5 the extinct volcano overlooking Edinburgh has been voted the city's top attraction . One reviewer said that the signage was not clear, and added: ‘It's sad that there is nowhere to buy any food or drink and not even a small gift shop to buy a postcard.’ Another visitor added: ‘But beware of the dogs. People let their dogs run wild up here. It ruins the whole place. ‘Lots of runners and walkers going round the path that rotates the whole hill, but as I say, dogs attack and ruin the whole place.’ Despite a handful of negative reviews, Arthur's Seat tops TripAdvisor's list of must-see Edinburgh attractions - with the website awarding it a 2014 certificate of excellence. Angus Miller of Geowalks, which leads walking tours around the landmark, said he was ‘not surprised’ the attraction was top rated - and accused those laying into it of being ‘spoon fed’. He said: ‘I suppose if you have that kind of mentality you do expect just to be able to pick up a coffee and go to the toilet. One visitor who climbed the peak said 'with the name Arthur's Seat we had expected a chair for photographs' Another user complained that 'there is nowhere to buy any food or drink' or a postcard' atop the peak . ‘But it's actually a wild area within the city. A lot of people go up there in city shoes as well, and the paths are quite rough. ‘People expect a city walk, but it's wild land. Obviously people are used to being spoon fed.’ He added: ‘I sometimes get people getting confused on tours. I had some guys from Newcastle, and one pointed to Fife and asked if it was Wales. ‘But I'm not surprised that it's top rated - it does seem to be the one thing that people coming to Edinburgh feel the need to do. People seem to be really enthusiastic about it. ""It's such a contrast from the busy streets. It's amazing - the views and the scenery.’ TripAdvisor has awarded a 2014 certificate of excellence to Arthur's Seat thanks to favourable reviews . A visitor to Edinburgh Castle wrote on the website that he has 'seen more impressive stuff at Disneyland' Martin Gray, ranger and visitor services manager for Historic Scotland, which looks after Arthur's Seat, said he was ‘delighted’ visitors had rated the attraction so highly. He added: ‘In regards to some of the more unusual comments - whilst we are keen to receive feedback, it is after all a mountain - and we would ask any potential visitors to prepare for it as so that they can safely enjoy the wildness of this most special of Edinburgh landmarks.’ Arthur’s Seat was just one of a number of Edinburgh landmarks to face tourists' wrath. The Scott Monument on Princes Street was deemed ‘too high’ and ‘a dizzying harrowing experience’. And a visitor to Edinburgh Castle described its 500-year-old crown jewels as ‘a paltry crown and the Stone of Destiny’, adding: ‘I have seen more impressive stuff at Disneyland’.","Arthur's Seat has a 4.5 rating after more than 4,500 TripAdvisor reviews .

"It reads like a shopping list of a super-rich international playboy, from yachts, classic cars and jewellery to luxury homes in Knightsbridge, Dubai and Spain. But the £22million catalogue of riches have been seized by prosecutors this year from some of Britain’s biggest drug dealers, fraudsters and tax cheats. Investigators working around the globe have vowed to pursue criminals even after they have been caught and convicted, insisting they will ensure ‘crime does not pay’. Details of assets seized from criminals include a property in Knightsbridge (right) in which tax fraudster Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh (left) had a £1million stake . Dosanjh also handed over a Rolls Royce Phantom, like the one pictured, as part of £11.4million recovered to date . Martin Evans was ordered to repay £4.8million for several offences including theft, deception and running a firm while bankrupt. Prosecutors sold his V50 yacht, similar to the one pictured, for £330,000 to raise £1.8million to date . The Crown Prosecution Service has released details of the vehicles, houses and property taken from just seven criminals which it is claimed could be used to fuel more crime. They include high-end properties worth millions of pounds in Knightsbridge and Chelsea, two of London’s most expensive districts, as well as Kent, Marbella in Spain and a flat on the 49th floor of Dubai’s landmark Torch building. The rogue’s gallery of criminals have also lost a Rolls Royce Phantom, a V50 yacht and £2,500 Tiffany necklace. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, told MailOnline: ‘It’s simply not right that criminals should be allowed to benefit from their illegal lifestyles so CPS prosecutors up and down the country in our new Proceeds of Crime Service are working flat out, with police colleagues, to deprive them of their ill-gotten gains.’ The largest amount seized on the list was from tax fraudster Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, who was convicted in June 2012 of using carbon credit VAT rules to con HMRC out of £39million. Millions were transferred out of the UK to accounts in Switzerland and then around the world to Singapore, Cyprus and UAE. Sentenced to 13 years in prison on appeal, an order was made last year to seize £2.9million plus another £10million in hidden assets. London drug baron Redwan El Ghaidouni was ordered to hand over more than £400,000 in 2012 after being convicted of trying to smuggle drugs into the UK. The CPS seized and sold his flat on the 49th floor of the Torch building in Dubai’s Marina to raise the money . The total recovered to date is now £11,414,440, including a Rolls Royce Phantom and a property in Knightsbridge in which Dosanjh had more than £1million in equity. British national David John Downes, who lived mainly in Spain, was jailed for 4 years and 7 months last year for his role in a major ‘boiler room fraud’ in which worthless shares were sold to unwitting investors using high pressure sales techniques. The shares were sold over the telephone to the UK based investors by ‘cold calling’ by plausible sounding salesmen who were based abroad, with the money placed in bank accounts in the US, Canada, Dubai, Singapore and Switzerland. To date he has had more than £4million seized including land in Spain and properties in Marbella. Money launderer Tarek Meghrabi was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in 2012 for crimes worth more than £8million. Ordered to pay £2.3million, prosecutors took ‘robust action’ and seized and sold a property in Chelsea worth £2.2million and a Tiffany necklace which sold at auction this year for £2,500. With additional payments of £30,114 in May this year, the total reclaimed to date is £2.2million. Martin Evans was jailed for four years in prison in 2006 for offences including being a bankrupt in charge of a company, trading with intent to defraud a creditor and five counts of theft. Ordered to pay back £4.8million, so fare £1.8million has been confiscated so fare. It includes £948,998 that was located and seized in Switzerland in September this year and just over £330,000 raised from the proceeds of selling a luxury V50 yacht. Melvin Jestin was ordered to pay £627,500 after his 2011 conviction for conspiracy to supply cannabis. After years of Jestin trying to delay making the payments, he eventually sold his Tudor-style six-bedroom house in two acres of land in a village in Kent in March this year and has now paid £759,033, including interest. Fraudster David John Downes, jailed for 4 years and 7 months last year for his role in a major ‘boiler room fraud’, had properties in Marbella seized as part of £4million taken by the CPS . Money launderer Tarek Meghrabi was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in 2012 for crimes worth more than £8million. Ordered to pay £2.3million, prosecutors took ‘robust action’ and seized and sold a property in Chelsea worth £2.2million (left) and a Tiffany necklace  for £2,500 . Assets seized by the Crown Prosecution Service includes: . Drug gang leader Daniel Redmond was sentenced to 9 and a half years for a plot to import cannabis resin into the country. Ordered to hand over £3million by Snaresbrook Crown Court, to date prosecutors have seized £1.5million including cash seized in Spain and enforced against the order in May this year. London drug baron Redwan El Ghaidouni was ordered to hand over more than £400,000 in 2012 after being convicted of trying to smuggle drugs into the UK. The CPS seized and sold his flat on the 49th floor of the Torch building in Dubai’s Marina, raising the £money he was required to pay in the first successful British confiscation order in the United Arab Emirates. Ms Saunders added: “The examples highlighted today by MailOnline are a very powerful demonstration of the message that crime does not pay. ‘It’s particularly unpalatable at this time of year, when many law abiding people are feeling the pinch, to think of organised criminals capitalising on the misery of drugs and fraud and revelling in extravagant UK properties and overseas holiday homes. ‘So I’m delighted that we’ve taken these assets back, often to the benefit of British tax payers.’ Prosecutors can now take tougher action in more countries than ever before, she added. ‘The proceeds of crime - the cars, the cash, the houses - are often laundered and used to fuel more crime. They are the lifeblood of organised criminals but we are the means of constricting that blood flow. ‘Organised crime works across borders and so must we. That’s why we’ve sent CPS prosecutors to Spain and Dubai, and have plans to send others to the Caribbean and South Africa, to work with international partners to thwart the attempts of criminals to hide their assets.’","Assets seized by Crown Prosecution Service from wealthy criminals .

"A Chinese smartphone manufacturer that has been accused of copying Apple has become the most successful tech start-up in the world after being valued at $45 billion (£29 billion). Xiaomi achieved success in just four years by producing a range of low priced mobile phone handsets that have attracted millions of customers. It is now worth more than Uber, the taxi app - which went on the market valued at more than $18.2 billion (£11.7 billion). Xiaomi has enjoyed success with smartphones like the Mi-2A and Mi-2S after it was founded by Lei Jun (above) four years ago although the company has drawn criticism for copying some of Apple's products . Investors now believe that Xiaomi it has the potential to become a global consumer brand and as a result they have poured in cash in recent months. Apple's head of design hit out Xiaomi at the recent Vanity Fair New Estalishment Summit in San Francisco. Asked what he felt about the company being described as the 'Apple of China', Sir Jonathan Ive criticised them for copying his company's designs. 'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. He said: 'When you're doing something for the first time, for example with the phone, and you don't know it's going to work, and you spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it's copied — I have to be honest, the first thing I think isn't ""ooh, that was flattering"". 'All those weekends I could have had at home with my lovely family but didn't, but the flattery made up for it.' However, Xiaomi's global vice president Hugo Barra said such accusations were 'sensationalist'. He told the Verge: 'If you have two similarly skilled designers, it makes sense that they would reach the same conclusion.' Among those investing in Xiaomi is a private equity group linked to Jack Ma, the boss of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which recently floated on the New York Stock Exchange. Yuri Milner, who was an early investor in Facebook, has poured in more than $500 million (£321 million) after saying Xiaomi was ‘unprecedented in terms of the speed of its growth’. He predicted that the company’s value could got even higher - and reach as much as $100 billion (£64 billion). Xiaomi is currently the third biggest smartphone maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung. It produces phones and tablets bearing the 'Mi' logo. Similarities in the design of Xiaomi's products and those of Apple have earned the company the unofficial title as 'the Apple of China'. It even produces a MiTV similar to AppleTV and its own version of Apple's iCloud called MiCloud. Executives at Apple, which is valued at around $651.5 billion (£418.6 billion), have reacted badly to these, with its vice president of design SirJonathan Ive effectively accusing Xiaomi of theft. Xiamoi's revenues increased by 300 per cent last year and now stand at $5.5 billion (£3.5 billion). Last year it turned just a small $56 million (£36 million) profit, a figure that investors are convinced will increase very sharply very soon. Sources told Recode that Xiaomi’s revenue is now more likely to be $10 billion (£6 billion) which, in a mark of how fast the company is growing, is the same as what it was said to be worth in total last year. The Xiaomi Miui 6 handset, which many have said is simply a copy of the iPhone 5S and uses its own apps, has helped turn Xiaomi into the third biggest smartphone producer in the world behind Apple and Samsung . Xiaomi has huge plans to expand and poached Hugo Barra from Google after he oversaw the launch of its Android operating system. It could bring its aggressive pricing strategy to the US or Europe - in China it is known for tactics like selling 100,000 phones costing just $130 (£84) in just 90 seconds via Internet promotions. Xiaomi’s new valuation was announced by chief executive and founder Lei Jun in a statement. He said: ‘This fundraising round is in recognition of the results Xiaomi has achieved in the last four years since inception, and also unveils the next chapter of development for Xiaomi. ‘Xiaomi will assume we are starting from scratch, and continue working towards our dream to let everyone globally enjoy a better life through technology. Xiaomi Redmi phones have been the company's best selling products in China, Singapore, Taiwan and India . ‘Xiaomi will launch some heavyweight flagship products in January 2015 to show gratitude to the fans, partners and investors who have been supporting us.’ Analysts’ eyebrows were raised after Uber, the US-based taxi app, was valued at $17 billion (£11 billion) in June. But since then it has more than doubled and is now said to be worth some $41 billion (£26 billion) with another $1.2 billion (£0.8 billion) infusion of cash earlier this month. Analysts have said that investors seem to have a ‘limitless appetite’ for Uber and that it is on course to trump General Motors, the largest American car maker, which has a market capitalisation of $53.2 billion (£34.2 billion). In an interview with Bloomberg Milner said that he was attracted to Xiaomi instead of Uber because of the ‘size of the opportunity ahead of them’. He said: ‘I don’t think there’s any company that has reached $1 billion in revenue as fast as Xiaomi. In every conceivable benchmark, it’s almost unprecedented in terms of its speed of growth.’","Xiaomi was founded just four years ago by Chinese businessman Lei Jun .

"A Florida man whose face and body is adorned with distinctive tattoos has been arrested after he was busted allegedly  making fire-starting devices. Police say that a search warrant was served on the mobile home of 30-year-old Jeffrey Mark Jalinski on December 22. Orange County deputies and SWAT entered the truck expecting to find drugs about 9.15am, according to The Orlando Sentinel. But once inside they found Jalinski  with three beer bottles containing possible gasoline and a rag stuck in the neck of each bottle, often referred to as a Molotov cocktail.

"A cycling lane in Bristol has been likened to an obstacle course as it weaves its way round several trees and lamp posts. Bristol City Council painted white lines on a section of pavement in Nelson Street to create a contra-flow cycle lane, allowing bike riders to pedal against the prevailing traffic in relative safety. The council moved the cycle lane from the roadway due to building works which narrowed the width of the carriageway forcing them to move the facility which allowed riders to pedal the opposite way to traffic. A cyclist weaves their way though the maze-like cycle lane in Nelson Street in Bristol City Centre . Council workmen painted the white lines on the pavement while building works took place on Nelson Street . Cyclists using the cycle lane have to weave sharply out of the way of several trees to remain within the lines . However, the strangely shaped cycle lane is not the oddest in Britain, where there is one of just six feet in length. A cyclist was left in disbelief when he spotted what is thought to be the UK's shortest cycle lane - at just six foot. It appears next to a shared space pavement for pedestrians and cyclists, but has left riders baffled as to why they even bothered. The lane appears out of nowhere, with no other cycle paths in sight, before stopping abruptly just a few feet later when the road hits a junction. The cycle lane, in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol is only six feet long and believed to be the UK's shortest cycle lane . The tiny cycle track is situated on a junction between Heather Avenue and Park Lane in South Gloucestershire . Before the building works commenced, the cycle lane was on the side of the road, pictured right . Cyclist David Stone spotted the new lane in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol. He said: 'Is this the shortest cycle lane in the UK? 'I have no idea how long it has been there but a new mini roundabout has recently been located in Heather Avenue, so it may be that they had some paint left over.' This cycle lane in Beetwell Street, Chesterfield, is only 13 feet long. It was painted in April this year by Derbyshire County Council but has already been slammed by the town's cycling community . The bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon was created in December 2012 and is just 8ft 2ins, barely longer than a bike. It was defended by Plymouth council as they said it did not cost them anything . One cycle lane in Bristol is only six feet long, pictured,  and is believed to be Britain' shortest . Other weird cycle lanes include this one, pictured, in Chesterfield which is just 13 feet long . Meanwhile, this one in Plymouth, Devon, pictured, was ridiculed by cyclists when it was unveiled . This bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon, was ridiculed by the town's cyclists when it was built in 2012 . South Gloucestershire Council said the cycle lane, situated on a junction between Heather Avenue and Park Lane, had nothing to do with them. A spokesman said: 'It is believed that it is there to protect cyclists who have returned to the road. 'In the planning application for the development, there is an agreement to provide for safety at road junctions.' The cycle lane was created by developer Barratt Homes, who inserted the lane when completing a nearby housing estate as cyclists join the road from a shared pavement. A spokesman for Barratt Homes said: 'The cycleway markings are on the road as part of the termination on the shared footpath and cycleway along Heather Avenue and have been installed as part of the technical requirements of South Gloucestershire Highways under the planning consent and road adoption agreement.' This is not the first time ridiculously short bike lanes have been marked out on British roads. Meanwhile, council officials in Cardiff spent an estimated £2,000 painting this stretch of roadway red . In December 2012, bungling council workers created a bike lane, measuring just 8ft 2ins, on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon. A council spokesman said the path did not council anything and was added because it alerted cyclists to the left hand turn into a new facility. The 8ft stretch of cycle lane in Cardiff city centre cost an estimated £2,000 when it was completed in 2010 . Cardiff Council officials spent an estimated £2,000 in painting the red and white markings on the tiny stretch . Elsewhere, council workers in Cardiff were criticised for building an 8ft bike lane in 2010 at the estimated cost of £2,000. Welsh cyclists were left baffled with the logic behind the lane when an official told them it was to 'highlight the interface between the eastbound carriageway and the beginning of a new contraflow facility'. Most recently, cyclists ridiculed a decision to create a path - sandwiched between two junctions - in Chesterfield. The 13 foot cycle lane in Beetwell Street in Chesterfield was developed in April this year and Derbyshire county council bosses said it offered a useful link in a much longer bike route in the town. But users said officials could have saved themselves the bother of marking its start and finish with painted signs – which are squeezed in next to each other on the small patch of pavement.","Bristol County Council moved the cycle lane onto the pavement .

"Many New Year’s Eve revellers will be drinking themselves into a stupor on Wednesday night, but it’s probably best not to do it after you’ve robbed a restaurant of all its alcohol. This is what one boozy thief worked out in Darwin after police found him comatose at the scene of a massive alcohol theft  from a restaurant in the city's CBD. ABC reported that two men, 33 and 44, allegedly broke into the restaurant on Monday night and loaded a wheelie bin full of alcohol, with one then passing out drunk on the premises. This is the alcohol police in Darwin recouped after the boozy robber passed out drunk on the premises . The two men forced entry to the cold store. One tipped all the rubbish out of a nearby wheelie bin then filled it with the restaurant's spirits. 'He then wheeled it out and started drinking,' Duty Superintendent Louise Jorgensen said. The only problem was that he did more drinking than wheeling. A number of others also took advantage of the open premises and helped themselves. 'The original villains also helped themselves to various slabs of beer,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. The robbers piled the bottles of spirits into a wheelie bin but they did not make a quick getaway . After polishing off a couple of bottles of stolen spirits the legless thief wasn't going anywhere . In the morning one of the men was allegedly found on the premises by an off-duty police officer. 'He was passed out, comatose in front of the restaurant. The wheelie bin was nearby. Empties were everywhere,' Superintendent Jorgensen said. It turned out to be an even bigger Christmas gift for police as they also found on the premises the backpack of the second original offender with his ID inside. He was soon located and arrested. A total of 151 bottles of spirits and eight cartons of beer were stolen. The two men arrested remained in custody and were expected to appear in court in relation to the matter. As if 151 bottles of spirits wasn't enough robbers helped themselves to various slabs of beer too .","Police in Darwin found an alleged alcohol thief snoozing at the scene of a massive theft from a restaurant .

"A watchdog found the language and presentation in the Hacked Off advert implied the proposals had been endorsed by Lord Justice Leveson (pictured) An advert by Hacked Off, which is campaigning for tougher regulation of the Press, has been banned on the grounds it is misleading. The ruling by watchdogs will embarrass the lobby group, which has been found guilty of failing to live up to the high standards of fairness and accuracy it demands of the Press. The group hoped the power of celebrity would help it to victory in its cause and crafted an advert designed to win support. It featured the names of more than 200 public figures it said backed its campaign, which appeared under the headline: ‘The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration’. The language and presentation implied the proposals had been endorsed by the judge who led the inquiry into Press standards. In fact, there was no such endorsement from Lord Justice Leveson in the advert, which ran in the Guardian and some other publications. In a ruling today, the Advertising Standards Authority said the language used by Hacked Off was ‘confusing’, ‘ambiguous’ and ‘misleading’. The decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration, who ranged from actor Stephen Fry to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. The ASA said: ‘A national Press ad featured a number of names and the claim “What do all these people have in common? The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration”.’ It went on to state that leading figures were joining people who had suffered abuse at the hands of the media to support the establishment of a new Press regulator as set down in a Royal Charter agreed by MPs in 2013. The Press and this new body would be overseen by a Recognition Panel set up by Royal Charter, which critics argue is the first step towards State regulation of a free Press. The watchdog's decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration, who ranged from actor Stephen Fry (pictured left) to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams (right) The ASA said the group was wrong to use the name The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration without any clear qualification as it would lead the public to believe it was ‘one of the direct outcomes of the Leveson inquiry, rather than a response to it’. Hacked Off said it would appeal and insisted it had only ever used the Leveson name to distinguish its proposals from others that were being put forward. It even suggested the ruling was a political decision to please the Press. A spokesman said: ‘We believe that the advert promoting the Royal Charter was very clear in what it was aiming to achieve and was not misleading.’","Advert by Hacked Off has been banned on the grounds it was misleading .

"Voters now trust David Cameron more than Ed Miliband when it comes to the NHS, a poll shows today. The surprising result comes after Labour has spent months focusing on the Health Service as the centrepiece of its election strategy.

Voters now trust David Cameron (pictured) more than Ed Miliband when it comes to the NHS, a poll shows today . The surprising result comes after Labour spent months focusing on the Health Service as the centrepiece of its election strategy . In September, Ed Miliband said the Health Service was ‘creaking’ under David Cameron and claimed the Government was trying to privatise it. However, despite the rhetoric, a surprising ComRes survey showed that 22 per cent say they trust the PM to manage the NHS, compared with 20 per cent for the Labour leader. The survey also found that although Labour remains the most trusted party to control the NHS, its lead over the Conservatives in this department has fallen to three points – the smallest gap since the polling firm first asked the question in June.

"The number of centenarians receiving birthday cards from the Queen has gone up by 17 per cent in just a year. There are now so many people are now reaching their 100th birthday that the little-known Whitehall office responsible for making sure their milestone is celebrated has had to take on extra staff. Some 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Palace this year, up from 6,360 in 2013. A total of 7,517 people have received a Centenarian card from the Queen this year, up from 6,360 in 2013 . The cards are sent to British citizens on their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday. The Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for checking ages and sending birthday cards from the Queen, has increased the number of employees involved from one to seven in the past five years. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that there are now 13,780 people over the age of 100 in Britain, compared with just 6,860 in 2000. It is now estimated one in three children born today will reach 100. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: 'It is a massive source of celebration that more of us are living longer fuller lives and thousands of centenarians have celebrated their 100th birthday with a very special card. 'Our reforms will ensure the state pension remains strong for future generations and I am proud we are protecting today's pensioners with the Triple Lock meaning the basic State Pension is at the highest percentage of earnings since 1992.' The number of people over the age of 100 has risen dramatically from around 3,000 in 1983 to more than 13,700 last year . The cards from the Queen  are sent to British citizens on their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday . Margaret Wilberforce-Eke, who leads the DWP team in charge of keeping information on centenarians up to date, said: 'Every day we help families mark amazing celebrations. Reaching 100 might be becoming more common, but it is still very special for all those involved. 'It is a privilege to be involved in just a small part of these birthdays – but we hear back that receiving a card is the perfect finishing touch for a great day.' The DWP Centenarian team, based in Newcastle upon Tyne, contacts people approaching their 100th, 105th and every subsequent birthday who are in receipt of State Pension. Those not in receipt of State Benefits can make a direct application to Buckingham Palace to receive a celebration card.

"Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about unfair and extortionate penalty notices. Complaints to the offices of Citizens Advice are up by 41 per cent in a year, while the number of people seeking advice via the charity’s website has tripled to 155,000. The parking cowboys, which operate everywhere from hospitals and railway stations to supermarkets, are aided in a multi-million pound rip-off by a sweetheart deal with the government’s DVLA. Scroll down for video . Complaints: Rogue private parking firms are at the centre of a surge in complaints about penalty notices. This is a file picture of a car park sign, with no suggestion that complaints have been made about this company . The DVLA has pocketed almost £25million in five years by selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to the firms without making sure they are operating within the law. The firms are able to capture the details of vehicles by using number plate recognition cameras of the type used by the police to identify and track criminals. Private parking firms requested driver details from the DVLA 2.5million times in the year ending March 2014, which was up by almost a third from 1.9million in the year before. A Daily Mail campaign turned the spotlight on parking cowboys earlier this year and identified a number of horror stories, particularly involving hospital car parks where firms targeted cancer sufferers and patients whose treatment had over-run. Subsequently, the local government Secretary Eric Pickles announced an investigation and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt introduced new guidelines for hospitals designed to end huge fines for trivial infringements. Complaints to Citizens Advice (CA) included one from a pregnant mother who needed urgent hospital treatment but has hit with a fine that spiralled to £140 when her partner parked up and walked her in to the building. Local government Secretary Eric Pickles (left) announced an investigation and the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) introduced new guidelines for hospitals designed to end huge fines for trivial infringements . A woman in Cambridgeshire was hit by an all-day fine after she dropped her son off at a retail park for his job and then picked him up again at the end of the day. She was fined her for a six-hour stay because the firm’s number cameras failed to pick up that she left in the morning and came back in the afternoon. In Greater Manchester, one man paid and displayed his ticket but the machine would not let him put in the vehicle registration. The firm charged him on this technicality. In theory, civil law states that penalties for parking on private land without permission or for too long should reflect the loss suffered by the owner, however the penalties are often £100, which can be reduced to £50 if people pay up quickly. CA analysed over 700 calls made to its consumer service July and September this year and found the average private parking charge was £83 but some people have been hit by demands for as much as £300. One in six callers complaining about parking penalties on private land were hit with a charge even though they had bought a ticket. Other problems included signs that were too small, too few or hidden away. There were also faults with ticket machines and number plate recognition cameras. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year how  MET Parking, which worked for McDonald’s, was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading . People complained about being targeted with a charge when they only stopped briefly, while many people found it difficult to get through to the company involved to pay the penalty. This makes a bad situation worse because the charge is higher if it is not paid quickly. * you followed the parking rules; . * you parked in the right place; . * you only stayed for the time you paid for; . * you bought a ticket and displayed it correctly; . * the parking company wasn’t responsible for looking after the land you parked on; . * there were no signs about the parking rules or to tell you not to park on the land; . * the signs were unclear or obscured; . * the place you parked in wasn’t clearly marked as being a restricted area; . * you didn’t own the car when the parking ticket was issued; . * your car broke down; . * the payment machines were out of order; . * there were compassionate reasons for not paying, such as illness or bereavement or another emergency; . * the parking charge is for the wrong amount, is too high or you have already paid it; or . * you have been discriminated against under equality law, because you are older, pregnant or have a very young baby and were hindered getting a ticket or abiding by the time limit. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year how at least one major firm, MET Parking, which worked for McDonald’s, was chasing motorists using a debt recovery firm that had been declared ‘unfit’ to operate by the Office of Fair Trading and a firm of solicitors that was shut down last year because of staff ‘dishonesty’. Some 155,260 people got online help around parking on private land from the CA website in the period October 2013-September 2014. That was up from 69,374 the year before. Its offices helped people with 914 problems with parking on private land between July and September 2014 - up from 646 problems in the equivalent period the year before. Industry codes firms are required to give people a ‘reasonable’ grace period for stopping but not parking, but this is not defined. CA is calling on the British Parking Association (BPA), which represents the firms, and the Independent Parking Commission (IPC) to set out a clear grace period for all providers to abide by. CA’s chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: ‘The public is paying for parking firms’ errors. ‘Broken ticket machines, hidden signs, contact numbers that just ring out, and charges that fail to take into account emergency situations are leading to unfair charges. The sharp rise in parking problems reveals an industry that is letting drivers down. ‘Parking charges should be a deterrent but should also reflect the actual loss rather than just the whim of the firm. ‘We’re concerned firms are chasing drivers for fees entirely disproportionate to the length of time that a car overstays.’ She added: ‘Bogus and unfair fines from private parking firms are causing misery for motorists. We want parking companies to help drivers understand their rights. ‘A clear grace period should be agreed and stuck to so this there is consistency for drivers. Firms must also make sure their contact details are readily available and calls made to them don’t go unanswered.’ The BPA did not respond to a request for a comment on the increase in complaints. Previously, it defended its members’ activities, saying: ‘We want to make certain that parking enforcement is undertaken fairly, reasonably and responsibly. The practice of rogue ticketing on private land causes distress to motorists and small businesses alike and should be properly regulated.’ It said an appeals system exists for drivers who feel a penalty notice has been issued unfairly.","Number of people seeking advice via Citizens Advice website has tripled .

"A lucky surfer was spared his life this Christmas season after a deadly great white shark leapt out of the sea right next to him but didn't manage to take a bite. Photographer Tom Kampas filmed the unidentified surfer at El Porto Beach at around 11 a.m. on December 21 but says he didn't even see the shark's acrobatic jump until he watched the footage at home. Surfer AND shark: A shark popped out of the ocean just feet behind a surfer in California earlier this month . In the video, a shark can be seen leaping from a wave behind a surfer who is unaware of the animal’s presence. 'All of a sudden that great white came up from out of the water behind the surfer like a Polaris missile,' said Kampas. 'It all happened so quickly and I don’t think that guy was even aware of it.' Kampas shared the impressive video with the Shark Research Institute who said that the shark is just a baby but that it is indeed a great white shark. KTLA reports that there have been several shark siting off South Bay beaches but that few of them were as exciting as the footage captured by Kampas. According to National Geographic, of the 100-plus annual shark attacks worldwide, one-third to one-half is attributed to the great white sharks. 'They are streamlined, torpedo-shaped swimmers with powerful tails that can propel them through the water at speeds of up to 15 miles (24 kilometres) per hour. They can even leave the water completely, breaching like whales when attacking prey from underneath,' says National Geographic. The baby great white certainly displayed its masterful swimming skills earlier this month. There it is!: Can you spot the great white shark leaping out of the ocean like a torpedo?","A lucky surfer was spared his life this Christmas season after a deadly great white shark leapt out of the sea right next to him .

"Lenny Henry received mixed reviews when he guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today Programme . Lenny Henry's guest editing of the BBC's flagship daily radio news programme received a mix reaction. The actor and comedian took over Tuesday's edition of Radio 4's Today Programme to discuss ethnic diversity in the media. For the show the presenting team was made up entirely of people from ethnic minority backgrounds. It also featured interviews with MP Diane Abbott, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, and MEP Amjad Bashir. While some people supported the programme calling it 'refreshing' others criticised it for not being diverse enough. Broadcaster Jeremy Vine was quick to come out in support of the show calling it 'thought-provoking.' Bethany Skinnard tweeted: 'Really enjoyed your guest edit@LennyHenry on @BBCRadio4 #todayshow really refreshing perspective and let's not forget # devilsavocado' However, others described the decision to exclude white presenters as 'positive race discrimination' and described Henry as a 'hypocrite.' Scroll down for video . Steve Speck tweeted: 'R4 Today Prog - prime example of positive race discrimination. Lenny Henry insisted all presenters from ethnic minorities. #bbcr4today' The presenting line-up for the Today Programme guest edited by Lenny Henry, included Nkem Ifejika and Mishal Husain . During the show Henry revealed that he had been the victim of racism his 'whole life.' He said that included during the programme and  after he made earlier in the year to BAFTA about the lack of black and ethnic minority people on screen. 'I'm very aware there's still a way to go,' he said. 'But what's great is there's a tolerance in this country that is extraordinary and to be proud of and I'm proud to be British and my mum was proud to be British too.'","Comedian Lenny Henry guest edited BBC Radio 4's Today programme .

"Deafening footage has emerged of the deadly  tornado which ripped through Mississippi last week leaving at least four people dead. William Bozeman was working at Bumper to Bumper, an auto repair business in the city of Columbia, when winds up to 165mph hit on December 23. He quickly whipped his cell phone to capture the storm and luckily survived the experience. The heart-pounding 54-second clip starts with the sky plunged into a foggy darkness. High-speed gusts can be heard sweeping through the area. Far from being terrified, Bozeman screams in exhilaration. As the sky brightens, it becomes clear the he is cowering behind some machinery in a bid to weather the storm. Pieces of debris fly past the lens and rain appears to pelt down.

However, once the weather had died down he was able to retrieve it from the rubble. Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant  issued a state of emergency when the natural disaster struck, hastening the availability of  resources needed for storm relief. His office said the vortexes knocked out power to more than 7,000 customers. The twisters were spawned by thunderstorms that originated over south-central Louisiana, then tracked northeast before barreling through southeastern Mississippi. Corey Mead, a meteorologist for the national Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said the intensity of storms diminished after they passed through Mississippi. Relief efforts are expected to continue well into the New Year. Map of the US state of Mississippi locating the two counties hit by a deadly tornado .

"Missing: Arthur Neal Jr, 86, was last seen at his home on Trinity street in Detroit, Michigan, on December 20 . The family of an elderly man who disappeared in the middle of the night just days after he won $20,000 on the lottery say they fear for his life. Arthur Neal Jr, 86, was last seen at his home on Trinity street in Detroit, Michigan, on December 20. He was driving a black, 1998, Cadillac Deville, with a Michigan plate of BMZ -7786. The African American grandfather is 5ft 7 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds with a medium complexion, gray hair, and a full beard and mustache. Neal's worried granddaughter, Lawanda Marshall, said they had become concerned after he failed to show up for Christmas, as he would not have missed Christmas with his family. According to his relatives, Neal  had recently won  $20,000 in a lottery game, but had no plans to leave town. Marshall said that the information about his lottery win was widely publicized and his family think this could be the reason he has vanished into thin air. Marshall said: 'It bothers me greatly because I don't think that's the type of information that should have seeped out – if that was the case – especially that neighborhood in which he was staying and reside.' Neal's family said they went to his house to check on him and found his home in disarray and a door left ajar which raised their suspicions  further. Vehicle: Neal was last seen driving a black, 1998, Cadillac Deville, similar to this white model, with a Michigan plate of BMZ -7786 . His family said that he still does masonry work despite his age. They are appealing to anyone with information to report it to police.

"Tropical forests are growing faster than scientists thought due to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A Nasa-led study has found that tropical forests are absorbing 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year as they photosynthesise and grow. And this is far more than is absorbed by the vast areas of boreal forest that encircle the Arctic. Trees and plants in tropical forests (stock image) are absorbing 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. The researchers claim their findings show that rainforests are essential for soaking up excess greenhouse gases, and play a far greater role than had been previously realised . The researchers claim their findings show that rainforests like the Amazon are essential for soaking up excess greenhouse gases, and play a far greater role than had been previously realised. Dr David Schimel, a researcher at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, who led the study, said: 'This is good news, because uptake in boreal forests is already slowing, while tropical forests may continue to take up carbon for many years.' Deforestation in the world's biggest rainforest, the Amazon, dropped by 18 per cent over the past year. Brazil said that 4,848 square kilometers (1,870 square miles) of rain forest were destroyed between August 2013 and July 2014 - an area slightly larger than the US state of Rhode Island. The figures were down from 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 square miles) cut down during the same period a year earlier. It comes in the wake of the adoption of a controversial bill revising the Forest Code, which was 2012 after more than a decade-long effort by Brazil's powerful agricultural lobby, mostly eased restrictions for landowners with smaller properties, allowing them to clear land closer to riverbanks. Rain forest clearing is responsible for about 75 percent of Brazil's emissions, as vegetation is burned and felled trees rot. The Amazon extends over 6.1 million square kilometers (3.8 million square miles), with more than 60 percent within Brazil's borders. However, Dr Schimel and his colleagues warn that deforestation in tropical rainforests could exacerbate climate change by leaving more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In total, they estimate that forests and other vegetation absorb around 2.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 30 per cent of that emitted by humans. As emissions add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, forests worldwide are using it to grow faster. However, the rate at which they absorb this has been hard to estimate with many studies producing contradictory results. As many rainforests consist of mature trees that are often hundreds of years old, they were not thought to absorb much carbon dioxide. Young fast growing trees tend to absorb more carbon dioxide as they use the carbon as they grow. Global air flows and data on deforestation also suggested tropical forests were releasing more carbon dioxide than they absorb. But this new study suggests the tropical forests are using far more of the carbon, and so growing far faster than previously believed. Dr Schimel and his colleagues, whose work is published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, used computer models, satellite images, data from forest plots and photosynthetic experiments to build up a picture of how forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation and burning releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and were thought to cause tropical forests to release more carbon dioxide than they absorbed. But the new study suggests this is not the case . Nasa satellites monitor changes in rainforests like the Amazon (pictured from above) to estimate carbon dioxide uptake. In total, experts estimate that forests and other vegetation absorb around 2.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, about 30 per cent of that emitted by humans . He said: 'What we've had up till this paper was a theory of carbon dioxide fertilisation based on phenomena at the microscopic scale and observations at the global scale that appeared to contradict those phenomena. 'Here, at least, is a hypothesis that provides a consistent explanation that includes both how we know photosynthesis works and what's happening at the planetary scale. 'All else being equal, the effect is stronger at higher temperatures, meaning it will be higher in the tropics than in the boreal forests.' However, he added that changes in water supply to forests due to changing climate and deforestation could alter the amount of carbon dioxide tropical forests are absorbing. He said: 'The future tropical balance of deforestation and climate sources and regrowth and carbon dioxide sinks will only remain a robust feature of the global carbon cycle if the vast tropical forests are protected from destruction.' Scientists believed that rainforests were poor at absorbing carbon dioxide despite their rich plant life, but the new study shows that they, in fact, account for more than half of all greenhouse gases absorbed by vegetation .","Nasa study shows tropical forests absorb 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 a year .

"Planning on giving up smoking, losing weight or spending less money in 2015? Then get more sleep. A study has shown that our failure to stick to New Year's resolutions each year is simply down to tiredness. Researchers found that those who got less than seven hours of sleep each night were far more likely to have weak willpower. Scroll down for video . Getting a good night's sleep might be as useful as forcing yourself to the gym in the morning, according to research by psychologists at the University of Hertfordshire who found it can help improve willpower . Professor Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire, claims that tiredness erodes self-control. There have been a number of studies that have looked at the role that sleep can have on people's ability to focus and concentrate. A group at the University of North Carolina found that nurses who slept less than seven hours of sleep tended to be less professional the next day, intentionally working slowly and engaging in discussions about confidential information. Another study from Pamplin College of Business at Virginia Tech found that students who went to bed later through the course of a week tended to cheat more in a trivia quiz. Employees who slept badly the night before are also more likely to surf the internet for fun while they are at work, according to a third study from Singapore Management University. It is thought that sleep-related fatigue costs businesses more than $150 billion (£96 billion) a year in lost productivity. His findings suggest that using complicated techniques to stick to diets and getting up early to the gym may actually not be helping . Instead, Professor Wiseman recommends going to bed earlier and trying to go to the gym in the evening rather than first thing in the morning. He said: '[The brain requires energy] to do something we don't really want to do or find difficult to do. 'If you are sleep deprived, then you don't have the mental energy needed. 'In fact some of the things that people do for their resolutions, like getting up early to go to the gym, leave them more sleep deprived. 'This is why over time they find it harder and harder to keep going.' In previous research from 2010 Professor Wiseman has found that 80 per cent of people in Briton let their resolutions slip before the end of January. In the latest study, he asked more than 1,000 people to rate both the quality of their sleep and how successful they were at achieving their New Year's resolutions in an online survey. More than 60 per cent of those who said they were getting enough sleep - usually regarded to be more than eight hours - were able to achieve their resolutions. Getting up early to go to the gym becomes harder over time as people lose sleep in favour of getting exercise . Unhealthy foods like chocolate and alcohol are the most common things people try to give up each year . This compared with just 44 per cent of those who slept poorly who managed to stick to their resolutions. Experiments by other groups have shown that in the workplace people who are sleep deprived tend to cut corners more or waste more time browsing the internet when they should be working. Researchers have also shown that sleep deprivation can lead people to make poorer diet choices, often picking foods high in fat and sugar. Insomnia can impact both of physical health, the immune system and on mental learning, but the latest findings also suggest it can damage willpower, making it harder to achieve good intentions . Professor Wiseman added: 'At the moment people will planning what they are going to try to achieve this year and how. 'What we have found suggests that they are actually putting in more effort than they need to. 'If they went to bed a bit earlier then it would make it easier to achive their resolutions.' Around 80 per cent of Britons fail to stick to their New Year's resolutions like losing weight beyond January .","An early night is the best way to stick to resolutions, say psychologists .

"As six bodies were removed from the Java Sea following the crash of AirAsia flight 8501, the first details of those who died on board the doomed aircraft have started to emerge. The Airbus 320 had 162 people on board - 138 adult passengers, 16 children, one baby and seven crew members - when it came down off the coast of Borneo Island on Sunday en route to Singapore from Indonesia. The victims include an engaged couple heading off on a short break, a British businessman travelling with his two-year-old daughter, Christian missionaries en route to renew their visas, a young female university lecturer, and a family travelling to visit their daughter at boarding school. Scroll down for video . Family members of victims of the doomed Air Asia flight are comforted at Juanda International Airport in Indonesia, where a crisis centre has been set up . Most of the victims on board the plane were Indonesian nationals, although there were also three South Koreans, a Malaysian, a French co-pilot, a Briton and a Singaporean . Earlier today bodies were discovered alongside luggage, a plane door and an emergency slide in the water 100 miles off Indonesia, three days after the AirAsia plane vanished from radar screens within minutes of its pilot asking permission to climb 6,000 feet to avoid bad weather. The vast majority of flight 8501's victims were Indonesian nationals - although three South Koreans, one Malaysian, a French co-pilot, one Briton and one Singaporean were also on board. British businessman Chi Man Choi, who was flying to Singapore with his two-year-old daughter Zoe to celebrate New Year with his wife . Despite many of the 162 people coming from the same country, details have emerged of diverse backgrounds, with the only thing uniting many of those of board being the fact they held a boarding pass for the doomed airliner on its scheduled journey from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore. Among the victims were Ruth Natalia Puspitasari, her new toy-maker fiance Bob Hartanto Wijaya, and his parents Marilyn and William. Miss Puspitasari's father Suyanto told how his daughter - who would have turned 26 on holiday next Monday - had called him in excitement to explain her birthday plans shortly before boarding. He also revealed that the economics graduate had previously exhibited deep concern over missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, telling him of her sympathy for the agonized families of victims who have been left without information on their loved ones. Meanwhile British businesman Chi-Man Choi, who is originally from Hull, Yorkshire, was flying from Indonesia to Singapore with his two-year-old daughter, Zoe, to celebrate New Year with his Singaporean wife and his family. Also on board the doomed flight was Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, who is believed to have been a commerce student at Melbourne's Monsah University. He was travelling with Cindy Clarissa Soetjipto, who was sitting next to him and is listed as his sister on Facebook. The pair were seated with a relative named Rudy Soetjipto, according to the flight manifest. Meanwhile family of four, Hermanto Tanus, his partner Indahju Liangsih and their two sons Nico and Justin, were on their wat to visit student Chiara Natasya Tanus. Kevin Alexander Soetjipto, who was also on the flight and is believed to have been a commerce student at a university in Melbourne . The 15-year-old, who had moved to Singapore to attend school had been eagerly awaiting a visit from her parents and brother since moving two months ago. Meanwhile the three South Koreans on board are believed to be Park Seong Beom, his wife, Lee Kyung Hwa, and their 11-month-old daughter Park Yu Na. The Christian missionaries were on their way to Singapore to renew their visas so they could stay for another year in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Hermanto Tanus, his partner Indahju Liangsih and their sons Nico Giovanni, 17, and nine-year-old Justin Giovanni were also on board the flight. In Singapore, student Chiara Natasya Tanus, 15, had been waiting eagerly for a visit from her parents and brothers. Captain Irianto, left, and pictured with his daughter Angela Ranastianis, who posted on social media: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you' She had not seen her family, who are from Surabaya, since she left for Singapore to pursue her secondary education two months ago. Elsewhere Louise Sidharta had been at Singapore's Chani Airport waiting for her fiance Siau Alain Octavianus to arrive off the flight. The couple were reportedly planning to get married next year. As well as the passengers, there were also seven crew on board the jet, including the pilot Captain Iriyanto. His picture was posted on social media by his 22-year-old daughter Angela Ranastianis with the heartbreaking message: 'Papa, please come home, I still need you. Bring back my papa.'

"Rapped: Aldi's 'Swap & Save' advertising campaign has been banned for a second time after the advertising watchdog ruled it was misleading . Aldi has been rapped by the advertising watchdog for a second time after Tesco complained that the discount retailer's 'Swap & Save' price comparisons were flawed. In TV and press adverts for the campaign shoppers spoke about swapping from their usual supermarket to Aldi, with one saying: 'We've saved so much on our weekly shop.' After an investigation, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) agreed Aldi offered savings, but it banned the adverts after ruling they exaggerated how many people had taken part in the challenge. The decision came after Tesco complained that the comparison was misleading because it believed the eight-week comparison period was out of date and invalid for a price sensitive market. Britain's biggest grocery chain also said weekly shops were not compared on a like-for-like basis, the selection of items to include or exclude was arbitrary and explanatory information in the adverts was not prominent enough. It noted the adverts stated 84 out of 98 people saved, and that the challenge was based on four weeks' shopping at a competitor and then four weeks shopping at Aldi, but it understood that only four of the 98 individuals had undertaken the eight-week challenge and the remaining 94 had undertaken the challenge over two weeks. Aldi said Swap & Save differed from traditional comparative advertising as it looked at overall shopping costs at a single store over an extended time rather than the prices of individual products or a standardised basket. It said comparing individual products would therefore have been artificial because consumers did not buy the same items every week. It said the campaign fully compared the actual overall weekly shop of individuals over a lengthy period and was fair, transparent and verifiable. The ASA said it was acceptable for Aldi to run a price comparison campaign based on consumers shopping normally with a competitor for four weeks and then with itself for the same time. But it believed consumers would assume that 98 people had participated in the eight-week challenge, when in fact only four people had. It also found inconsistencies in how items had been included or excluded, with some non-grocery or high-ticket items such as dishwasher salt, truffles and Christmas pudding excluded from one shop and included in another. Complaint: The decision came after Tesco complained that comparisons were misleading because it believed the eight-week comparison period was out of date and invalid for a price sensitive market . The ASA did its own calculations, taking into account items it believed should have been included and excluded, and allowing for inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Aldi's interpretation of the data. The watchdog said they still showed savings in the original shops ranged from 22 per cent to 33 per cent. Moreover savings for a shorter 'revalidation' trial ranged between 25 per cent and 38 per cent. It concluded: 'We considered those amounts represented significant savings at the time of both the original shops and the revalidation shop, and therefore that the overall message of the Swap & Save campaign, that consumers could save money by shopping at Aldi, was not misleading to consumers. 'Nonetheless, because we considered the way in which the comparison was presented in the ads implied more people had participated in the eight-week challenge than was the case, we concluded the ads were in breach of the Codes.' The adverts must not appear again in their current form, it ruled. 'We told Aldi Stores Ltd to ensure that in future the basis for comparisons was made clear and did not mislead, and that their comparisons were verifiable,' the ASA said. Aldi's joint managing director of corporate buying, Giles Hurley, said: 'It is important to be clear that the ASA has endorsed the validity of the Swap & Save campaign. 'We recognise that the decision to uphold competitor representations was technical in its nature and, because of this, we will respect the finding and have addressed the issues that it raised.' Earlier this year, the ASA banned a TV advert for Swap & Save following a complaint from Asda, warning Aldi to make the basis of its comparisons clear in future.","But advertising watchdog rules shopping at the discounter is still cheaper .
Ads' 'implied' 84 people had saved over an eight-week challenge, says ASA .
In reality just four people took part in the full challenge ."

"A mother-of-six with a Paddington Bear collection worth £10,000 has gone into overdrive since the release of the recent Hollywood film about the lovable animal. Emma Bending's house is filled to the brim with  teddies, books and prints that are all fuelled by her love for the small Peruvian bear character. The 44-year-old from Bugbrooke, Northampton, was so desperate to see the new movie that she booked herself into the first showing at her local cinema when she couldn't get tickets for the premiere on eBay. Emma Bending, 44, fell in love with Paddington Bear as a child and now has a collection worth £10,000 . The super-fan's extensive collection has taken 12 years to build and includes 400 items of memorabilia . Emma, who works as a school attendance officer, said: 'Paddington is so naughty and mischievous but also so polite and British at the same time. 'He's the perfect character and I'd like to think I'm one of his biggest fans.' Emma's obsession with the bear started aged four after her grandparents gave her one of the first books. She collected teddies, books and even had a Paddington-themed bedroom. The mother-of-six's home in Bugbrooke, Northampton, plays host to more than 30 stuffed bears . Fans from all over the world contact Emma for information and advice on building their own collections . Unlike most children whose early toys are given away or lost, it wasn't until her early teens that Emma's Paddington Bear was carefully stowed away in her parents' loft. When she was watching a repeat of the Paddington TV series with her children in 2002, she remembered her childhood toys and dug them out. Now she and her six children are some of Paddington's biggest fans. Emma has spent the last 12 years building up a bumper collection and their home in Bugbrooke, Northampton, plays host to more than 30 stuffed bears. Book shelves stocked with five first editions worth up to £3,000 cover her walls and her favourite piece is a simple sketch of the beloved children's character by the original illustrator Peggy Fortnum. Altogether, she has got more than 400 items of memorabilia, including a life-size stand-up bear that was originally part of a Harrods shop display and cost £400. When watching the Paddington TV series with her children in 2002, Emma   dug out her childhood toys . Emma spends much of her spare time repairing old Paddington Bear toys that have seen the wear of time and has darned fur, sewed up holes in coats and glued boots to bring bears back to life. Author Michael Bond has signed books and luggage labels for her and Emma is hoping friends and family will club together to buy her one of the Paddington sculptures currently dotted all over London. Friends and colleagues have also caught the bug and Emma regularly sources themed toys and books for friends as gifts. Her knowledge is now so vast that fans from all over the world contact her for information and advice on building their own collections.

She said: 'The new film is fantastic - it has something for everyone, which is what makes Paddington so great. 'I was just four when I first fell in love with Paddington, with his little blue hat, red coat and suitcase. 'My grandparents gave me a book called Great Big Paddington Bear for my fourth birthday. 'I loved reading about the mayhem Paddington caused for the Brown family when he arrived in the UK from Peru.' Emma owns five first editions worth up to £3,000  and  an original sketch  by  illustrator Peggy Fortnum . Husband Michael asked Emma to  sell some pieces when the collection started taking over the house . 'When I was six I begged my mum and dad for a real Paddington Bear and on Christmas day he was there under the tree. 'Over the following years, my bedroom turned into a Paddington shrine. 'My Dad put up Paddington wallpaper, curtains, and a lampshade. I even had Paddington bedspreads. 'It was only when I fell in love with George Michael that my love for Paddington waned and I put away the toys. 'Then once my husband Michael and I had six little ones, our house was full to the brim with toys. 'One day a repeat of the Paddington programme came on television and I said ""I've got one of those?"" 'I then dug through the boxes in the loft until I had found my original bear. 'As soon as I showed him to the kids they all wanted one and that's how my passion for Paddington came back to life. 'Now I don't know how I ever put him in the loft and he's as big a part of my life as he ever was.'","Emma Bending's Northampton house is filled with Paddington memorabilia .

"A rare white tiger has died after it was bitten by a highly venomous black cobra, which hid inside its cage in an Indian zoo. Keepers at the Kamala Nehru zoo in Indore, Hyderabad, went to check on two-year-old tiger Rajan in his enclosure on Saturday morning. The tiger had been brought to the zoo just a month ago as part of a breeding programme for the rare animals. Scroll down for video . Rare white tiger Rajan, who was discovered unconscious in its cage at Kamala Nehru zoo in India after being bitten by a venomous cobra . But when zookeepers opened the door, they found the tiger unconscious, and bleeding from the nose and foaming at the mouth. Vets were called but they were unable to save the big cat, who was declared dead, with a post mortem examination revealing a poisonous snake bite as a cause of death. Now zoo officials believe that the cobra somehow found its way into the tiger's enclosure and the two animals began to fight. The snake then bit the tiger unleashing its venom, which killed the rare animal. Vets battled to save the two-year-old big cat, pictured, who had only been at the zoo for just over a month, but he unfortunately died . However, the cobra was also injured in the clash and has been left paralysed with animal experts battling to save it. Uttam Yadav, the zoo's director, told the Hindustan Times: 'It appears that the tiger had a fight with the snake and died after the snake bit the big cat. 'We found an injured cobra inside of the tiger's cage. When we checked on the tiger it was unconscious. I assume the tiger and cobra had a fight in which the cobra would have bitten and killed the tiger.' Now the zoo are putting measures in place to make sure snakes are unable to enter the tiger enclosure. Dr Yadav added: 'As part of precautionary measures, the authority will put thin wire mesh across all the cages, build trenches and put board at some part of cages to block the entry of crawling animals inside the cages.' The black cobra, which had fought with the tiger and unleashed its venomous bite, which ultimately killed the big cat . The Indore zoo now only have three white tigresses called Diya, Shivani and Sita. The park has more than 65 cages and as many as 452 different animals and is one of the most visited attractions in in Hyderabad. The tiger's death comes after a man was killed by a white tiger after allegedly jumping into its moat at another Indian zoo. The man, named locally as Maqsood, is said to have been under the influence of alcohol when he climbed into the white tiger enclosure at New Delhi Zoo in September. Witnesses say the 22-year-old entered the enclosure despite several attempts by zoo security to keep him from the tigers.","The rare white tiger called Rajan was found unconscious in its enclosure .

"Supermarket chain Aldi has launched a brand new budget yoga range just in time for the New Year, including a mat and foam roller for just £6.99 each. The store claims its new range enables people to experience 'yogic calm' on a budget by snapping up mats, foam rollers and yoga-style clothing at just a fraction of the price they are usually sold at. The launch comes just a month after the budget chain introduced a skiwear range, which boasted of being able to kit out a family of four for just £160. Aldi's new yoga range (pictured) features a mat, foam roller and clothing at  prices a fraction of  sport retailers . From Friday, Aldi's yoga range will be available in all stores and there will also be a series of 'yoga and pilates accessory sets', each costing only £4.99, in a bid to tempt in new shoppers. The main items from the range, a yoga mat and foam roller, cost just £6.99 each – a bargain compared to prices up to £70 at some dedicated sports retailers. Aldi is also selling a ladies' yoga jacket for £11.99 and capri pants for £6.99 as part of its 'Specialbuys' offering. The firm's managing director of buying Tony Baines said: 'It is no secret that our shopper demographic has evolved. Aldi is also selling a ladies' yoga jacket for £11.99 and capri pants for £6.99 as part of its 'Specialbuys' offer . 'The past few years have seen a significant shift in perceptions of Aldi customers who are increasingly being attracted to our top quality, great value philosophy. 'Our yoga range is an extension of this - it gives our shoppers the chance to try a new sport this January without spending a fortune.' It follows the budget supermarket chain's entry into the skiwear market. The store claimed the bargain-priced range meant a whole family could be kitted out for a ski trip for just £160. The Ski Pro range features £35 jackets, £30 trousers and a host of accessories with technical gloves priced at just £4.99 and goggles from £7.99. Aldi has become increasingly popular with families over recent years, launching ranges which rival upmarket products at low-cost prices. Earlier this month, a £4.29 Irish Cream Liqueur from the supermarket scooped the top award at an internationally renowned drinks competition, alongside products more than triple its price . The Ballycastle Irish Cream was described by judges as 'everything you'd expect from a cream liqueur – thick, creamy and luscious' at the  prestigious Spirits Business Liqueur Masters 2014 awards. The supermarket also scooped the 'Consistency in Excellence' trophy; a one-off accolade giving special recognition to Aldi's high quality spirits. Last month, the supermarket put a bottle of the 'six-rated' white, Hungarian Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 6 Puttonyos 2008 wine on shelves for just £18.99. Ordinarily, a 1993 bottle would be likely to set shoppers back about £185 - and similar quality 2008 dessert wines are sold at an eye-watering £76.

"Whether it’s his real name or not, only a man called Joe Gross could possibly upload this video. Definitely not for the squeamish, it shows Mr ‘Gross’ removing what is quite possibly the world’s longest ingrown hair. The video begins with ‘Gross’ claiming, maybe not for the first time, that this is the grossest thing he’s ever done. Joe Gross lines up the clump of ingrown hair on his neck with his tweezers . After clamping the tweezers around the clump of hair he gives it a good tug . ‘I’ve had this giant black mark on my face for months and it literally looks like a pound of hair,’ he said. Then, using a pair of pink tweezers to make the whole procedure a little more stylish, he starts pulling the clump of black hair from his cheek. What goes on from here is pretty hard to stomach as Gross goes on to live up to his name and gets to work on removing the hair. There must be a lot of horror fans out there in cyberspace as the video has gone viral. During the disgusting drama Gross describes how he had a pimple which would ooze every couple of months for about a year. The hair comes out slowly in long strands that seem to take ages to come out . He finally pulls the last piece of hair out using the tweezers leaving only a hole and specks of blood . A dermatologist made it clear to him that it was a cyst that would need to cut out, but as the hair just kept on being pulled out it ended up being just ‘the longest ingrown hair in history.’ Equally revolting was the moment a Canadian man last month squeezed a spot on the back of his neck for the first time in 20 years, and a torrent of white pus that had been blocked under the skin for two decades was released.

"A mattress ended up looking like a giant slice of pizza after it caught on fire when a couple tried to use a hand warmer to heat up their bed. The man and woman - who also had their son at home - tried to deal with the blaze after the bedding at the property in Pimlico, central London, caught fire in the early hours of this morning. The couple attempted to extinguish the blaze themselves at the house, which had no smoke alarm, but firefighters were called at 3.25am - and arrived as the three of them were leaving the block. Destroyed: The man and woman - who also had their son at home - tried to deal with the blaze after the bedding at the property in Pimlico, central London, caught fire in the early hours of this morning . Expensive area: Firefighters from Chelsea and Lambeth fire stations attended the blaze on Gloucester Street (above, file picture), a road with an average property value of £1million . Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus led them to safety - before they were all treated for smoke inhalation at the scene by London Ambulance Service crews. The fire was under control by 4.20am. Hot stuff: File picture of a charcoal hand warmer . Charcoal hand warmers provide heat for users by burning charcoal in a box, and can last up to six hours. The box has an inside layer of non-flammable material that will evenly spread the heat. They are started by lighting a charcoal stick before quickly extinguishing it and placing it inside the box. They are often used by skiers and walkers, or workers in cold locations. Owen Neale, London Fire Brigade fire investigator, said: ‘No smoke alarm, trying to fight the fire themselves and using a charcoal hand warmer next to bedding. ‘So it’s fair to say that the residents were lucky to escape without serious injury. 'It’s important that people don’t use items like hand warmers to heat their beds as the bedding can catch fire and put those sleeping at risk. ‘It’s also vital that everyone has at least one smoke alarm on every level of their home. 'Make sure it’s your New Year resolution to check your smoke alarms work.’ All other residents in the block were told it was safer to stay in their flats than walk into the smoke-filled corridor. Firefighters from Chelsea and Lambeth stations attended the blaze on Gloucester Street, a road with an average property value of £1million. The LFB has launched a campaign called Know the Plan, designed to improve awareness of fire safety for the residents of high rise buildings and purpose built blocks. It also aims to encourage landlords and housing providers to act on their fire safety responsibilities.","Couple tried to deal with blaze after bedding caught fire this morning .

Tiger spokesperson Simon Murphy told Daily Mail Australia that this ‘is not an emergency and bird strikes are a fairly regular occurrence with all airlines.’ It is Tiger Airways procedure that the flight must immediately land and undergo assessment from an engineer following a bird strike. Flight TT585 was forced to divert to Brisbane Airport after a ‘bird strike’ for the safety of the passengers . The flight left Cairns at 10am and was due to arrive in Melbourne at 2pm . 'No issue was reported by the captain but when the plane lands it will be assessed by an engineer before the flight continues on to Melbourne this afternoon.' The flight left Cairns at 10am and was due to arrive in Melbourne at 2pm. The plane was delayed for around three hours, leaving at 2.05pm local time. They are scheduled to land at 5.25pm, 'in plenty of time for New Year's Eve.' 'These things happen but safety is always the priority.' In August this year, a Tiger Airways flight from Singapore to Trichy was forced to land when the Airbus A320 was hit by a bird; damaging the windscreen and creating a pressure imbalance during the landing. In 2010 a Tiger Airways flight from Brisbane to Rockhampton returned to Brisbane after it was struck by a bird. Passengers were forced to wait eight hours at the airport until the flight could take off again.

"The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) have banned this picture of a skinny model from being used on the Urban Outfitters website as it is  ‘irresponsible and harmful’ A picture of a skinny model on a fashion chain’s website has been outlawed as ‘irresponsible and harmful’. The clothing company Urban Outfitters has been ordered to remove the photo amid claims it could fuel anorexia. The ban has been imposed by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which was particularly concerned about the model’s ‘thigh gap’. The image, which shows only the lower half of a young woman’s body, is part of an advertisement on the US firm’s British website for a pair of polka dot mesh briefs priced at £6. The ASA received a complaint from an unnamed source and ruled in their favour. In its judgment it said: ‘The complainant, who believed that the model in the picture was unhealthily thin, challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and harmful.’ The watchdog has told the firm it has until today to remove the picture and ensure its adverts are produced responsibly in future. However, it was still being used on the website yesterday, alongside many others which are very similar. It is under no obligation to take down the additional images because they are not the subject of the complaint. In its ruling, published today, the ASA said: ‘We considered that the model was very thin, and noted, in particular, that there was a significant gap between the model’s thighs, and that her thighs and knees were a similar width. ‘We understood that Urban Outfitters’ target market was young people and considered that using a noticeably underweight model was likely to impress upon that audience that the image was representative of the people who might wear Urban Outfitters’ clothing, and as being something to aspire to. We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible.’ The firm denied the claims, saying: ‘The model was represented by one of the UK’s most successful and well-respected agencies. We do not believe she was underweight.’ It added the model had a healthy waist measurement of 23.5inches, was naturally tall and slim and had worked for a number of other fashion brands. The ASA warned it could ban the company’s adverts from internet search websites if it fails to abide by the ruling. Minister for Women and Equalities Jo Swinson, who has campaigned on the issue of body confidence, welcomed the ASA ruling. She said: ‘Retailers will benefit from having a diverse range of models and mannequins which is not only a positive way of challenging low body confidence but makes good business sense too. 'Given the worrying rates of eating disorders especially among young people, I applaud the Advertising Standards Authority for encouraging positive body image, and for taking steps to ensure that retailers comply with this. I hope that Urban Outfitters remove these images, and that other retailers take note of these unacceptable images.' The advertisement was on the US firm's British website for a pair of polka dot mesh briefs priced at £6 . Urban Outfitters, who also have stores across the UK (pictured), said they do not believe the model used in the website image was under weight . The Advertising Standards Authority has been banned from claiming the cereal contains 'honey goodness' The Honey Monster has been slapped down by advertising watchdogs for suggesting honey is good for children. The cereal that the character promotes, Sugar Puffs, has been banned from claiming it contains ‘honey goodness’ – as honey is just as bad for the body as sugar. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the boast amounts to a bogus health claim. Sales of honey are soaring, apparently because of the belief that as a natural product it is better for you. But health experts point out that once honey is consumed it behaves the same way in the body as sugar. The advert on the cereal’s website carried the claims: ‘Yummy Honey Goodness For A Monsterfied Breakfast... 20% More Honey’. This idea that the cereal – which contains 8.6 grams of sugar per 30g serving – was full of goodness was backed up by claims that it was low in fat and salt and a good source of fibre, vitamins and iron. The firm insists the website was simply trying to convey that they had increased the amount of honey and reduced the use of sugar. However, it has since removed use of the word ‘goodness’.","Urban Outfitters has been ordered to remove the image from its website .

"Trying out his metal detector he'd been given for Christmas, Gary Underwood discovered a World War Two shell – which helped him prove an old family story. He found the device buried in a bank at the foot of his Kent garden. Mr Underwood was testing a story told by his grandfather Bill, who said he had uncovered it in the garden while digging in 1973 – but then threw it into the mud bank. 'The story has always fascinated me so I thought I'd have a quick go with the detector,' said Mr Underwood, 27, who lives in Sittingbourne with his parents. Gary Underwood pictured with two bomb disposal experts after discovering a shell in his parents' back garden in Kent . 'The next thing 'beep, beep, beep'. I dug down about three inches and found it.' Gary assumed the bomb had been discarded but thought he would test out his new equipment just in case. And he was stunned when his metal detector began to beep and he found the battered shell under a three inch layer of mud. Gary, who lives with his parents, said: 'My grandad told me how he was digging his garden over with a fork in about 1973 when he found the shell. 'He picked it up and looked at it and threw it up the bank at the bottom of the garden. Mr Underwood found the shell, right, using a metal detector he had been given as a Christmas gift . 'I picked it up and put it down on the garden bench before telling my mum and dad what I'd found. They thought I was joking to start with. 'It was then we said perhaps we should let someone know so I called 101 but was told to dial 999. I started to worry a bit then.' Three police officers were sent to the scene. On arrival they took a picture of the device before sending it to the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. Gary added: 'They told us to go inside, not to touch it and wait for further information. 'They then sent another message saying they may have to evacuate my street and Gaze Hill, which is behind it. At that point I was thinking 'I'm not going to be very popular'. After calling the police, officers alerted ordnance experts who took the shell away to dispose of it . 'Forty minutes later they turned up in a big green lorry so all the curtains were twitching. 'They came in had a quick look at it and took it away to dispose of it, which was a relief. 'I was a bit gutted because grandad found it and had told me about it since I was a kid, but I understand why they took it.' Gary was bought the metal detector by mum Sharon, 54, dad Alan, 53 and his partner Sophie, 27. Police alerted ordnance experts who took the shell away to dispose of it.","Gary Underwood from Kent was given a metal detector for Christmas .

"Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh has had a one-game suspension rescinded, making him eligible for Sunday's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys. Appeals officer Ted Cottrell reduced the discipline to a $70,000 fine, the NFL announced on Tuesday, after Suh could be seen stepping on the left leg of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers during the fourth quarter of Sunday's regular season finale. This as the wife of Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford called out the league for suspending Suh, pointing out that a member of the Green Bay Packers stepped on her husband during the game and there was no punishment. Scroll down for videos . Getting off: Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh has had a one-game suspension rescinded, making him eligible for Sunday's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys . Speaking out: The wife of Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford called out the league for suspending Suh, pointing out that a member of the Green Bay Packers stepped on her husband during the game . Cut up: A photo of Stafford seems to confirm he may have been stepped on . Kelly Hall took to Instagram on Tuesday as she referenced an article from The Detroit News that pointed out her husband too had been stepped on during the game, writing; 'Thank you. Pretty sure Matthew's leg looks a lot damn worse right now from when he got stepped on/cleated in the same game. But it wasn't Suh.. And he's not Aaron Rodgers, so no one would think twice about it.' Suh on Monday was suspended by the league for one game for violating safety-related playing rules prohibiting unnecessary roughness. With Rodgers in a defenseless posture, Suh backed up and stepped on the quarterback's leg with his right foot before repeating the move with his left foot in a display of ""unnecessary roughness"", the NFL said in a statement on Monday. 'Unnecessary roughness': Ndamukong Suh deliberately stepped on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers' ankle during Sunday's Lions-Packers game, the NFL ruled . 'You did not respond in the manner of someone who had lost his balance and accidentally contacted another player who was lying on the ground,' Merton Hanks, the NFL's vice president of football operations, said. 'This illegal contact, specifically the second step and push off with your left foot, clearly could have been avoided.' Suh has a long history of player-safety violations. Cottrell is jointly appointed by the NFL and NFL Players Association to hear and decide appeals for on-field player discipline.","Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh has had a one-game suspension rescinded, making him eligible for Sunday's NFC wildcard game .

"Moments after the Dallas Cowboys finished burying the Jacksonville Jaguars 31-17 at Wembley Stadium, 80,000 poppies were supposed to rain down from the sky and cover the pitch in honour of Remembrance Day. It may be just as well that didn’t happen because for the Jaguars, who will be returning to Wembley next October to host the Buffalo Bills, the finish of Sunday’s game is a moment they’ll likely want to forget. The Jaguars briefly held a 7-3 first quarter lead before a botched play on special teams led to the Cowboys scoring a touchdown and taking an advantage they would not relinquish. Tony Romo, playing with two fractured vertebrae, was seldom pressured by Jaguars' front seven . Dallas head coach Jason Garrett said that sequence of events ‘really swung the tide’. ‘I think we played a pretty solid football game after that,’ he said. ‘Making stops on defence, moving the ball, throwing it, and getting the running game going.’ After getting up by seven, Dallas seemed content to let Jacksonville hang around until quarterback Tony Romo hit Dez Bryant with a second quarter touchdown pass that put the Cowboys up 17-7 after the extra point. The Cowboys didn’t look back after opening up the double-digit lead and kept the Jaguars off the board until Jacksonville secured a safety in the fourth quarter when the outcome of the game was no longer in doubt. DeMarco Murray became the  first player in NFL history to rush for 100-plus yaRds in nine of the first 10 games . Romo finished his day with 246 passing yards and three touchdowns before being replaced by backup Brandon Weeden. Bryant caught two of those touchdowns and had 158 receiving yards on the day, a season high. Dez Bryant had a memorable day at Wembley . Many of the 83,603 fans at Wembley attempted to cheer on the Jaguars, but the team simply did not have the horses to keep up with a Cowboys team that appears playoff-bound. The Cowboys will fly home to the Lone Star State with a badly-needed victory and, perhaps more importantly, a healthy Romo. Depending on the outcome of Monday night’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Carolina Panthers, Dallas may enter their bye week in sole possession of first place in the NFC East. Romo said: ‘You obviously want to have a chance to control your destiny and go out and do that. And we have that ability and guys have played hard and they put forth a lot of work and commitment to get to this point. And I'm proud that they have got themselves and ourselves in this position. But no one has won anything yet. It's all in front of you. You got to take it and move forward and get better.’ Four of Dallas’ six remaining games are against divisional opponents, so the Cowboys playoff chances are truly in their own hands. According to Bryant, the team will ‘stay focused’ and ‘get better each and every day’. He said: . ‘It's good. We got to continue to keep our head down and focus on our goal, and we all know what that is. We got to stay together, play together, and hope for the best.’ The Jaguars will remain in the cellar of the AFC South and once again be outside of the playoff picture looking in when postseason play begins in January. The exuberant Bryant finished the day with six receptions, 158 yards and two touchdowns . Regardless of their failure to find success at Wembley in 2014, the Jags will return to the United Kingdom and play as the home team in Week 7 of the 2015 NFL season. Although Dallas won’t be returning next year, franchise owner Jerry Jones would like to see the Cowboys back in London. He said: ‘I wouldn’t dare elaborate under when, what, how, but again, this is attractive to our franchise. This is attractive to me. I like the idea. I like for our players to have these experiences.’ The Cowboys defense halt Jaguars running back Toby Gerhart . The Cowboys will never give up a home game to play at Wembley, but Jones said the team would gladly travel to the UK on a yearly basis if a team is permanently placed in London. ‘On a personal basis and speaking for the Dallas Cowboys we very much would like to have a team in London,’ Jones said. ‘It has cache. It has an air about it of international competition I think that London is probably one of two or three cities outside of the United States that really does have all of the criteria that I would look at for having an NFL team.’ Given the fond memories the Cowboys created on Remembrance Sunday against the Jaguars, it’s not hard to see why Jones would want Dallas to return as soon as possible .","Dallas scored 28 unanswered points and won by a final margin of 31-17 .

"A hotel in a small Oregon town has failed in its attempt to sue over a scathing TripAdvisor write-up after a judge protected the anonymity of the review. The Ashley Inn, in Lincoln City, Oregon, demanded $74,500 from user Kelly12, who wrote that the hotel was 'nasty' and even claimed the staff were high on drugs. Hoteliers asked a court in Multnomah County to compel TripAdvisor to reveal the identity of Kelly12 so they could sue for defamation. Failed attempt: The Ashley Inn, in Lincoln City, Oregon, tried to sue a TripAdvisor user for $74,500 - but a judge refused to compel the site to reveal their identity . But Judge Christopher Marshall denied the request under laws designed to protect media organizations, the Oregonian reported. A piece of state legislation from 1973 says that nobody contributing to any kind of media can be forced to provide evidence - unless they are doing something criminal. The law applies to 'any medium of communication to the public', a definition which TripAdvisor's attorneys said applied to them. Lawyers for the Ashley Inn said the review was obviously false. It referred to a March 2014 stay by a guest from Prescott, Arizona - which the lawyers said did not match any hotel records. Protected: According to a Multnomah County judge, TripAdvisor is subject to protection under media laws . The piece itself, published in April, included observations such as: 'laundry and housekeeping are either high or drunk', and 'breakfast is nasty, the rooms are nasty'. It also claimed: 'the owner smokes weed' and that a receptionist 'had phone sex with someone.' The review has since been taken down - but the hotel owners are still unsatisfied. Jeffrey Frasier, an attorney for the business, said the ruling is 'disappointing because it leaves our client without a remedy.'

I really love my food - I'm always being tempted by room service and I eat out a lot - but I try and eat organic with natural ingredients,' she said.

I like to go to dance classes and feel like Beyoncé,' she said, adding that one of her favourite songs to work out to is Summer by Calvin Harris. The fitness fanatic also works out with James Duigan, the man behind the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire.

"Sony may have come under fire for editing certain scenes from The Interview, but it seems a few of the more controversial images might just have slipped through the net. The millions of viewers who have already download the movie will have been treated to scenes showing James Franco cavorting with topless dancers and two girls kissing - scenes which are unlikely to impress North Korea's infamously uptight leader. Kim Jong-Un  has made no secret of its fury over the movie, and the FBI has continued to insist that North Korea is behind a cyber-attack on Sony, in which thousands of damaging documents were leaked. Scroll down for video . The millions of viewers who have already download the movie will have been treated to scenes showing James Franco cavorting with topless dancers . An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse suggested that the hack may have been an inside job carried out by disgruntled ex-Sony employees - but the FBI has dismissed the theory, claiming there is not enough evidence to stand it up. According to Politico, an official claimed the evidence put forward by Norse was 'narrow' and not an accurate analysis of the information. Last week, it was revealed that Sony removed a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un and television presenter Dave Skylark. But it seems that the racy scenes depicting lesbian kisses and half-naked North Korean women dancing did indeed make the cut. Certain scenes, including one showing two girls kissing, are unlikely to impress North Korea's regime . The movie, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' the feared dictator, has been a continuous source of tension between the U.S. and North Korea. Over the summer, North Korea warned that the film's release would be an 'act of war that we will never tolerate'. It said the U.S. will face 'merciless' retaliation. Then a hacking cell called Guardian of Peace  launched a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, leaking thousands of damaging documents. Television presenter Dave Skylark played by James Franco (right) and Kim Jong-Un played by Randall Park (left) in a trailer for The Interview . But the attention brought to the movie over the hack and its initial cancellation by Sony, drove traffic to independent movie theaters and online when the company changed their mind and decided to release it on Christmas Eve. On opening day, the movie grossed $1million. Among the documents leaked in the hack was a version of the film's script including scenes which did not appear in the film released online and in movie theaters. Sony staff who spoke with The Sunday Times called the version released last week a 'redacted version' and expressed hopes that the full unedited movie would be released on DVD in a 'director's cut version'. The Interview grossed $1million on its opening day, when it was released online and in a few movie theaters . Kim Jong-Un (right) has made no secret of his fury over the movie, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two hapless journalists tasked with 'taking out' the feared dictator . A South Korean activist will launch balloons carrying DVDs of Sony's 'The Interview' towards North Korea to try to break down a personality cult built around dictator Kim Jong-un. Activist Park Sang-hak said he will start dropping 100,000 DVDs and USBs with the movie by balloon in North Korea as early as late January. Mr Park, a North Korean defector, said he is partnering with the U.S.-based non-profit Human Rights Foundation, which is financing the making of the DVDs and USB memory sticks of the movie with Korean subtitles. Mr Park said foundation officials plan to visit South Korea around Jan. 20 to hand over the DVDs and USBs, and that he and the officials will then try to float the first batch of the balloons if weather conditions allow. 'North Korea's absolute leadership will crumble if the idolization of leader Kim breaks down,' Mr Park said. Details edited from the film include North Korean military insignia, which was originally visible on soldiers' uniforms in the film, and a conversation between Rogen and Franco about Kim Jong-un's sexual abilities. Over the weekend, the North Korean regime spewed racial slurs at President Obama as they blamed him for the movie's release. President Obama encouraged Sony to release the film in defense of free speech. 'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' a spokesman for North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement. President Obama has promised retaliation for the hack against Sony, but it's still unclear what punishment will entail. Last week, it was revealed that Sony removed of a 10-minute scene depicting the aftermath of a gay orgy between Kim Jong-un and television presenter Dave Skylark, played by James Franco.

ALS ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE: . Everyone from David Beckham to Anna Wintour has now completed the Ice Bucket Challenge for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also referred to as motor neurone disease. It started in August as a fun way to raise awareness and funds for charities like the ALS Association and MND Association and involves people pouring a freezing cold bucket of water over their heads before nominating other people to get involved. The trend began in America and took off when Pete Frates, a former Boston College baseball player tipped to become a Red Sox star who had his career cut short by the disease, nominated fellow Boston athletes to take part. Pete Frates, a former standout baseball player at Boston College, had a very happy 30th birthday this month, pictured with his wife Julie .

STEPHEN SUTTON . Cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton, who tweeted at @_stephensstory, raised £3million for charity in his final months battling the disease. The 19-year-old, who had been diagnosed with bowel cancer, drew up a bucket list of things he wanted to achieve before he died. At the head of his 46 goals was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Knowing he did not have long left, he dropped out of school to concentrate on fundraising, and his efforts were so successful that he soon increased his target to £1million.

Benedict Cumberbatch supported Stephen's campaign, as did Jimmy Carr, pictured here in an image from the Stephen's Story Facebook page . When in April he was rushed to hospital with breathing problems after one of his lungs collapsed, he believed he had just days to live and urged people to help him reach his target. After the teenager posted a message online donations started to flood in and he had soon passed £1million. He was also sent messages of support by celebrities from Piers Morgan to Sir Chris Hoy and Russell Brand. Celebrities, politicians and classmates joined his family in an outpouring of grief after the youngster lost his fight for life. Thousands flocked to donate in his memory as news of his loss spread via social media, causing the page to temporarily crash. His mother Jane told of her heartbreak at the death of the 'courageous, selfless and inspirational' teen who in the end raised more than £3million for charity. NEK NOMINATE: . NekNominate was an online craze where youngsters are chosen by their peers to down - or 'neck' - strong drinks before challenging others to film a more shocking video within the next 24 hours. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game after he uploaded footage of himself 'necking' beer to Facebook and told his friends to do the same. He posted: 'I nominate all of you whose birthday it's not. Merry Christmas'. Former professional rugby player Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game .

"Yeah, yeah, we all know you're going to give up smoking (again), drink less, eat less and save more. This year, how about making some New Year resolutions that will put a saucy sparkle in both of your eyes? Here are just some ways that you could start your relationship off with a bang this New Year... Tracey says that the New Year is a great opportunity to revamp your sex life . I PROMISE TO… . Accept sex can't be perfect. Don't fall for myths (or boasts - the neighbours aren't really at it six times a week) but set real expectations about what you'd like to achieve and change. Understand and enjoy the differences between you and your partner rather than try to turn them into 'Mini-me'. Two 'mini-me's' makes for super boring bedtimes. If you like different things, you'll encourage each other to try different things. Sort out any problems in your sexual past so you can have happy sex in the future. It's never too late to get help for a serious sex trauma and it's definitely time to ditch any silly hang-ups kindly handed over by an insensitive ex. Your orgasm face is cute not frightening. Touch each other constantly. Both sexually and affectionately – and make sure you both know the difference. If you're never sure whether that kiss or cuddle is an expression of love or initiation of sex, you're going to end up mightily confused. There is no such thing as an ideal relationship. Everyone compromises. You let go of the tooth fairy. Now let go of this. Tracey recommends making an effort to touch your partner more a New Year's resolution . Honesty isn't the best policy. To be 100 per cent honest, you would have to express every fleeting sexual thought you have about others and every negative thing you think about your partner. Neither are wise. Be tactful, be kind and hold back the really nasty stuff you're desperate to blurt out in the middle of a an argument. Accept that most couples fall in and out of love during the course of a relationship. It's normal to have highs and lows and nothing to be frightened of. Have sex more often even if you're not particularly in the mood to keep your libido purring and your partner happy. It's been proven time and time again: the more often a couple have sex, the more often they want it. As well as trying new things this New Year, Tracey says now is a great time to iron out any problems . Look the best you can so your partner loves the outside of you as much as they do the inside. We all love slobbing in front of the telly but there is a limit to how often you can both pull on the same old moth-eaten T-shirts and track pants. Even if you're staying in Saturday night to watch a DVD, putting on a nice pair of jeans and top won't kill either of you. Make dates for sex rather than wait for it to happen. That way you both have something to look forward to! If you're the low sex drive person, it will give you time to get in the mood. Do whatever it takes - drag out that dog-eared copy of Fifty Shades or watch a few cat videos on You Tube. Each to their own. Instigate sex more often to make yourself feel powerful and sexy and let your partner know you enjoy it as much as they do. Be brave and adventurous and promise not to crinkle your nose up at anything daring your partner suggests but you don't fancy. How do you know you won't like sex with a pair of Marigolds on if you don't try? Talk about and solve sex problems as they happen, rather than let niggly little things turn into big bedroom monsters. But choose your battles wisely and focus on all that's good in your sex life, as well as what needs fixing. Mix it up every single time. Change one of the following elements for each session you have: the time of day you do it, what room you do it in, what you're wearing, what position you choose, who initiates, what the focus of the session is. Start a 'sex jar' on New Year's Day. It's a golden oldie that works a treat. Each write down 10 things you'd like to try. Rip into separate points, fold and put all of them into a jar. Pick out one a week to try. (Insist on pre-approval before you pop them in if you think 'Lure the hot 18-year-old next door in for a threesome' will feature strongly.) Repeat when it's empty. Happy New Year everyone and hope it's a great one for you all!

"A father whose four young sons could communicate only in grunts when authorities rescued them from a filthy Denver apartment was sentenced to five years in prison Tuesday after pleading guilty to his second offense of child abuse. Wayne Sperling, 67, told Judge J. Eric Elliff to do 'whatever you feel is right' when given a chance to speak before he was sentenced. Elliff said Sperling made excuses and did not accept responsibility for keeping the boys in 'horrific' conditions, and he hoped the sentence sends a message that children can't be treated like pets or possessions. Scroll down for video . Father punished: Wayne Sperling, 67, pictured here in court November 15, was sentenced to five years in prison for keeping his four sons in squalid conditions . 'They are human beings that need to be carefully nurtured,' Elliff said. 'That did not happen here.' Sperling's wife, Lorinda Bailey, was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years of probation last month, and Sperling had sought a similar sentence. Prosecutors asked for Sperling to spend seven years in prison. Authorities said Sperling, 67, his wife and the boys lived in an apartment filled with cat feces and swarming with flies. 'They just weren’t equipped to be parents,' defense attorney Betsy Atkinson said. The children, ages 2 to 6, were malnourished when they were found in October 2013. An emergency room doctor suspected abuse when the youngest was taken to the hospital for a cut on his forehead. The doctor noticed that the boy was non-verbal, unwashed, reeked of cigarette smoke and had bruises consistent with pinching. That led authorities to the apartment, where authorities said all the surfaces were covered with flies and that about an inch of solidified cat feces covered with urine lay beneath one of the boy's beds. Authorities said the stench inside the home was overwhelming, and that the three older boys communicated by making 'infant-like noises.' Cruel: Sperling (left) and his wife, Lorinda Bailey (right), had already lost three children after being accused of child abuse in 2006 . 'Sperling stated the children have their own language and grunt at each other but were able to speak to him and Bailey,' an arrest warrant affidavit said. Prosecutors said it was one of their most horrific cases, but Colorado's child abuse laws kept them from pursuing harsher penalties because the children didn't suffer serious physical injuries. After the boys were rescued and given bagged lunches to eat, they acted as if they hadn't seen food before, patting the sandwiches and playing with the apples, a detective testified during Bailey's sentencing hearing. An adult mimed eating an apple to encourage them to eat; they licked the fruit instead. The boys are improving while living together in foster care, but they still struggle, prosecutors said. They still aren't all toilet trained, and their snack cupboard has to be kept locked to prevent them from hoarding. Sentenced: His wife Lorinda Bailey, 36, pictured last year, was sentenced to 90 days in jail last month . A judge said Sperling made excuses and did not accept responsibility for keeping the boys in 'horrific' conditions . They have breathing problems and are sensitive to light, requiring them to wear special glasses, Deputy District Attorney Anita Drasan said. 'They didn’t smile, they didn’t laugh, and they lived in constant fear and were unable to express themselves,' Drasan said. And, reading a statement from their foster mother, she added, 'these are fighters and survivors. They will grow to do great things. But they have a long battle before them.'. The latest case involving Bailey and Sperling warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child-abuse offense. The couple lost custody of other children amid similar allegations in October 2006, after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street. The children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate, and officers found a home full of trash and rotten food. Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse.","Wayne Sperling, 67, was arrested last year after a doctor treating one of the boys noticed the child was filthy and had bruises consistent with pinching .

"Charged: Ravens security director Darren Sanders . The security director of the Baltimore Ravens is due in court charged with a sex offense, it has emerged. Darren Sanders was a prominent figure in the NFL team's investigation into Ray Rice after the now-sacked player was filmed hitting his then-fiancee in an elevator in February. Now court records show Sanders, 48, is due to be tried in February on a fourth-degree sexual assault charge. The incident is alleged to have happened on December 14 and the type of charge generally refers to non-violent sexual assaults. It carries a maximum penalty in Maryland of a $1,000 fine, a year in jail or both. Previous offenders can be jailed for up to three years. The summons, listed yesterday by the Baltimore City District Court, shows Sanders' address was given as the Ravens' team headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland. A hearing in the case, further details of which have not yet been revealed, is scheduled for February 9. Sanders' attorney Andrew Alperstein told the Baltimore Sun the claims were 'totally fabricated, made up'. The lawyer added: 'It does a disservice to real victims when people make things up like this. 'People like [Sanders] are susceptible to made-up allegations. It puts you in a vulnerable position. He's had nothing but an exemplary career.' The Ravens' spokesman Kevin Byrne added the team was aware and had been investigating. The NFL team, with which Sanders has been associated for a decade, is still reeling from a year of scandal surrounding now-sacked player Ray Rice. Those condemning Rice included President Obama after video emerged from inside the elevator of an Atlantic City casino of the athlete knocking out his then-fiancée Janay Palmer.

NFL officials initially handed the 27-year-old just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine, sparking outrage among domestic violence campaigners. He later had his $40 million contract terminated by the Ravens after video emerged from the elevator itself.

"A giant Leatherback turtle washed up on the same South Australian beach where seven sperm whales beached themselves less than a month ago. Friends Scott Neindorf, 21, and Blake Watkins made the discovery as they were walking along Macs Beach. 'I've never seen anything like it,' Mr Neindorf told Daily Mail Australia. 'I couldn't believe how big it was.' Scott Neindorf's friend Black Watkins pictured alongside the Leatherback turtle they came across on Macs Beach, on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula . South Australian Museum senior researcher Mark Hutchinson told DMA the fact the turtle washed up in the same area, not far from Ardrossan, the whales were found 'must be coincidental'. 'It's unusual to find turtles of that size this far south because of the cold but Leatherbacks are able to keep themselves warm because of this blubber layer they have, they can protect themselves. Some Leatherbacks have been known to weigh more than 600 kilograms, however, this one is unlikely to have reached full maturity. It's believed the turtle was up to 60 years old, weighed more than 200 kilograms and almost 2 metres in length. South Australian Museum senior researcher Mark Hutchinson said the fact the turtle washed up in the same area (near Ardrossan) the whales were found 'must be coincidental' 'We were just walking along and just randomly come across it,' said Mr Neindorf. 'We go down there a fair bit, never seen one of them washed up on the beach, it was quite a surprise. 'I was not going to touch it, so we just lay down next to it and took some pics to show how big it actually was. 'We had a good look at it and told a few people about it. My mate was trying to get onto the fisheries to just report it. 'Apparently it might have been there for a week at least, the fins were starting to rot away, the shell was in good condition.' While large turtles in the colder southern water are a rare find, there have been sightings before. 'Fisherman do tell me they have seen them on occasions,' Dr Hutchinson added. 'They feed on the surface and are slow moving, feeding on jellyfish of all things, they pick quiet areas where there are currents, so if you are on a boat you do spot them sometimes.' Seven beached sperm whales died on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia earlier this month.  The whales were found 50 metres offshore at Parara Beach, south of Ardrossan . Locals have been shocked twice in less than a month after a Leatherback turtle was found not far from where sperm whales became beached on the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia . The museum's reptile and amphibians expert said it was likely the Leatherback had died some time ago. 'It probably died out at sea and the currents have brought it in. Unlike the whales who actively beached themselves, once is passive and the other active,' he said. 'They tend to be solo when spotted, it's ideal spot for feeding but you do sometimes get a couple of animals come in together. 'Unfortunately there are several reasons why they die, it can be in a collision with a boat, drown when caught up in gear or they can die when eating plastic bags which they can mistake for the translucent things they normally feed on.'","A Leatherback Turtle washed up on Macs Beach .

"Many women say white wine in particular sends them 'crazy' or makes them irrationally upset . There was a time when an evening with friends was synonymous with a nice, chilled bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (or four). But as the years have rolled by, that crisp, glass of gooseberry-flavoured nectar has fallen out of favour. 'No white wine for me - it sends me mental,' is how it started. 'Nor me,' said another friend, and on it went. In fact, over the last few years, nearly a dozen of my female friends have declared they can no longer drink what used to be our favourite tipple. One was almost arrested, another broke her wrist and another very nearly got run over. There are countless other tales of tears, tantrums and Tube journeys going disastrously wrong. But what is it about the drink of choice for so many women that sends them doolally - or 'psychotic', as one friend confessed? Is there something in the wine itself or is it the way we consume it that wreaks such havoc? Firstly, different people react to alcohol in very different ways, Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser to the charity Drinkaware. 'Women react more quickly to alcohol,' she explained. 'If you’re a sturdy woman, you might think you can drink any scrawny man under the table - but don’t be fooled. 'Even if a woman is the same size as a man, she will have more body fat and less body water. 'Since alcohol is only distributed in body water, you’ll have a higher proportion of it in your bloodstream.’ This, she says, may be why women tend to suffer from worse hangovers. Indeed, researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbi found that not only do women get drunk faster, but their hangover symptoms were more severe - even though they drank the same amount as the men. Then there's eating on on an empty (or at least emptier than many a man's) stomach, which one study likened to taking alcohol intravenously. 'Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach means the alcohol is absorbed into your system quicker,' said Dr Jarvis. But what does seem to be key in the white wine situation is the speed at which it is drunk - and the volume of alcohol it contains. Both Dr Jarvis, and Dr Arun Ghosh, a GP at the Spire Liverpool Hospital and ITV's resident doctor, agree that women tend to drink more quickly. 'White wine is a female drink - more women drink white wine even than red wine,' Dr Ghosh told MailOnline. 'If a woman orders a large 250ml glass, that's a third of a bottle of, say, 13 per cent alcohol. And she can often drink that a lot quicker than a man drinking a pint (568ml) - which is also weaker in terms of volume of alcohol. 'Whereas a man might take 30 minutes to drink a pint (which contains on average two units of alcohol), some women will drink a glass of wine (which could be up to three units) in 10-15 minutes,' he added. 'The strength of wine has also increased,' GP Arun Ghosh told MaiOnline. Experts advise those who are worried about their consumption - and the effects - to cut down on glass size and the alcohol volume of wine . The effects of too much alcohol also manifest themselves in different ways. 'Men tend to get more aggressive as they have more testosterone - but for women, alcohol can be more of a depressant, so they may cry. 'However things are changing and young women are becoming equally as violent as men,' he added. While there appears to be no published research - or evidence - that white wine per se is the culprit for so many women becoming so intoxicated, theories abound. One is that white wine contains more sulphites than red wine. While sulphites are naturally found on grapes, small amounts of sulphur are added prior to fermentation as a preservative to keep the freshness and remove unwanted yeasts and bacteria. However sulphites have been linked - anecdotally, at least -  with 'drinking blues' and depression, as well as a host of other ailments from allergies to headaches. White wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red, according to the Food Standards Agency. A large glass of 13% wine puts a woman over the government's lower risk guidelines. Another small glass (125ml) will put men over the guidelines too. Wine is often consumed at dinner time alongside a meal but did you know that a large glass of 13% wine (250ml) can add 228 calories to your evening supper? This is similar to a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers. A standard glass of 13% red or white wine (175ml)   could also contain up to 160 calories which is similar to a slice of Madeira cake. Often when sharing wine, we assume we’re drinking less calories but a bottle of wine shared between two could mean you are consuming 340 calories each - that’s the equivalent of a pain au chocolat pastry each. Source: Drinkaware . Whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml, rose contains 2.5g per 100ml. Meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml. While there is no published evidence to prove a link between higher sugar alcohol and more boisterous behaviour, there is a wealth of research proving sugar can dramatically affect behaviour. 'The strength of wine has also increased, without a doubt,' said Dr Ghosh. Plus, women in particular are more likely to 'overpour', according Drinkaware, which warns many of us have no idea how much we're glugging from the glass. For example, a large (250ml) glass of 13 per cent wine puts a woman over the government's lower risk guidelines for alcohol consumption. It also contains up to 228 calories - similar to a Cornetto ice cream or two fish fingers. Elsewhere, it has been suggested that white wine is simply more 'drinkable' - i.e. we drink it faster and end up consuming more. Then there's the bubbles in drinks such as champagne or prosecco. 'The carbon dioxide makes the body absorb alcohol more quickly - which in turn makes you drunk more quickly,' said Dr Ghosh. There is some evidence that bubbly drinks intoxicate you more quickly than flat drinks. A study at the University of Surrey in 2001 found volunteers given two glasses of fizzy champagne had an average of 0.54 milligrams of alcohol per millilitre of blood after five minutes, while those given the same amount of flat champagne had 0.39 milligrams. One theory is the carbon dioxide in bubbles speeds up the flow of alcohol into the intestine. Indeed, turning your wine into a spritzer may not be the restrained option you think, as the researchers said mixing fizzy water with wine could have a similar effect. White wine also contains up to 10 times more sugar than red, according to the Food Standards Agency. Whereas red contains 0.2g sugar per 100ml, rose contains 2.5g per 100ml. Meanwhile dry white wine contains 0.6g and medium white wine 3g per 100ml . The principle could apply to all carbonated drinks, including beer, adds Dr Emma Derbyshire, a senior lecturer in nutrition at Manchester Metropolitan University and independent adviser to the Natural Hydration Council. Although this won’t necessarily increase the severity of your hangover, getting drunk faster may impair your judgement more quickly and spur you to drink more, Dr Jarvis warns. It is also true that some ethnic groups suffer more after drinking because of their genetic make-up. ‘We know East Asians have very low levels of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde), which can make them get drunk more quickly and contribute to hangovers,’ says Dr Jarvis. And the next morning? When it comes to hangovers, most of us are familiar with the phrase ‘Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine, but wine before beer and you’ll feel queer.’ But why is this? 'A possibility is that beer has a higher water content than wine, so you’re getting more fluids into your body if you drink beer,’ says Dr Emma Derbyshire, a senior lecturer in nutrition at Manchester Metropolitan University and independent adviser to the Natural Hydration Council. 'People tend to drink more at the beginning of a session to quench their thirst, so beer may keep you slightly better hydrated.' One large glass of wine can put you over the lower risk guidelines for the day. To stay on track, try these tips from Dr Sarah Jarvis, expert medical advisor to alcohol education charity Drinkaware... 1. Mind your measures . Downsize your drinks - if you drink wine opt for a smaller glass. There are generally three sizes of wine glass – 125ml, 175ml and 250ml. An average 125ml glass of wine would be around 1.5 units, but a 250ml glass could be over 3 units. So, just one large glass and you’ve already drunk the equivalent of the government’s lower risk guidelines . 2. Tackle your triggers . If you always have a glass of wine to celebrate a good day at work, or commiserate a bad one, try doing something else instead. An alcohol-free dinner out makes a feel-good treat, while a gym session is a great way to relieve stress. 3. Give alcohol-free days a go . If you drink regularly, your body starts to build up a tolerance to alcohol. This is one of the main reasons why many medical experts recommend taking regular days off from drinking to ensure you don't become addicted to alcohol . Test out having a break for yourself and see what positive results you notice. Drink low alcohol or alcohol-free wine. The alcohol content in normal wine ranges from 9 to 15%; however, lower alcohol and no alcohol wines are readily available – have a look next time you go to the supermarket. 4. Treat yourself . Trade up to a special bottle of wine that's expensive enough to encourage you to saviour it over a few days, rather than down it all in one night. This way, you'll space out the units you're consuming. 5. Track your drinking over time . If you choose to drink, recording exactly what you've drunk during the week will give you a great idea of whether you're within the guidelines.

"Dumped on a crewless cargo ship on a fixed course to crash into the Italian coast, nearly 1,000 migrants were rescued early yesterday just hours from certain disaster. Italian coastguards said the Blue Sky M was carrying 970 desperate immigrants – many of them women and children – with its engine locked on autopilot heading towards Puglia in south-east Italy. Six coastguards were lowered by helicopter to the bridge of the Moldovan-flagged vessel and corrected the ship’s course after taking control of its jammed engines and navigation computers. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Some 970 migrants were led to safety from the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M when it arrived in Gallipoli, Italy in the early hours of New Years Eve . Tragic: Four people have died and this man is being stretchered from the cargo ship . Freezing temperatures: Children are carried away wrapped in blankets from the Blue Sky M cargo ship . Migrants: The ship was carrying 970 people, some suffering from frostbite . Because of stormy seas in the Adriatic, the rescuers could not board the ship from coastguard vessels. Commander Filippo Marini said: ‘There would have been death and destruction – the ship was only a few miles away from the coast of Puglia.’ He added: ‘It was a real race against the clock. Unlocking the engines was a difficult and delicate operation, but they managed to do it.’ Mimma Antonagi, of the Red Cross, said: ‘The ship was abandoned by its crew in open water. If [the Italian officers] had not gone on board, it would have crashed into the coast.’ The ship’s position was traced after a passenger made an emergency satellite phone call to Greek officials, pleading: ‘We have no water, blankets or food.’ The caller said there were armed men aboard – thought to have been the people smugglers – but there was no sign of them when the coastguard arrived. The Blue Sky M had recently had its safety certificates withdrawn after it was ruled unseaworthy. After it docked in the Italian port of Gallipoli, hundreds of desperately cold men, women and children carrying their few remaining possessions were helped to safety. Wrapped in blankets, they stumbled off the ship to waiting aid workers and ambulances. One woman holding a young child collapsed and several had to be carried on stretchers. Medics treated refugees as they were brought ashore following their ordeal on the high seas . Investigation: Authorities are trying to find out how the migrants came to be hidden on the Blue Sky M . Immigrants: The crew abandoning the ship strengthens the theory that the 970 passengers are illegals . Coastguard: Spokesman Commander Filippo Marini said the team took control of the ship after determining there was no crew to be found . Abandoned: The Blue Sky M was carrying 970 migrants when it was spotted near the coast of Corfu yesterday . Many of the migrants had been forced to huddle for hours on the main deck, and more than 100 were treated for hypothermia. Most are thought to have been fleeing the vicious fighting in Syria and Kurdistan. A Moldovan man was arrested on suspicion of being one of the traffickers after trying to pass himself off as one of the migrants. Italian prosecutors impounded the Blue Sky M after it docked yesterday as they began an investigation into the incident. Italy is facing a massive surge in migrants from the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. The most common sea route has been from Libya, but this ship is said to have come from Turkey, although it is not known from which port it set off. It is unusual for a vessel the size of the Blue Sky M to be used by people smugglers. Reports suggest they bought or hired it and charged the migrants thousands of dollars each with the promise of safe passage to Europe. Distress call: Moldovan cargo ship Blue Sky was allegedly carrying 970 illegal immigrants when it sent out the distress call (not pictured today) Shiptracking: The Blue Sky changed its course and made a sharp turn towards Italy instead of Croatia where it was heading . Route: Shiptracking data shows the Blue Sky made two sharp turns before heading towards Italy . They appear to have begun the hazardous journey with their human cargo before fixing the ship on a course to Italy and abandoning it by speed boat. To avoid capture, smugglers frequently abandon migrants at sea, sometimes overturning the crowded migrant boats as they leave, according to survivors. This year alone, more than 100,000 migrants were rescued at sea by Italian officials. Hundreds drowned in the attempt. The Blue Sky M was originally heading for the port of Rijeka in Croatia. According to the tracking website MarineTraffic, the ship abruptly changed direction on Tuesday morning, heading west towards Italy. This is thought to have been when the smugglers abandoned their human cargo to its fate. Weather conditions in the region have been poor for days, also hampering the rescue of those stranded on the Norman Atlantic ferry which caught fire on Sunday, killing at least ten people. More than 400 were rescued in gale-force winds. Spain has said 800 African migrants have tried to storm the border fences separating the country’s North African enclave of Melilla from Morocco in the second attempt in two days. The Interior Ministry reported police managed to repel most but 54 migrants managed to make it across. Spanish National Television has shown the migrants celebrating the feat. The ministry said two police officers were treated for unspecified injuries during the melee. Thousands of African migrants living illegally in Morocco try to enter the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta each year, hoping to reach a better life in Europe. On Tuesday, 200 migrants stormed the six-meter high fences, with 102 getting across.

"Whether it's frivolous and fun or a serious news story, if people around the world are talking about about a topic, it will have a hashtag. From the First Lady Michelle Obama endorsing a political campaign surrounding the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria, or celebrities tipping buckets of iced-water over their heads to raise money for charity, the topics that have had us chatting away on social media in 2014 have been far-reaching. Add to those Kim Kardashian's #BreakTheInternet picture of her oiled derriere, Miley Cyrus joining the #FreeTheNipple campaign, and Solange Knowles and Jay Z's #Elevatorgate, and it's varied subjects that have gauged our interest. Here's what got us campaigning, posting, tweeting, donating (and tittering) in 2014. The #BringBackOurGirls campaign was aimed to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls by Islamic extremist group Boko Haram in Nigeria . #BringBackOurGirls . You know when Michelle Obama endorses a hashtag, the world will stop and take notice. And that's exactly what happened when she posted a picture of herself holding a sign with these poignant words. The campaign was aimed to raise awareness of the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls by Islamic extremist group Boko Haram in Nigeria. In April, the terrified teenagers were abducted in their dorms and and forced on to trucks at gunpoint. Following apathy from the Nigerian government, the #BringBackOurGirls campaign was started by former Nigerian government minister Oby Ezekwesili. As well as the First Lady, Prime Minister David Cameron and celebrities from Salma Hayek to Cara Delevingne and Leona Lewis joined the campaign. Sadly, eight months on, there's still no sign of the students. Celebrities including Cara Delevingne (left) and Leona Lewis (right) joined the campaign . #IceBucketChallenge . Millions of people helped raise nearly £100million for amyotrophic laterel slerosis (ALS) by urging friends and followers to donate to the charity while having a bucket of ice cold water chucked over their heads. After the likes of David Beckham, Bill Gates and Rita Ora uploaded videos of themselves getting the icy treatment, the world followed suit. Luckily, the campaign took off in August, and became a welcome cooling technique for celebrities worldwide during their summer holidays. Good sport: Becks gets the icy treatment and helps propel the #IceBucketChallenge into viral orbit . Rita Ora does the Ice Bucket Challenge on the New York City streets . Bill Gates got the world donating after throwing ice cold water over himself . #HerNameWasReeva . Domestic violence activists used this hashtag to highlight the issue of domestic violence during the trial of Oscar Pistorius, who was jailed for five years for culpable homicide after shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkampf on Valentine's Day 2013. The Twitter campaign highlighted the prevalence of domestic violence around the globe. In South Africa, a woman is killed by domestic violence every eight hours while in the UK an incident of domestic violence is reported to the police every minute. The Olympian has since been sentenced to five years in prison for manslaughter. #HerNameWasReeva was used by activist to highlight domestic violence during the trial of Oscar Pistorius (at court, right, and with murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkampf, left) #NoMakeUpSelfies . The 'no make up selfies' took the internet by storm in March and are thought to have raised more than £8million for Cancer Research UK and other cancer charities. Bare-faced celebrities including Cheryl Cole, Holly Willoughby, Amy Willerton and Jemima Khan helped send the trend viral. Cancer research did not initiate the campaign, but asked users to add a donation request and text code to their posts after becoming aware of the #NoMakeUpSelfies trend. At the time, Cancer Research UK's head of social media, Aaron Eccles, said: 'We're over the moon. When we do a social media campaign we want to engage as many people as possible, and this has taken off like crazy.' The trend was kicked off in the UK by Fiona Cunningham, 18, who encouraged people to donate cash along with their selfies after actress Kim Novak kicked off the craze when she appeared bare-faced at the Oscars. Fiona set up a Facebook page from her bedroom in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and encouraged people to post their selfies. Bare-faced Cheryl Cole (left) and Holly Willoughby (right) helped send the trend viral . Amy Willerton (left) and Jemima Khan (right) helped raise £8million for cancer charities . #Elevatorgate . There's nothing that gets the world tweeting like a great celebrity scandal - and Beyonce and Jay Z gave the world a gift in the form a family bust-up. Leaked CCTV footage showed Solange Knowles attacking Jay Z in  a hotel lift in New York City in May with sister Beyonce standing by her side. The internet was, of course, aflutter with theories about the fall-out posted under the hashtag #elevatorgate. The big question was whether it was the end of the music couple's six-year marriage. But seven months on, it seems the power couple are still going strong. Leaked footage showed Solange Knowles attacking Jay Z in a hotel lift in New York City in May with sister Beyonce by her side . #HeForShe . Launched by Emma Watson at the UN headquarters in New York in September, #HeForShe reminded the world that women's rights was a human issue, not just a feminist one. The Harry Potter actress revealed the sexism she has experienced throughout her life, saying it started at the age of eight when she was branded 'bossy' for wanting to direct school plays. 'At 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear ""muscly"" ... at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings,' she said in her speech to kick off the campaign. The UN Women HeForShe campaign aims to get 100,000 men and boys involved in the fight to achieve gender equality. Emma Watson at the launch of the #HeForShe campaign at the UN headquarters in New York in September . #BreakTheInternet . When Kim Kardashian flashed her well-oiled derriere on the front of Paper magazine in November along with the cheeky slogan 'Break the Internet', it almost had the desired affect. But what the star may not have been prepared for were the slew of spoofs that followed. The audacity of the attention-seeking shoot, which also included fully naked photos inside the magazine, inspired people worldwide to take create their own  versions. Who knew one bottom could create such a global ripple? Kim Kardashian flashed her well-oiled derriere on the front of Paper magazine in November . The attention-seeking magazine shoot inspired people worldwide to create their own versions and spoofs of the famous photoshoot along with the hashtag #BreakTheInternet . #FreeTheNipple . Free The Nipple started in July as a campaign against Instagram's censorship of female nipples. The crux of the free nipple message? Why are women not allowed to be topless while men are able to removes their shirts freely? The campaign may not have pulled in celebrity activists of the Angelina Jolie caliber, but luckily there's always a star waiting for a chance to flash  for a good cause. In this case, it was Miley Cyrus who so willingly obliged last week, giving the campaign a new lease of life.

"Killed: Ezell Ford, 25, was shot three times by LAPD officers, including once in the back, on August 11 . The autopsy of a mentally ill black man who was killed by Los Angeles police has revealed that he was shot three times at close range, including once in the back. Ezell Ford, 25, was shot dead during a confrontation with LAPD officers near his home in South Los Angeles in August this year. Ford's parents accuse the LAPD of 'executing' their son and have filed a $75million lawsuit against the city. Ezell Ford was shot three times in his right side, right arm and back, and had abrasions to his left hand, forearm and elbow, according to the autopsy report. The autopsy also revealed that a muzzle imprint, consistent with that of the gun used by LAPD, was found around the back wound. The report was disclosed Monday after police initially ordered the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office to withhold the results for months to avoid tainting potential witness statements. Ford was unarmed when police confronted him on a street near his home in South Los Angeles in August 11. Representatives from the LAPD said officers tried to speak to him but got into a struggle with Ford and shot him when he tried to grab an officer's gun. Ford's parents say the killing of their son was 'more like an execution than a confrontation,' according to their attorney. Representing the family, Steve Lerman said the autopsy report was 'horrifying' and supported the parents' claim that the shooting was 'unjustified, illegal and unconstitutional.' He said the family read the report together and that Ford's parents have 'gone into seclusion.' 'They're distraught, they're hysterical with grief and anger,' Lerman said.  'It essentially filled in their worst nightmare that this happened like this'. Scroll down to read the full autopsy report . Rest in peace: Tritobia Ford lights candles at a memorial for her son, Ezell Ford, a 25-year-old mentally ill black man, at the site where he was shot and killed by two LAPD officers in August . Anger: Dozens of protesters march to shut down the 110 freeway near Ezell Ford's home South Los Angeles after the autopsy report was released on Monday night . Killed: Ford's parents say the shooting of their son was 'more like an execution than a confrontation,' and have filed a $75million lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles . Ford's parents have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit and a $75million claim against the city alleging the two gang officers knew Ford from the neighborhood and were aware he had mental problems. Lerman said an expert is reconstructing the incident along with witness statements from people who directly saw what happened, and he was confident the family would prevail in court. 'It's simple to me that they pounced upon an unarmed defenseless man they knew to be mentally challenged and ended up shooting him in the back and killing him, that's the nutshell,' Lerman said. Lerman has said his investigator found witnesses to support his case, but he refused to divulge details. The suit also claimed that the city, LAPD and 10 unnamed superiors or other officers were part of a culture that tolerated civil rights violations, including racial profiling and excessive force against blacks. The autopsy reports comes at a time when tensions between the black community and police are at their highest in recent memory. Mass protests have been held across the U.S. Following the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and the chokehold death of 43-year-old Eric Garner in New York City. Both deaths involved white police officers and unarmed black men, but neither case saw any charges brought against the officers responsible. The anger at police took a horrific turn on December 20th, when two New York officers were executed in their squad car by a man who said he was targeting cops as revenge for the deaths of Brown and  Garner. Last week, Antonio Brown, a black 18-year-old, was shot dead  by a white officer at a gas station in Berkeley, Missouri. Police say Antonio Brown pulled a loaded 9mm handgun on the officer and that the police officer was justified to open fire. Discovery: The autopsy report revealed that a muzzle imprint, consistent with that of the gun used by LAPD, was found around the back wound on Ezell Ford's body, indicating that he was shot at extremely close range . Preparing: Los Angeles Police set up a perimeter at a freeway offramp after protesters blocked the southbound lanes of the 110 freeway after the Los Angeles County Coroner released the autopsy report . In memoriam: Tritobia Ford, right, is hugged as family light candles at a memorial for her son . A small protest was held on Monday night in Crenshaw District, a few miles from Ezell Ford's home, following the release of the autopsy report. Around 30 to 40 protesters were involced in the peaceful march, while shouting 'No justice, no peace.' A short while afterwards, a group of about 30 protesters blocked traffic on the southbound 110 Freeway in South Los Angeles, but were escorted off the road by California Highway Patrol, abc7.com reports. Police Chief Charlie Beck told a news conference on Monday that the investigation into Ezell Ford's death was far from over. 'There is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers,' Beck said. Beck said the officers reported that Ford attracted their attention with suspicious actions then knocked one officer to the ground. Ford was atop the officer and grappling for the officer's holstered weapon when his partner fired two shots and the fallen officer pulled a backup gun and shot Ford in the back, according to an account read by Beck on Monday. Beck said officers told investigators it was a violent struggle in which 'the (downed) officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity - possibly, probably the cause of the muzzle imprint mentioned in the coroner's report.' He said the muzzle imprint was consistent with the type of weapon used by the officer, and that the other weapon was a semi-automatic pistol that probably wouldn't leave the same kind of mark. Keeping the peace? LAPD Chief Charlie Beck speaks to the media Monday after the Los Angeles County Coroner released an autopsy report on the LAPD's shooting of Ezell Ford in Los Angeles . Loving memory: Lavell Ford wears a T-shirt protesting the fatal police shooting of his brother Ezell Ford . Beck said he had no indications thus far that the officers involved knew anything about Ford's mental condition, and that police have tried to reach witnesses listed by the family's legal staff but were unable to successfully speak to any. The imprint indicated Ford was shot either right up against his skin or very close to his skin, said Richard Lichten, a retired law enforcement lieutenant and a police practices expert. He said the abrasions only indicated Ford had sustained friction wounds at some point. Additional details such as injuries to the officer involved in the scuffle would provide more details, Lichten said. 'The autopsy report is only one piece of the puzzle, only one piece, and no one should render a solid opinion based only on an autopsy report,' Lichten said. He said many other types of evidence from interviews, officer statements, measurements, photographs, gunshot residue and details about the bullet will also be analyzed during the investigation. The LAPD previously identified the two gang officers involved as Sharlton Wampler and Antonio Villegas. The chief said it would be several months before the investigation was completed and presented to the civilian Police Commission to determine if it was within department policy. Meanwhile, the officers remain on non-field duties. The commission will receive separate recommendations from Beck and the department's independent inspector general. The county district attorney's office will separately determine if the shooting was justified or if charges should be filed. Beck said the department has found no witnesses who saw the confrontation between Ford and the officers. He appealed for any possible witnesses to come forward. The LAPD said no officer was hurt in the incident, and Ford, who was identified by family members, died in hospital. READ THE ENTIRE AUTOPSY REPORT HERE...

"The Australian Federal Police is investigating reports of a Brisbane girl being taken from her home to undergo genital mutilation in Africa. It is believed the girl is between the ages of four and seven and is travelling with her father, The Guardian Australia reported. The child was born in Sierra Leone but was taken to Gambia to have the procedure before Christmas. Scroll down for video . It is believed the girl is between the ages of four and seven and is travelling with her father to Gambia for female genital mutilation . An AFP spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were investigating the allegations. 'AFP has received a referral in relation to FGM and as we are currently conducting enquiries, no more comment can be offered at this point in time,' she said. But there are fears police intervention is too late, with west African community members in Brisbane telling The Guardian Australia the girl may have already had the procedure. Female genital mutilation is illegal in Australia, as is removing children to undergo the procedure. An example of knife and blades used for FGM, which is illegal in Australia, but three girls a day are at risk of it . Three girls a day are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Australia. There are four types of FGM including clitoridectomy, excision, infibulation and other. No FGM director Paula Ferrari told Daily Mail Australia more needed to be done to educate people about the dangers of the procedure. Source: World Health Organisation . She said the girls who were most at risk of FGM were those who came from a community where the practice is accepted, or had a mother or sibling who had experienced it. In the case of the Brisbane girl, Ms Ferrari said the child had this history. 'The question could be asked if this could have been prevented because she had ticked two of these boxes,' she said. Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has urged relatives or friends to blow the whistle on anyone taking children abroad to undergo female genital mutilation. But it is virtually impossible for authorities to step in without evidence of somebody's intentions, Ms Bishop told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday. 'If somebody just presents with a passport and they're heading off overseas and we have no evidence to provide us with any cause to prevent the person leaving, then of course that happens,' she said. 'People are free to travel on an Australian passport if they have a valid passport.' Ms Bishop said it was vital family members or friends who were in the know about such plans let authorities know. 'This equally applies to foreign terrorist fighters,' she said. 'It's the families that we need to hear from if there are such matters occurring.' Relatives were the ones most likely to notice changes in behaviour or the beginning of radicalisation, Ms Bishop said. '[Whether it's] a girl leaving for overseas for this brutal, barbaric practice, or whether it's people leaving for overseas to take up with terrorist organisations.'","The Brisbane girl is believed to be between the ages of four and seven .

The reduced sandwich size is just the latest in a series of admissions by food producers that portions are getting smaller. A spokesman for SSP told The Times the reduced size was not a money-saving ploy, but merely a move to bring the sandwiches 'in line with their competitors'. They claimed they now use stronger tea bags in large teas, meaning they did not need to put two bags in one cup. The spokesman also denied claims that workers had been told only to hand out napkins to customers who ask for them. But the move have been criticised by consumer groups, who say customers want honesty from firms. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't. 'We want simpler pricing so people can easily compare products to see which is the cheapest, and for special offers to be genuine. ' SSP runs more than 109 Upper Crust units in 17 countries, including many at railway stations and airports . An SSP spokesman said: 'Similar to many retailers we conduct range reviews on an ongoing basis to ensure we meet our customers expectations. 'These range reviews cover all aspects of the mix: merchandising, price and product specification. As part of this process, whilst the size of some of our range has been reduced, the price of the majority of these products has also been reduced‎.' Last year, High Street bakery Greggs came in for criticism after it emerged best-selling snacks, including steak bakes, bacon rolls and pizzas, had shrunk in size. But the bakery giant defended the reduced size of its food, insisting they were better for customers' waistlines. Mars gave the same explanation for reducing the size of Twix bars, claiming it was due to demands to reduce calorie content. Which? examined the changes in size of food products in the study released last year. It found Walkers Crisps had shaved 6 per cent off its pack size, bringing them down to 32.5g. The 49p price remained the same, however. Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts had also came down from 215g to 190g, which is 12 per cent or six sweets, without any reduction in the price. Dolmio reduced the contents of its Express Creamy Carbonara Pasta Sauce from 330g to 300g. Last year, Which? released figures which showed a number of food products are now smaller than before .","Company behind Upper Crust and Cafe Ritazza cuts length of baguettes .

"From Wall-E to Hal 9000, personal robots have been one of the most widely portrayed future technologies in science fiction movies. And now one company claims they are close to bringing the fiction into reality with their Luna personal robot. The human-sized android can apparently perform simple tasks like walking the dog and serving drinks, or more complex tasks like assisting doctors and nurses in a hospital. Scroll down for video . A robot dubbed the world's first personal robot has begun its crowdfunding phase.   Luna (shown) is described as the first human size personal robot designed for everyday practical use.   The innovation received press in 2011, but now the developers have launched a Kickstarter campaign for £320,000 ($500,000) Santa Monica-based company RoboDynamics believe their product will revolutionise robotics in the same way that the PC did home computing and the iPhone revolutionised mobile electronics. The innovation received press in 2011, but now the developers have launched a Kickstarter campaign for the £320,000 ($500,000) needed to bring Luna to market. Early adopters will get the robot for $999, rather than the expected £965 ($1,500) price tag, with a scheduled December 2015 shipping date. Height: 5ft (1.5m) Weight: 60 lbs (27.2kg) Motherboard: Mini-ITX . Ram: 8GB . Storage: 16GB SSD . Screen: 8"" Capacitive Touch Screen . Camera: Hi-def with wide angle lens . Luna Expansion Ports (LXP): Seven USB . Main Operating System: Ubuntu Linux . Interaction with Luna is possible using an 8-inch touchscreen display on its face, as well as through a microphone, wireless and cellular communication. The robot stands five feet tall with two ‘arms’ on either side of its body. It rolls around on wheels - which might hamper its ability somewhat just as it did the Daleks in Doctor Who. But the design of the robot is open source, and with multiple USB ports the makers claim that anyone could design accessories or various add-ons for it. It also features an HD camera and a carrying handle. Personal robots have been frequently portrayed in science fiction movies, such as Wall-E (shown) and Hal 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now RoboDynamics say their Luna android could bring robots to the masses. The 5ft (1.5m) tall android can be programmed to perform a number of tasks . Luna is pictured left with Robodynamics founder Fred Nikgohar. On the right, near its base, can be seen the cameras and some of the USB ports that can be used to attach other devices. However, as the robot is on wheels its movements will likely be somewhat limited . Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment. Speaking at an event in London earlier this month, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' He argued that developments in digital personal assistants Siri, Google Now and Cortana are merely symptoms of an IT arms race which 'pale against what the coming decades will bring.' But Professor Hawking noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant, with the potential to eradicate, war, disease and poverty. ‘Since our founding 11 years ago our mission is to bring robots to the masses,’ said Robodynamics founder Fred Nikgohar. ‘We believe that robots and humans can live and work in harmony together. That's why we made Luna. ‘Luna is a personal robot designed for everyday practical use. She is a powerful platform capable of an increasing universe of apps and services through an app store model.’ Among the number of tasks that Luna could perform, the makers say it could be used to keep an eye on the elderly in their own home. It could also be employed as a medical assisting, reminding patients to take their medicine or assisting nurses by fetching items. And it could even be used as a patrolling security system for buildings, allowing humans to avoid dangerous situations. Other uses and limitations of the robot have not yet been revealed, but the company is adamant that Luna can kick-start the personal robot industry. They rather ambitiously aim to see a robot in every home by 2021.

"Astronomers have so far been attempting to find alien life by sniffing out their chemical signature. But researchers say they have found a better way of finding extra-terrestrial beings: through vibrations. The European team has now created the first tiny motion detector that it claims may someday help find microscopic life forms on distant planets. Scroll down for video . Alien hunter: European scientists have developed an extremely sensitive motion detector that can be built using already-existent technology. The device can hold around 500 bacteria . Taking advantage of movement, which they call 'a universal signature of life,' the sensor aims to identify on a nano-level the tiny motions that all life forms make. They team began to explore the possibility of searching for life with a sensor attuned to those tiny vibrations in organisms such as bacteria and yeast. 'The nanomotion detector allows studying life from a new perspective: life is movement,' said Professor Giovanni Longo at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. 'This means that the nanomotion detector can detect any small movement of living systems and deliver a complementary point of view in the search for life.' Good vibrations: The sensor has already shown it can detect living things, including E coli (artists's impression pictured) and yeast, as well as human, plant and mice cells in the lab . Professor Longo worked with colleagues at Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie in Belgium to create the an instrument that is smaller than a millimetre - just a few hundred microns in length. One micron is equal to 1000 nanometres or the thickness of a red blood cell. Most bacteria are from 1 to 10 micrometers long and the device can hold around 500 bacteria. The sensor uses a nano-sized cantilever to detect motion. A cantilever is essentially a beam that is anchored only at one end, with the other end bearing a load. It is most often used with bridges and buildings, but in the sensor it is used on the micrometre scale, and it can hold around 500 bacteria. The idea comes from the technology behind an existing microscope, the atomic force microscope, which uses a cantilever to produce pictures of the very atoms on a surface. The cantilever scans the surface like the needle of a record player and its up-and-down movement is read by a laser to produce an image. The motion sensor works the same way, but here the sample is attached on the cantilever itself. For example, a bacterium attaches to the cantilever. If the bacterium is alive, it will inevitably move in some way. That motion also moves the much smaller and sensitive cantilever and it is captured by the readout laser as series of vibrations. The signal is taken as a sign of life. The team tested the sensor on a variety of living things, including E. coli, yeast, as well as human, plant and mice cells in the lab. In all cases, when living organisms were placed near the sensor, they 'produced an increase in the amplitude of the measured fluctuations,' said the study. Professor Longo also scooped up soil and water from the grounds near his Swiss lab and found that the sensor could detect tiny life there, too. Researchers found they could manipulate the movements of the life forms by adding nutrients which the cells would consume, or adding chemicals that would kill them, making the motion stop. 'The detection system can be used as a simple, extremely sensitive, and weight-efficient 'life detector,'' the study said. A prototype would cost less than £6,400 ($10,000), would use very little battery power and could be contained in a 20 by 20 cm box. The device has not been presented yet to Nasa or Esa, but efforts are under way to write a proposal and make a prototype that could travel to space on a robotic vessel. If it had been available to the Esa's Rosetta mission, which recently sent its Philae lander onto a comet for the first time and detected, it could have propelled the science one step further, the researchers claims. If the world's space agencies find a way to use it, the detector could be used to search for life on the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, or on Mars, where it might help scientists recognise life exists in a form that they had not previously expected or understood. Sense of scale: The sensor is just a few hundred microns in length. One micron is equal to 1000 nanometres or the thickness of a red blood cell or a glucose molecule . The sensor could also be used to detect extreme life forms in areas that are hard to measure on Earth, such as volcanoes and the ocean floor, he said. However, it could be years before the sensor is actually tested in space. 'It is rare that anything is ""simple"" in the context of space exploration,' said Ariel Anbar, a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration and the department of chemistry and biochemistry at Arizona State University. Nonetheless, Professor Anbar, who was not involved in the study, described the work as 'refreshing' and a 'fundamentally new idea.' 'Motion-detection on such a scale has never been attempted before as an extraterrestrial life detection approach,' he said. 'If it is as technologically simple to implement as the authors claim, then it could be worth integrating into future mission concepts.' If the world's space agencies find a way to use it, the detector could be used to search for life on the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, or on Mars (pictured), where it might help scientists recognise life exists in a form that they had not previously expected or understood .","Tiny sensor was created by researchers in Switzerland and Belgium .

"She's already been reported to the police for hate crimes against overweight people, but Katie Hopkins is continuing with her verbal assault on the matter. On Tuesday, the controversial TV star was reported by a woman belonging to a 'fat activist' group during filming for her new programme on TLC, in which she gains and loses three stone in six months. But the former Apprentice star isn't backing down. In an interview with The Telegraph today, she has taken another stab at people who are overweight, saying: 'All fat people want is an excuse. But fatties have the one thing disabled people don’t have. They have choice.' There's no stopping her! Katie Hopkins, who in her new show,  went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and back again in six months, has hit out at overweight people again by saying that 'all fat people need is a kick up the a**' She went on to explain that she believes nobody is forcing these people to eat and maintains that she would raise the topic with a morbidly obese person if she saw them parking in a disabled spot. Katie, who added that 'all fat people need is a kick up the a***', is convinced that half of the British population secretly shares her views. On Tuesday, however, Katie was reported to the police when she met up with the group of five women in London who all work independently as plus-size activists or diet bloggers, so that she could hear opposing views on her claims that 'fat people are lazy'. The panel included size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki, burlesque performer Khandie Kisses, blogger 'Big Fat Betty', editor of Slink magazine Rivkie Baum and vlogger Thandi Ejindu, who lost 11 stone in one year. The discussion between Katie and the women quickly heated up and size acceptance campaigner Ms Szrodecki is seen storming out of the room to call the police in the second episode from the series, which is set to air on Saturday. Katie Hopkins has been accused of committing a hate crime against fat people. The TV star was reported to police by plus size campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki (right) during filming for Katie's new documentary. Size acceptance campaigner Kathryn Szrodecki is seen storming out of the room after her clash with Katie . Ms Szrodecki walks outside with her mobile phone and can be seen speaking to the police about Katie. She says: 'Yes, it became personally offensive. And I believe it is a hate crime and I’d like to report it.’ The argument is seen in the second episode of Katie's new show, with the first part airing on Friday night. Over six months, Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit. The journey was all captured on camera for the documentary. Katie caused an uproar last year, when she told an obese woman on This Morning that she wouldn't employ her because fat people give off the impression that they are lazy. But she decided to put her money where her mouth is with her latest project, by gaining and losing 3st to prove that overweight people are unwilling - rather than unable - to lose weight. The weight gain hit Katie's emotions harder than she expected, with the mother-of-three was often reduced to tears over her size, especially when she caught sight of herself in the mirror. She recently told The Sun that she even refused to have sex with her husband Mark Cross after she had gained the first stone, because she felt so unattractive. Katie originally weighed 8st 12lb (right) but ate her way to 11st 13lb (left), then dropped back down again in just a few months to prove how easy it is to lose the flab . Katie Hopkins refused to be intimate with husband Mark Cross, pictured, after she gained a stone in weight . Previously a slim size eight, weighing in at 8st 12lb at 5ft 7in, the 39-year-old gained nearly 3st by gorging on 6,500 calories a day and severely limiting her movement. The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, follows Katie after she's at her peak weight of 11st 13lb, with a 38in waist and a BMI of 26, and then slims down thanks to a strict diet and exercise regime. In the show, we see the usually polished star in her unguarded moments. Make-up free and in a pair of striped pyjamas, Hopkins breaks down over her larger body. After a weight-gain diet that included daily 'snacks' of a litre-and-a-half of Mars milk drink, an entire tub of Pringles, cheese on toast, Dairy Milk and Galaxy chocolate and the inclusion of a second breakfast, Katie then cuts her calories to a mere 1,500. Katie found fame on The Apprentice, left, and also enjoyed a stint in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2007, right . As well as a low fat diet of porridge, salads and lean chicken with a jacket potato, Hopkins upped her daily steps from 1,000 to 20,000 daily and introduced several hour-long runs a week. Following this self-devised plan she managed to drop down to 9st 12lb in just three months, shedding a further 6lb after the documentary ended. Katie kept a video diary during the making of the programme and regularly recorded her  strong views on fat people. One video sees her explaining: 'One of the things about being fat and eating all the time is you find you don't want to go out so much. You feel like you don't really want to go out because you can't fit into the things you would like to wear. 'I'm not sure if that's something many fat people suffer from because I see a lot of fat people out and about. Whether that's out of choice I don't know but I'm surprised that fat people go out at all.' The controversial former reality star has been as active  on Twitter, defending her views on being overweight . Katie first embarked on the weight-gain and weight-loss scheme after becoming sick of hearing excuses thrown around by overweight people for their size. Speaking on ITV's This Morning in September she said: 'One in ten of our children are starting school overweight or obese and one in three children who are 15 or over are overweight or obese. 'People have always said to me, ""You're lucky, you're skinny,"" and I just don't think these excuses are cutting it any more. 'I saw a story the other day about how the curtains in your bedroom not being thick enough could be making you fat. I just thought, we have to put an end to this.' While she now has greater sympathy for people with weight issues, Katie is continuing to be outspoken on the topics, using her Twitter account to make digs at larger people in her neighbourhood. She recently tweeted: 'My local over/under active thyroid self help group meets in KFC.' She also posted: 'I see you all down there with your excuses, but a third of the planet is obese. The first step to slim is NO EXCUSES. Own your problem.' Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, airs Friday and Saturday, 2 and 3 January at 9pm on TLC.","Katie Hopkins was accused of committing a hate crime against fat people .

Soon after his arrival in Manezh Square, Mr Nalvalny, centre, was arrested by police . Mr Nalvalny, centre, escaped a custodial sentence earlier today after being convicted of fraud . Mr Navalny's brother Oleg received a three-and-a-half year jail term for fraud. Following his arrest, Mr Navalny managed to tweet that he 'had not got as far as the square'. He added: 'I call on everyone not to leave until they are forced to. They cannot arrest everyone.' A Russian judge today  convicted one of Vladimir Putin's most charismatic and high profile critics of fraud, but spared him jail, so stopping him from becoming a martyr. Alexei Navalny was handed a three and a half year suspended sentence, but was left with tears in his eyes as his brother Oleg was handcuffed and jailed for the same period. Prosecutors had demanded a lengthy jail term for the popular blogger and lawyer, an anti-corruption campaigner who wants to replace Putin as president. Embezzelment trial: Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, left, was handed a suspended sentence but his brother and co-defendant Oleg, right, was jailed .

Moscow and St Petersburg to protest against corruption in president's government and inner circle. The ruling will come as a relief for Navalny's . supporters after prosecutors asked that he be imprisoned for 10 . years. The trial was widely seen as being political despite an insistence by the Kremlin that it does not interfere in the administration of justice in Russia. Anger: In astonishing courtroom scenes, Navalny, 38, chastised the judge over the jailing of his brother branding the proceedings a 'disgrace' before slamming his fist on the table . Alexei Navalny stands next to a defendants' cage with his brother and co-defendant Oleg inside at the court hearing in Moscow. Prosecutors had asked that he be jailed for 10 years . Nevertheless, it is rare for judges to go against the demands of prosecutors so emphatically. This led to surprise today at Navalny's release, and complaints from pro-Putin elements that a 'thief' had been let off. The Navalny brothers were accused of stealing 30 million roubles, or around $500,000 under the current exchange rate,from two firms, including an affiliate of the French cosmetics company Yves Rocher, between 2008 and 2012. The company involved, Yves Rocher, wrote a complaint to investigators, but its representatives have insisted throughout the trial that there never were any damages. The French executive who wrote the complaint also left Russia shortly afterward and never attended the hearings. The verdict can be seen as taking the wind out of the sails of anti-Putin groups, but the jailing of his brother appeared vindictive.

Defiant: Oleg Navalny makes a 'horns' gesture as he receives a hug from his wife wife Viktoria  at Moscow's Zamoskvoretsky District Court . An unauthorised protest against Oleg Navalny's jailing was expected later today in Moscow. The provocateur group Pussy Riot released a video supporting the protest, featuring women sweeping snow from the square with brooms and then mounting them and flying off as witches. Currently under house arrest, Alexei Navalny is serving another suspended five-year jail term for a separate conviction last year, which his supporters also called a sham. In the 2013 trial he was found guilty of embezzlement and sentenced to prison, but he was released the next day after thousands of people protested in the streets of Moscow.

"Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor Nigel Lawson warned her controversial poll tax would be 'completely unworkable and politically catastrophic', newly-released government files reveal. In 1985 he told the Prime Minister of the 'horrifying' impact of the flat rate of tax, in a memo which has been made public for the first time. However, adviser Oliver Letwin, now David Cameron's policy chief, helped to convince Mrs Thatcher to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax which replaced the old domestic rates based on property values. Mrs Thatcher's Chancellor Nigel Lawson warned the poll tax would be 'completely unworkable and politically catastrophic' In a strongly worded memo, Mr Lawson said: 'A flat-rate poll tax would be politically unsustainable; even with a rebate scheme the package would have an unacceptable impact on certain types of household.' He wrote of the 'horrifying' impact as 'a pensioner couple in Inner London could find themselves paying 22 per cent of their net income in poll tax, whereas a better off couple in the suburbs pay only 1 per cent.' Mr Lawson continued: 'The biggest gainers would be better off households in high rateable value properties; the losers would be poorer households, particularly larger ones. 'We should be forced to give so many exemptions and concessions (inevitably to the benefit of high spending authorities in Inner London) that the flat-rate poll tax would rapidly become a surrogate income tax.' Mrs Thatcher was urged to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues . The introduction of the community charge, as it was officially known, in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales, provoked riots and protests across the country . Even environment minister Kenneth Baker, the scheme's architect, was beginning to have doubts, proposing a watered-down alternative combining the flat-tax levy with elements of a property charge. A study by the Department of the Environment identified 'a number of unpleasant effects', with some 7.5 million households – 44 per cent of the total - set to lose out. The community charge, as it was officially known, was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales. It proved to be a disaster for the Tories, provoking riots and protests across the country and helping to precipitate Mrs Thatcher's final downfall. However, papers released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, show that Mr Letwin helped to convince Mrs Thatcher to use Scotland as a 'trailblazer' for the new tax in the teeth of the opposition of senior colleagues. The introduction of the community charge, as it was officially known, in Scotland in 1989 and the following year in England and Wales, provoked riots and protests across the country and eventually led to Mrs Thatcher's final downfall. Oliver Letwin, who is now David Cameron's policy chief, worked as an adviser in Number 10 in the 1980s and urged Margaret Thatcher to press ahead with the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland . The seeds of the debacle were sown four years earlier in 1985, when she was persuaded by environment ministers Kenneth Baker and William Waldegrave that she could realise her long-held ambition to abolish the old domestic rates - based on property values - through a new, flat-rate tax payable by all adults. In 1985 Mr Letwin told the Prime Minister: 'No one can say that you are being insufficiently radical, since you will be... trying out an extremely radical system in a significant part of the country. 'By the same token, no one can accuse you of being rash, since you will be reserving your options on domestic rates in England and Wales. 'If you are not willing to move to a pure residence charge in England and Wales immediately, you should not introduce a mixture of taxes, but should rather use the Scots as a trailblazer for the real thing.'","Introduction of poll tax sparked riots and protests across the country .

"As third in line to the throne, Prince George will have been inundated with gifts from all over the world this Christmas. But the young royal is proving easy to please - one of his favourite festive presents cost under £10. Pippa Middleton bought her 17-month-old nephew a soft toy police car from Chelsea Toys in London for just £9 and he is said to be delighted with the cuddly item. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton bought a soft toy for £9 from Chelsea Toys in London for Christmas. Prince George is said to be particularly delighted with the gift . The store owner Alka Poole said: ‘She was looking for a small gift because she’d already bought him a massive thing. ‘She just needed something to give him to play with.' The soft toy police car was a top-up to a larger offering Pippa had purchased for her nephew . Although Pippa has yet to be pictured holding the prince, she has been very vocal about her adoration of the royal toddler. She told American programme the Today show in July: 'He's amazing, a very dear boy. 'He has brought a lot of pleasure and fun for all of us, the whole family.' Despite her busy schedule, Pippa pays regular visits to George and her sister The Duchess of Cambridge at their Kensington Palace apartment. The siblings have always been extremely close and Pippa's frequent contact with her nephew shows that the Middleton family are continuing with their attitude to strong family ties with the next generation. She said earlier this year: 'We spend a lot of time together. 'We still do a lot together as a family. 'And I think that's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other, treat each other normally. 'And that's sort of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.' Although Pippa has yet to be pictured holding the prince, she has been very vocal about her adoration of the miniature royal . Although Pippa has more contact with George than most of Kate and William's close friends, she wasn't among the seven people chosen as his godparent. It is thought that the royal couple believed she was struggling to cope with the amount of public attention she has received since the royal wedding and they felt the new role would pile on even more pressure.

"After seven eventful years and 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km), the Dawn spacecraft now has the mysterious world of Ceres in its sights. The unmanned probe is currently 400,000 miles (640,000 km) from the Texas-sized dwarf planet, approaching it at around 450mph (725 km/h). When it arrives at Ceres in March, it will explore the dirt-covered icy world in the hopes of understanding the history of the early solar system. Scroll down for video . After seven eventful years and 2.9 billion miles (4.7 billion km), the Dawn spacecraft now has the mysterious world of Ceres in its sights. This artist's concept shows the Dawn spacecraft heading toward the dwarf planet Ceres. It is due to arrive at the icy, dirt covered world in March if all of its final manoeuvres go to plan . Its arrival will mark the first time that a spacecraft has ever orbited two solar system targets. Dawn previously explored the protoplanet Vesta for 14 months, from 2011 to 2012, capturing detailed images and data about that body. The probe recently emerged from something called 'solar conjunction', in which it was on the opposite side of the sun, limiting communication with Earth. Now that Dawn can reliably communicate with our planet again, mission controllers have programmed the manoeuvres necessary for the next stage of the rendezvous. Ceres is 590 miles (950km) across. In January, scientists discovered that water was gushing from its surface . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. 'Ceres is almost a complete mystery to us,' said Christopher Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission, based at the University of California, Los Angeles. 'Ceres, unlike Vesta, has no meteorites linked to it to help reveal its secrets. All we can predict with confidence is that we will be surprised.' Astronomers believe Ceres may have formed later than Vesta, and with a cooler interior. Current evidence suggests that Vesta only retained a small amount of water because it formed earlier, when radioactive material was more abundant, which would have produced more heat. Ceres, in contrast, has a thick ice mantle and may even have an ocean beneath its icy crust. Ceres, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km), is also the largest body in the asteroid belt, the strip of solar system real estate between Mars and Jupiter. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible . By comparison, Vesta has an average diameter of 326 miles (525km), and is the second most massive body in the belt. The spacecraft uses ion propulsion to traverse space far more efficiently than if it used chemical propulsion. In an ion propulsion engine, an electrical charge is applied to xenon gas, and charged metal grids accelerate the xenon particles out of the thruster. These particles push back on the thruster as they exit, creating a reaction force that propels the spacecraft. Video by Nasa . Ceres (illustrated, far left) is here compared to other minor planets by size. Pluto (pictured, centre) is not that much larger. Eris (far right) is larger than Pluto and found further out, beyond Pluto, in the solar system . Dawn has now completed five years of accumulated thrust time, far more than any other spacecraft. 'Orbiting both Vesta and Ceres would be truly impossible with conventional propulsion,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director at Nasa. 'Thanks to ion propulsion, we're about to make history as the first spaceship ever to orbit two unexplored alien worlds' The next couple of months are set to provide improving views of Ceres, prior to Dawn's arrival. By the end of January, the spacecraft's images and other data will be the best ever taken of the dwarf planet. Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is in the solar system's asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies current classified as a 'dwarf planet' Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter.

"For hundreds of years the Mayans dominated large parts of the Americas until, mysteriously in the 8th and 9th century AD, a large chunk of the Mayan civilisation collapsed. The reason for this collapse has been hotly debated, but now scientists say they might have an answer - an intense drought that lasted a century. Studies of sediments in the Great Blue Hole in Belize suggest a lack of rains caused the disintegration of the Mayan civilisation, and a second dry spell forced them to relocate elsewhere. Research co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides new evidence for the drought theory of the Mayan collapse. The research suggests that a sharp decline of the Mayans around 900 AD was due to a drought - while a second coincided with the fall of Chichén Itzá (shown) in 1000 AD . The theory that a drought led to a decline of the Mayan Classic Period is not entirely new, but the new study co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides fresh evidence for the claims. The Classic Period refers to the time from 300 to 900 AD in Mesoamerica - a region that extends from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala and northern Costa Rica. During this time the Mayans built a number of monuments, on which they recorded dates. In 514 they were building around ten per year, rising to about 40 per year in 750. But following this, the numbers began to decline quickly; by 900, no monuments were being built. Dozens of theories have attempted to explain the Classic Maya Collapse, from epidemic diseases to foreign invasion. This latest theory, though, adds fuel to the idea that climate change was the reason. Previous research has found that periods of high and increasing rainfall coincided with a rise in population and political centres between AD 300 and 660. Professor Douglas Kennett, from Pennsylvania State University, and his research team collected a stalagmite from a cave in Belize, less than one mile (1.6km) from the Maya site of Uxbenka in Belize and about 18 miles (29km) from three other important centers. Using oxygen isotope dating in 0.004-inch (0.1mm) increments along the length of the stalagmite, the scientists uncovered a physical record of rainfall over the past 2,000 years. Combined, the stalagmite and hieroglyphs allowed the researchers to link precipitation to politics. They say a climate reversal and drying trend between 660 and 1000 AD triggered political competition, increased warfare, overall sociopolitical instability, and finally, political collapse - known as the Classic Maya Collapse. This was followed by an extended drought between AD 1020 and 1100 that likely corresponded with crop failures, death, famine, migration and, ultimately, the collapse of the Maya population. The reason for the Classic Maya Collapse in 900 AD has been hotly debated. But the evidence from the Great Blue Hole in Belize (shown) suggests less rain led to famines and civil unrest. Sediements at the bottom of the 407ft (124m) deep hole provide a geological record of the past . Dr Droxler’s research involved drilling cores from sediments in the Great Blue Hole, a vast circular sinkhole off the coast of Belize that is 984 feet (300m) across and 407ft (124m) deep. The hole formed tens of thousands of years ago when sea levels were much lower, being filled as the oceans began to rise. Ongoing sedimentation at the base of the hole allows scientists to study periods from history. When there are storms or extremely wet periods, more sediments are deposited at the bottom of the lagoon. But less rainfall can also be accounted for, in particular due to the ratio of titanium to aluminium in cores taken from the sediment. A lower ratio of titanium to aluminium corresponds to dryer periods. ‘It’s like a big bucket. It’s a sediment trap,’ Dr Droxler told Live Science. The Classic Period refers to the time from 300 to 900 AD in Mesoamerica - a region that extends from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala and northern Costa Rica. Following the drought, the Mayans relocated to parts of the northern Yucatan Peninsula (shown) With his team he found that from 800 to 1000 AD, no more than two tropical cyclones occurred every two decades, when usually there were up to six. This suggests major droughts occurred in these years, possibly leading to famines and unrest among the Mayan people. And they also found that a second drought hit from 1000 to 1100 AD, corresponding to the time that the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá collapsed. The research adds to previous evidence that suggested decreased rainfall coincided with a decline of Mayan culture. And it may help finally solve the mystery of why the Mayans disappeared in parts of Mesoamerica a thousand years ago.","Research co-authored by Dr André Droxler from Rice University in Texas provides new evidence for the drought theory .

"A fifth of Britons would sacrifice a finger to achieve the perfect body shape, a survey says. As many prepare for New Year's fad diets, the research found a fifth of adults have skipped meals to try to lose weight and a quarter admit they struggle to keep up exercise and diet regimens. And our fixation is growing, with the word ‘diet’ mentioned more than 1,200 times in the Press in the first five days of January 2014 - 43 per cent up on 2013 and 66 per cent more than 2012. There's got to be an easier way... A fifth of Britons would cut off their finger for a body like this, a survey says . The national body confidence campaign, Be Real, which commissioned the survey of 2,000 adults, said Britons are 'bombarded' with idealised images of celebrities and models, driving many into depression and despair. It is urging people to avoid fad diets this New Year and focus on living healthier lives instead. Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, chairwoman of Be Real, said: 'People are increasingly obsessed with diets. 'But actually, at the same time as a nation we are getting bigger. It is obviously a fixation that doesn’t work. 'The sad reality is that somebody of any age can become fixated about dieting to achieve the perfect body. 'But young women are likely to be more affected by it and feel greater pressure than other sectors of the population.' Sales of bread are falling faster than those of any other supermarket product, as more and more shoppers move towards low-carbohydrate diets. Supermarket bread sales fell by 8.9 per cent last year, with the traditional staple food increasingly being seen as fuelling weight gain. Yesterday the Mail reported that this same trend for high-protein, low-carb diets has triggered a fall in pasta sales. The typical white-sliced loaf, popular since the Sixties, has also been losing out to more exotic alternatives such as soft flatbread wraps. At the same time, TV shows such as the Great British Bake-Off have encouraged people to make their own. Bread has always had a special appeal to the British, initially as a staple food of the poor, through to the sandwich. Ms Nokes, who is also chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, said a fixation with how we look is also affecting young children. 'It is incredibly sad. The obsession we have with achieving the perfect body is affecting children, not just teenagers but pre-teens,' she said. 'I realise there is a real problem with obesity. But I am far from convinced that fat shaming and demonising people and promoting fad diets is the right way of countering that. 'We need to increase people’s self esteem.' The research found that in many cases attempts to lose weight proved fruitless: a third say they have returned to their previous weight after dieting. Charlotte Dickens, a GP and chairwoman of the campaign’s health committee, said people are risking their health striving for unachievable perfection. She said some university students are getting so depressed because of body confidence issues they do not want to go to lectures. 'Many of my patients are young people at a London university, and we are seeing increasing levels of dissatisfaction about how people look and the importance they place on it,' she said. 'There are eating disorders, but also anxiety and depression which is stopping people going out to lectures because they are unhappy with the way they look. 'It is having a big impact on their ability to live and work and be happy.' Holli Rubin, a psychotherapist specialising in body image, said: 'Dieting and losing weight top the New Year’s resolutions lists every year and the pressure this causes often means we’re setting ourselves up to fail. 'The cycle of dieting is very hard to break and very bad for our general health and well being. ' Be Real is a campaign to change attitudes to body image, and includes schools, businesses and charities. No over-indulgence here! The Only Way Is Essex star Lauren Pope posted this selfie recently.

"Devon is the most popular place in Britain to build a new home, a survey has revealed. Around 7million people in the UK dream of transforming a plot of land into their own customised dream home. In 2014 Devon became the most searched-for county for people looking for the perfect spot to build their own properties, closely followed by the Scottish Highlands and then Kent. Devon is the most popular place to build your own home in the UK, followed by the Scottish Highlands . Southern regions of the UK feature heavily in the list - with Cambridgeshire, Somerset and Avon, Hampshire, Cornwall and Sussex all in the top 10 places budding house builders search for to build their own homes. Aberdeenshire in Scotland and Carmarthenshire in west Wales also appear in the top 10 places as many people search for rural spots to build their dream homes. The relatively unspoiled countryside of Devon may appeal to some home builders, with 18,500 online plot searches done for the county in the last 12 months. Searches also typically peak around January as people look to move home and make a fresh start in the new year. Prices for plots in the UK vary widely across the country, but can start from as little as £6,950. However in Virginia Water in Surrey a 1.5 acre plot can cost £5.2million. Building your own home appeals to many people because it gives them the chance to tailor every inch of their house to their needs.

Ray and Michelle Blundell spent 14 years building their 16th century mock tudor cottage with exposed beams . The property resembles a 16th century cottage complete with exposed beams and medieval carpentry. The couple taught themselves construction and plumbing skills and the house is now worth around £600,000. Researchers said it can take people who wish t build their own homes up to two years to find the perfect plot.

"A promising jockey allegedly caught masturbating on a woman's balcony was in critical condition today after being shot twice by a resident when he assaulted neighbors as he tried to flee. Angel Suarez Medero, 21, is a rising star at Parx Casino's racetrack in Philadelphia, having made millions of dollars from his races. Medero, of Bensalem, was being treated for gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen after the bizarre incident on Sunday night - soon after his girlfriend claimed that he had been drinking a red-colored liquid and acting strangely. Scroll down for video . Angel Suarez Medero, 21, was a rising star on the racetrack in Philadelphia. He was in critical condition with two gunshot wounds after allegedly masturbating on a woman's apartment balcony . Police were alerted on Sunday evening following reports of a man masturbating on the second-floor balcony of an apartment in Bensalem, Philadelphia (pictured) Police were alerted around 8.30pm to a male suspect, naked from the waist down, and allegedly masturbating on the deck of a second floor apartment in Bensalem. 'I was sitting on the couch,' said the woman, who was inside the apartment at the time, later told NBC 10.  'My dogs started freaking out. They went up to the door and I looked up and I could see from my living room that there was a man on my deck.' The resident then said the suspect motioned for her to be quiet as her dogs continued to bark. 'He laid down on the floor, stood back up and then he started masturbating on my deck,' she said. 'I stood there for like ten seconds and I tried to get them to come with me but they wouldn't. Then I got out of there.' The female resident called 911 and fled to a neighboring apartment, police said. The suspect then forcefully broke into the apartment through the sliding glass door. The suspect then allegedly stole the woman's dog, according to police. He jumped out of the second-floor bedroom window and  broke into another near-by apartment that was occupied at the time. Medero was then believed to have assaulted two occupants before being shot twice by one resident during the struggle. The jockey's girlfriend, Kaylia Albright (pictured) reportedly told Medero's agent that he had been drinking a red-colored drink prior to the incident . Lt. William McVey of Bensalem Police told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday that Medero, who weighs 110lbs, was 'combative' and not cooperating with officers even after he was shot. The 21-year-old was taken to Aria Torresdale Hospital where he remains in a critical condition on Tuesday. He was placed in an induced coma and has undergone surgery - and faces further operations - to repair damage to his liver and pancreas. He will be charged with burglary, assault and related offenses, once his condition improves. Resident Evan Greathouse told Philly.com that both of his dogs attacked Suarez, but one of them named Ollie (pictured) has not been seen since . Toxicology reports were being conducted but the results would not be released, Lt McVey told Daily Mail Online. The jockey's agent, Dave Yannuzzi, said on Tuesday that Medero lives with his girlfriend. Kaylia Albright is also a jockey at Penn National Race Course. The couple are believed to live in the same apartment complex where the break-ins took place. Mr Yannuzzi, who has been Medero's agent for four months, told Daily Mail Online that the 21-year-old was 'extremely talented... he's a very nice kid, very gentle and kind-hearted.' He added: 'What happened was absolutely out of character. [Angel] is good to people, good to animals. 'You could have knocked me over with a feather when I found out.' Mr Yannuzzi said that the jockey was being held under police guard and that Medero's mother had not been allowed in to see him. According to Philly.com, Medero's girlfriend reportedly said that he was acting strangely before the incident and was drinking a red-colored liquid. The agent and others suggested that Suarez could have been on a substance such as bath salts or PCP at the time of the incident. Mr Yannuzzi told Daily Mail Online: 'I don't know for a fact if he smoked something or drank something.' The agent said he was unaware of his jockey ever having been in trouble with police in the past, other than traffic tickets. Resident Evan Greathouse told Philly.com that both of his dogs attacked Suarez, but one of them named Ollie, a long-haired dachshund, has not been seen since. The dog is still missing, police said on Tuesday. The apartment resident who shot the suspect is cooperating with police and his firearm was legally owned and registered. The incident was being investigated by the Bucks County District Attorney's Office. Paulick Report said that when Medero was 19 years old, he 'was a finalist for the Eclipse Awards’ Outstanding Apprentice Jockey, having won 142 of his 837 mounts for earnings of $3,366,126. 'This year, Suarez has 58 wins from 539 starts for earnings of $1,446,953.'","Angel Suarez Medero, 21, was shot twice after assaulting residents in Bensalem, Philadelphia on Sunday .

"Red meat may be linked with cancer because it contains a chemical that is unnatural to the human body, scientists say. Previous studies have linked red-meat consumption to a number of cancers, especially colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian and lung cancers. Now, U.S. researchers believe the culprit is a sugar molecule called Neu5Gc, found in beef, pork and lamb. When eaten, the body sees it as a foreign substance - and the immune system attacks it. This leads to inflammation in the body, which over time is known to promote the formation of tumours. Scroll down for video . Red meat is linked with cancer due to a sugar molecule called NeuG5c. This is unnatural to the human body, and so the immune system attacks it. This leads to inflammation, which over time causes tumours to form . The same process could happen when people drink whole milk, certain cheeses and fish eggs, which all contain Neu5Gc, the researchers warned. As Neu5Gc naturally occurs in most mammals but not humans, this also explains why humans are more at risk cancer while other carnivores are not. The research is significant as it diverges from the previously held theory about red meat and cancer. Previously it was believed there was an association between red meat and cancer because of the carcinogenic chemicals linked to grilling. But grilling fish and chicken generates the same carcinogenic molecules as grilling red meat and yet they are not associated with a risk of cancer. Scientists said the fact that they have very little or no Neu5Gc could now explain why. Dr Ajit Varki, from the University of California San Diego, who led the study, said the Neu5Gc phenomenon is unprecedented. He said: 'In this case, the foreign sugar is like a Trojan Horse. It becomes part of your own cells.' 'When you react to a peanut or other allergy-causing substance, you're reacting to something foreign. The sugar molecule Neu5Gc is found in red meat such as pork, beef and lamb. It is not found naturally in humans, but it is in most other mammals. Because of this, it is unnatural to the human body. When humans eat meat, the molecule pervades tissues. The immune system attacks it, causing inflammation. Over time inflammation has been shown to cause tumours to form. Previous studies have linked red-meat consumption to a number of cancers, especially colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian and lung cancers. 'This is the first example we know of something that's foreign, gets totally incorporated into you despite the fact that your immune system recognises it.' However, Dr Varki said Neu5Gc plays the role of 'gasoline on the fire'. That is, it boosts the cancer risk, but doesn't seem to be the ultimate cause of the disease. As part of the study, Dr Varki and his colleagues fed Neu5GC to two groups of mice. One group naturally had Neu5Gc and another was genetically engineered to no longer have the molecule, mimicking human biology. The specially engineered mice showed a cancer rate that was more than five times that of the other rodent group. They were not exposed to carcinogens, further implicating Neu5Gc as a key link between red meat and cancer. Dr Varki added: 'Until now, all of our evidence linking Neu5Gc to cancer was circumstantial or indirectly predicted from somewhat artificial experimental setups. 'This is the first time we have directly shown that mimicking the exact situation in humans - feeding non-human Neu5Gc and inducing anti-Neu5Gc antibodies - increases spontaneous cancers in mice. 'The final proof in humans will be much harder to come by. 'But on a more general note, this work may also help explain potential connections of red meat consumption to other diseases exacerbated by chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes.' He does not advise cutting red meat out of the diet, however. It comes after the World Cancer Research Fund advised eating no more than 500g of red meat per week – the equivalent of five or six medium portions of roast beef, lamb or pork. They also advise eating processed meats like bacon, ham and salami as little as possible . Dr Varki continued: 'Of course, moderate amounts of red meat can be a source of good nutrition for young people. 'We hope that our work will eventually lead the way to practical solutions for this catch-22.' In fact, selective breeding could allow farmers to reduce the amount of NEu5Gc in meat, and it may be possible to develop an antidote to counteract the cancer risk. The study was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It comes after the World Cancer Research Fund advised eating no more than 500g of red meat per week – the equivalent of five or six medium portions of roast beef, lamb or pork. It also advised eating processed meats like ham, bacon and salami as little as possible. 'Convincing evidence' that both types of meat increase the risk of bowel cancer - as well as other cancers - means people should seriously think about cutting down, it recommended.","Red meat is linked to cancer because of a sugar molecule called Neu5Gc .

"Shoppers have been warned to avoid fake Frozen dolls after two were found with dangerously high levels of chemicals linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility in men. The two singing dolls seized in Walsall, West Midlands, were made in China and have excessive levels of phthalates - which help soften plastic but could be carcinogenic in high quantities. A stallholder who sold the hit film souvenirs is now helping officers trace the supply chain, though they admit they do not yet know how widepread the problem could be. Let them go! These fake Frozen dolls found in Walsall, West Midlands, have excessive levels of phthalates - chemicals which are used to soften plastic but which have been linked to cancer, birth defects and infertility . The Anna, Elsa and Olaf the snowman toys look almost exactly like their real counterparts, but do not have a Disney logo or a manufacturers' address on the box. They were being sold on market stalls and over Facebook, and were confirmed as fakes by Disney, Walsall Council said. Labour councillor Khizar Hussain, cabinet member for community, leisure and culture, said: 'It is pretty much impossible to tell these dolls are counterfeit, just by looking at them. 'But they are potentially very dangerous and I would urge anyone who thinks they may have one to keep them away from children and to get in touch with trading standards for advice.' Scientists dispute exactly how harmful to human health phthalates might be, but previous studies have drawn possible links with cancer, birth defects and male infertility. The chemicals were banned by the EU in 1999 for use in any toys which are designed to be put in the mouths of children under the age of three. Indistinguishable: The toys found in Walsall, including these Olaf the snowman (left) and Princess Anna (right) figurines, look like the real thing but do not have a Disney logo of manufacturer's address . The European Commission warned at the time that putting phthalates in a toddler's mouth could pose a 'serious risk to child health'. It advised that other affected toys not intended to be put in children's mouths would have to carry a warning label. Apart from the part-animated Avatar, Frozen is the most popular animated film ever made and the fifth-highest-grossing film in box office history - with eye-watering takings of £723million. It tells the story of princess sisters Elsa and Anna, who fall out over Elsa's cryokinetic magical powers. Although the seized items did not include an Elsa doll, officers said the dolls featured both sisters singing the Oscar-winning song Let It Go and cost around £35, a similar price to the real thing. Frozen's Snow Glow Elsa was the most in-demand toy in the Christmas rush and many retailers sold out of their entire stock. The warning is the latest of several about fake Frozen dolls made in the Far East. Smash hit: Frozen has become the most successful animated children's film in box office history . In November 426 fake Frozen dolls destined for the UK were part of a haul of almost 2,000 toys seized by border police from a cargo ship arriving from China. Other local authorities later issued warnings about dangerous toys flooding the black market which could be harmful to children. These included fake snap bracelets which could slice children's wrists because they were made from metal measuring tape. One of the largest hauls of fake Frozen goods, in Nottingham, included hundreds of items of clothing and dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets. None had been subjected to legally required safety tests and trading standards officers warned the clothes could lack fireproofing or pose a strangulation risk. Gavin Terry, joint lead officer for intellectual property at the Trading Standards Institute, said: 'Counterfeit goods may seem like a bargain but they can be truly dangerous. 'Often untested, poorly made and untraceable, counterfeit Frozen toys could be poisonous, pose a choking hazard or be made of highly flammable material. 'Some seized counterfeit Frozen toys have had a stylised logo designed to appear similar to, or pass off as, a Disney-branded product. 'Shoppers should look closely at the product to make sure it is legitimate.'","Two dolls seized by Trading Standards officers in Walsall, West Midlands .

"Five Guantanamo Bay inmates who were held without charge for more than a decade have been released and sent to Kazakhstan. The men were all captured in Pakistan in the aftermath of 9/11 and accused of links to terror groups including Al-Qaeda, but ended up in legal limbo even after they were cleared to be freed. One has a chronic heart condition and had a mechanical heart valve fitted in 1999, while another insisted he was just a chef who moved to Pakistan to find a wife. Freedom: Adel Al-Hakeemy (above) is one of five Guantanamo detainees who have been flown to Kazakhstan . Released: Among the five are Adel Al-Hakeemy (left), who campaigners said was a chef who was trying to find a better life when he was kidnapped in the aftermath of 9/11, and Sabri Mohammad al Qurashi (right) Two of the men were from Tunisia and were identified as 45-year-old Adel Al-Hakeemy, and Abdallah Bin Ali al Lufti, who military records show is about 49. The other three, from Yemen, were named as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, who is about 46, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, who is about 36, and Sabri Mohammad al Qurashi, about 44. Lufti was . detained in Pakistan and held at Guantanamo for nearly 12 years, . according to a database of government documents compiled by the . New York Times and National Public Radio. He was accused of links to Tunisian militants when he lived . in Italy in the 1990s, but he denied this. He has heart problems . that led authorities to recommend his transfer as early as 2004, according to government documents handed to Wikileaks. Release: Five Guantanamo Bay inmates who were held without charge for more than a decade have been released and sent to Kazakhstan. Pictured, protesters outside the White House earlier this year . He had a mechanical heart valve fitted in 1999 and was on a cocktail of medication including blood thinners. He also had a history of kidney stones and depression, according to the files. Another of the suspects, Hakeemy, has been the subject of a lengthy campaign by the London-based charity Reprieve, which gave him legal representation. He had been described by U.S. authorities as a 'veteran terrorist' who had allegedly taken part in fighting in Bosnia and was accused of links with an Algerian Islamist group. But the charity said he was just a chef who was trying to find a better life. The charity said he lived in Afghanistan with his pregnant wife until they fled the U.S. invasion in 2001. He was then kidnapped by Pakistani forces, handed over to the Americans and tortured. 'Adel has been held without charge in Guantánamo since 2002, despite being cleared for release,' a spokesman said. 'His daughter Hind was born after he was abducted, and he has never seen her.' The charity said he was born in Tunisia and has four brothers and five sisters. He migrated to Italy in 1985 to work as a chef but moved to Pakistan in the hope of finding a wife who shared his Muslim faith. His attorney Cori Crider said today: ' All Adel wants now is to regain his health, see his daughter, and start his life again. 'We are very encouraged by this wave of releases at the end of 2014, and hope we see more of the dozens of cleared men left in Guantánamo rejoin their families early next year.' One of the Yemenis, Khalaqi, 46, had been implicated by John . Walker Lindh, an American captured in late 2001 working with the . Taliban, as having fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan, . according to the documents. But Khalaqi denied any involvement. The U.S. has sent hundreds of prisoners from Guantanamo to third countries, but this is the first time Kazakhstan has accepted any for resettlement. A on oil-rich majority Muslim country with ties to Russia, it has nevertheless been the subject of several diplomatic negotiations with the U.S. Controversial: Some 28 prisoners have been released from Guantanamo this year, and 127 remain . Their release brings the prison population at Guantanamo to 127, according to a Pentagon statement, and the total number of releases in 2014 to 28. All five men were detained on suspicion of links to al Qaeda or allied groups, but the U.S. official said investigations had determined they 'could be described as low-level, if even that.' The government did not say why they could not be sent home, or why exactly Kazakhstan was chosen as their destination. Officials have been unwilling to send Yemenis to their country because of unrest and militant activity there, while in the past some Tunisians have feared persecution. Kazakhstan's acceptance of the five followed extensive negotiations, officials said. Other countries that have accepted Guantanamo detainees forresettlement this year include Uruguay, Georgia and Slovakia. The transfer of the five men followed a recent pledge by . President Barack Obama for a stepped-up push to shut the . internationally condemned base. More than half of the remaining Guantanamo detainees are . from Yemen, but Washington is unable to send them home because . of the chaotic security situation there. The five former inmates, who were flown on a U.S. military aircraft, arrived in Kazakhstan on Tuesday at 11:15 pm Washington time (4.15am GMT), officials said.","All five were captured in Pakistan and are now in their late 30s and 40s .

"The tragic death of Jay Muscat who was killed by a great white shark on Monday has again stirred up debate on whether sharks should be culled to help prevent this from happening again or if people should be more aware of the facts before swimming in the sea. Mr Muscat was killed in an area very common for sharks at this time of year. A great white was spotted circling just off these waters a few weeks previously. Western Australia’s Department of Fisheries put capture gear and drum lines around Cheynes Beach on Tuesday. But shark expert and environmentalist Andrew Fox believed that they were treating the symptom not the cause. Scroll down for video . The culling of sharks off Australia's coast is one way of dealing with the problem, but environmentalists say that it's people's mindsets that have to change . ‘People need to be better informed about sharks. In every situation where there has been a shark attack in recent times it’s been when there’s been increased numbers and sightings of sharks,’ Fox explained. ‘There should be a better network of information where people know the activity of sharks in the area and make an informed decision on whether they should go into the sea or not.’ Mr Muscat was spearfishing when he was attacked at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany. The 17-year-old was mauled by the shark and his friend Matt Pullella only escaped death by putting the spear gun into the shark’s mouth and firing the trigger. The dangers are apparent, but Fox explained that because the seal and whale population was increasing there’ll naturally be a redistribution and increase of great white sharks coming inshore to feed. ‘To kill a shark that has attacked somebody is ludicrous. It’s only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with,’ he said. Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast, around 70km east of Albany, is where Monday's shark attack took place . A Western Australia Department of Fisheries boat is deployed at Cheynes Beach to kill the shark . Shark expert Andrew Fox argues killing sharks is pointless as the shark is 'only responding to a natural stimulus that it has evolved with' Jeff Hansen managing director of Sea Shepherd Australia said one of his organisation's vessels Bruce The Rib would be going to Cheynes Beach to monitor what was happening . A key factor in recent attacks has been that victims have been spear fishing when they’ve been attacked. It’s a hobby that has cost some young people their lives. Mr Muscat is the second teen to be killed while spear fishing this month, following the death of 18-year-old Daniel Smith, at Port Douglas in far north Queensland. ‘When the fish is speared it begins to bleed and struggle. The vibration the fish makes in the water combined with the smell attracts the shark. It does make the chances of an attack even more likely,’ Fox said. ‘Again, information should be available so people can decide whether they should go out spear fishing in certain areas. You just need to be made aware.’ Western Australia’s Department of Fisheries reaction to Monday’s shark attack was to deploy capture gear and drum lines around Cheynes Beach on Tuesday in an attempt to catch the shark. Sea Shepherd vessel Bruce The Rib and its crew were headed from Perth to Albany today to keep eye on what the Western Australian Department of Fisheries were up to at Cheynes Beach . Rick Fletcher, a Department of Fisheries spokesman said that if any shark of a comparable size – a four to five-metre-long great white – was caught it would be killed. 'At this stage it's highly likely that if we capture the shark that's likely to have been involved in the incident it will be destroyed,' he said. Earlier this year the Western Australia government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks. The policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed. The Environmental Protection Agency sunk the policy in a ruling earlier this year. However, the government is still able to use drum lines if they are threat to beach-goers, Mr Barnett was quoted saying in September. On Tuesday environmental group Sea Shepherd said they were also sending one of their members Mike Dicks with his boat Bruce The Rib to Cheynes Beach to herd any sharks away from the drum lines and if the Fisheries do kill something to document it in full. ‘Killing sharks won’t make a difference. There were sharks spotted in the area days before this incident occurred, so once again that information is not being sent throughout the community,’ Jeff Hansen managing director of Sea Shepherd Australia said. A Western Australia Department of Fisheries boat is reversed into the water on Tuesday before going on patrol around Cheynes Beach . Earlier this year the Western Australia government trialled using baited drum lines to cull sharks. The policy was hugely controversial and resulted in 170 sharks being killed . ‘At certain times of the year there should be signage at beaches saying that great whites or tiger sharks have been seen in the area – to enter the water at your own risk. Beach patrols should be carried out regularly too.’ Mr Hansen said that the Western Australia government once did a survey on the issue and results showed that 80 per cent of the people were against the killing of sharks. ‘Mitigating the risk of entering the marine environment is up to the individual not the government,’ Hansen said. ‘So who is the government doing this on the behalf of? They keep going on about a silent majority but their own survey shows that this silent majority doesn’t exist.’ Mr Hansen said that a Western Australia government survey showed that 80 per cent were against the killing of sharks . Australia has witnessed a number of shark attacks this year, some fatal. In September, British expat Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed in a shark attack in Byron Bay, at the eastern-most point of New South Wales. While Sean Pollard, 23, from Bunbury, WA, lost an arm and both hands when he came under attack by a great white in October.","Jay Musca, 17, was spearfishing when he was attacked and killed by a shark at Cheynes Beach on the West Australian coast .

"Embattled Network Rail boss Mark Carne today announced he will not take his bonus after late-running Christmas track works caused chaos at the weekend. He had been on on track for a £135,000 boost on top of his £675,000 Network Rail salary, despite missing a series of performance targets. The decision to forgo the cash came less than 24 hours after he laughed at the idea that he would not take the money and was accused of trying to 'wriggle' out of answering questions about it. Network Rail boss Mark Carne today announced he would not take his £135,000 bonus . Mr Carne appeared at Reading station today, after refusing to cut short his holiday in Cornwall to take charge to the fiasco. But he admitted driving to London from the West Country, instead of taking the train. During an excruciating radio interview yesterday, Mr Carne refused five times to say whether he would take his bonus. In an apparent u-turn today, he revealed he would now not take the cash. He told Sky News: 'I've decided that I'm accountable for the performance of the railway and in my view the performance over the Christmas and New Year period was not acceptable and I've decided that I should not take the bonus for this year. 'I took this job on ten months ago knowing that the railway faced enormous challenges and I think I've seen over the last few months that those challenges are very real – not just in terms of the reliability of the service, but in terms of the major engineering works that are required to keep the railways safe. 'And that's what I'm really focused on and I'm convinced that we've got the plans and people now in the railway to deliver the improvements.' Mr Carne had remained on holiday at this smart property in Cornwall instead of returning to London . Rail boss Mark Carne last night returned to take charge of the railways - by car. The Network Rail chief executive had refused to cut short his break at his holiday home in Falmouth, Cornwall, where he is said to enjoy gardening, canoeing and sailing. Today he insisted he had been in 'full contact' by phone and email with staff, but admitted: 'I totally agree it would have been better if I had been there on the day, but I wasn’t. That’s life.' And he revealed that he did not let the train take the strain for his holiday, telling Sky News: 'I drove back last night with three kids and two dogs; it was an easier way to make it.' There was chaos at King's Cross station on Saturday when track maintenance works over-ran. Passengers on the delayed services complained of sardine can conditions and of being forced to stand all the way to Scotland. There were extraordinary scenes at the station on Sunday when men with flags were used to keep trains running after a signal failure. The continuing shambles, which has also engulfed the capital's Paddington and Finsbury Park stations, led to fresh calls from MPs for heads to roll at Network Rail. The infrastructure firm, which taxpayers fund with £5billion a year, was already under fire for announcing 'rip-off' new year fare rises. Yesterday there were also hold-ups due to signalling problems between Bedford and Bletchley and between Selhurst, Norwood Junction and West Croydon in south London. Emergency engineering works between Clapham Junction and Earlsfield also meant disruption to a number of services in and out of London's Waterloo station. One of the major engineering projects over Christmas involved the part-closure of the West Coast Main Line between Euston station in London and Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire. The line opened on time yesterday but by mid-morning passengers were enduring delays of up to 40 minutes due to a signalling problem at Wembley Central in north west London. Passengers were left in tears in some cases with hundreds of journeys ruined by the overrunning works. The disruption caused chaos at King's Cross, Paddington and at Finsbury Park where there was overcrowding . Yesterday Mr Carne appeared on BBC Radio 4 down the line from Cornwall, from where he had refused to cut short his holiday to take charge of the chaos. He was accused by presenter Ed Stourton of trying to 'wriggle' out of answering the question about whether he plans to take the pay-out, to the fury of thousands of festive passengers who faced misery on the railways at the weekend. In the excruciating encounter, Mr Carne refused to speak for four-seconds, leaving the presenter to ask if he was still on the line, before he snapped back: 'I am still here and I'm just waiting to talk about the railway.' Labour today called on the government to take responsibility for the crisis on the railways. Shadow transport secretart Michael Dugher said: 'To be frank, in recent days Ministers have done their utmost to shift the blame on to others. 'But this happened on the Government's watch and it seems nothing was done to intervene when issues were brought to your attention in the weeks beforehand. It appears that ministers were asleep on the job,' he said in a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. 'Passengers deserve better than the terrible service they have suffered recently. As the crisis wore on last weekend and you were forced to finally issue a statement, you said lessons must be learnt and responsibility taken for mistakes. I hope you will agree that this should also apply to ministers.' BBC Radio 4 presenter Edward Stourton took Mark Carne to task in an interview yesterday, when he refused five times to say whether he would take the bonus . Edward Stourton: Why don't we clear up the question of whether or not you'll take this bonus . Mark Carne: Well Ed as you well know when I took this job on actually the bonus potential of this role was 160 per cent of my salary. One of the first things that I did in this job was to reduce this bonuses potential to only 20 per cent of the salary. ES: Which is £135,000 as I said. MC: It's a maximum of £135,000. The other thing that we have done is to make public what our performance is in every quarter so people can see how we are doing. As you probably know this year our performance has failed to live up to the expectations that the public would have had. ES: Catastrophically so in the judgement I suspect of those that went through the Christmas chaos. So, easy question: will you or won't you take it, whatever it is at the end of the year? MC: First of all I want to apologise unreservedly to… . ES: That's taken as read, will you or will you not take your bonus? MC: Ha ha, Ed, the bonus at the moment, the maximum bonus that I would be likely to get would be about 5 per cent of my salary… . ES: Which is what? MC: …which will be a matter for the remuneration committee to consider at the appropriate time. ES: Forgive me, you earn £675,000 a year. If you are just talking about what 30-something thousands pounds… why not just say I'm not going to take it and get rid of that issue once and for all. MC: I think by reducing the bonus from 160 per cent to 20 per cent we've made some significant steps to hopefully diffuse the issue of bonuses. I think we have got far more important things to talk about. ES: I can almost feel their collective temperature rising as they listen to you wriggle in the way that you are doing about the very basic question of whether you think you are worth this extra money in light of what they have been through… . [FOUR SECONDS OF SILENCE] . ES: Are you still there? MC: I am still here and I'm just waiting to talk about the railway. We really have had a very difficult time over the Christmas period, the most intensive engineering safety and mamaintenance works programme ever in the history of the railway, over £200million worth of work that we have been trying to do, over 300 projects across the network.

A mother-of-one has told of how a huge shark 'stalked' her family at Cheynes Beach, only days before 17-year-old Jay Muscat was killed while spearfishing in the water. Rhianna Hook, from Mount Barker near the south coast of Western Australia, said she was forced to pluck the four children she was with out of the ocean, including her two year old daughter Tali, upon seeing the grey shape at the beach, which is 60 kilometres east of Albany, on Boxing Day. 'We thought we'd let the kids have a play in the ocean and then one of the boys with us who was fishing, said there was something there, so we all jumped out,' Mrs Hook said. 'We saw all this thrashing around in front of us and we thought it might be a dolphin and didn't think anything of it, but then one of the boys said ""that's a shark"" and that's when we realised. 'You could tell by the way the tail was moving – dolphins' tails go up and down and sharks go side to side. It was also very big; well over two metres long and it looked a bit menacing.' The 33-year-old spent the day fishing and swimming with her family at the West Australian beach, 60 kilometres east of Albany, when she saw the huge figure less than 100 metres from the shore line . The sighting came only three days before the death of 17-year-old Jay Muscat, who was spearfishing when he was attacked by a shark at the remote beach . The 33-year-old school teacher told Daily Mail Australia that the shape was less than 100 metres off the shore of the shallow beach. It came only three days before Jay Muscat, 17, died at the beach while spearfishing with his friend Matt Pullella, who shot his spear gun into the mouth of the shark to save his own life after it had mauled his friend. Western Australia's Department of Fisheries confirmed on Tuesday that capture gear and baited drum lines were deployed in the area in an attempt to catch the shark, which was likely to be a four to five-metre-long great white. The Beach remained closed on Tuesday and the department urged locals and holiday makers to stay out of the water. Mrs Hook took to social media after her sighting, to share a picture of the shark, writing that it 'stalked our family up and down the beach'. Tali fishing with her dad at the beach, which has now been closed after the Department of Fisheries deployed capture gear and baited drum lines in an attempt to catch the shark that attacked Mr Muscat . Mrs Hook admitted she felt guilty after not reporting the sighting to the Department of Fisheries, later adding that she knew the shop that Mr Muscat's family owned . 'We think it was trying to chase some food,' she said. 'It swam up the channel, up the beach, then turned around and came back again and once it got back it stayed in front of us for a while, then it went into a patch of weed and disappeared.' 'We had my nine-year-old niece, a five-year-old niece, a four-year-old and my two and a half year old with us and we just went 'no way, you guys can stay in the creek'.' Despite the frightening incident occurring at the location that Mrs Hook and her family choose to visit over Easter and on Boxing Day each year, the mother admitted she felt guilty after not reporting the sighting to the Department of Fisheries. Remote: Cheynes Beach is home to a caravan park, is surrounded by bushland and is often the subject of day trips for families at this time of year . 'We saw all this splashing around in front of us... You could tell by the way the tail was moving – dolphins' tails go up and down and sharks go side to side. It was also very big; well over two metres long and it looked a bit menacing,' Mrs Hook said of her shark sighting . 'We visit every so often but I wouldn't have had a clue who to report it to,' she said. 'We've seen dolphins and whales there before and my husband saw wobbegong sharks when he was younger – bit closer to the actual beach, but I've never seen anything close to a shark in the water there before, so when we saw it we were all thinking it was amazing without thinking anything about it. 'Having the tragedy happen has made us all kind of think, well maybe we should have reported it.' 'They [Mr Muscat's family] are from a small town close to Albany where we do our shopping – we know the shop that his family owned and I work at a school and know kids who know him. 'It's a hugely awful tragedy, gut wrenching for everyone,' she added.","Rhianna Hook spent Boxing Day on Cheynes Beach with her husband, her two-year-old daughter and three other young nieces .

"She's a magician by day and a princess by night. From her sparkling ball gowns, glittering shoes and tiaras to high top hats, playing cards and wands – the royal Aussie princess and self-taught magician is living in a real life fairy tale. It’s a lifestyle that Rita Barbagallo, from Blakehurst in southern Sydney, has been embracing for more than 20 years. After suffering a life-threatening illness in her teens, the 47-year-old was determined to live her life to the full. Scroll down for video . Meet Rita Barbagallo - When she isn't living the princess lifestyle, the 47-year-old visits hospitals to entertain the sick children and put a smile back on their faces . She works as a magical children’s entertainer Barbee Barb across the globe, pulling magic tricks from everyone’s sleeves at kids's parties and putting a smile on sick children’s faces in hospitals. 'Life's too short,' she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I visit a lot of hospitals to entertain sick kids and put a smile to their little faces – it makes my day. ‘I remember going through some tough times. I had a life-threatening illness during my teens and early 20’s. That’s when I decided if I ever get out of this bed, I’ve got to help other people. ‘A promise is a promise and you can’t go back on a promise once you get better. It made me realise how lucky we are and I've been fortunate to have those little luxuries in my life.' Barbagallo said she had a fairytale ceremony and designed her own dress - measured at 8.2 metres long . Rita and husband Salvatore celebrated their 25th anniversary in Thailand by renewing their marriage vows . Inside her three-tier waterfront palace in Sydney, Barbagallo lives with her prince charming husband Salvatore, 57, who works as a real estate financier, and assists her shows when he's not working. The couple recently returned home from Thailand after celebrating their 25th anniversary by renewing their marriage vows. ‘We had a fairytale ceremony in Phuket,’ she said. ‘I designed my own dress and it measured 8.2 metres – number eight because it means infinity and doesn’t have an end and it’s always been my favourite number - and two for the two of us. ‘It was worth $35,000 and the lace alone cost $2,500 per metre but we’re looking at putting it up for auction and donating the money to charity.' She has worked as a kid's entertainer for more than 24 years. Pictured at St George Hospital - Children's ward . Barbagallo has travelled across the globe to perform her magic tricks for sick children and kids parties . Barbagallo (pictured) teaching other children's entertainers at a conference in Melbourne 2014 . In her spare time, Barbagallo goes through her closet to donate all her unwanted clothing and accessories to churches and the less fortunate families. 'When I travel overseas, I always pack two luggage - one to give away and one for my holiday. I like to share my nice things to others, especially those who can't afford clothes. 'At my last clean-out, I counted 40 wedding dresses, 200 ball gowns, 500 pairs of shoes and 100 handbags. There's a lot of things that are just sitting on my shelves. 'I've always looked after all my things but I've given most away because I know someone else might like them.' The self-confessed princess said she has been embracing her lifestyle choices for more than 20 years . Barbagallo has travelled to over 60 countries - She added a special needs school in Phuket recently . She said she dedicates at least one full day helping children in need and doing charity work . And like the royal Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Aussie couple has worked with several charities and are set to launch their very own foundation called Barbee Barb. ‘I’ve travelled to over 60 countries and every time I travel, I make sure I dedicate at least one full day doing charity work. Our ceremony was close to Mother’s Day over in Thailand – so we donated all our flowers from our ceremony to a nursing home and an autistic school,’ she said. ‘We had 100,000 flowers at our ceremony and we used it all to decorate their foyers and make it nice and beautiful for their loved ones to visit – it was lovely. ‘On top of that, we had a wishing well and proceeds was spent on nappies, shampoo, toothpastes and brushes for the elderly. There are so many people who don’t have the simple things in life so we just got to give back. ‘And we will continue to help kids and adults when we launch our new foundation soon – pay for children's medical procedures, wheel chairs and meals for the elderly - things like that.' The couple have never had children of their own but they live with their pomeranian named Brandi and a cat called Cleopatra. 'We've never had any kids but we've got each other. I love kids but our life is complete and we can do our own little things to help others in need,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Barbagallo grew up on a Central Coast farm in Mangrove Mountain with her six sisters and one brother in a close knit home. 'I grew up on a farm and worked each day - driving tractors and trucks - it was tough work but our family lifestyle was just perfect. 'I'm a country girl at heart and mum used to call me her little princess.' Barbagallo and her husband own two precious pets - pomeranian Brandi and their cat Cleopatra . Rita Barbagallo loves to dress up her beloved pomeranian  named Brandi in cute little dresses . As she lives her glamorous lifestyle, Barbagallo laughs and says most people in her area know her as the 'Barbie' lady. 'They don't know my name but I'm always dressed in bright colours and I drive a Barbie-mobile but  it doesn't bother me when people give me strange looks,' she said. 'My husband has always supported me and he lets me be me. He gets me and he will never try to change who I am. Sal knew who I was before he married me. 'In fact, he has started to wear some bling and his clothing are getting a little bit out there. I don't think I could imagine him wearing the stuff now when we first met but I'm happy because we're both comfortable in our own skins.' While she continues to entertain children and run her own magic workshops across the globe, Barbagallo said she won't be retiring any time soon. ‘I’d be an old duck before I give up,' she laughed. 'As long as my ears can still hear and my eyes can still see – I'll continue to make kids laugh and smile for as long as I can.'","Rita Barbagallo, from Sydney, is a magician and children's entertainer .

"Police have released grainy CCTV footage of a man they believe could be linked to 45 burglaries in the past five months. Officers in Sussex fear a gang is targeting elderly, vulnerable residents by 'cold-calling', then returning when they have left the house - in some cases after they were taken to care homes. Some of the victims were unable to remember what was stolen, while others lost sentimental items including several wedding rings, bracelets, brooches and pendants. Scroll down for video . Suspect: This man could be linked to as many as 45 burglaries in Sussex over the past five months . Grainy: The footage shows the man forcing open the back doors of one of the victims' homes in August . The newly-released CCTV footage shows a man sneaking into the back garden of a house in Steyning, West Sussex. He peers through the glass back doors before pulling them open forcefully and charging into the house. The burglary, which took place in August and was one of the first allegedly orchestrated by the gang, set a similar model for more than 40 others, police said. In each of the 45 burglaries, thieves entered houses through a back door or window then escaped with jewellery or antique items with a total value of tens of thousands of pounds. Possessions stolen included a platinum wedding ring, a Russian wedding ring with three bands of different golds and several other wedding rings. Haul: Taken in the raids were a gold watch, several wedding rings, candlesticks and Royal Doulton figurines . Also taken in the raids were Royal Doulton figurines, a gold watch, silver drink trays, an emerald pendant, a silver brooch, two Art Nouveau solid silver candlesticks and various chains, bracelets and necklaces. Victims include homeowners who have gone on holiday and elderly residents whose homes have been targeted within days of them moving into care homes. Officers are investigating whether the offenders are cold-calling homes first to work out who is in and whether they have valuables inside. Police now want to identify a man they believe is a suspect seen in the CCTV. The burglaries have mainly focused on the Horsham, Wealden and Lewes districts. Prize: One of the items taken was this ornamental plate. Some victims could not remember what was stolen . Towns and villages  struck include Coolham, Henfield, Steyning, Horsham, Pulborough, Bramber, Billingshurst, Kirdford, West Chiltington, Ashurst and Petworth. Katy Wood, from Sussex's Police's Operation Magpie team leading the investigation, said: 'We urgently need the public’s help to identify who is responsible. 'Don’t let cold callers into your home and please report anyone acting suspiciously in your home or nearby to us immediately. 'Please consider fitting an alarm if you don’t have one, fit timers to your lights so they do on when you are not there and make sure you leave your home secure.'","Sussex Police believe a gang is targeting old and vulnerable residents .

"Two dead bodies - one dismembered and one badly rotten - have been found dumped next to each other in an isolated patch of woodland. Police found the corpses in a patch of woodland just outside Brockton, Massachusetts, on Monday. The town is 25 miles south of Boston. Investigators believe one of the bodies - which was missing limbs - is a woman in her 20s. The woman, who had brown hair, was found near a rotting corpse which seemed to have been there much longer. In the woods: Police found the bodies - a woman and a second of unknown gender - in a wooded area around Brockton, Massachusetts . The body had decayed so much that police could not tell what age or gender it was. According to local news station WHDH, the find was little more than a pile of bones. Timothy Cruz, the attorney general for Plymouth County, Massachusetts, said the condition of the bodies showed they had been there different lengths of time. He added medical examiners are working to identify the two victims, and appealed for anybody who is aware of missing people to come forward. The first body was discovered Sunday in a wooded area about a quarter-mile from the parking lot of a Brockton Veterans of Foreign Wars post and near several single-family homes. Police began a search and found the skeletal remains of the second body on Monday. Search: Detectives found the woman first - then located the severely decayed second body . One body was determined to be that of a woman believed to be in her 20s, and it appeared to have been dismembered, Cruz said. The gender of the other body, found beneath the other, could not immediately be determined, nor was it possible to know if it had also been dismembered, he said. Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston, is a city of about 93,000 residents. 'I realize this is going to be of great concern to residents of the community,' Mayor Bill Carpenter said of the discovery of the remains, adding the city would support the investigation in any way it could. Cruz declined to say who notified authorities of the first body. Asked whether investigators fear there could be other remains in the area, the district attorney would not rule out the possibility but added that 'every nook and cranny' of the nearby woods had been searched.","Corpses turned up in wooded area of Brockton, Massachusetts .

"Four in 10 mums want politicians to stop banging on about Europe and focus instead on easing the pressure on family finances. With four months until the general election, almost half of mothers already fear politicians will not keep their promises if they make it into power after May 7. The latest edition of the MumDex by Asda reveals a growing disconnect between the supermarket's customers and politicians, with just a third willing to even open the door to a candidate on the campaign trail. The survey reveals 40 per cent of mums want politicians to focus less on the EU, with 53 per cent wanting to hear less about transport and 24 per cent keen to focus on issues other than childcare . More than half of do not think it will make any difference to their lives who wins the election . Mums say they want to hear less about transport, just weeks after David Cameron (left) and Nick Clegg (right) scrambled to be pictured at Stonehenge to promote government investment in new road schemes . The MumDex survey of more than 3,000 of the supermarket’s customers nationwide reveals that many have low expectations about what the general election will bring. Some 44 per cent said it would make little or no difference to their lives whoever wins the election, rising to 60 per cent in Northern Ireland. More than half – 59 per cent – said they do not trust whoever is elected to actually implement the policies they campaign on. While the survey does not mention party leaders by name, it will make for grim reading for David Cameron, not least the issues mums are interested in – and what to hear less about. Forty per cent want to hear less about Europe a major blow to the Prime Minister who has pinned his hopes of re-election on the promise of an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Despite the rise of Nigel Farage's Eurosceptic Ukip, 40% of mums want politicians to focus less on the EU. Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to focus on the cost of living and the NHS, which will chime with mums in the survey . More than half – 53 per cent – want politicians to talk less about transport. It comes after Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy nick Clegg dashed around the country earlier this year to be pictured near roads earmarked for upgrades, with both posing at Stonehenge. Surprisingly, 24 per cent of mums want less focus on childcare, perhaps a reflection of the way it has become pigeon-holed as a ‘female issue’, when women have much broader concerns. Top of the list of priorities, according to the survey, is the cost of living, which 75 per cent of mums want politicians to focus on more. Meanwhile 70 per cent named the NHS as a concern. Labour leader Ed Miliband has campaigned hard on both the squeeze on incomes and the pressure on the health service. Immigration – regularly cited by Ukip as a key issue - was also a concern for 53 per cent of mums. Asda’s Hayley Tatum said: ‘Almost half of Asda Mums are so dispirited that they don’t think that the election - whoever wins - will make any difference to their family’s lives; and, even more concerning, most of them don’t even trust politicians to honour their campaign . ‘Mums still feel ignored, and they are not optimistic that this will change - they don’t have faith that this election will bring with it politicians and policies which speak to mums’ needs. ‘Despite this, they are not switching off - mums will still be following the election coverage online, on TV, and in print. ‘It’s very interesting to see that they would much rather read analysis of a candidate’s comments in the papers the next day than actually hear from the candidate directly.’ According to the survey only 33 per cent of mums are willing to listen to candidates who come to their door. Almost half – 49 per cent – plan to watch the TV leaders’ debates, if they happen. But two-thirds plan to get most of their information from online, TV and newspapers. While 60 per cent of mums with teenagers plan to talk to them about the election, but only five per cent would want their children to go into politics themselves.","Voting mums reveal electoral turn-offs in latest Asda MumDex survey .

"Home Office officials secretly considered plans to provide homes with chemical weapons shelters amid fears of an attack by the Soviet Union - but the scheme quickly ran into difficulties. Files released by the National Archives show that the plan foundered after experts pointed out that people would have to remain in the sealed shelters for up to 10 hours in the aftermath of a chemical attack. It also emerged that Margaret Thatcher wanted Britain to acquire chemical weapons to counter the Soviet threat during the Cold War. Ikea-style instructions were drawn up for  shelters where families could hide during chemical attacks . The plan to offer families shelters to protect them from chemical weapons emerged in the last amid fears of an attack by the Soviet Union . 'As the cubic capacity was approximately 7 cubic metres, four people could be supported in the enclosed air for only about 2-3 hours,' the minutes of a meeting from April 1985 noted. It was suggested that the air supply could be extended through the use of fans and filters - but again there was a difficulty. 'It was immediately realised that finding room for them might be a problem,' the minutes noted. Other files reveal how the Mrs Thatcher said it was ‘negligent’ that Britain had not acquired chemical weapons as intelligence reports suggested that the enemy could use them against the West. In a secret memo in National Archives files at Kew, Charles Powell, Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary, summarised a meeting on the subject in which then defence secretary Michael Heseltine warned that a lack of chemical weapons was a ‘major gap’ in Nato’s defences. ‘The defence secretary said that colleagues were aware of the threat posed by the Soviet Union in this file. The absence of an adequate retaliatory capability was a major gap in Nato’s armoury,’ he wrote. ‘Reliance on a nuclear response to chemical attack lacked credibility. Possession of a very limited defensive capability was not a deterrent.’ He added: ‘Summing up the discussion, the prime minister said that it might be argued that it was negligent of the Government not to acquire a chemical weapons capability. But this was not a decision which could be addressed at this stage.’ The shelters, including this igloo-style design, were later discovered to be unfit for purpose . The shelters were likely to have been inspired by Anderson shelters which were used during the Second World War to seek refuge from Nazi bombing raids . A Ministry of Defence paper from 1984 underlined the scale of the threat with an assessment that the Russians had over 300,000 tons of nerve agents alone. In contrast, United States – which was the only Nato member to possess a chemical warfare (CW) capability – had an ageing stockpile of just 31,000 tons which was not actually declared to Nato. Britain abandoned its chemical weapons programme in the 1950s and kept only a nuclear capability, which was deemed a disproportionate response to an isolated chemical weapons attack on troops. In another secret paper from 1983, officials make predictions of the death toll if the Soviet Union attacked Britain with chemical weapons. A Home Office working group calculated that a Russian CW attack by just three aircraft on Gatwick Airport would leave 16,350 dead and 29,000 injured while a similar attack on Southampton dockyard would kill 33,350 and leave 42,000 injured. An official memo of July 1984 states: ‘The Home Secretary attended a presentation in the Ministry of Defence on 29 February at which the Prime Minister was present about the threat posed by the growing Soviet capability in chemical weapons. ‘At that meeting it was agreed that a paper on chemical weapons’ policy should be prepared by officials, and this was sent to the prime minister on 2 July.' Margaret Thatcher, pictured in 1986, said it was ‘negligent’ that Britain had not acquired chemical weapons as intelligence reports suggested that the enemy could use them against the West . The memo added: ‘The paper (which has been agreed at official level) concludes that, whilst an attempt to achieve arms control should be the first priority despite uncertainties about the outcome, if these efforts fail the arguments for a Western chemical weapons capability would be very strong… . ‘In its recommendations the paper invites ministers to consider a range of options for countering the military threat posed by chemical weapons, including a retaliatory capability.’ The fears arose out of intelligence reports that suggested that the Soviets were building chemical weapons that could penetrate the West’s Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) weapons suits. ‘It is our intelligence judgment that the soviets have expanded their CW capability, particularly in the area of penetrating agents,’ the paper says. ‘We do not have specific evidence of new agents having actually been deployed into service with the Soviet forces, but we are convinced that a new and serious chemical weapons threat exists. It is a threat that our current respirator and probably our present NBC suit cannot defeat.’ But the paper also warns that it would be difficult to win over public opinion - especially because there was no protection available for the civilian population.

"An 85-year-old woman was left stranded and in floods of tears at Stansted Airport after Ryanair refused to accept her bus pass as ID for a return flight to Edinburgh. Helen Trotter, from Hawick, Roxburghshire, had used the permit to prove who she was on the outbound flight, however Swissport staff at Stansted - acting as third party agents for Ryanair - advised her that this form of ID was not acceptable for the return journey. Her family are now facing a 12-hour round trip to pick up the grandmother, after she was too upset to re-enter the airport. Eighty-five-year-old Helen Trotter  had used her bus pass as ID to leave Edinburgh Airport for Stansted . Daughter Irene, 53, told the Edinburgh Evening News that her mother was visibly shaken by the whole affair. 'We got a call from a member of staff at Stansted saying that she was bawling her eyes out,' she said. Ryanair's General Terms and Conditions of Carriage do not include a bus pass as being an acceptable form of ID. It lists a passport, national ID card or any valid driving licence with photo as acceptable identification for adults, while children under 16 years of age (travelling with an adult) on UK domestic flights can travel without photo identification. However, the pensioner had been allowed to use the photocard on the flight down to Stansted from Edinburgh. Visibly upset by being denied entry, Ms Trotter couldn't bring herself to return to the airport . On the return journey to Edinburgh from Stansted, the grandmother was told her bus pass ID wasn't valid . A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'Customers flying domestically within the UK should travel with a passport or driving licence. In rare cases, where customers have no other form of ID, travel may be permitted with a bus pass. 'We have asked our third party handling agent at Stansted (Swissport) to explain why this issue was not escalated and ensure it does not recur. 'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Trotter and transferred her free of charge onto the next available flight that day, however she chose not to travel. 'As a gesture of goodwill, we are offering Mrs Trotter a free return flight from Edinburgh to Stansted and hope she will fly with us once more.'","Helen Trotter, 85, had passed through with bus pass on outward flight .

"The hack attack against Sony Pictures may have been an inside job and not carried out by North Korea, cybersecurity experts have said. Representatives from an independent cyber intelligence company briefed FBI agents yesterday on findings which indicate that disgruntled former Sony staff and piracy-advocates were behind the hack. The FBI maintains that the hack was carried out by North Korea, but are now looking into the possibility that Pyongyang hired hackers from outside the . country, an official close to the investigation said on . Monday. Scroll down for video . Not Pyongyang: FBI agents have been briefed  on findings which indicate that disgruntled former Sony staff and piracy-advocates were behind the hack in November this year . As North Korea lacks the capability to conduct some elements . of the sophisticated campaign by itself, the official said, U.S. investigators are looking at the possibility that Pyongyang . 'contracted out' some of the cyber work. Some private security experts have begun to question whether . Pyongyang was behind the Sony cyberattack at all. An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse has found that it is likely a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack, the FBI was told during a briefing yesterday. 'We are very confident that this was not an attack master-minded by North Korea and that insiders were key to the implementation of one of the most devastating attacks in history,' Kurt Stammberger, a senior vice president with Norse, told CBS News last week. Norse believes that a woman calling herself 'Lena', who claims to be part of the hacking group 'Guardians of Peace', may have worked for Sony for a decade before leaving last May. Consulting firm Taia Global said the results . of a linguistic analysis of communications from the suspected . hackers suggest they were more likely from Russia than North . Korea. 'I think the government acted prematurely in announcing . unequivocally that it was North Korea before the investigation . was complete,' said Mark Rasch, a former federal cybercrimes . prosecutor. An investigation by cybersecurity firm Norse has found that it is likely a Sony insider might have helped launch the attack, and that North Korea is not responsible . The FBI maintains that the Sony hack was carried out by Pyongyang over the release of The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-Un . 'There are many theories about who did it and how . they did it. The government has to be pursuing all of them.' While U.S. officials investigate whether North Korea . enlisted help from outside contractors, the FBI stood by its . previous statement that Pyongyang was the prime author of the . attack against the Sony Corp unit. 'The FBI has concluded the Government of North Korea is . responsible for the theft and destruction of data on the network . of Sony Pictures Entertainment,' the Federal Bureau of . Investigation said in a statement to Reuters. North Korea has denied that it was behind the Sony attack . and has vowed to hit back against any U.S. retaliation. The people who claimed responsibility for the hack have said . on Internet postings that they were incensed by the Sony . Pictures film 'The Interview,' a comedy about a fictional . assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Because of the hackers' threats, major U.S. cinema chains . refused to show the film. Last week, Sony struck deals with some . 320 independent theaters to distribute 'The Interview' and also . made the film available online. The hackers released the email caches of Sony executives, including Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Amy Pascal and its CEO Michael Lynton . The FBI said its determination that North Korea was behind . the hack was based on information from a variety of sources, . including intelligence sources, the U.S. Department of Homeland . Security, foreign partners and the private sector. 'There is no credible information to indicate that any other . individual is responsible for this cyber incident,' the agency . said. Kevin Mandia, whose security firm was hired by Sony to . investigate the attack, said the only way to know who the . culprits are is to trace the network traffic from the infected . machines back to the hackers' machines. Only the government and . Internet service providers have that kind of visibility, he . added. 'I don't have the data that they have to come up with that . conclusion,' Mandia, chief operating officer of FireEye Inc, said. 'Every attack loops through numerous machines,' he said. 'You have to peel that onion all the way back. It isn't an easy . thing to do.' Mandia, who has supervised investigations into some of the . world's biggest cyberattacks, said the Sony case was . unprecedented. 'Nobody expected when somebody breaks in to absolutely . destroy all your data, or try to anyway, and that's just . something that no one else has seen,' he said.","Cybersecurity experts tell FBI they think Sony hack was inside job .

"These shocking photographs lay bare the extent of obesity in Britain, with school uniforms being sold in super sizes to fit overweight children. Items on sale at stores in Burnley and Clitheroe, Lancashire, include trousers with a 48in waist, classed as 5XL, and blazers with a 56in chest - which is 16 sizes bigger than the average adult fit. It comes a month after doctors warned childhood obesity in the UK had reached ‘alarming’ levels with up to a third being dangerously fat, and that British girls under 20 were the fattest in Europe. Obesity Britain: Shahid Aslam, 29, and Janet Aslam, 55, of family business Moonline in Burnley, Lancashire, show examples of oversized school uniforms that they sell. These trousers are XXXXL and the blazer is 52in . Shahid Aslam, 29, whose family runs the Moonline children’s clothes shop in Burnley, said: ‘We’ve introduced sturdy fit trousers that go up to a 48in waist - and believe me, we do sell them. ‘We have also sold large adult sweaters to children, when they’re not even in the last year of primary school, and we now do blazers up to 50 inches when it used to be 42.’ Before the start of the 2014/15 school year, uniform supplier Trutex, of Clitheroe, started providing made-to-order blazers for chest sizes up to 56in, the Lancashire Telegraph reported in September. A spokesman said: ‘We work closely with our retailers, and over the last few years they’ve been advising us that parents are now often asking for bigger sizes of the garments we manufacture.’ In addition, Caroline Fotios, of uniform charity Mum’s The Word, said they have also had requests for surprisingly large sizes. She said: ‘There was one recently where we had to find a large adult sweatshirt for a 10-year-old pupil. The child came in with his parent and I thought he was going to be much older than she said.’ Huge: Items on sale at stores in Lancashire include trousers with a 48in waist, classed as 5XL, and blazers with a 56in chest - which is 16 sizes bigger than the average adult fit . Last month the Mail reported on how a study by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found British girls are the fattest in Europe, topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe. British boys under 20 are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top where one-third of boys are ranked as fat. Recent research for the period 1980-2013 says there has been a substantial increase in overweight and obese children and adolescents in developed countries, including the UK. The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services. Moonline has been supplying school uniforms in Burnley for almost 30 years, with its owners first trading at markets in 1985 - and opening their first store in 1992.","Items on sale in Lancashire shops include trousers with a 48in waist (5XL)

When items are placed on the table, the case  identifies even slight changes in temperature to reveal when a beverage is safe to drink. Scroll down for videos . The thermal table (pictured) was created by Japanese data researcher Ken Kawamoto, who projected light from a Flir One iPhone case onto a table using a process known as projection mapping . Designer Ken Kawamoto used a Flir One thermal imagine iPhone case, which costs around £250 (£390). In a video, a glass of ice water is shown turning the table blue, while a glass of hot water is shown turning it red. Kawamoto also pours cold and hot water into a tray, to see how the liquids combine, and shows what a MacBook’s battery looks like under thermal imaging. Projection mapping uses video projectors, but instead of projecting the image onto a flat screen it maps the light onto any surface. This light scatters the pixels of an image, and turns any surface – in this case, a table - into an interactive display. The process is also known as spatial augmented reality and video mapping, and is typically used for adverts. The project can be created by anyone using a projector and Flir One case (pictured left). The case is fitted with its own battery and lasts for 2 hours continuous use on a single charge.

"The most likely cause of the deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was a young boy playing near a colony of virus-infected bats nestled in a hollowed-out tree, scientists believe. The two-year-old boy - described as the index case, or patient zero - became infected and was the first to die in his village in Meliandou, Guinea in December last year. It is thought 'patient zero' was Emile Ouamouno, described as a playful toddler by his father Etienne. Before his death, on December 6, 2013, Emile had been near a tree harbouring the free-tailed bats. The toddler came down with a sky-high fever, began vomiting and passing black stools. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe bats living in this hollowed-out tree in the village of Meliandou, Guinea could be the source of the Ebola epidemic that has rampaged through West Africa this year . A two-year-old boy, thought to be Emile Ouamouno, pictured being held by his father Etienne, is understood to be 'patient zero' - the first person infected with Ebola, sparking the current outbreak . The cause of the deadly outbreak of Ebola in West Africa was most likely a young boy playing near a colony of virus-infected free-tailed bats, scientists claim . Emile's sister Philomene fell ill on Christmas Day last year, and was dead before New Year. Their mother and grandmother followed, becoming infected with the disease . It took four days for the disease to claim Emile's life, and he passed away on December 6, 2013. His sister Philomene fell ill on Christmas Day last year, and was dead before New Year. Their mother followed, along with their grandmother, Etienne said earlier this year. The disease then spread to other members of the community before spreading to other parts of Guinea. The disease was only recognised as Ebola in March, and in the summer it began to spread across international borders, infecting people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, before patients were diagnosed in Spain, US and  UK. The epidemic represents the largest ever-recorded Ebola outbreak, killing 7,800 people by December 17, 2014. Etienne said his son died on December 6, 2013, four days after first falling ill . Fruit bats are the commonly suspected carriers of the Ebola virus and have been linked to previous outbreaks in Africa. They are often hunted for food, but scientists say they are an unlikely source of infection. This is because food-borne transmission would have affected adults before or at the same time as the two-year-old boy. This suggested a source of infection unrelated to food  - that the boy somehow came into contact with the insect-eating free-tailed bats. Researchers from the Robert Koch-Institute in Berlin were part of a team which took part in a four-week field mission in Guinea in April 2014. This was to examine human exposure to bats, to survey local wildlife and to capture and sample bats in Meliandou and in neighbouring forests. However the village where the boy died was not located in the forest. Instead, the source of the infection was probably a large colony of free-tailed insectivorous bats occupying a hollow tree, they concluded. Villagers reported that children often used to play in and around the tree and may have resulted in a massive exposure to the bats. Emile was from the village of Meliandou in Guinea, pictured. From there the disease spread to other parts of the country as well as neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia . Researcher Dr Fabian Leendertz said Ebola virus disease epidemics are transmitted to human populations either through contact with larger wildlife or by direct contact with bats. Writing in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine he said: 'We monitored the large mammal populations close to the index village Meliandou in south-eastern Guinea and found no evidence for a concurrent outbreak.' Instead, a more plausible source of the outbreak was contact with bats rather than larger wildlife.","The two-year-old boy is described as the index case - or patient zero .

The fitness instructor had stopped to take photographs of the scenery with her friend Helen Birch-Machin when the incident unfolded. She was then hit by what she describes as a 'small blue vehicle' and was knocked unconscious. She said: 'I'm lucky to be alive. If it wasn't for my helmet I wouldn't be here. 'I can't believe the driver left the scene, they probably don't realise the damage they've done.' Ms Taylor had been out with he friend Helen Birch-Machin when the pair stopped to take photographs of the scenery . After the crash, Ms Taylor was rushed to Macclesfield Hospital. She needed nine stitches but was discharged in time to spend Christmas with her son. She said: 'My face was covered in mud and my helmet was smashed to pieces. 'I kept drifting in and out of consciousness and I don't even remember much of Christmas because I felt so drugged-up. 'I've no idea how long it will be until I can go back to work and, because I'm a self-employed fitness instructor, I won't get any sick pay. It's turned my world upside down.'

"This is the moment a brave buffalo charged three lions after they grabbed a young calf from the herd. The hungry lions crept up on the buffalo and calf in north-west Tanzania, East Africa, causing them to disperse in a terrifying 90-second ordeal. While the majority of the buffalo escaped, one animal turned back and stood firm against the lions in a bid to protect its young. But the big buffalo rallied and stood between her young and the lion's teeth while charging horns-first at the circling predators. Three lions took the opportunity to surround their prey and closed in on the calf. But the outnumbered buffalo could not hold them at bay and a young lion pounced and snapped away the baby between its jaws. The buffalo become separated from the herd when it turns back to face the lions and protect its young calf . While the buffalo stands up to two of the lions, a third big cat approaches from behind to close in on the calf . Only the quick-thinking reactions of the the adult buffalo saved young calf from death. The 1,000 pound beast ploughed into all three lions just as they looked set to feast on the calf. And the rest of the herd arrived just in time to mount a dramatic rescue and send the lions retreating with their tales firmly between their legs. The brave buffalo charges the three lions as one snatches the calf away from its mother and runs off with it . Despite the buffalo's best efforts to keep the lions at bay, the animals outnumber her and edge closer to her calf . It seems all is lost as the lions make off with their prey, closely followed by the distressed mother . Amateur photographer Andreas Häntzschel, 39 from Aachen, Germany, captured the whole clash on camera while he was on safari. Andreas said: 'I like the nature, I like travelling and I like to take pictures in a documentary style. 'This was absolutely unreal. This was amazing and you don't get a lot of chances to see something like it. The buffalo charges a the lions and manages to snatch her young back, closely followed by the rest of the herd who charge the big cats . 'To see lions is not too spectacular but to see them fighting is great. The buffaloes were very courageous to save themselves.' Andreas, who works as a portfolio manager for an energy firm, used a Canon DSLR to take the snaps while filming with a Panasonic Video Cam. He said: 'Most people ask me how I managed to see that and then they are happy to see the buffalo calf alive. 'But I was so angry that I didn't take my full HD camera with me.'","The buffalo and its young became separated from the herd by three hungry lions in Tanzania .

Similarly, the research found that most cities in South America and continental Europe stayed awake into the small hours. Of course, in Argentina, Chile and Brazil, the celebrations fall in the summer, allowing many people to party on the beach. In contrast, people in China and Israel were asleep last year earlier than other countries, probably because their New Year’s traditions, which stretch back thousands of years, are celebrated on different days. A total of 88 per cent of Britons wearing Jawbone activity tracking bands stayed awake past midnight last year, with the average Londoner going to bed at 2am and waking up at 9.36am on New Year’s Day. Around three in 10 Americans skipped the midnight countdown last year in favour of catching some extra shut-eye. Jawbone’s data revealed that the west coast goes to bed particularly early, typically three hours after the ball has dropped in Times Square and 19 hours after the first fireworks in Sydney. It has been suggested that people living in Los Angeles prefer an alternative tradition: the Rose Parade, which begins at 8am on New Year’s Day. Almost 48 per cent of Jawbone wearers in Pasadena – a southern Californian town - were asleep by midnight, for example. But not all cities in the US go to bed so early, with people in New York and Miami partying hard into the night.

This stock image shows men dancing with a Chinese dragon on New Year's Eve in Macau . The day is believed to be the anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve and to celebrate, the shofar (a hollowed out ram's horn) is sounded and symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey are eaten. However, on Chinese New Year, which is celebrated on February 19 next year, 800 million people stay up late with their families to watch the largest TV broadcast on the planet, the CCTV New Year’s Gala, which ushers in the New Year. Only Hong Kong stays up later to celebrate the New Year later than the Chinese New Year, according to the data. Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Chinese New Year vary widely. It is common for families to gather for dinner and to cleanse their homes to sweep away bad luck and make way for incoming fortune. Windows and doors are often decorated with red paper and decorations denoting good fortune, happiness, wealth and longevity. Lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes are also popular customs.","Russians last year stayed up the latest in the world, according to data from Jawbone Up smart band wearers .

Chloe Dutton, 19, was enjoying a Christmas night out in Southend, Essex, with friends when a stranger followed them out of the nightclub and attacked Miss Dutton with what is believed to be a knuckle duster . The student, who is currently studying at Kent University, pictured left before the Boxing Day attack and right while waiting in A&E following the incident. She needed emergency plastic surgery for the deep wound . The incident occurred as Miss Dutton, from Westcliff, Essex, left Talk nightclub with two friends on Boxing Day and went to get a takeaway near Southend Bus Station. They became aware they were being followed by a man and told him to stop pestering them. However, he then knocked two of them to the ground before targeting Miss Dutton by punching her in the face with what is thought to be a knuckle duster. The student, who is studying social work at Kent University, said: 'I went out with two girlfriends on Boxing Night. 'As we walked along the road we realised we were being followed. He kept trying to separate me from my friends. 'My friends told him I wasn't interested and to go away but he started attacking them. He got them on the floor and kicked them several times, then he attacked me. 'The police and ambulance were called but the ambulance didn't come. The police took us to hospital. 'I was in a lot of pain and the wind was blowing on a huge gash from my eye to my cheek so my friends asked if I could sit in the police van. The blood was pouring down my face.' Miss Dutton said the attack was completely unprovoked and neither she nor her friends knew the man. The attack has left Miss Dutton  with horrific facial injuries (left), including a broken eye socket (right) Miss Dutton was attacked by a man who was believed to be using a knuckle duster (like the one pictured) She added: 'I had to wait five hours in A&E and when they did examine me they transferred me immediately to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. I had to have plastic surgery and didn't leave hospital until Sunday night. 'I have to go back for a CAT scan. They said he must have been using some sort of knuckle duster to do so much damage and that I will be scarred for life. 'I might have to have more surgery on the broken eye socket, which will leave more scars. 'They will decide whether to use a plate or let it heal naturally.' A police spokesman said: 'We were called at 2.10am to reports an Asian man assaulted a woman and her two friends. 'The women reported they were walking through town when he began speaking to them. 'They asked him to stop as they didn't know him and at that point he assaulted them. 'One girl was badly injured and has a fractured eye socket. A police vehicle took them to hospital.' Police said the man is described as Asian, about 25-years-old and was wearing a black jacket, jeans and a grey hat. An ambulance spokesman said: 'We were called at 2.09am to the bus station in Southend to reports of a woman in her late teens with a facial injury. 'She was reported to have cuts to her left eye. At 2.38am we were told to stand down as the police were going to take the patient to hospital.' The spokesman confirmed an ambulance hadn't been dispatched by the time they were told to stand down. Anyone with information about the incident should contact Southend CID on 101.","Chloe Dutton was enjoying night out with friends when she was attacked .

"The woman shot in the stomach before Ismaaiyl Brinsley assassinated two NYPD officers has been released from hospital. Shaneka Thompson, 29, was released from a Baltimore Hospital yesterday after spending just over a week recovering from a gunshot wound inflicted by Brinsley on December 20. After shooting the Air Force reservist, Brinsley went on to murder Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos in New York, in an apparent act of revenage over the police killings of two unarmed black men this summer. Shaneka Thompson, left, the ex-girlfriend of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, right, has been released from hospital, just over a week since he shot her in the stomach before killing two NYPD officers and then himself . Brinsley shot Ms Thompson, an Air Force reservist in the stomach and threatened to kill her if she called the police; he then travelled to New York and killed Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos . Ms Thompson's grandfather James Delly told the New York Post  she was 'feeling fine' and that her family was 'very happy'. He said his granddaughter isn't fully recovered, but was 'progressing'. Ms Thompson is staying with her mother. Brinsley's rampage began with an early-morning visit to Ms Thompson's Baltimore apartment. After shooting her he threatened to kill her if she called police.spo . The 28-year-old then caught a bus to New York where he killed the two officers, before running into the subway where he took his own life. Ms Thompson's release, comes as tensions between the New York police and Mayor Bill de Blasio continue to sour. De Blasio was booed during an officer swearing-in ceremony yesterday, and hundreds of officers turned their backs on him during Ramos' funeral on Saturday. Some officers have been highly critical of de Blasio for remarks about police relations with black Americans that they say incited the shooting. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was jeered yesterday when he addressed New York police officers during a swearing in ceremony at Madison Square Garden . Hundreds of officers also turned their backs on de Basio at Ramos' funeral on Saturday . While de Blasio was speaking yesterday as 884 new police officers were sworn in at the city's Madison Square Garden, the crowd jeered. De Blasio praised the city's police as 'the finest police department in the world,' and said the new officers had made a 'heroic choice' to join the force. Despite the praise, de Blasio was given only tepid applause compared to Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who took the floor next. When de Blasio said police would have to deal with problems they had not created, someone shouted: 'You have created them.' When he took the podium, Bratton continued to mount his defense of the criticized mayor, citing his 'passion' for the police during 'very difficult times.' Aides for de Blasio pointed out that this wasn't the first time the mayor has been booed at a ceremony. The funeral for the second officer killed by Brinsley is scheduled for this weekend. A prayer vigil will be held on Saturday for Liu, 32, and he will be buried the following day.","Ismaaiyl Brinsley shot his ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in the stomach .

"A staggering 221 new species were discovered in 2014  by one US institution alone, including a tiny elephant shrew with a distinctive 'trunk'. The list of new species include 110 ants, 16 beetles, three spiders, 28 fish and 24 sea slugs. It was compiled using 64 scientific papers published by the California Academy of Sciences. Nice to meet you: A total of 221 new species were discovered in 2014, including a tiny elephant shrew. The new species of round-eared sengi,  was found in the remote deserts of Namibia, in south western Africa. It is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called Macroscelides micus . The animals were discovered in remote caves, at the bottom of the sea, in deserts and even in the heavily populated state of California. ‘Biodiversity scientists estimate that we have discovered less than 10 per cent of species on the planet,’ Dr Meg Lowman, the Academy’s Chief of Science and Sustainability said. The new species include 110 ants, 16 beetles, three spiders, 28 fish, 24 sea slugs, two marine worms, nine barnacles, two octocorals, 25 plants and one mammal. Pictured is a poison-loving sea slug . Entomologists found and described 110 new species of ants on the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar. One species of note was the Malagidris sofina, or the ‘hero ant,’ (pictured) which lives in non-porous clay, and is thought to build a striking, funnel-like nest to promote oxygen exchange and protect its colony from suffocation . The Etendeka round-eared sengi, or Macroscelides micus, was found in a remote part of the Namid Desert in south western Africa. It is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis. The animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade. It has rust-coloured fur, a large, hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment. Genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives. Sengis are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees (known as sea cows) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews. ‘Academy scientists tirelessly explore the unexplored regions of Earth - not only to discover new species, but also to uncover the importance of these species to the health of our natural systems. ‘Our findings help to sustain the future of life for our children and grandchildren. Even in our own backyards new discoveries abound.’ Among the discoveries was a new species of round-eared sengi, or elephant-shrew, which was found in the remote deserts of Namibia, in south western Africa. It is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called Macroscelides micus. Experts now know that the creatures are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees  - known as sea cows - and aardvarks than they are to true shrews.

Catch of the day: A gigantic deep water worm eel, called Pylorobranchus hearstorum is the largest of its kind found off the Philippines measuring nearly 50 inches (127cm) from head to tail - almost twice as long and three times heavier than any known worm eel . the tropical forests and reef-filled waters of Southeast Asia have yielded three newly discovered ray spiders, which are each about the size of a single grain of sand. This image shows the web of one of the tony creatures . It also exhibits a defensive behaviour known as ‘cliff-jumping’. This is when a lone hero ant breaks from the colony and sacrifices itself to tackle an intruding foreign ant approaching the nest entrance by grabbing it and throwing it – and itself – dramatically over the lip of the nest, meaning the insects tumble to their death. Also among the finds are 65 new species of marine creatures, including a type of 23-million year old megamouth shark identified by its fossilised teeth. A total of 20 new species of gobies, one cardinalfish, one toadfish, two grenadiers, one yellow damselfish, one pipefish, 24 colourful nudibranchs, two octocoral, nine new barnacles, two marine worms, and a ghost shark from New Zealand were also found in 2014.

"When Dolce & Gabanna sent models sporting piles of colourful hair accessories down the catwalk during their S/S15 show, the fashion world swooned in delight. But the designers' source of inspiration for the look is an unlikely one - the colourful Bana people of Ethiopia's Omo Valley, who like nothing better than intricate piles of brightly coloured hair clips. And they aren't the only ones who love a good hair accessory. Ever the early adopters, Japan's Kawaii girls have enthusiastically embraced the look, although their colour of choice is pink in all its shades. Pretty: A pair of Japanese Kawaii girls show off their collection of hair clips - all in varying shades of pink . Bright: The Bana tribe of Ethiopia's Omo Valley have long adored colourful hair clips but wear theirs differently to the Kawaii girls . By contrast, the Bana use them to clip their fringes in place, choosing striking rows of clips in alternate bright shades or, in some cases, in shimmering blocks of silver. In Japan, pink is most popular, whether bright fuchsia or delicate powder shades - all perfectly in keeping with the Kawaii 'Sweet Lolita' sub-set which sees women pile on as many frills, bows and ruffles as they can. Clips are worn dotted across fringes, combined with girly bunches or worn clipped on to candy-striped headbands. Floral pattern and Hello Kitty designs are also loved. The creative use of accessories will come as no surprise to anyone who has followed Japan's adventures in fashion, with the country producing a fascinating range of style tribes. Girly: Along with every shade of pink imaginable, Japan's Kawaii girls like delicate patterns, whether floral, polka dot or candy-striped . Style tribe: This girl has combined elements of the Kawaii look with sporty stripes and a chic neon pink scarf . Pile it high: Never knowingly underdressed, these girls have added piles of necklaces, headbands and glasses to their colourful look . Keeping it simple: This fashionista has opted for a darker take on the trend, opting for white and silver bows, as well as a pair of pink hairbands . Cheerful: This bright ensemble is lifted by the addition of a mini crown - something also seen at Dolce & Gabanna . Among the most creative of all is the hair clips' most devoted group of admirers, the Kawaii style tribe which sees girls - and some boys - dressing to show off their individuality with takes on the look ranging from the Lolita (sweet and girly) to Gotchi (Gothic). The antithesis of fake-tanned hair-extensioned TOWIE chic, Kawaii girls like pink, kitsch, tutus, delicate dabs of glitter, enormous false lashes, ultra pale skin - and plenty of hair clips. The most common Kawaii style is named the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible. Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbon, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels. Mixing it up: Like Japan's fashionistas, the Bana are fond of mixing up their hair clips with piles of jewellery - including head bands . Good look: Bright hair clips are not a female-only trend for the Bana as this boy (left) demonstrates. Bright sunglasses are also popular . Intricate: This man has used red and blue hair clips to keep his fringe in place and has accessorised the whole thing with a feather . Matching: This colourful pair have opted for a similar colour scheme, matching striped shirts and bright beaded arm bands . Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up. For the Bana, getting dressed is less about showing individuality and more about looking as bright and cheerful as possible. Beadwork has long been part of their culture, with many opting for colourful beaded headbands - sometimes combined with the hair clips. Others, regardless of sex and age, adorn themselves with piles of arm bands, heavy metal necklaces and beaded belts in eye-popping shades of yellow and crimson. However they are worn, piles of colourful hair clips have proved one of the most universally popular trends of 2014, with devotees also spotted  at Glastonbury in the summer and at festivals across the globe. And with scores of colourful hair accessories cropping up on the S/S15 catwalk, it is probably just a matter of time before they show up on a high street near you. More is more: This lady has combined no less than three clusters of hair clips with huge beaded earrings, a lariat and a head band . Beautiful: As this photo reveals, her simple t-shirt is almost hidden by her beaded belt and breast plate and she also carries an umbrella . Mix and match: Head bands aren't the only way to brighten up a look. Headscarves and bold earrings also go well with the piles of clips .","Japan's Kawaii girls and Ethiopia's Bana tribe share a love for piles of colourful hair clips .
In Tokyo, clips are worn on fringes alone with the majority choosing girly shades of pink and lilac .

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fallen victim to hacking after a sophisticated computer virus was discovered on the USB drive of one of her aides. The Reign virus, which is believed to have been developed by US and British spying agencies, was detected after one of Mrs Merkel's employees plugged her personal drive into a work laptop. The woman, who works in close contact with Mrs Merkel, had loaded a speech she was editing on to the drive, took it home to continue working on it, before returning to the office. Scroll down for video . A woman who works closely with Angela Merkel discovered the virus on her USB drive after plugging it into a government computer in order to work on a speech (file image) As she went to plug the drive back into her work computer she was sent a firewall alert saying a virus had been detected, according to Germany's Bild newspaper. She had used the same drive the day before on work computers without causing an alert. Checks on the Federal Chancellory's 200 other computers showed no more traces of the virus, and officials said it would be impossible to trace whoever put the malware there. It is also not known what, if any, information was taken. Reign allows users to take pictures of a computer screen, take control of the mouse, record passwords and restore deleted files. Staff working for the German government are prohibited from using personal drives on office computers for fear of transferring a virus, and it is not clear whether the staff member will be disciplined over the breach. The speech itself was believed to have been on European Union strategy and was almost certainly not the target of the hack, as it was due to be delivered publicly several days later. While sources at IT security firm F-Secure have previously said the Reign virus was likely created by the UK or US, it is not clear that either country was behind this attack. The virus code could have been downloaded from the internet by a third party before finding its way on to the aide's hard drive. The Reign virus allows users to take control of a computer mouse, take snapshots of the screen, record passwords and restore deleted data. Experts believe UK or U.S. spies are behind the sophisticated code . However, the discovery of the virus will still likely prove embarrassing for the US as it comes after after the country's spies were accused of bugging Mrs Merkel's phone earlier this year. Whistleblower Edward Snowden claimed in October that the American National Security Agency had been listening in on the calls of up to 35 prominent allies, including France and Germany. That lead to claims Angela Merkel's personal mobile phone was tapped, and caused Mrs Merkel to demand answers from the US government. While American authorities never acknowledged whether spying took place, Barack Obama was forced to offer Mrs Merkel an apology. Reign is known as a Trojan, a malicious piece of software which is hidden in other data and downloaded on to a laptop, tablet, or PC computer without the user knowing. According to web security firm Symantec, the virus has been around since at least 2008 and may have taken years to develop. It is highly sophisticated, can have its capabilities tailored to each target, and carefully covers its own tracks. It is extremely difficult to detect, and even once it has been detected, it is difficult to identify what exactly the code is doing. The company says it has been used for spying against governments, businesses and private individuals since 2008, and was updated some time in 2013.","Aide took USB drive home in order to work on German leader's speech .

"Michael Schumacher has started to recognise family members, according to a family friend. Philippe Streiff, another former F1 driver, told French media that Schumacher ‘has yet to recover the power of speech’ but is ‘nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him’. Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head injuries in a ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps one year ago today. Scroll down for video . Road to recovery:  Michael Schumacher, pictured with his wife Corinna in Italy in 2004, has yet to recover the ability to speak, but recognises family members, a friend has claimed . The former Formula One ace emerged from an induced coma in June, and left hospital in September. In an interview with Le Parisien, Streiff said he had learned of Schumacher's progress from his wife, Corinna, and his surgeon, Gerard Saillant. Streiff, claiming to be a 'family friend', said Schumacher,  had ‘very limited’ movement but was working on sitting upright, and that ‘long term... he could hope one day to walk with crutches.’ However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying Schumacher faces a ‘long fight’ for recovery, and that Streiff is not a family friend. ‘We need a long time. It’s going to be a long time and a hard fight,’ Sabine Kehm said. Michael Schumacher suffered brain damage after a ski accident in  Meribel in December last year . Family friend? Streiff claims he was told of Shumacher's progress by his wife Corinna, left, and with brain specialist Gerard Saillant, pictured right . Schumacher (second right) celebrates on the podium after his 2012 Formula One Grand Prix win in Valencia . Friend: Former racing driver Philippe Streiff made the comments on French radio today . ‘He is making progress appropriate to the severity of the situation,’ she added, reiterating a statement she made a month ago. Ms Kehm said Streiff was not a close friend of Schumacher and that his claims to have had contact with the two people named were ‘factually wrong’. ‘I cannot confirm that (report),’ she said. ‘I can only confirm that I do not know where Mr Streiff has his information from because he has no contact with us and he never has.’ Kehm was forced to make similar denials last month, when Streiff, who is himself wheelchair-bound since following a crash in 1989, commented on Schumacher's health. Speaking on French Radio, Streiff said:  'It's very difficult. He can't speak. Like me, he is in a wheelchair paralysed. He has memory problems and speech problems.' Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet, on December 29, 2013. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock, severely injuring his head. After spending several months in a medically induced coma, Schumacher was transferred to Lausanne Hospital, Switzerland, in June and he is now being cared for at his home on the shores of Lake Geneva.","Michael Schumacher is now starting to recognise family, friend says .

"Lassie the dog nuzzled and licked Able Seaman John Cowan - who was presumed dead following an attack off Lyme Regis, Dorset, in the First World War - until he stirred and was brought back to life . The little-known tale of a dog named Lassie who brought a sailor back to life by licking his face during the First World War has emerged 100 years later. The bodies of seven sailors had been laid out in the cellar of a port-side pub in Lyme Regis, Dorset, following a German torpedo attack on a British battleship in the English Channel on New Year's Eve, 1914. All were presumed dead until the landlord's rough-haired collie dog entered the basement and sat alongside the motionless body of one sailor, Able Seaman John Cowan. She proceeded to lick his face and nuzzle him for 30 minutes until, amazingly, he began to stir and rescuers rushed to his side. He went on to make a full recovery. The incredible act sounds like it could be a storyline straight from the 1950s TV series Lassie. Some people even believe the Lyme Regis dog provided English author Eric Knight with the inspiration to write his 1938 novel Lassie Come Home, which paved the way for the subsequent TV show and film. However, Lassie aficionados say there is no record of the writer being aware of the story. Now the remarkable story has been revealed in full by the late historian Rodney Legg in his book, Dorset in the First World War, which has been published posthumously. A total of 547 men perished when the battleship HMS Formidable came under attack from an enemy submarine during an exercise in Lyme Bay. About 200 men, including Able Seaman Cowan, survived the blasts from the torpedoes. Two lifeboats were lowered into the water before a loss of power prevented any more being used. While the ship was sinking, the chaplain, the Rev George Brooke Robinson, went below the decks to fetch cigarettes for the men, only to end up drowning. The following day one lifeboat washed up on the beach at Lyme Regis and those on board, who were barely alive, were taken to the nearby Pilot Boat Inn. Landlord Tommy Atkins turned his beer cellar into a makeshift mortuary and the dead, including Seaman Cowan, were placed there before the bodies could be taken away by officials. His dog, a cross-bred collie, had become used to licking the face of Mr Atkins' wife to rouse her from regular epileptic fits. She began to nuzzle the face and hands of Seaman Cowan until he eventually stirred. After recovering from his ordeal, the sailor visited members of staff at the pub and Lassie to thank them for saving his life. David Tucker, the director at the Lyme Regis Museum, said: 'The Formidable was torpedoed 20 miles off Start Point in Devon. The ship was hit at 2am on New Year's Day and then again at 4.40am before it went down. 'There was a crew of almost 800 and some of the survivors were recovered by a fishing boat out of Brixham. 'About 40 men managed to get into a small lifeboat which spent 23 hours in the sea before it reached Lyme Regis. Seven of the men died on board from exposure. 'A local policeman arranged for the survivors to go to the Pilot Boat inn about 50 metres away and they were given dry clothes, brandy and cigarettes. Lassie was a cross-bred collie owned by the landlord of The Pilot Boat (above) in Lyme Regis, Dorset, where sailors were brought back after a torpedo attack off the coast in 1914. Seaman Cowan was presumed dead . Many people believe the tale of the Lyme Regis dog inspired Eric Knight's 1938 novel Lassie Come Home which paved the way for the subsequent TV show and 2005 film (above). However, others dismiss this idea . 'The seven bodies were taken down into the cellar, including that of John Cowan. 'Lassie wouldn't leave Cowan's side and licked him and licked him until he started to show signs of life. 'There are different theories as to where the inspiration for Lassie came and ours is one of those. It is said that when people heard the story of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they told it again and again.' Author Eric Knight was born in Yorkshire in 1897 and would have been aged 18 at the time of the sinking of HMS Formidable. It means he could have been aware of the incident and potentially could have used the tale in his well-known novel. However, Ace Collins, the American author of the 1993 book Lassie - A Dog's Life maintains it was the heartbreak of Knight witnessing families sell their prized collies to buy food during the Depression of the 1930s that inspired him. He said: 'Eric Knight was inspired by a Depression-era tour of England where he saw things that were so bad people were selling their prized dogs just to raise money to feed their families. 'His own collie, Toots, served as the model for Lassie in the Saturday Evening Post short story that was later expanded into a novel. 'I spoke with his daughter when I did the research and reviewed all of Eric Knight's interviews on the inspiration. 'None of my looks through Knight's notes on the story and later the book is anything mentioned about the Lassie story from Lyme Regis. 'But who knows, maybe, while growing up in England, Eric Knight heard that story.'","Landlord's dog nuzzled face of sailor until he stirred and could be saved .

"The results of Britons' search engine activities for 2014 have been released, and it appears that when it comes to learning something from the internet, our interests range from arts and crafts to the sexiest dance of the year. Nervous teenagers ensure that 'how to kiss' remains high up in our favourite searches but a more unusual question being asked regularly by the British public is, 'how to twerk'. The  move, which involves rapidly thrusting the hips while maintaining a low squatting stance, was made famous by Miley Cyrus during her performance during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and has since entered mainstream pop culture. Twerking, Miley Cyrus's signature dance, was one of the most searched for 'how to' instructions by Brits . Twerking, demonstrated here by Miley Cyrus against fellow singer Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Award, involves rapidly thrusting the hips while maintaining a low squatting stance or bending over . According to Google's list of searches Brits are frustrated twerkers, desparate to imitate Nicki Minaj's moves . Our internet habits show that Brits are eager to perfect the move shown off by performers like Jessie J, Nicki Minaj and Beyonce. In a list of the most googled 'how to' searches in 2014, 'twerking' comes in at sixth place while 'how to squat' is in seventh place. The questions entered into the global search engine create a fascinating insight into UK behaviour behind closed doors. It's further evidence that   Britain is becoming bottom obsessed. In August the second UK National Twerking Championships drew a large audience as 13 dancers wowed crowds with their eye-popping moves at the competition held in north London. The women bounced and jiggled their way through five rounds in a bid to win first place and a chance to dance on stage with twerking sensation Nicki Minaj. Ever since the Nineties there has been sharp increase in admiration of shapely bottoms. 1. Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes. 2. To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward. 3. To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone. 4. Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section. 5. For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out. 6. Then up the tempo and shake the butt. Directions provided by instuctions site, HowCast. From Kylie Minogue’s pert glutes in those gold hotpants in the 2000 Spinning Around video to Jennifer Lopez's  most famous asset, we have entered the age of the hourglass figure. Miley Cyrus may have made brought twerking into the mainstream but Nicki Minaj just cemented it with her almost indecent Anaconda video, in which her posterior was definitely the star of the show. Kim Kardashian's curves could be fuelling Google searches for tutorials for bum boosting squat exercises . When Kim Kardashian posted a picture on Instagram of her Paper magazine cover shoot which prominently featured her naked derriere, it received a record-breaking half a million likes in just nine hours. 1. Draw . 2. Kiss . 3. Crochet . 4. Meditate . 5. Knit . 6. Twerk . 7. Squat . 8. Shuffle . 9. Revise . 10. Wallpaper . But alongside the increase in our preoccupation with bottoms and this headline-making dance move, Brits have also developed a growing interest in arts, crafts and DIY. The most searched-for set of instructions of the year is 'how to draw', suggesting the UK is full of budding artists. Following that is 'how to kiss' - for those who find asking friends how to conduct a clinch isn't quite helpful enough. Crochet is the third most searched-for tutorial and knitting closely follows, as Brits desperately search for advice about casting on and off, tackling cable knits and other techniques. John Lewis estimates that there are more than seven million knitters in Britain and to mark our love of the hobby a new series of The Great British Sewing Bee airs in February. As well as our fascination with arts and crafts, DIY looms large with 'how to wallpaper' coming in tenth place on the list.","Bottom-obsessed Brits use Google to learn the hip-thrusting dance move .

"A surfer who survived a shark attack off the coast of California over the weekend has vowed to hit the waves again as soon as doctors let him. Kevin Swanson of Morro Bay was on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park, which is 200 miles north of Los Angeles, when he was bitten by the 10ft animal. It had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, dug teeth into his hip and then dragged him under the water. Mr Swanson was submerged for a several seconds, before resurfacing and yelling 'shark attack'. Kevin Swanson, left, has spoken about being attacked by a shark off the coast of California, and has said he will return to the waves as soon as he's given the all clear by his doctor . Mr Swanson, pictured being treated by medics, on his board near the Montaña de Oro State Park . He then paddled back to the beach where he created a tourniquet for his leg using the leash on his surfboard. Mr Swanson told Key-tv3 that he was 'lucky to be alive, no doubt about that', following the attack on Sunday. Mr Swanson said the shark attack wouldn't keep him out of the water, saying: 'As soon as the doctor gives me the green light I'll be going back out there and I'll probably be hesitant to paddle out to the same spot, but I'll eventually be out there as well.' He said the moment he was pulled under the water, 'everything changed dramatically'. 'It went from calm, serene, beautiful day with your friends to violent.' Mr Swason estimated the shark dragged him about 5-10 feet below the surface. Swanson underwent surgery at Sierra Vista Regional Medical Centre for a laceration to his right leg, he said was as big as a pie tin. The shark had swum underneath the 50-year-old's board, grazed his hip and then dragged him under the water. A picture of his board shows bite marks next to the tail fins . He said: 'It looked like something that would never get put back together again.' Before Mr Swanson was flown to Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center, two doctors that happened to be on the beach who helped treat his injury. He said: 'Without them who knows. I may have gone into shock without them there.' The authorities did not close the beach as a result of the attack, but instead sent out notifications to others in the area.","Kevin Swanson was bitten by a shark off the coast of California .

"A funfair operator and her two young sons have died after a fire ripped through the caravan where they were living during the winter. Sadie Peters, 36, and her children - aged just one and six - were declared dead at the scene after a blaze broke out at 1.45am at a long-standing site for fairground families in Newchapel, Surrey. Her 35-year-old husband John and eldest son, aged ten, survived and were treated for burns. Mr and Mrs Peters belonged to families which have spent generations travelling the country to run fairs, according to the president of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Fairground operator Sadie Peters and her two sons, aged one and six, died in a fire in Surrey . Blaze: The site was cordoned off this morning by police and firefighters as they investigated the fire's cause . Guild president David Wallis, 70, said  distraught members have rallied round the family and a permanent benevolent fund will donate money to the survivors. 'We represent 20,000 people overall and every one of them feels for the family at this time, especially so close to Christmas', he said. 'There is a strength in the community where we stick together and support each other. That's what we'll be doing now.' The  site where the fire happened is reserved for travelling fairground families and was cordoned off this morning while police and firefighters investigated. One neighbour who has lived on the close-knit site for 20 years, and asked not to be named, said: 'I was woken up at around 1.30am, I heard the fire engines outside. 'They are a family of five. Her eldest son and husband were asleep on the sofa when it happened, so I have heard, and they tried to save the family but couldn't. David Wallis, president of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, said: 'There is a strength in the community where we stick together and support each other. That's what we'll be doing now' One resident said: 'Most of us are related - everybody knows everybody - and it's just a tragic accident' 'My husband ran down to help and said the scene was devastating. There was screaming and crying. It must have been horrible. 'We are a very close knit community and for this sort of thing to happen is just such a shock. For it to happen around this sort of time of year as well just makes things worse. We are all thinking of the family now.' Another resident said: 'I know who they are, obviously we all do, we are a small community and everyone knows everyone here. 'We are not related to them but there is a national grief. Everyone in the fairground industry knows everyone up and down the country. 'We are just completely devastated. For a family to be ripped apart like that is just tragic. 'We are all thinking of them and praying. I just can't believe what has happened. I am struggling to get my head around it. 'I don't know how her husband and son are going to cope with it all.' One resident of the site said: 'It's very upsetting. It's two small children and their mother. This is a big community of people who all get on well and they're all completely devastated.' Another added: 'Most of us are related down there - everybody knows everybody - and it's just a tragic accident.' Countryside: The site set aside for fairground workers is in Newchapel, Surrey. Parish councillor Graham Marks said: 'I'm very shocked and saddened. The residents there are part of our community. They support us' A Surrey Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 1.37am on Tuesday 30 December to a report of a caravan fire. 'Three fire crews were sent to the incident and put out the fire using hose reels. 'Sadly, two children and one woman have died. A man and another child were also treated for burn injuries at the scene and the child has since been taken to East Surrey Hospital. 'Surrey Fire and Rescue Service & Surrey Police are carrying out a joint investigation and our thoughts are with the family and friends of those involved at this tragic time.' A Surrey Police spokesman said earlier: 'Surrey Police and Surrey Fire and Rescue units are currently at the scene, which remains cordoned off while inquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the fire continue.' Called The Plantation, the site has been set aside for fairground families for around 30 years. It won permission to expand by four plots on the green belt in 2011. A Tandridge District Council report in December last year said there were 72 families living on 38 plots, some of whom were 'doubled up' at a rate of two or three to a plot. Backed up: Traffic waited to pass the scene as police and firefighters continued their investigations . Tragic: Another man and a child were treated and the scene, and the child was later taken to hospital . 'Overcrowding is a significant issue', it said. 'There are significantly more families residing at The Plantation than the original planning approval allows for'. The carnival workers were concerned there was not enough room to store their equipment, it added. Parish councillor Graham Marks told MailOnline: 'They use it for a winter's quarters to educate their kids and repair all the fair equipment, then from Easter onwards they're usually travelling the country. 'I'm very shocked and saddened. The residents there are part of our parish and part of our community and have been for many years. They support us and any fundraising we have.' District councillor Ken Harwood added: 'These incidents are always tragic but this time of the year it's particularly poignant. As a community everybody feels something like this.' A Tandridge District Council spokesman said it had not found any evidence that the layout of the site had changed since last year's report. 'Tandridge District Council has no role in the management of the site which is in private ownership,' he said. 'The Council has no direct involvement in this investigation but will assist should the services of the Council be required in any way. 'We would express our sympathies to other members of the family.' A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We sent two ambulances, two cars and three vehicles from our Hazardous Area Response Team. 'Sadly as a result of the fire three people were pronounced dead at the scene. We also treated a man and a child at the scene for burns and/or smoke inhalation.'","Fatal blaze broke out at site in Newchapel, Surrey, at 1.45am on Tuesday .

"A wannabe thief has proved that crime doesn't pay, when trying to blow up an ATM in the Northern Territory only to be knocked flat on his back by the blast. He's seen in the surveillance video standing near the ATM. There's no one else around at 3.45am and all appears normal but then he looks to his left, takes something out of his pocket, and then glances to his right. Normal, that is, until he lights something which is unclear but what happens next catches the culprit completely by surprise. All appears normal here, except for the shirt over his face. The would-be bandit seems set to take money out of the ATM, the legitimate way . But then he lights something in his hand and places it on the ATM . The blast is a big one, lighting up the area and smashing the ATM into pieces . He places the explosive on the ATM but the force of the blast is so great - it throws him across the pavement. Clearly stunned by the impact and perhaps dumbfounded by his massive fail, the man runs off like a scalded cat - without any cash and with pride severely dented. NT Police told NT News that when they arrived they found the ATM had been completely destroyed. The force of the explosion not only wrecks the ATM but also tosses the culprit into the air .

On this occasion he targeted the ANZ in Winnellie but is wanted for a similar attack on the nearby NAB ATM on Christmas Eve.

"Two men who were flying over the Sydney to Hobart yacht race when their light plane plunged 'nose first' into deep sea near the finish line have been found dead in the cockpit of the plane wreck. Pilot Sam Langford, 29, and photographer Tim Jones, 61, were taking photos of boats competing in the race when on Monday afternoon their single-engine Cessna crashed and disappeared in waters near the Tasman Peninsula, in southeast Tasmania. Police confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the plane has been found at the bottom of the sea. Tasmania Police Inspector Lee Renshaw said an operation to recover the wreck and two bodies is under way. 'Weather conditions, while sloppy, are not windy and that is good for recovery. As long as the weather stays favourable, we hope to make good progress,' he said. Scroll down for video . Sam Langford (left) and Tim Jones (right) were on board the single-engine Cessna when it plunged into waters off the coast of Tasmania . Two tourists who were watching the boat race from a cliff top told the ABC they saw a plane flying 'too low' off Cape Raoul. Nona Radonja said: 'It was flying really, really low so I thought that was strange.' And Chris James added: 'It did look out of place ... too low for a plane, I think.' An air, land and sea search was in its third day when the bodies were found in the area where oil has been seen on the water surface, and where a set of aviation headphones were found. Seven boats competing in the yacht race, some of whom witnessed the crash, have been praised for going to the aid of the stricken aircraft. A Cessna 172 (stock photo shown) is believed to have crashed with two people on board while filming the Sydney to Hobart race . Mr Langford, from Mount Nelson, and Mr Jones, from Hobart, are thought to have plunged into waters off the Tasman peninsula in their plane at about 6.20pm on Monday. Police commander Tony Cerritelli said the plane was flying in less than ideal weather conditions and was just 300 metres from a race competitor when it went down. 'It was flying at around mast level and plunged nose-first into the water,' he said on Tuesday. Race competitor Mistraal radioed for help as it rushed to where crew members saw the plane's tail disappear beneath the waves. The Mistraal team sent a mayday call, which has appeared on social media. 'Mayday, mayday, mayday. We have a plane in the water. Plane in the water at 43 14 147 50. This is Mistraal. Mistraal,' it said. The crew then radioed to say they were at the crash site. Owner and skipper Simon Kurts and his Sydney to Hobart yacht Love and War is reportedly helping to search for the plane . A few unique items were received on Tuesday. 'It's a headrest, a set of headphones and a cover off one of the earpieces on aviation headphones with a boom microphone,' Insp Renshaw said. Waters in the area are up to 90 metres and too deep for divers. Three-time winner Love & War joined in the initial search, along with Mistral, Enchantress, Inner Circle, Helsal III and Wax Lyrical. The crash is thought to have happened around 30nm from the race finish in the Derwent River in Hobart . A statement from race organiser, Cruising Yacht Club Of Australia commodore John Cameron, said: 'We know of several yachts that were in the vicinity that may have diverted to render assistance.' The Cessna 172 is owned by Airlines of Tasmania, the ABC reports. The managing director of Airlines of Tasmania, Shannon Wells, said there were two people on board the plane 'which was conducting aerial photography of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race'.

"Werribee Zoo has made the heartbreaking decision to euthanise a newborn white rhino after it was discovered the calf had been born with an aggressive bacterial infection in her stomach. Veterinary staff at Werribee Open Range Zoo, just outside of Melbourne, made the call to euthanise the three-day-old female Southern White Rhino calf after she underwent an endoscopy which revealed the infection had done irreparable damage to her stomach. Sally Lewis, director of Werribee Zoo, said that the loss was deeply distressing for the team who had provided expert care to the rhino calf from the moment she was born. Werribee Zoo has made the heartbreaking decision to euthanise a newborn white rhino after staff at the zoo discovered the calf had been born with an aggressive bacterial infection in her stomach . 'For the last three days our veterinary team have worked around the clock to care for our rhino calf and to lose her now, after those critical first few days is devastating,' said Ms Lewis. The calf's older sister Kipenzi had been born with a similar infection, so signs of the calf's illness had been identified soon after her birth. Blood tests revealed that she had an elevated white blood count and that she had been born with an infection passed on from her mum,' said Senior Veterinarian Dr Natalie Rourke. 'We were able to identify it quickly and begin antibiotic treatment. Despite this initial infection she was feeding well, had good movement and we were cautiously optimistic about her progress,' Dr Rourke said. The decision was made to perform an ultrasound and endoscopy on the calf when she began to lose interest in drinking her milk and was showing signs of discomfort despite being given medication. Sally Lewis, director of Werribee Zoo, said that the loss was deeply distressing for the team who had provided expert care to the rhino calf from the moment she was born . 'The loss of this calf is a huge blow for us, particularly with a species that is so under threat,' said Ms Lewis . On Sunday afternoon the tests revealed that the young calf's stomach lining had become enflamed and she was battling an incurable infection. 'When we examined the rhino calf under anaesthetic we found that the damage to her stomach was so severe that any attempt at surgery would only prolong her pain,' said Dr Rourke. Dr Rourke said that the team were then forced to make the 'heartbreaking' decision to end the calf's suffering. Director Sally Lewis said the past few days had been an extremely difficult time for the whole team at Werribee Zoo. 'The loss of this calf is a huge blow for us, particularly with a species that is so under threat,' said Ms Lewis. 'We’ve been overwhelmed by the response from the community over the last few days, as they have shared our joy in the arrival of this precious baby and our concern about her health,' she said.

"Former Army major: Eric Joyce, 54, independent MP for Falkirk, will now face a trial next year . A Member of Parliament today denied assaulting two 14-year-old boys and causing criminal damage during a row at a corner shop. Eric Joyce, 54, independent MP for Falkirk, will now face a trial next year over allegations he assaulted the boys and caused £200 worth of damage at a store in Chalk Farm, north London. The ex-Labour party politician formally denied the allegations when they were put to him at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today. He denied two counts of common assault and one of criminal damage, relating to an alleged incident at the newsagent's in October. District Judge Margot Coleman conditionally bailed Joyce, a former Army major, to appear for trial at the same court on May 1. Speaking outside court today after the hearing, Joyce, said: ‘I’m fairly confident. 'I’m not denying the incident took place but it was caught on CCTV and will all be shown in the court so they will be able to make up their own minds. It is a question of interpretation and mine is that I was well within the law.’ Asked if he was disappointed to have to wait until May to try and clear his name, he added: ‘Yes, I didn’t realise it would be as long as that.’ Joyce wore a dark grey suit with a white shirt and red tie in the dock as each of the three charges were put to him. Store: Joyce will face a trial next year over allegations he assaulted the boys and caused £200 worth of damage at the News and Food Express (pictured) in Chalk Farm, north London . The court heard the prosecution plans to call the two teenagers and the shop keeper of the News and Food Express as witnesses to the incident. Judge Coleman listed a trial for half a day on May 1, with a ground rules hearing, at which lawyers will agree the questions to be put to the young witnesses, for March 16. Joyce is accused of 'assault by beating' of two youths and with causing damage to groceries and confectionery belonging to the shop owner. He is also charged with 'intending to destroy and damage such property or being reckless as to whether such property would be destroyed or damaged'. Joyce was released on bail on the conditions he does not contact any witnesses or visit the shop.

"A 'special report' appeared at the end of the latest edition of Dabiq, the Islamic State's magazine, with John Cantlie's name alongside it (file image) British ISIS captive John Cantlie  appears to have written an article for the latest copy of the terror group's propaganda magazine. The piece, entitled 'Meltdown', appears at the end of the sixth issue of Dabiq magazine and praises the Islamic State's decision to start minting its own currency. Mr Cantlie's name appears alongside the story, though it is not clear what role he had in writing it, or whether his byline was added to another person's work. The 'special report' appears at the end of the sixth issue  of the magazine, and describes how the US dollar will collapse, before speaking about the benefits of using gold as currency. The piece then goes on to praise the Islamic State's decision to start minting its own coins in Iraq and Syria as 'a smart move'. According to the article the terror group is planning to use gold dinars and silver dirhams for trade, an ancient form of currency which stretches back to the time of Mohammed. Dabiq is part of the Islamic State's slick propaganda machine, which includes producing HD videos of battle scenes, hijacking social media accounts to recruit online, and making a specially designed smartphone app. Named after a town in Syria where ISIS believes a final showdown between Muslim and Western forced will occur, it praises the terror group's decisions and explains their ideology. The group claims that issuing money based on gold will mean that it does not lose its value, and will end their reliance on the price of oil for economic stability. Mr Cantlie was captured by Islamic State fighters in November 2012, along with US journalist James Foley, who has since been beheaded in a gruesome video posted online. Meanwhile Mr Cantlie has been forced him to take part in seven ISIS propaganda videos, recorded in the style of a news report in which he praises the terror group and criticises the West. Mr Cantlie was captured in 2012 and has since become part of Islamic State's propaganda machine, appearing in heavily scripted videos. It is not clear what, if any, role he had in writing the latest article . He usually appears dressed in an orange Guantanamo-style prison jumpsuit, sitting behind a desk against a black background while reading in forced tones from a script. However for the last video he appeared standing outside on the streets of Kobani, where ISIS are engaged in a bloody and prolonged battle with Kurdish forces. In a previous video Mr Cantlie has discussed attempts by the US to rescue him, and how he was moved to another camp just days before the raid. His family have repeatedly appealed for his captors to make direct contact with them so they can discuss his release, but in one video MR Cantlie said he has accepted that he will be beheaded. His father Paul, 80, sent a direct message to ISIS from his hospital bed begging the terrorists to send his son home before he passed away. He died a short time afterwards.","Mr Cantlie's byline appeared alongside 'special report' in ISIS magazine .

"A fish caught off the coast of Western Australia has set a new record in the state as its oldest fish, living to the age of 84. The 60-centimetre long female Bight redfish - its scientific name Centroberyx gerrardi - was captured in November last year. The maximum length of this species of fish is usually 46 centimetres. The 60-centimetre long female Bight redfish - its scientific name Centroberyx gerrardi - was captured in November last year . But scientists were only able to identify its age until now as they needed to look at its bones. 'It's not possible to tell the age of a fish from looking at it. So its age wasn't discovered until its skeleton went under the microscope at the Department of Fisheries' Hillarys research centre just recently,' Fisheries Minister Ken Baston said. The age of the fish was determined by the number of growth rings of the inner ear bones known as the otoliths. It is similar to the process used to find out the age of trees by the cross-section of its trunks. The find knocked off a previous record of 78 years held jointly by a western foxfish (Bodianus frenchii) and a bass groper (Polyprion americanus). The age of the fish was determined by the number of growth rings of the inner ear bones known as the otoliths . Born in 1929, the Bight redfish made its debut into the world at the same time as Popeye and the Academy Awards. James Scullin took over from Stanley Bruce as Australia's ninth prime minister. Current Prime Minister Tony Abbott is the 28th. The fish's skeleton was collected as part of a State Natural Resource Management office funded research project to assess the overall health of south coast stocks. It was caught off the south coast of Western Australia and handed into the state's Department of Fisheries where it was looked at by researchers who determined its age . Determining the fish's age was a joint effort between researchers from the Department of Fisheries and Murdoch University's Centre for Fish and Fisheries Research. Mr Baston said it was encouraging the research was being supported by recreational fishers and commercial fish processors on the south coast who have been donating fish frames of the required species with skeleton and head left intact after filleting. Bight redfish is one of the key species being checked. The project is also looking at pink snapper, blue morwong and donated frames of three near shore finfish species - Australian herring, King George whiting and tailor.","The 60-cm long female Bight redfish was captured November last year .

"This is the moment Andy Murray's father got down on one knee to propose to his long-term girlfriend, just a month after the tennis ace popped the question to his long-term love Kim Sears. Will Murray, 60, is set to tie the knot with his girlfriend of more than 10 years, Sam Watson, after proposing during a festive walk along a beach on Christmas Eve. The couple, who met when Andy moved to Barcelona to train more than a decade ago, celebrated their engagement with the 27-year-old tennis star and his brother Jamie at their home in Dunblane, Perthshire. Will Murray, 60, is set to tie the knot with his girlfriend of more than 10 years, Sam Watson, after getting down on one knee and popping the question during a festive walk along a beach on Christmas Eve (pictured) Will and Sam's engagement (pictured together above with Andy) comes just a month after the Wimbledon champion proposed to his girlfriend of nine years, Kim Sears. He popped the question with a diamond ring . Will and Sam met more than 10 years ago after Andy moved to Spain to train, and stay out of the spotlight . The engagement comes just a month after the Wimbledon champion proposed to his own girlfriend of nine years. He popped the question with a diamond ring he chose himself in November, and Kim – who he met at the U.S. Open in 2005 – said yes. No details have emerged about either  wedding, but relatives have been quick to congratulate the most recent engagement news. Sam's daughter, Brogan Watson, 20, wrote on Twitter: 'Congratulations to my mum and will on their engagement!!' And her other daughter, Erin Watson, said: 'Congratulations to my mum and Will on their engagement so happy for the 2 of them (sic).' It is believed Sam's daughter Brogan helped Will buy the engagement ring, which he presented to his long-term girlfriend while down on one knee during the beach walk. A source close to the couple told the Daily Express: 'Will and Sam have been a couple for a long time now and he just felt the time was right. 'He wanted to do something special for Christmas this year and the proposal on the beach was very romantic. He was a bit nervous beforehand.

'All the family are delighted and it was a double celebration with Andy and Kim also recently getting engaged.' The source added that the family haven't made any plans for a double wedding, but quipped: 'You never know.' Will, an area manager for Scottish newsagent chain RS McColl, split with Andy and Jamie's mother Judy nearly 20 years ago. The couple's tennis star sons continued to live with him in Dunblane after the divorce was finalised, and he put his love life on hold while he helped bring them up. He later met Sam, an optician, when Andy moved to Spain to study at the Schiller International School and to train on the clay courts of the Sanchez-Casal Academy. Speaking in 2009, Will said: 'Once we got to a point where the boys were more comfortable with the situation between me and their mother, then I built up a bit of a social life again. 'I sold the house in Dunblane when Andy went to train in Spain about seven years ago and moved into an apartment in town. 'Just about that time I met Sam and we've been together ever since.'

He said previously: 'Since Andy and Jamie have been in the public eye for the past couple of years, Judy has always been there with them.

"Libby Lane thought she was making  history this month as the first woman bishop for the Church of England. But it seems she was pipped to the post by an 11-year-old schoolgirl. Rebecca Howarth, from Manchester, became Britain's first female bishop when she took over from the Bishop of Manchester at the beginning of December - a post she will hold until Epiphany on January 6. At just 11 years old,  Rebecca Howarth has accepted the role of 'girl priest' in her local Oldham Parish Church . The service where Rebecca took over from the current Bishop of Manchester, left, at the beginning of December involved her pulling him out of his chair and sitting in it herself wearing her ceremonial robes . The ceremonial post has always been held by a boy but with the church's new rulings about women, the schoolgirl is making history of her own. She told The Telegraph: 'I was really excited ever since I found out I was going to be girl bishop. 'Really women are just as good as boys I think, they’re both equal to each other. If a boy can be bishop, I don’t see why girls can’t. I just believe that girls have a right to be as good as boys.' As regular churchgoers, Rebecca said her parents are very supportive of her new position, although her little sister feels a bit left out. Her priest suggested Rebecca for the role. 'Father Derek asked my mum if I wanted to think about it and as soon as I agreed it was announced in church. 'They’d decided it would be nice to have a girl. If I’d disagreed there were lots of others who would have done it,' she said. Rebecca,  here with Associate Priest Jean Hurlston, says  girls have a 'right to be as good as boys' The Medieval tradition sees the serving Bishop of Manchester symbolically step down from his duties at the church and a young church member take over the responsibilities during the festive season. Rebecca was officially invested at a special service on Monday by the bishop, David Walker. During the ceremony, she had to pull him out of his chair and sit in it herself. Church warden Marlene Armitage told the Manchester Evening News: 'Rebecca is our first ever girl bishop and she will be the country’s first female bishop because the first female bishop hasn’t yet been appointed after the decision was made to allow female bishops. 'We met to decide who would make a good bishop and Rebecca is a lovely girl and she comes to church every week. 'We asked the Bishop David Walker if we could have a girl bishop and he gave his approval.' Libby Lane made history when she was announced as the Church Of England's first woman bishop . Rev Libby Lane, 48, was recently announced as the first female bishop in the Church of England. The saxophone-playing mother-of-two has spent much of her career working in the north east and was announced as the new Bishop of Stockport, an assistant in the Chester Diocese. The historic move came a month after the General Synod in York approved legislation to elevate women to the position and 20 years after the first women were ordained as priests. The Rev Lane who was not the bookmakers’ favourite for the role, said she was grateful for the opportunity but admitted she was 'somewhat daunted' by the position.","Rebecca Howarth replaced Bishop of Manchester in a Medieval ceremony .

"A California family has won a $2.5 million settlement from the federal government after their  daughter was killed by a drunk congressional aide they claimed was on the job the night he took the wheel while intoxicated. Mallory Dies, 27, was struck and killed in December 2013 by Raymond Morua, a 32-year-old former aide to Santa Barbara Democratic Rep. Lois Capps. Dies' parents sued for wrongful death and claimed Capps' office hired Iraq war vet Morua despite his two prior DUI arrests, a hit-and-run and an embezzlement conviction. Wrongful death: Raymond Morua was drunk following a party he purportedly attended while 'on the clock' as a congressional aide when he struck and killed 27-year-old Mallory Dies in December 2013 before fleeing the scene . Denial: Rep. Capps also denied that Morua was working for her the night he got drunk at a part before killing Dies. But the Dies family attorney (Dies' father Matt is pictured left) argued he was. The federal government quietly settled with the family for $2.5 million in November . The federal government quietly settled in November, thereby avoiding a trial without admitting liability for Dies' death, reports KEYT. Her parents, Matt and Raeona Dies, initially named Morua, Capps, and the U.S. government in its filing. However, the federal government assumed liability for Capps as its employee and removed her from the amended court filing. Morua pleaded guilty earlier this year to DUI, manslaughter and fleeing the scene of a fatal collision. He's since been sentenced to 20 years to life behind bars. The Dies initial claim was that Morua was officially on the job the night of December 6, 2013--gladhanding in Rep. Lois Capps' stead at a private holiday party thrown by a local newspaper. Capps' spokesman insisted that their former employee was at the booze-fueled bash on his own when he bought eight cocktails and got behind the wheel. But Raymond Victor Morua III wrote in a sworn statement that the congresswoman's scheduler instructed him to attend the party. Not liable: Morua was an aide to Democratic U.S. Rep. Lois Capps when he drunkenly ran down Dies. He also had prior DUI arrests, a hit-and-run and an embezzlement conviction, which Capps' camp claims they were unaware of when they hired him. The federal government assumed liability for Capps as its employee, thus dropping her form Dies' parents' suit . DIES vs. CAPPS -- Wrongful Death Lawsuit by DailyMail.com . 'On or about November 27th, 2013, I was in Representative Capps' office and was told by Vianey Lopez that I was to attend a Christmas party on Dec. 5, 2013, at The Savoy, a club on State Street in Santa Barbara,' he wrote. He had reportedly attended the same event a year earlier as Capps' emmisary. 'Mr. Morua has said under oath, under penalty of perjury, that he was on the job,' Dies famiyl attorney Robert Stoll said earlier this year. Adding that if that's the case, 'then Lois Capps is responsible.' Investigative journalist Peter Lance published a lengthy exposé in which he details an alleged cover-up on the part of Capps staffers, aimed at sparing their boss the embarrassment of having hired and publicly praised Morua. But Capps has not been found responsible and the federal government admitted no wrongdoing while settling with Dies' family. Despite this, Matt Dies told KEYT that his family has gotten what they were after. 'This lawsuit wasn't about the money. It was about accountability,' he said. 'I feel like what we have been saying all along has been given legitimacy.'

"With her long blonde hair, blue eyes and pale complexion, Alexandra Jenkins was constantly compared to Queen Elsa by customers while working as a John Lewis shop assistant. The 20-year-old would even be pestered by young Frozen fans who kept mistaking her for the fictional Disney character on a daily basis. Now Alexandra, who was forced to wear a disguise to look less like the cartoon queen, has decided to embrace her features - and has launched a career as a lookalike. Scroll down for video . Alexandra Jenkins was pestered by children who constantly mistook her for Disney's Queen Elsa . Alexandra, from Portbury, Bristol, now leads a double life, appearing at children's parties and corporate events during the evening and at weekends. She said her new venture became an obvious option after an increasing number of people began comparing her to the Disney princess. And she has even started singing lessons to perform Let It Go. 'It all kind of took off in January last year really. I was told by a lot of people I looked similar to Elsa and then it just kind of escalated from there,' she said. 'By the start of December I was getting told I looked like Elsa all the time; I get parents come up to me all the time telling me I look like Elsa, as well as the kids.' Alexandra says she can't go a day without someone pointing out her likeness to the Frozen character, right . As well as continuing her job at John Lewis Alexandra can now be hired to appear at children's parties . Alexandra says that she was 'recognised' so often by customers at John Lewis that she took to wearing thick spectacles in order to disguise herself. 'At work the only thing which is able to disguise me is the fact I have glasses, or sometimes wearing my hear down works,' she said. 'If I don't wear my glasses, or even when I do sometimes, the likelihood is I get a lot of people coming up to me telling me I look like Elsa. 'Over the summer lots of kids come in to get their back to school stuff and they tell me I look like Elsa, or their parents start pointing me out.' Alexandra will often do a shift in the department store and then go straight on to make an appearance as Elsa . Due to her icy blonde hair and pale complexion it takes Alexandra under an hour to make a full transformation . Alexandra has worked in the children's clothes section in John Lewis at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol, for almost three years but has found it easy to incorporate her new career into her life. Her blonde plait and poignant face-shape mean it only takes her half an hour to transform herself into the famous Princess after work or at weekends. 'My hair is real so I don't have to wear a wig which makes it a lot more believable for the kids. 'It takes me no longer than half an hour to transformed into Elsa, I just put on my dress, put my hair in plait and then put some purple eye shadow and the rest of my make-up on. Alexandra is so convincing as the Disney princess she was even offered the role of Elsa at Disneyland Paris . 'The make up takes the longest amount of time but it really isn't a big job.' Alexandra says that, thus far, her business has been a huge success and she has been thrilled with the response. 'I've had a great reaction. People are always asking me if I do events or parties. It helps that I genuinely look like her. People stop me in the street quite a lot.' Single Alexandra's likeness to Elsa has even been noticed by Disney who offered her the role of the character at Disneyland Paris. Alexandra decided to turn it down but is now booked for around four appearances a week. She has even taken up singing lessons to perfect the voice of the popular film character making her likeness even more authentic. 'I'm having singing lessons at the moment so that I can perfect Let it Go,' she said. Alexandra has even started singing lessons so she can belt out Let It Go . Alexandra, who can be booked for children's parties, says she's surprised how much it's taken off . 'With the role you get quite a lot of kids asking you to sing it, I don't want to let myself down. It also really helps you to get into character, blasting it out.' Despite her triumphs, Alexandra says that her new job can be quite testing and she does occasionally resent her uncanny appearance with the Frozen star. 'It can be frustrating sometimes. However much I look like her obviously I am still Alexandra as well and sometime people forget that.' Despite this she adds that she is flattered to be compared to Elsa and is very grateful for the attention. 'However it's lovely to be compared to such a popular character. People can obviously see the similarities as it draws attention to me all the time. 'I'm so surprised by how much it has taken off. There are so many other lookalikes around so I was amazed at how many people started booking me.'

"Margaret Thatcher was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘unscrupulous’ practices in the City, according to newly-released government papers. Her most senior official, Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong, set out his ‘increasing disquiet’ about ‘the things that people think are going on in the City’. He said that a ‘bubble’ was being created that would be ‘pricked’ and said that ‘corners were being cut’ and money made in ways ‘that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous’. Scroll down for video . Margaret Thatcher was warned that her financial sector reforms would lead to a new culture of ‘unscrupulous’ practices in the City in the 1980s . Independent regulation was the only solution to the problem, Sir Robert argued. Critics claim that Mrs Thatcher’s reform of the financial sector paved the way for the ‘loadsamoney’ era and the future financial crisis of 2007 which led to economic downturn. The memo came just months before the Big Bang - the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange and its replacement with electronic trading floors and foreign investors. It was so called because the change meant a huge increase in activity and established London as the premier international financial centre and brought huge wealth to City workers. But it was also a period also of financial scandals - most notably the Guinness share-rigging affair which involved an attempt to manipulate the stock market. In an extraordinary memorandum contained in files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London, Sir Robert put down on paper his doubts about the effect the changes were having. Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong set out his ‘increasing disquiet’ about ‘the things that people think are going on in the City’ in a memo to the Prime Minister in March 1986 . Jan 1984: FTSE 100 index of 100 leading shares created, at a base of 1,000 points . Oct 1986: The Big Bang reforms deregulated the stock market, with new technology sweeping aside old trading practices. Banks were able to buy up old stockbroking firms, seeing high street names becoming players on the stock market . 19 Oct 1987: Black Monday sees stock values crash around the world, down almost 11 per cent. The following day the FTSE fell by 12.22 per cent . 30 Dec 1999:  FTSE peaks at 6950.6, a level not since surpassed . 11 Sep 2001: US terror attacks cause panic around the world and the FTSE falls by almost 6 per cent . 4 Sep 2007: The amount banks lend to each other hits highest level since 1998 . 14 Sep 2007: Northern Rock goes to the Bank of England for a bailout after suffering a run on its money . 15 Sep 2008: Lehman Brothers collapses . 29 Sep 2008: FTSE falls 5.3 per cent after Bradford and Bingley is nationalised . 21 Jan 2008: FTSE slumps 5.5 per cent, wiping £77billion off the value of shares . 13 Oct 2008: UK government orders £37billion bailout of RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS . His note, dated March 17 1986, seven months before the Big Bang, was addressed to Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary Nigel Wicks, who would almost certainly have shown it to her. While he acknowledged his concerns were ‘pretty vague and unspecific’, he said that he was by no means alone in harbouring such doubts. ‘I do not know whether you are having the same experience but I am finding, among people who work outside the City of London but whose activities bring them into touch in some degree with the City, that there is increasing disquiet about the things that people think are going on in the City,’ he wrote. ‘I do not just mean the levels of remuneration; a lot of people, including some from inside the City, think that is a bubble that will be pricked in a year or two. ‘They think more about the way in which corners are being cut and money is being made in ways that are at least bordering on the unscrupulous. ‘It tends to be summed up by the people saying that they doubt whether it really is good enough any more to leaving the policing of the City to self-regulation. ‘I’m afraid that all this is pretty vague and unspecific; but I find it sufficiently prevalent to be concerned.’ Mrs Thatcher received an altogether rosier assessment from David Willetts, who was then working in the No 10 policy unit and who co-authored a paper for her on the likely impact of Big Bang. The paper dismissed concerns that it could lead to a repeat of the ‘boom and bust’ which followed previous City deregulation in 1971 when a property boom was followed by a market collapse and a banking crisis. ‘This does not mean that there might not be individual financial failures as a result of bad commercial decisions, but we do not expect a systemic problem,’ the paper noted.","Cabinet secretary Sir Robert Armstrong set out his ‘increasing disquiet’

"In his own words: Jay Wilds exclusively spoke to The Intercept about the 1999 killing of Hae Min Lee for the first time since the trial of Adnan Syed . Nearly two weeks after the hit podcast Serial finished its triumphant 12-episode run, Jay Wilds, a key figure in the engrossing real-life murder mystery, broke his silence for the first time about the 1999 case. Listeners of the spinoff podcast of the long-running radio program This American Life know Jay as the star witness for the prosecution in the state's case against Adnan Syed. As part of a plea deal, Wilds testified against Syed saying that the popular Woodlawn High School student strangled to death his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, because he was angry she had broken up with him. Wilds told detectives he helped Syed bury Lee's body in a Baltimore park but vehemently denied taking part in the 1999 killing. In December 2000, Syed was convicted of murder and received a life sentence. Wilds avoided prison time altogether. Journalist Sarah Koenig, who had spent more than a year reinvestigating the January 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee for Serial, raised serious questions about Wilds' involvement in the case and his motives, methodically picking apart his testimony during the trial. In an exclusive interview with The Intercept, which will be published in several installments beginning this week, Mr Wilds, who is married and has children, took Koenig to task for misrepresenting him. Offering his side of the story for the first time since the Syed trial, Wilds largely stuck to his version of events from 15 years ago, saying that Adnan talked to him about killing Hae a week before she went missing. Jilted lover: According to Wilds, when his friend Adnan Syed (left) was dumped by his first serious girlfriend, Hae Min Lee (right),  he took it to heart because the breakup made him feel like a 'loser' Woodlawn High School in Baltimore was rocked by Hae's killing in January 1999 . Together: The only image of the young couple together, along with other - unidentified - students at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County, Maryland. The school was where the couple met . But those who listened closely to the wildly popular podcast will notice some discrepancies in Wilds’ latest version of events. 'It was at least a week before she died, when he found out she was either cheating on him or leaving him,' Wilds told The Intercept. 'We were in the car, we were riding, smoking. He just started opening up... Just normal conversation ike, ""I think she’s fucking around. I’m gonna kill that bitch, man.""' However, Sarah Koenig reported that Adnan and Hae had broken up weeks before she was strangled to death and dumped in Baltimore's notorious Leakin Park. January 13, 1999: Hae Min Lee, a senior at Woodlawn High School, vanishes . February 9: A man who stopped for an emergency bathroom break finds Hae's body in a shallow grave in a Baltimore city parl . February 12: Anonymous tip-off tells police to look at Adnan Syed as a suspect . February 18: Police seize his cell phone records . February 27: Jennifer Pusateri tells detectives Jay Wilds has told her that Syed killed Hae . February 28: Syed is arrested hours after Wilds shows police Hae's car . September 7: Wilds pleads guilty to accessory after the fact to first degree murder . December 15: Syed's first trial is declared a mistrial . February 2000 25: Syed is convicted of first degree murder . June 6: Syed begins life plus 30 years sentence . 2003: Review of case but conviction remains . 2012: Second review does not find in Syed's favor . October 3, 2014: First episode of Serial . December 18: Serial wraps up 12-episode season . Wilds went on to say that to him, Adnan's threats sounded like nothing more than the rants of a jilted teenager 'blowing off steam.' 'I thought at worst he'd throw a rock through her window or something,' Wilds told the reporter. Turning to the question of a motive, Wilds claimed that the breakup had a devastating effect on Adnan because to him the relationship meant much more than it did to Hae. According to Wilds, when Hae decided to leave him, Adnan was left feeling like a 'loser,' which pained him greatly. 'What else could motivate you to choke the life out of someone you cared about?' Wilds speculated. 'He just couldn’t come to grips with those feelings… He failed; he lost the girl. Calling to mind the day of Hae's murder, Wilds said he did not know his friend was planning to kill his ex-girlfriend when Adnan loaned him his car and cellphone after school. According to Wilds, it was not until he picked Adnan up later in the day on January 13, 1999, that the high school senior told him he had killed Hae. Although during police questioning, and later during the trial, Wilds testified that he first saw the girl's body in the trunk of her car outside a Best Buy store, in The Intercept interview he claimed it happened outside his grandmother's house. ‘I didn’t tell the cops it was in front of my house because I didn’t want to involve my grandmother,' he explained the discrepancy. Wilds said when he finally saw Hae's body, she looked 'purple' and her legs dressed in stockings were tucked behind her. According to Wilds, Adnan forced him into helping him bury Hae's body by threatening to turn him in to police for running a drug dealing operation out of his grandmother's house. ‘Adnan says, “Just help me dig the hole.” And I’m still thinking, “Inner-city black guy, selling pot to high school kids.” The cops are going to fry me. They’re gonna pin me to the f***ing wall,’ he told the website. Inconsistencies: While during the trial Wilds said he first saw Hae's body in the trunk of her car outside this Best Buy, in the interview with The Intercept he said it took place outside his grandmother's house . Burial ground: Wilds admitted to have assisted Syed in burying Lee's body at Leakin Park in Baltimore . In Sarah Koenig’s podcast, much has been made of the many inconsistencies, both big and small, in Jay Wilds’ story, and how it kept changing over time, from his first interview with police to his testimony in Syed’s second trial. Producer: Sarah Koenig is the producer and former Baltimore Sun reporter who has created the cult podcast . Addressing the discrepancies, Wilds said initially he was not willing to cooperate with police for fear of incriminating himself as a drug dealer, and also because he did not want to get his friends in trouble in connection to the Hae murder. ‘I wasn’t fully cooperating, so if they said, “Well, we have on phone records that you talked to Jenn.” I’d say, “Nope, I didn’t talk to Jenn.” Until Jenn told me that she talked with the cops and that it was ok if I did too. ‘That’s the best way I can account for the inconsistencies. Once the police made it clear that my drug dealing wasn’t gonna affect the outcome of what was going on, I became a little bit more transparent,’ he said. Sarah Koenig wrapped up Season 1 of Serial December 18, saying in conclusion that while she cannot say with certainty that Adnan Syed is innocent, based on the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution during the trial, he should have never been convicted of the murder. The Innocence Project at the University of Virginia has taken up Syed’s case at Koenig’s request and has identified alternative suspects, including a serial rapist who died in prison several years ago. in September, Maryland's Court of Special Appeals asked the state to respond to arguments about Syed's alibi and previous attorney. Syed's attorney Justin Brown said the Court of Special Appeals will decide whether to hear the appeal and if it does, whether Syed, now 34, deserves a new trial.","Jay Wilds was star witness for the prosecution in the murder trial of Adnan Syed in 2000 .

"Concerns: Europol director Rob Wainwright has warned of travelling crooks who exploit cheap flights and visa-free travel to commit crime abroad . Travelling criminals are exploiting cheap flights and visa-free travel to launch 'burglary blitzes' in foreign countries including the UK, says Europe's top policeman. Organised criminals are flying in crooks from eastern Europe for short-term crime sprees, then shipping them out before they can be tracked by police, said the chief of Europol. The growth of such gangs is now raising questions about the ability of British police to cope with international organised crime. One in seven people arrested last year in England and Wales was a foreign national. Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, the European crime agency, told i: 'In the past, 95 per cent of housebreakers were committed within half-a-mile. 'Now you're having Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian gangs and others from across Europe jumping on airlines, knocking off [homes and businesses], and almost getting out of the country the next day. 'We have some criminal groups we've identified in Europe that are operating literally in every European country over a one- or two-year programme.' Last year it was revealed that police from Eastern Europe were being drafted in by their British counterparts in a crackdown on the growing number of foreign criminals. For the first time officers from Poland, Lithuania and Romania were working alongside British colleagues and targeting known convicts from their home countries. But since then the tactics used by international gangs have only got more sophisticated. The i cited senior police who said foreign crooks were increasingly working with domestic criminals to plan crimes and launder the profits. And those criminals who are caught before they are able to flee the country are increasingly being allowed to stay, according to a report earlier this month that found hundreds are escaping deportation. John Vine, the independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, gave the report to the Home Secretary in the summer but it was only published at the beginning of this month. The report looked at a major new scheme known as Operation Nexus, which involves immigration officials working in police stations to run checks on suspects’ immigration status and criminal history. It concluded that despite significant improvements in some areas, many foreign offenders were still being released by police without checking they were allowed to be in the country. Heathrow Airport border control: Organised criminals are flying in crooks from eastern Europe for short-term crime sprees, then shipping them out before they can be tracked by police, said Mr Wainwright . The scheme has had a ‘positive impact’ after it was introduced in London in October 2012, the report said. The number of immigration offenders deported from the capital has risen by 158 per cent from 418 in 2011-12 to 1,077 in 2013-14. But 336 of 717 foreign nationals detained by West Midlands Police – the other force in the scheme’s trial – were released before their immigration status was checked. The force also only saw a small rise in the number of foreign criminals that were removed – from 239 in 2012-13 to 274 last year. And some suspects held by the Metropolitan Police were freed because staff shortages meant there were no immigration officers available to run the checks.","Crooks from eastern Europe are being flown in for short-term crime sprees .

"Two of the rarest turtles in the world have been washed ashore on the west coast of Britain after being swept almost 5,000 miles from its usual home in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtles, which are critically endangered, were discovered on beaches in Merseyside and Cumbria. It is thought the dinner-plate sized reptiles had been left too weak to fight against the ocean currents by unusually cold weather in the Gulf of Mexico. This juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtle remains in a critical condition after being found barely alive on a beach on Walney Island, off Barrow in Cumbria, 4,660 miles from its usual home in warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico . The 'cold stunned' turtles are thought to have been carried across the Atlantic Ocean by the Gulf Stream together with strong westerly winds. There are only 30 record incidents of Kemp's Ridley turtles being stranded on Irish and British beaches in the past. They may spend their lives swimming the world's oceans hunting jelly fish and shell fish from the sea floor, but it seems that sea turtles can suffer decompression sickness. Scientists have diagnosed the sickness for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles. The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive. In humans, it can produce many symptoms from joint pain to paralysis and death, but it is not known what animals feel. However, it appears that turtles that surface from a deep dive too quickly can also suffer from the condition. Those accidentally caught in fishing nets are most likely to suffer. Most have been washed ashore already dead, so experts say to find the two turtles alive is extremely rare. However, one of the turtles - found on Formby Beach in Sefton, Merseyside, - has since died while the other remains alive. Marine biologists believe there may be other turtles that have suffered the same fate and have asked the public to be vigilant. Rod Penrose, strandings coordinator of the UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, said: 'It looks like there has been a large cold standing event off the eastern seaboard of the USA. 'The sea temperatures dropped causing large numbers of Kemp's Ridley turtles to become cold stunned. 'This condition leaves the turtles in a lethargic condition unable to feed or swim against strong currents.' Mr Penrose added that the surviving turtle will be flown back the a rescue centre in North Carolina so it can be released back into the wild. He said: 'These are the rarest turtles in the world so even just a few individuals being lost in this way can impact the populuation.' The turtles were swept 4,664 miles from their usual breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico by strong currents . This juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtle was found alive on Formby beach in Sefton, Merseyside, by walker Rod Archer (pictured holding the reptile) but it later died despite being taken into care by the RSPCA . There are an estimated 1,000-5,000 breeding females left in the world, which all next on just a single beach in Mexico. During the 1980s their numbers were reduced to just a few hundred but a major conservation effort, including translocating eggs from Mexico to a beach in Texas, has seen their numbers increase. The smallest of the sea turtles, they can grow to be up to 70cm (27 inches) long and weigh up to 60kg (132 lbs). They normally feed on crabs and other crustaceans around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. In the past most Kemp's Ridley turtles that are swept to Britain tend to have damaged flippers or are two young to fight the strong currents of the Gulf Stream. However, most have been found on beaches in South West England and Wales. The Kemp's Ridley found in Cumbria was too weak to swim after being stunned by cold water temperatures . The rescued turtles are around the size of dinner plates and are thought to be juveniles too weak to swim against the strong ocean currents and winds that have swept across the Atlantic during the past month . The most recent turtles were found far further north and experts believe strong winds in December helped carry them there. The first was discovered on Formby beach in Sefton, Merseyside by Rob Archer, from Ramsbottom, on Saturday 20 December while he was walking with his girlfriend. He told the Liverpool Echo: 'At first I thought it was a crab. It seemed to be in a stupor as if there wasn't much life left in it. 'My firstt thought was to put it back in the sea, so I walked out into some deeper water and it swam away. 'I have since heard I shouldn’t have done that and I do feel bad about it.' However, the turtle washed ashore again nearby on Monday 22 December and was taken into care by the RSPCA. It later died. The surviving turtle is now being cared for by specialist vets at the Lake District Coast Aquarium in Maryport . The second turtle was discovered on a beach on Walney Island on Sunday 21 December and was taken to the Lake District Coast Aquarium in Maryport, where it is being cared for by specialist vets. Experts are now warning that anyone who finds a turtle should not try to put them back into the sea. Dr Peter Richardson, Biodiversity Programme Manager at the Marine Conservation Society said: 'We advise never to put live stranded turtles in the UK back in the sea as they will almost certainly perish.' Emily Baxter, marine conservation officer with the North West Wildlife Trusts, added: 'It is rare for non-native turtles to be washed ashore in the North West but there have been strong westerly winds over December. 'Stray juveniles can sometimes be carried by strong currents from warmer seas and this might explain why they are so far away from home.' Anyone who finds a stranded turtle should report it to the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme on 0800 6520333 or at www.ukstrandings.org.","Two juvenile Kemp's Ridley turtles were found alive by walkers on Formby beach, in Sefton, Merseyside, and on Walney Island, off Barrow in Cumbria .

"Italian authorities took control Tuesday of a cargo ship carrying hundreds of migrants after the crew disappeared and set it on a programmed route to crash into a coast, officials said. The alarm was first raised about the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M after a passenger sent a distress call earlier Tuesday when the ship was off Greece. Greek authorities scrambled a navy frigate and helicopter, but the captain said the vessel wasn't in distress and didn't require assistance. The ship then headed on its own toward Italy. As it neared Santa Maria di Leuca, on the southernmost tip of the 'heel' of boot-shaped Italy, Italian port authorities dispatched two helicopters as a precaution and boarded the ship with a team of six coast guard officials. Scroll down for video . An armed special missions officer of the Greek coast guard prepares to set off from Corfu harbour for waters off the Ionian island of Othoni, responding to a distress signal from Moldovan-registered 'Blue Sky M' Distress call: Moldovan cargo ship Blue Sky was allegedly carrying 700 illegal immigrants when it sent out the distress call (not pictured today) Coast guard spokesman Commander Filippo Marini said the team took control of the ship after determining there was no crew to be found. He said the Italians 'avoided disaster' by interrupting the programmed route that would have had the ship crash into shore. He said the motor had been blocked, and that the Italian crew was trying to unblock it so that it could be safely brought into port. Tens of thousands of migrants and refugees, most fleeing conflict or poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, attempt to reach the European Union each year, most heading by sea to Italy or Greece. The smugglers who organize the trips often abandon the ships before they reach shore to avoid arrest. The operation came two days after a Greek-operated ferry caught fire between Greece and Italy with the loss of at least 11 lives, prompting a two-day search and rescue effort. A merchant marine ministry official said the distress call had come from one of the passengers on board the ship, a man who had told emergency services 'we have no water, blankets, or food'. This afternoon, BBC producer Piers Scholfield tweeted that a Greek frigate sent to aid Blue Sky M made contact, and was told the ship is 'not in danger, but needs food supplies'. He also posted: 'Greek coastguard spokesman tells my colleague the ship Blue Sky M is now under Italian jurisdiction & no one on board is in danger.' Two military helicopters who flew over Blue Sky M this afternoon reported no sign of life onboard, according to Greek news website prothemanews.com . The rescue operation is being coordinated by the Corfu harbour master. The Hellenic Navy frigate 'Navarino' and an S-70 Sikorsky helicopter have also been sent to the area . Shiptracking service  show that Blue Sky has recently changed its course and made a sharp turn towards Italy instead of Croatia where it was heading . Further shiptracking data shows that Blue Sky made two sharp turns before heading towards Italy . The incident comes two days after a Greek passenger ferry with more than 400 people on board caught fire in the same area, leading to a huge rescue operation by Italian and Greek coast guard and military officials. At least 10 people died in that incident, while more than 400 were rescued. Authorities are still searching for potential missing passengers from the Norman Atlantic ferry. The Greek frigate Navarino, which is heading to locate the cargo ship, had been in the area assisting in the rescue operation for the Norman Atlantic.","Ship carrying 600 illegal immigrants' issue distress call near Corfu .

"Two men opened fire on a police car patrolling a tough part of Los Angeles, but the two officers inside were not injured and one was able to shoot back, authorities said Monday. One suspect was later arrested and the other was on the loose. The shooting occurred amid heightened tensions over attacks on police elsewhere in the country after grand juries declined to indict white officers in the killings of unarmed black men. Police have not yet determined a motive for Sunday night's shooting in South Los Angeles — an area plagued by gang violence — but said there were no indications it was linked to other attacks on police in the country. Scroll down for video . A crime scene is set up in South Los Angeles after two men opened fire on a patrol car with two officers inside. According to authorities the area is plagued by gang violence . 'It was a completely unprovoked attack,' LAPD Deputy Chief Bob Green said initially. 'They were just driving on the street, and somebody struck out and tried to kill two policemen.' However, Green later said police were looking into whether the officers might have driven into an ongoing dispute and were inadvertently fired at. 'Last night the initial assessment, based on the reaction of officers and the adrenaline factor, was they were getting ambushed, but, you know, things change and it takes a lot to investigate this,' Green said. Officers arrested one man shortly after the attack. Christopher Taylor, 18, was booked on suspicion of shooting at an occupied vehicle. An hours-long search followed for the other man, but he remained at large. Police found a handgun and rifle at the scene, and were looking for video evidence and conducting interviews to determine details such as why and how the shooting occurred. No one was injured in the attack, however the LAPD have begun their investigation. The incident comes amid tension nationwide between police and protesters rallying against their tactics . The two officers were responding to an unrelated radio call and driving slowly in a neighborhood when they saw two men on a sidewalk and the flash of a rifle being fired, police said. The officers stopped the car, and one got out and returned fire as the men fled. Police found one suspect, uninjured, a short time later along with a rifle and a pistol. Police searched the neighborhood throughout the night for the other man, warning nearby residents to stay in their homes. Police stopped the search after the man wasn't found. Chief Charlie Beck said at a news conference Monday that he was concerned that people might be targeting officers but added that the neighborhood had been marred by gang violence during the past several months and there had been a significant number of gang shootings. Officers stand next to a patrol car at the scene. LAPD spokeswoman Officer Nuria Venegas said Monday that one man was under arrest and a second suspect was on the run . 'It's gettin' bad, it's gettin' real bad,' resident Isiah Frierson, 65, said Monday. 'You can't go nowhere.' Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said the 'blatant violence' was an outrage. 'Anyone who is willing to murder a law enforcement officer threatens the fundamental fabric of our society, and that should terrify the community,' Izen said in a statement. 'Murdering police officers is not a form of protest. It is an affront to all citizens and to public safety.' The shooting came as protesters in California and across the country have rallied for weeks against police killings of unarmed black men in Missouri and New York. The killing of two New York City officers in their patrol car has authorities on edge across the country. The New York gunman ambushed the officers then killed himself after posting threats online, including references to the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York City. Both were killed by white officers. Police searched the neighborhood throughout the night for the other man, warning nearby residents to stay in their homes .","One officer was able to fire back during shooting in South Los Angeles .

"A woman who alleged she was raped at a party by four men, including two college football players in 1998, has discovered that all of the evidence in the case has been destroyed. Brenda Tracy had not been named publicly until recently when she told her story to Oregonian sports columnist John Canzano. But during a meeting with the president of Oregon State University she was heartbroken to learn that a catalogue of mistakes had been made and all of the evidence was gone. Speaking out: Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon, bravely came forward to give her account of how she was brutally raped and sodomized 16 years ago . President Ed Ray had offered an apology to Tracy in November, after years of silence, and vowed to review the university's response  to see if there were actions the school could take now. But during their meeting this month, which lasted more than hour, he handed her a two-page letter in a plain envelope. It outlined Oregon State's internal investigation into its handling of her alleged gang rape in 1998 by four men, including Beavers' football players Calvin Carlyle and Jason Dandridge. And while he said the university condemned the alleged brutal rape, and stressed that the institution had committed a 'moral failure' in her case, nothing would be done. Ms Tracy, who decided not to participate in the case told Canzano she now wishes she had. She  told Ray: 'I'm stuck with this memory of four men surrounding me, high-fiving as they treated me like garbage. It just doesn't equate.' Oregon State President Ed Ray (pictured) personally apologized to Brenda Tracy for the school's failure to support her through the ordeal but has confirmed nothing will be done . OSU head football coach Mike Riley suspended two of the men for one game and was quoted as saying they had made 'a bad choice' - a remark he now regrets making . 'I don't know how to feel about all these people not caring,' she said. 'I don't know what this says about me, or human beings in general.' The four men were arrested in 1998, but prosecutors didn't press charges because Ms Tracy decided not to participate in the case. Tracy told Canzano she now wishes she had. The Oregonian  found that the university community never responded after she reported the assault and poor decisions were made by local police and the district attorney's office. Evidence was destroyed years before the statute of limitations expired - despite the strong urging by a deputy district attorney to preserve it. Ms Tracy told how she had decided in 1998 to go through with a rape examination and then to commit suicide because 'I was already dead.' But the kindness of the nurse who did the rape examination got her through and inspired her also to become a nurse, she said. She came forward 16 years later because she remained haunted by the words of Oregon State coach Mike Riley, who said two players had made 'a bad choice.' Ms Tracy went to police in 1998 to say she was gang-raped, sodomized, robbed, and then re-victimized. She told investigators the men stood around, watching it happen and cheering the others on. At one point, she said she begged one of the men to make it stop but none of her attackers did. Two Oregon State football players, defensive back Calvin Carlyle, 18, and running back Jason Dandridge, then 20, were named as suspects in the report. The other suspects were Michael Ainsworth 18, a Southern California high school football recruit and Nakia 'Ken' Ware, a 23-year-old community college defensive back who was on probation. Suspects: Michael Ainsworth, 18, left, was a Southern California high school football recruit. Nakia 'Ken' Ware, right, was a 23-year-old community college defensive back, was on probation for armed robbery in California . Accused: Oregon State running back Jason Dandridge, left, was 20 when he was identified as a suspect. Oregon State defensive back Calvin Carlyle, right, was 18 when he was named as a suspect . Larry Roper, who served 19 years as the vice provost for student affairs told The Oregonian: 'Sex assaults were murky.' If Tracy's report had escalated to a student-conduct hearing in 1998, it would have been Roper's duty to handle any appeal - but it didn't. Roper added: 'I look back now and think, '(Expletive), we could have really done something.' 'We had no idea back then how to conduct an investigation, it was a difficult road. There's no comparison between now and then. 'There's no point in even trying to draw a straight line -- good luck -- because one doesn't exist.' Pete Sandrock,the former district attorney of Benton County in December 1999, was tasked with the responsibility of investigating the case. He said: 'I came upon my name in the story and I just let out a, 'Oh s—.' Meanwhile, at Oregon State, the administration could not do anything, because Tracy had reported the alleged crime to an OSU sexual assault support counselor named JoAnne Dodgeson. Dodgeson talked with Tracy and later obtained a copy of the police report. The counselor gave the 38-page report to the university's student conduct department. It meant campus officials had access to the details, but made questionable decisions. At the time of the attack, in 1998, Brenda Tracy was 24 years old and working as a waitress. The blonde with shoulder-length hair was 5 ft 10 inches tall and weighed 140lbs. She was a single mother to two boys, ages four and five. She took a late-night excursion from Keizer to Corvallis with her best friend, Karmen McFadden, who were supposed to meet up with her boyfriend and a group of friends. But  the woman ended up naked, in various degrees of consciousness, on the living room floor with men taking turns to rape her. Afterwards, none of the four suspects asked for legal representation. However, all were read their rights and each blamed the other. The suspects told police the 24-year-old vomited in the restroom, asked to be left alone and said 'No,' at different points in the course of the seven-hour ordeal. Ms Tracy recalls waking up with someone pouring alcohol down her throat and her clothes tossed around. Players:  Oregon State players are pictured at  Reser Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon . She said she was assaulted with a flashlight and digitally penetrated, and someone put ice on her groin. Ms Tracy told investigators that she woke up at another point and found Ainsworth on top of her having sex with her. The others, she said, were standing around the room, cheering. She told police she heard someone shout, 'Yea dog!' Ainsworth told police he took Tracy's clothes off and had consensual sex with her. The other players mostly denied involvement in the rape. Police obtained a search warrant for the house and found five used condoms in a bathroom wastebasket, alcohol bottles and a bag of marijuana. They also took DNA samples, including hair and fibers. A toxicology report the following day came back negative for drugs. When she woke up, she got in the car and drove home. All four suspects were arrested and booked into the Benton County Jail on charges of sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration and sex abuse. District Attorney Pete Sandrock had a solid case on his hands, with copious amounts of evidence, but Ms Tracy was hesitant to set the rape case in motion because her boyfriend was a former OSU football player. 'What happened to me was not my choice,' Tracy said. 'What they did to me was not my choice. They violated me. I was garbage to them.' Lois Krzeszewski, a former Oregon Department of Education employee, served as adviser to then-Oregon State President Paul Risser on the Commission for the Status of Women on Campus. She said: 'There was a lack of reporting when it came to sex assaults on campus. 'We had a real problem, and everyone knew it.'","Brenda Tracy, 40, from Oregon came forward last month to detail a chilling account of how she reported the rape to police .

"The mayor of Melbourne claims up to a third of beggars in the city are actually backpackers looking to earn money. Officials in the Australian city are struggling with a rising number of beggars, despite it being illegal and leading to fines of more than £50. The city's Lord Mayor, Robert Doyle, says an increasing number of tourists are begging to boost their travel funds. Scroll down for video . Authorities worry that travellers are taking much needed earnings away from the city's homeless community . And according to Australian newspaper The Herald Sun, over a third of the city's beggars are actually backpackers, largely males under thirty years old. Mayor Doyle said: 'Service providers tell me that international tourists make up around a third of the people begging on Melbourne's streets at the moment.' It is thought that beggars can make between £20 and £100 per day. But authorities worry that shoe-string travellers are taking much needed earnings away from the city's homeless community. Over a third of Melbourne's beggars are actually backpackers, largely males under thirty years old . 'Some of those international backpackers are operating on a very tight budget and so in their minds, they see it as OK to beg to try to raise additional funds,' Major Brendan Nottle, from the Salvation Army told the newspaper. He also warned city dwellers not to give beggars money, suggesting that buying someone a meal would be more appropriate if they were keen to help. It was recently revealed that carparks in the city had been transformed into illegal makeshift campsites for travellers wanting to save cash, and some backpackers had even taken food intended to feed the homeless.","There is a rising number of bogus beggars in Melbourne, Australia .

She is still assisting police with their investigations into the alleged homicide of the infant, as well as the baby's three-year-old sibling in July 2013. The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said. When asked whether there could be further charges laid, Detective Senior Sergeant Tony Green told reporters: 'All I'm saying at this stage is the investigation is ongoing.' 'The investigation is still ongoing in regards to those two children and also the charges that are currently before the court,' he said.

"Expat pensioners living in the hottest parts of Europe like the Costa del Sol are finally going to lose taxpayer-funded help with their heating bills, it can be revealed. Britain is spending £22million-a-year on winter fuel allowances for people living elsewhere in Europe, despite more than a third living in sunnier climes. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today condemns the 'absurd' handouts and vows to change the rules which have cost the UK taxpayer £130million in a decade. People living in Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Malta, Gibraltar and France will lose out, but the taxpayer still faces a bill for pensioners in 25 countries including Poland, Bulgaria and Finland. Scroll down for video . Last year Britain sent £8.7million in winter fuel payments to Spain, which enjoys much warmer winters than pensioners in the UK . The winter fuel allowance is worth at least £200 for the over-62s, rising to £300 for the over-80s. Official guidance says it is supposed 'to help pay your heating bills' and is designed as a flat sum for all pensioners to put towards the costs of keeping warm during the icy winter months. But EU rules mean it can be paid to expats if they can show they have a 'genuine link with the UK', and the money does not necessarily have to be spent on energy bills. As a result thousands of people living in warm European countries are able to receive the money, and spend it how they like. In 2002-03, just 8,000 people in 16 countries claimed at a total cost of £1million. But huge growth in take-up and EU expansion means that in 2013-14 a total of 135,285 people in 30 countries received £133million. It includes 50,000 people in Spain, 30,000 in France, 3,300 in Portugal, 8,000 in Cyprus and 2,000 in Greece. Now ministers plan to introduce a new 'temperature test' to stop payments being made to countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK – the South West at 5.6C (42F). People in Portugal, Spain, Greece, France, Malta and Cyprus will all lose the right to claim from September 2015. The Department for Work and Pensions today confirmed pensioners in Gibraltar will also miss out. But the handouts will still be available to people in 25 countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland. The cost of paying winter fuel allowances to pensioners living outside the UK has rocketed from £1million in 2002-03 to £133million in 2013-14, official figures show . If the rules had been in place last winter it would have cut the bill from £23million to just £7million. Mr Duncan Smith told MailOnline: 'Winter fuel payments exist to help Britain's pensioners keep themselves warm. 'It's absurd and offensive that taxpayers are funding these payments for people who have retired to the Mediterranean and enjoy warmer weather.' Legislation to introduce the temperature test has now been laid in Parliament and will come into force for next winter, 2015-16. Mr Duncan Smith added: 'The European Union has frustrated our attempts to address this issue in the past, but with our new temperature-based eligibility criteria we're able to satisfy EU rules as well as prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers' money.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the new temperature test would 'prevent this obscene waste of taxpayers' money' The average temperature in Spain in December and January is 13C, almost double the average in the South West of England. David Cameron vowed at the last election to protect the winter fuel allowance from cuts, despite complaints that the payments were not needed by wealthy pensioners. However, both the Lib Dems and Labour have said it is wrong to pay the money to rich pensioners who do not need it. Labour leader Ed Miliband used a speech earlier this month to set out his plan for 'common sense spending reductions, not slash and burn'. He said: 'We have already set out ways in which we can save money [including] an end to the winter fuel allowance for the wealthiest pensioners.' Lib Dem Deputy PM Nick Clegg has also warned the system is unfair. He said last year: 'The fact that we're asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who don't need to heat their homes because they live in sunny parts of Europe and maybe didn't even work here before they retired, I think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system.'","EXCLUSIVE: New rules curbing handouts to start from September .

"Police shot and killed a man who had posted an online video threatening to kill police and FBI agents after he tried to use his car to run down officers trying to arrest him in a Philadelphia suburb. Officers feared the man would kill them on Tuesday and they 'did what they had to do', according to Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood. He said five officers fired at the man. No officers were injured. Authorities did not immediately identify the man who was killed, as officers ordered him out of the car and he appeared ready to accelerate at them as they manned a blockade. Scroll down for videos . Police shot and killed a man who had posted an online video threatening to kill officers after he tried to use his car to run down cops at a blockade in a Philadelphia suburb on Tuesday . Five officers fired at the suspect who was killed in the hail of gunfire. No officers were injured . The Philadelphia Inquirer said he was 52-year-old Joseph A. Pacini and that he had posted three online videos with rambling messages and threats. Police had secured an arrest warrant for the man after the threats in the online video, Chitwood said. In videos posted to YouTube on December 29, Pacini vowed to take revenge on area authorities, the FBI and the CIA, who he believed were out to kill him. In a series of clips, the 52-year-old alternately describes his fear that authorities are out to get him, threatens to take them out first, and even asks his 'soulmate' - singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles - to stop his enemies before it's too late. 'She's the only one who can save me': In one of his videos, Pacini said he believed singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles to be his 'twin flame soulmate' 'She's the only one who can save me,' Pacini,  says of Bareilles in one rambling video. In another video, Pacini prophesied his demise after threatening local detective Matt Huffnall, who'd apparently been pursuing a police case against him. 'I'm gonna be dead or in prison within the next 12 hours,' he said. The man's death comes a little more than a week after a man who made similar threats shot two NYPD officers dead in their patrol car and then killed himself in a subway station. Police said they began following the man after he left a home in nearby Clifton Heights. They said when officers stopped him at an intersection and ordered him out of the car, he reversed and slammed into a police vehicle and then prepared to run over other officers. Officers opened fire, killing the man, Chitwood said. The man did not fire at police, and Chitwood said he did not know if the man had a weapon. In the New York case, Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were ambushed on a Brooklyn street as they sat in their marked car on December 20. Their attacker, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, had referenced in online posts the high-profile killings by white police officers of unarmed black men, specifically Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner on Staten Island. Soon after the officers' shooting Brinsley, who was black, killed himself. Decisions by grand juries not to indict the officers involved in the killings of Brown and Garner have sparked protests around the nation, with demonstrators lying down in the streets as though they're dead. Many protesters have chanted 'Hands up! Don't shoot!' a reference to their contention Brown's hands were raised when he was shot dead by police, and 'I can't breathe,' which Garner was heard saying on a video recording of his encounter with a policeman who put his arm around his neck. On Sunday, two men opened fire on a police car patrolling a tough part of Los Angeles, but the two officers inside were not injured and one was able to shoot back, authorities said. One suspect was later arrested, and the other was on the loose. Police haven't determined a motive for the shooting in South Los Angeles, an area plagued by gang violence, but said there were no indications it was linked to other attacks on police.

"Police in Pakistan have re-arrested the terrorist leader believed to be behind the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 which left 166 people dead. Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi had been due to leave jail today after a judge granted him bail on December 18, but was immediately rearrested by authorities on another case, his lawyer said. Lakhvi is one of seven suspects being tried by Pakistan in connection with the attacks, which involved four days of bombings and gunmen taking hostages in the city's Taj Mahal Hotel. He was due to be released just days after Pakistani officials rebuked the makers of U.S. series Homeland for depicting the capital Islamabad as a 'hellhole' full of terrorists. Scroll down for video . Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi had been due to leave jail today after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to hold him over the Mumbai terror attacks, but was rearrested this morning on a different charge . Officials scenes showing bombs going off in Islamabad and bodies scattered through the streets were an 'insult', adding that 'nothing could be further from the truth'. Over the weekend Indian officials also branded Pakistan as a 'haven for terrorists' as news of Lakhvi's immediate release from jail spread, saying officials had 'strong concerns' over the decision. Appearing in court in Islamabad amid tight security, Lakhvi today told reporters that he would accept whatever God intended for him. Police inspector Mohammed Arshad told the court that someone had filed a complaint at a police station on the Islamabad outskirts saying that Lakhvi had abducted his brother-in-law to wage 'jihad' six and a half years ago. The judge granted a police request for time to investigate the accusation, extending Lakhvi's detention for two days. Lakhvi, who is a leader of the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group, has now been accused of kidnapping a man to wage jihadi six years ago (file image) However, Rizwan Abbasi, Lakhvi's lawyer, called it a tactic to '....deprive my client of the fundamental right of liberty.' On December 18 a judge at the country's anti-terror court had agreed to grant Lakhvi bail saying there was a lack of evidence to justify holding him. The move had angered and embarrassed government officials as they had just vowed to crack down on terror groups following the Peshawar school attack days earlier. The fresh assault, in which 132 schoolchildren died, provoked a harsh condemnation from India, which has repeatedly said Pakistan is not doing enough to stop terror groups. Despite efforts by Pakistan's legal chiefs to keep Lakhvi behind bars, a judge on Monday said there was no reason to detain him, and asked him to post bail. Pakistani television reported that senior officials met last night at the Interior Ministry to discuss the case, before Lakhvi was arrested hours later. Lakhvi is one of the leaders of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terror group whose name translates as Army of the Righteous, which accepted responsibility for the Mumbai attacks. Over the course of four days members of Lashkar-e-Taiba detonated bombs at busy locations around the city, while gunmen took hostages inside the iconic Taj Mahal Hotel. In total 166 people were killed, while another 300 were wounded, dramatically worsening relations between India and Pakistan.","Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi was due to be released on bail earlier today .

"A gray wolf killed by a Utah hunter may . have been Echo - a female who attracted national attention . after wandering through several states to become the first of . the protected animals seen at Arizona's Grand Canyon in 70 . years, officials said on Tuesday. The hunter, who was not named by authorities, told Utah . wildlife officers on Sunday that he accidentally shot and killed . a wolf equipped with a radio collar near the Arizona border . after mistaking it for a coyote. Wolves in Utah are protected under the U.S. Endangered . Species Act, which bans killing of imperiled animals without a . special permit, but coyotes in the state are allowed to be shot . on sight. The Arizona Game and Fish Department released this photo in October of the gray wolf that was spotted at the Grand Canyon - the first sighting of the species in more than 70 years there. It is believed that a gray wolf killed on Sunday in Utah may be the same creature, named Echo . Wandering lone wolf: The three-year-old female's epic journey from the Rockies to the Grand Canyon sadly came to an end on Sunday when she was shot dead by a hunter in Utah . The incident, which is coming under sharp criticism by . conservationists, is being investigated by federal and state . conservation officers as a possible violation of U.S. and Utah . wildlife laws, authorities said. Information gleaned from the radio collar shows the wolf . killed in Utah was a three-year-old female that was captured and . collared in January in northwest Wyoming, said Utah Division of . Wildlife Resources spokesman Mark Martinez. The wolf spotted near the northern rim of the Grand Canyon . in October was also a young female, which had apparently roamed . hundreds of miles south from the Northern Rockies, . according to an analysis of droppings near where she was seen. It may be weeks before additional testing reveals whether . the wolf killed in Utah is the same one, which was nicknamed . Echo in a contest. Echo was the first gray wolf seen in the Grand Canyon and the adjacent national forest since . the 1940s, when the last wolf there was killed as part of an . extensive eradication campaign, said Chris Cline with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It also marked the species'  farthest journey south. Wolves often roam vast distances in search of food and mates. But the farther they go, the less likely they are to find a mate, said Ed Bangs, who led recovery efforts for wolves in the Northern Rockies over two decades before retiring from the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2011. 'It's looking for love,' he said in October. 'It leaves the core population and doesn't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill, so it just keeps traveling.' Analysis of the animal's scat while it was in Arizona in October showed it had traveled hundreds of miles from the Northern Rockies in Wyoming . The gray wolf is protected under the U.S. Endangered Species . Act in most states. About 25 per cent of the roughly 1,700 wolves from the Northern Rockies are being tracked, wildlife officials said. They are distinguished from the Mexican gray wolves found in the Southwest by their more full bodies and less pointed ears. Utah regulations require hunters to properly identify their . target before shooting but cases of mistaken identity sometimes . happen, Martinez said. 'It's something we train people for in hunter education . classes but it's not a unique thing,' he said. The hunter who shot the wolf near the city of Beaver in . southwest Utah immediately contacted the state to report the . incident as required by law, Martinez said. He said several . coyotes in Utah have been equipped with radio collars tied to a . research project. Wildlife advocates said the death was shameful, whether or . not the wolf was Echo. 'It's very sad either way,' said Michael Robinson, . conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity.","A hunter claimed he accidentally shot and killed a wolf equipped with a radio collar near the Arizona border after mistaking it for a coyote .

Even her mother has since said she has only  herself to blame for becoming despised by much of the British public. Her dreams of appearing on her own TV programme seem to have come true after Channel 4 decided to make her the star of a documentary. Her agent, Rob Cooper, tweeted yesterday: 'CONFIRMED: ""Josie: The Most Hated Woman In Britain"" will air on Thursday 22nd January at 10pm on Channel 4. #JosieCunningham' The wannabe glamour model announced the programme on her Twitter feed yesterday . Miss Cunningham retweeted the message to her 70,000 followers on the social network, sparking a mixture of anger from critics and joy among fans. While some of her followers replied 'love you Josie' and 'I'll be watching', another posted: 'Not paying my tv license again if they put that moose on my box!' Website user Mark Bedford added: 'You must be so proud. Parading round a bargain basement Katie Price for ridicule like some Victorian freak show. Well done.' Despite agent Mr Cooper's claim, a spokesman for Channel 4 said the schedule has not yet been finalised and the show was not therefore confirmed. It came after Miss Cunningham announced her engagement to Andrew Goy by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online. The engagement, which was then confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, comes just weeks after the couple were first pictured in Leeds city centre. There have also been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child. Last week, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her three-month-old daughter by sending him the wrong DNA result. She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day. But the mother-of-three mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man. Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders. Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It came after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. Josie, from Leeds, made headlines after having £4,800 breast enlargement surgery paid for by the NHS . As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice' Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. The mother-of-two had earlier spoken of her devastation when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl.","Controversial wannabe has been accused of shamelessly seeking fame .

"Bill de Blasio's lobbyists called top political allies and asked them to publicly slam the NYPD unions and cops for turning their backs on the New York mayor at a funeral for a slain officer, it has been revealed. DNA Info quotes two lawmakers who go calls from the de Blasio's aides asking them to speak out against the NYPD for its protest. 'City Hall wanted me to blast the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association for turning their backs on him,' one politician told the news site. 'They called up Monday, said they were calling all of us, and that it was our obligation to stand up defending the mayor.' Scroll down for video . Enemies: Aides for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) tried to get lawmakers to publicly blast NYPD cops and Patrolman's Benevolent Association head Patrick Lynch (third from left). The two are pictured together with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton at the policy academy graduation on Monday . Dozens of cops - from the NYPD and around the country, turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for slain Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend . The angry lawmaker said the request, made to both state legislators from New York City and city council members, was 'not really appropriate.' Another politician confirmed he got a call, as well, according to DNA Info. A City Hall spokesman tried to cast the calls to legislators in a different light - saying the mayor's aide were simply asking for 'statements of support' for the families of two slain NYPD officers. DNA Info's source, who got the call, called City Hall's version of events 'preposterous.' The request to blast the unions came at the same time de Blasio was trying to set up a meeting with the five NYPD union heads to broker a truce. He sat down with then in Queens for two and a half hours on Tuesday, though the meeting seemed to do little to repair the broken relationship between City Hall and the NYPD rank-and-file. Lynch, center, who is also in contract negotiations with City Hall, said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' after a fanatic gunned down two NYPD cops as 'revenge' for the death of Eric Garner . City Hall tensions with the NYPD took a dramatic turn for the worse after the murders of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos . Many NYPD cops are furious with the mayor for his sympathy toward protesters who rallied against alleged police brutality when a grand jury failed to indict an officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. De Blasio's remarks, including a statement that he had talked to his biracial son about the possibility he could be stopped by the NYPD, seemed to confirm long-held NYPD suspicions that he held anti-cop views. When two officers were gunned down on December 20 by a fanatic who claimed he was retaliating for Garner's death, the head of the largest NYPD union, Patrick Lynch, declared that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands.' NYPD cops turned their backs on the mayor when he visited the slain cops' families at the hospital. Then, at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend, dozens of officers were pictured refusing to face de Blasio when he took the podium. Then, at NYPD academy graduation on Monday, the mayor was met by scattered boos and was heckled while he spoke.","Mayor's lobbyists reportedly called New York city council members and state lawmakers  and demanded that they speak out against the NYPD .

"Hope Solo's domestic abuse case may be blocked before ever making it to trial. The Olympian goalie has been in an out of court for months, in the lead up to a trial on charges she beat up her 17-year-old nephew in a heated dispute last June. But on Tuesday, the 32-year-old's attorney asked a Kirkland County, Washington judge to throw out the case, claiming that the alleged victims 'hijacked' the case by 'substantially' changing their accounts of the brawl making it impossible for him to prepare for the case and for Solo to receive a fair trial. Solo remained quiet throughout the hearing, while her husband, former professional football player Jerramy Stevens, supported her from the gallery. Scroll down for video . Charges: U.S. women's national soccer team goalie Hope Solo appeared in court on Tuesday for a hearing related to assault charges she received last June, after allegedly beating up her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew in a drunken brawl . Off the hook: Solo remained quiet in court as her attorney asked the judge to drop the case, based on evidence he gathered that the alleged victims had changed their account of the event . Supportive husband: Solo's husband, former professional football player Jerramy Stevens, appeared in court to support her, as he has at many of the hearings over the last few months . The incident occurred on June 21, when Solo missed a flight and decided at the last minute to attend a family party at her sister's home. According to court documents, Solo got into an argument with her nephew over his athletic ambitions. She allegedly said he was 'too fat and overweight and crazy to ever be an athlete'. That caused the teen to lash back at Solo, calling her a name and demanding she leave the home. Instead, Solo allegedly followed the boy and continued to call him crazy and allegedly charged at him, punching him in the face and tackling him. The teen's mother, Solo's older half-sister, claims she tried to intervene and that Solo attacked her her as well. Claims: Above, a picture published on TMZ showing one of the injuries Solo's nephew sustained in the fight. He claims she charged at him after he called her crazy . Police broke up the fight after receiving a 911 call from a female at the house saying Solo 'was going crazy and hitting people'. At the scene, authorities noted that Solo appeared to be inebriated. She was charged with two counts of fourth-degree assault. Soccer star: Solo has continued to play for both the Seattle Reign and U.S. women's national soccer Team. Pictured above playing at a December 10 game against China in Brazil . In court on Tuesday, Solo's attorney told the judge that the nephew and sister changed their stories when he re-interviewed them recently, and that the case should be thrown out due to their conflicting testimonies. 'Right from the beginning, the witnesses were refusing to answer my questions when they were very relevant to the case,' Solo's attorney Todd Maybrown said. Maybrown says the teen told him that Solo slammed his head onto concrete multiple times in the altercation - which he did not report to police at the time. The teen's mother also says she witnessed the entire incident, which she did not claim in her first interview. Maybrown believes the teen may have been under the influence of medication at the time as well, and that the alleged victim refused to answer his questions about medical history. The judge decided not to rule on the new information, but will decide whether to throw out the case at next week's hearing on January 6. He ordered the prosecution to turn over notes on the alleged victims' depositions and medical records for the teen. If the case proceeds, Solo's trial will begin January 20. 'I agree dismissal is an extraordinary remedy,' Maybrown said. 'But when they’ve destroyed and hidden evidence…the only remedy would be dismissal.' However, Kirkland County prosecutors disagree and believe there is enough evidence to send the case to trial. For better or worse: Solo pictured above leaving court with her husband Stevens on November 4. A judge will rule on whether or not to dismiss the case next week . 'The extraordinary remedy is not one that is appropriate here,' City of Kirkland Deputy Prosecutor Lacey Offutt said, adding that these issues should  be heard 'in front of a jury'. The prosecution went on to accuse Solo's attorney of improperly presenting information to the court. Solo continues to play for the Seattle Reign and U.S. women's national soccer team, despite her current legal troubles. Some have called it a double standard to let Solo continue to play, in light of recent domestic assault scandals in male-dominated sports.","Soccer star is accused of beating up half-sister and 17-year-old nephew after getting into argument about nephew's athletic ambitions .

"For many people, the chance to own a Ferrari - the luxury sports car associated with musicians, actors and the super-rich - is nothing more than a pipe-dream. But now, they have the chance to buy the next best thing as shares in the brand are set to become available. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), which owns Ferrari, plans to list about 10 per cent of Ferrari's outstanding shares through a public offering and distribute the rest to its shareholders. The new Ferrari 458 Speciale that reaches 0-60 in three seconds - owners Fiat Chrysler plan to float shares of the luxury car maker on the stock market as a way to raise revenue . Shares of Ferrari will be listed in both the US and another European market. The transaction is expected to be completed by some time next year. The sale is part of a bigger plan by FCA to raise £38billion to fund an investment plan. Fiat took control of Chrysler this year and its shareholders recently approved the merger, creating Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the world's seventh-largest automaker. Fiat had been Chrysler's parent since shortly after Chrysler's bankruptcy and government bailout in 2009. Over the last five years, Fiat has bought out Chrysler's other owners, completing the transaction in January. Fiat's mass-market brands include Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Jeep. Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne said it was 'proper that we pursue separate paths for FCA and Ferrari' following the completion of the merger of Chrysler and Fiat. Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles John Elkann said: 'The separation of Ferrari will preserve the cherished Italian heritage and unique position of the Ferrari business and allow FCA shareholders to continue to benefit from the substantial value inherent in this business.' Long time Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo stepped down on September 10 after 23 years . Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1947, Ferrari makes luxury sports cars that cost from $250,000 to more than $1 million. The automaker caps its annual production at about 6,500 vehicles. Part of Ferrari's mystique comes from its exclusivity and its success on the racetrack. Its sports cars have been driven by actors, athletes, musicians and the very rich. Ferrari has been part of Fiat since 1969, when it first acquired a 50 percent stake in Ferrari. The Ferrari family continued to run the F1 team until 1988. The move comes just over a month after Ferrari's longtime chairman, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, said he was stepping down after 23 years at the head of the car company after a public spat over strategy with Mr Marchionne. Mr Marchionne had been a vocal critic of the on-track performance of Ferrari's Formula One team, particularly its lack of world titles since 2007. He has pledged to get the team back to winning ways. Ferrari is one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, but it has had one of its worst seasons in recent memory this year. Ferrari's top driver, Fernando Alonso, is in sixth place in the Formula One standings, 150 points behind the leader this season, Lewis Hamilton, who drives for Mercedes and has won nine of this year's races. Ferrari's top driver Fernando Alonso (right) is  150 points behind the leader this season, Lewis Hamilton (left) The Ferrari spin-off is subject to regulatory approval and final approval of the transaction's structure by the Fiat Chrysler board.

"The body of a missing 14-month-old Maryland boy was found in an Ohio creek Wednesday as his mother was ordered held on $150,000 bond in her first court appearance. Searchers found the body of Cameron Beckford in Big Walnut Creek on Wednesday morning, said Sgt. Rich Weiner, a Columbus police spokesman. The boy's mother, Dainesha Stevens, is charged with endangering children and tampering with evidence and was held on $75,000 bond on each count. Franklin County Municipal Court Judge Michael Brandt also ordered her not to have any contact with children. Columbus officers searched Tuesday near a creek with a dive team and helicopter after Stevens admitted she and a male acquaintance left Beckford on Friday night because they could no longer care for him. The area being searched on the city's far east side is more than two miles from the home where Stevens said she left the child. Stevens, 24, failed to protect her son 'by allowing an individual to violently spank him numerous times on several occasions,' according to a police charging document filed Wednesday. The discipline removed several layers of skin and caused the boy's buttocks to bleed, the document said. Stevens also allowed her son to be removed from the place he was assaulted 'to impair the investigation of a missing/homicide investigation' and concealed his whereabouts, the document said. Scroll down for video . Missing: Authorities continue to search for 14-month-old Cameron Beckford, who they warn may be already dead . Mother: Dainesha Stevens admitted she and a male acquaintance left the boy, Cameron Beckford, on Friday night because they could no longer care for him . The assault happened between December 21 and December 23, according to the document. Stevens made up a story about leaving the boy on a porch and says that was her way of asking for help, said her attorney, Mark Collins. 'There's reasons why she said what she said, but she's trying to do the right thing and that's what she did by helping yesterday and today,' Collins said Wednesday after the brief court hearing. She cooperated with police in their search, he said. Collins said Stevens came to the Columbus area December 15 after calling police in Maryland for help, then receiving a bus pass from the local protective services agency. Frederick police spokesman Lt. Clark Pennington said a domestic dispute preceded Stevens' departure. 'I know that they had, like, an argument on the 14th and that's why we think she went to Ohio on the 15th,' he said. Pennington said he didn't have immediate access to details about the dispute. Frederick police previously said the father of the two children called police on Sunday and reported that their mother had taken them to an unknown location in Columbus in mid-December. Based on the father's concerns, missing-child reports were issued. Collins said he didn't know the details of what happened in Maryland. Stevens on Monday reported that her six-year-old daughter Cheyenne had been taken to an unknown location by a friend, and investigators determined the toddler was missing while questioning the woman, police said. 'But I haven't seen her since Christmas Eve,' Stevens of Cheyenne in a 911 call obtained by Fox 28. 'And I've been trying to get her back from the people, and they won't tell me any information about her. They won't even try to bring her back to me.' Cheyenne later was found at a home on the city's west side and is in good condition, authorities said. She has been turned over to Franklin County Children Services. Stevens was staying with a male friend she knew as a teenager in Maryland, Collins said. That man is being held on misdemeanor warrants unrelated to the toddler's disappearance. 'It's our goal to keep that man in custody pending further investigation by the police,' said Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien. Stevens pointed police to the creek, Collins confirmed Wednesday without providing details. Police said Stevens had legal custody of both children. A missing-child alert said the toddler was wearing a puffy black coat, gray pants, black and red boots and a gray elephant hat. Police said he's black with brown eyes and a Mohawk hairstyle. A woman who answered the phone at a house believed to be the father's residence said he wasn't home. She said Beckford was her son. She apologetically declined to answer more questions and would not give her name. She also refused to open the door to the apartment, located in a densely populated neighborhood in the city, about 40 miles west of Baltimore. Criminal complaints obtained by Fox28 say three days before Christmas Cameron was 'violently spanked repeatedly' in a Columbus home - and his mother did not step in to save him. The complaints also said the spanking 'caused layers of skin to be removed from the child buttocks.' Court documents obtained by the station says Cameron's body was moved December 27 with Steven's permission for '[impairing] its availability as evidence.'

"In 2011 astronomers announced they had discovered a gas cloud known as G2 drifting around the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's core. While the cloud had been observed orbiting the black hole its origins, however, were unknown. But now astronomers have found that the cloud is in an orbit matching another gas cloud - suggesting both may have been ejected by a star as it orbits the black hole. A cloud at the Milky Way's core could be form a star, say astronomers. In this image the red part of the G2 cloud is seen in orbit around the black hole (path shown in solid white). The blue part is the second cloud, G1. The distance from red to blue is 900 times the Earth-sun distance. They may have come from star S2 . The new research, made possible using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, was presented by astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) near Munich, Germany. At the centre of our Milky Way is a supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*. Most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core. Sagittarius A* lurks 26,000 light years away in the Milky Way's innermost region. For a black hole, it is very dim - about a billion times fainter than others of its supermassive types - making it something of a mystery. Black holes eat matter from their surroundings and blow matter back. The way they do that influences the evolution of the entire galaxy. Its interaction with the gas clouds G1 and G2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes 'feed'. They hope to understand these black holes don't consume matter in the same way as their brighter counterparts in other galaxies. The findings could shed light on how stars are formed, how the galaxy grows and how it interacts with other galaxies. But finding a gas cloud in orbit around the black hole was odd, as it was not obvious where it could have come from. The new research, though, shows that the gas cloud G2 lags behind another, dubbed G1, by about 13 Earth years. Both are in a similar orbit, suggesting they are part of the same stream of gas - and they may just be one in a series of gas clouds deposited around the black hole by a star. The best model to explain the gas clouds now is that they originate from the wind of a massive star that also orbits the black hole. This star is labelled S2, and it may be shedding material as it makes its way around the huge gravitational phenomenon. If confirmed, the cloud would provide a fascinating insight into what happens when stars orbit a black hole. All black holes are known to have an event horizon around their core, within which nothing - not even light - can escape. But this star in question orbits beyond the event horizon, so it only feels the effects of the black hole from a greater distance. At the centre of our Milky Way is a supermassive black hole (illustration shown) called Sagittarius A*. Most galaxies are believed to have such an object at their core. Its interaction with the gas clouds G1 and G2 will give astronomers a unique opportunity to see how faint supermassive black holes 'feed' The new research, made possible using the Very Large Telescope in Chile, was presented by astronomers at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) near Munich, Germany. They observed the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, seen in this illustration . In 2013, the G2 gas cloud made its closest approach to the black hole, a distance of 20 light hours - about five times the distance of our sun to Neptune.. It is on a highly eccentric orbit, so will now begin to move out to a much greater distance from the black hole. And it follow a path already carved out by its companion, G1, which could provide information about its origins. 'Already a decade ago, another gas cloud - which we now call G1 - has been observed in the central region of our galaxy,' said Dr Stefan Gillessen from MPE in a statement. 'We explored the connection between G1 and G2 and find an astonishing similarity in both orbits.' The G2 gas cloud (illustration shown) was first spotted in 2011, but since then astronomers have debated its origins. Some have suggested it may have come from a star surrounded by a gas cloud, but this latest research says it is more likely it is ejected material from a star . The latest findings were made using the Very Large Telescope in Chile (shown). Here a laser beam launched from the VLT´s 26.9ft (8.2-metre) Yepun telescope crosses the majestic southern sky and creates an artificial star at an altitude of 56 miles (90km)  to correct images from the blurring effect of the atmosphere . Dr Oliver Pfuhl, also of MPE and lead author of the study, added: 'Our basic idea is that G1 and G2 might be clumps of the same gas streamer. 'In this case, we should be able to simultaneously fit both data sets and, indeed, our model captures the G1 and G2 orbits remarkably well.' A likely source for both G1 and G2 could  be clumps in the wind of one of the massive disk stars, which could have been ejected some 100 years ago. Another possible explanation that has been suggested recently would be a large star, enveloped by an extended gas cloud. Based on current data, however, this model is highly unlikely. Whatever the answer turns out to be, though, it could reveal a fascinating insight into some of the goings on near the black hole at the Milky Way's core.","Astronomers at the Max Planck Institute in Germany have provided a new theory for a gas cloud spotted in orbit around the Milky Way's core .
The cloud dubbed G2 could be part of a stream of gas from a star .
They made the discovery by finding another cloud in a similar orbit .
It suggests both originate from the wind of a nearby star .
Finding could help explain how black holes 'feed'"

"A Chicago teen who sent a letter to Santa asking for 'safety' for Christmas didn't get a response from the big guy in red, but he did hear back from President Barack Obama. Malik Bryant, a 13-year-old African-American resident of the Illinois city's crime-ridden South Side, penned the note in conjunction with a local charity's Letters to Santa program. 'All I ask for is for safety. I just wanna be safe,' Bryant wrote. Soon, Christmas magic took over, and the letter made its way to White House. In his reply to Bryant, Obama said the teen's 'security is a priority for me in everything I do as President.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Chicago, Illinois, teen Malik Bryant wrote to Santa asking for 'safety' for Christmas and instead got a response from President Barack Obama. The president told him, 'Please know your security is a priority for me in everything I do as President' Bryant, a 13-year-old African-American resident of Chicago's city's crime-ridden South Side, penned the note in conjunction with a local charity's Letters to Santa program . 'I’m just overwhelmed,' Bryant's mother told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'I still can’t believe it. How fantastic that out of all the problems he has in the world, the president took the time out to write a letter concerning about my son. 'I mean wow, what a Christmas.' In a video published by the news publication of Bryant opening the letter, the teen said the president's return letter should 'sent a message to everybody that it's not safe out here in Chicago.' 'I'm surprised he wrote it, but like it's not gonna solve like safety reasons out here, it's still dangerous,' Bryant said . The teen said he can 'barely' go outside anymore, even to visit family, and that there's certain blocks in his neighborhood that no one can cross through because 'there's real hard gang banging.' 'I can't go outside and ride my bike. I can't play ball outside,' Bryant said. 'I saw a dude, like, dead.' Bryant explained moments later that the dead man was actually a fellow teenager with whom he was acquainted and 'somebody murdered him.' Per the Sun-Times, Bryant was one of 8,500 students across 12 Chicago schools who participated in DirectEffect Charities' program this holiday season. Bryant's letter to Santa said, 'I would like to ask you sum but first Imma tell you about me. Im a black African American. I stand 5'10. Im in 7th grade. My favorite subject is math. I have 2 siblings living with me and Im the only boy on my moms side of my family. But anyway all I ask for is for safety. I just wanna be safe. At the bottom he noted that he would also accept a scarf, gloves, hat and school supplies. 'When I pulled this one letter from a seventh-grade class at an Englewood elementary school, I couldn’t stop reading it,' Michelle DiGiacomo, CEO of DirectEffect, told the Sun-Times. 'All this kid was asking for was safety. I was floored.' The non-profit's head passed Bryant's letter on to her congressman, Rep. Michael Quigley, and he sent it to the White House. Days later, the president responded via certified mail . This screen grab, taken from a video of Bryant opening Obama's letter, shows what the president, a Chicago native himself, wrote to the the 13-year-old student . DiGiacomo said the charity was planning to have one of its Santas buy Bryant the items appended to the bottom of his letter, but she 'couldn’t stop thinking about it.' 'Then it hit me. Someone bigger than Santa needed to see this letter. I thought the president of the United States needed to see it,' she said. The non-profit head said she passed the child's letter on to her congressman, Rep. Michael Quigley, and he sent it to the White House. Days later, the president responded via certified mail. 'Dear Malik: I want to offer you some words of encouragement this holiday season,' Obama, a Chicago native himself who worked as a community organizer on the South Side for several years after he graduated from college, wrote. 'Each day I strive to ensure to ensure communities like yours are safe places to dream, discover and grow. Please know your security is a priority for me in everything I do as President. If you dare to be bold and creative, work hard every day, and care for others, I'm confident you can achieve anything you imagine.' He added, 'I wish you and your family the very best for the coming year, and I will be rooting for you.' Bryant told the Sun-Times that he knows the Obama's note won't have a direct effect on his safety, 'but I’m excited the president of the United States wrote to me, and I can’t wait to show it off.' The president's letter wasn't all Bryant got for Christmas. After a copy of his original message to Santa went viral on the internet, the charity brainstormed gifts that he could play with indoors, and secret santas bought him a new computer and a Wii game. The charity is also trying to help the family find a new apartment in better part of town.","Malik Bryant, a 13-year-old African-American resident of Chicago's South Side, penned the note for a local charity's Letters to Santa program .
