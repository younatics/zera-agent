"(CNN) -- A spike in napa cabbage prices has South Koreans sweating over their national side dish, kimchi. Many Koreans eat the spicy fermented cabbage dish every day, and a weather-driven crop shortage has forced them to cut back or pay much more. The price of napa cabbage, a key ingredient in kimchi, has climbed fourfold. ""Restaurants are charging for extra kimchi now. They're charging 2000 won for a refill. A meal generally costs 5000 won,"" said Joe McPherson, founding editor of ZenKimchi.com, which features the Korean Food Journal. Koreans have taken to jokingly calling the side dish ""geum-chi,"" substituting in the Korean word for gold. The government has even stepped in. Import duties on cabbages and radishes have been suspended till year's end to help Koreans cope, said the Yonhap news agency. One hundred and fifty tons of the fresh vegetables are being imported from China as well. Japan faces food pressure from China . Some Koreans are looking for the government to do more, such as subsidize cabbage sales, said Eun Jeong Lee, a researcher at Seoul-based ZenKimchi.com. Kimchi-making season is coming up, which might force the issue. Korean families typically gather and make kimchi together in late October or early November, before winter sets in. ""They're still going to make it. They're just going to make less of it or use substitute ingredients,"" McPherson said. The endless variations on kimchi include radishes and cucumbers. In the United States, which has adopted kimchi, it's made its way into fusion food such as tacos and hamburgers. Why is 'food security' sparking unrest? On the microblogging site Twitter, kimchi fans from around the world were commiserating. ""Do not laugh: this is serious stuff for Koreans and kimchi lovers everywhere!"" one user posted.","Many Koreans eat the spicy fermented cabbage dish every day .

"""I'd never been near a race track in my life,"" explains Divina Galica, a former Olympic skier who belongs to an exclusive band of Formula One drivers. There are only five members -- and they are all female. ""For many years I lived near Thruxton (a race track in southern England) and could hear the cars going round, but I never had any interest in going over there."" Galica was captain of the British women's ski team and competed at three Winter Olympics from 1964 to 1972, but it was not until she hung up her poles that her story took a remarkable twist. Just under a month shy of her 32nd birthday, she became only the third woman to enter an F1 race at the 1976 British Grand Prix, completing an incredible career change. ""When I stopped ski racing I started a shop in London selling ski wear,"" Galica told CNN. ""It was a complete change of pace to me and I got a little restless. ""One day the telephone rang and a gentleman asked me if I'd like to go in for  a celebrity race for sports people. I came second in the race and a lot of people were surprised that in my first race I had come second. ""John Webb (formerly in charge of the UK's Brands Hatch circuit) invited me to race against the women drivers who were racing and again I came second. That sort of started my career."" It was a career which propelled Galica into the male-dominated world of F1, where only five women have entered a grand prix in its 61-year history and only two have successfully qualified for a race. ""I think I was quite well known because a lot of publicity followed me around and most people seemed to think I was qualified to race at that level,"" said Galica, who entered two further grands prix with the Hesketh team at the start of the 1978 season. ""The downside was the car I was driving, not the team because they were top notch -- they had run (1976 world champion) James Hunt. But the car was old and not particularly competitive."" The first woman to test herself against the men was Italy's Maria Teresa de Filippis, who made history at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix -- a race which also saw the sport's future supremo Bernie Ecclestone make his bow. De Filippis failed to qualify in Monte Carlo, but a month later in Belgium, in a race with no cut-off time for qualification, she started in last position on the grid. In a contest which saw nine of the 19-strong field retire, De Filippis guided her Maserati around the Spa track but finished right at the back. Her compatriot Lella Lombardi is the most successful female driver so far. In a three-year spell, Lombardi entered 17 grands prix for March, RAM and Williams, competing in 12 races. She became the first and only woman to score in the elite division of motorsport, when a fifth-place finish at the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix while racing for March earned her half a point instead of the usual one because the race distance was shortened. Hot on the heels of Lombardi was Galica, who, inspired by her Italian forerunners, entered the sport in 1976. ""Like everything, motorsport was male-dominated for many years but there were many, many women who raced ... Lella Lombardi was extremely good,"" the 67-year-old said. ""She was extremely strong as well, she had a good car and she did very well in it. So there have been good women drivers in Formula One."" Galica believes strength is essential if women are to deal with the physical rigors of a grand prix and the media attention which comes with their unique status. ""To drive in my day you had to be fit,"" she said. ""Luckily I came off a skiing career and I was massively fit, I was built like a tank. Nowadays, I've seen a lot of women drivers who are extremely good, but as they move up the formula, they're not quite strong enough. ""Often they make some mistakes because they get fatigued. Of course, men get tired in those cars too, it's not just women. ""Especially the modern F1 car, it creates enormous G-force, and the tracks nowadays don't have many straights so you're always turning and there is a lot of work to do."" Constantly dealing with the world's media is also difficult, according to Galica. ""It's tiring enough to drive an F1 car, but when you get out and are pounced on by thousands of journalists from all over the world you really get pretty exhausted. I think that's something that women don't understand,"" she said. ""You're not just driving the car and getting out of it and disappearing into your motor home, you actually are then at the mercy of the world's press."" South Africa's Desire Wilson was the next woman to enter a race in 1980, and it has been almost 20 years since Giovanna Amati drove for Brabham in 1992, but recently there have been reports claiming that Renault will sign Maria de Villota as the team's third driver. The Spaniard has previously raced in the World Touring Car championship and tested for Renault earlier this year. Galica said the 31-year-old must ready for the physical challenge if she is to drive in F1. ""My concern for her is not that she would be an ambassador, which she would be, and I'm sure she would do a wonderful job,"" Galica said of De Villota. ""But when she actually gets in the car I'm wondering if she'll be fit enough. ""I would be in the gym most of this winter trying to lift heavy weights and get my neck muscles going and just make sure I'm strong enough. I don't know her, but I think that would be my advice.""","Britain's Divina Galica is one of only five women to have entered an F1 grand prix .

"(CNN)  -- Israeli soldiers routinely and intentionally put children in harm's way during their 22-day offensive against the Palestinians in Gaza, according to a United Nations report made public Monday. On March 6, a Palestinian boy sits on the rubble of a building destroyed during Israel's 22-day Gaza offensive. The report said a working group had documented and verified reports of violations ""too numerous to list."" For example, on January 15, in a town southwest of Gaza City, Israel Defense Forces soldiers ordered an 11-year-old boy to open Palestinians' packages, presumably so that the soldiers would not be hurt if they turned out to contain explosives, the 43-page report said. They then forced the boy to walk in front of them in the town, it said. When the soldiers came under fire, ""the boy remained in front of the group,"" the report said. It said the boy was later released. Also cited were ""credible reports"" that accused Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that runs Gaza, of using human shields and placing civilians at risk. But it singled out the Israelis for more sweeping criticism. A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister called the report another example of the ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which requested it. The report cited two alleged incidents from January 3. In one, it said, after a tank round struck near a house, a father and his two sons -- both younger than 11 -- emerged to look at the damage. ""As they exited their home, IDF soldiers shot and killed them (at the entrance to their house), with the daughter witnessing,"" the report said. In the second, it said, ""Israeli soldiers entered a family house in the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City. Standing at the doorstep, they asked the male head of the household to come out and shot him dead, without warning, while he was holding his ID, hands raised up in the air, and then started to fire indiscriminately and without warning into the room where the rest of the family was huddled together. ""The eldest son was shouting in vain the word 'Children' in Hebrew to warn the soldiers. The shooting did not stop until everyone was lying on the floor. The mother and four of the brothers, aged 2-12 years, had been wounded, one of them, aged 4, fatally."" The alleged instances occurred during Operation Cast Lead, which was launched December 27 to halt rocket attacks into southern Israel from Gaza and ended January 17 with a cease-fire. The U.N. report called the response by Israel disproportionate. Of the 1,453 people estimated killed in the conflict, 1,440 were Palestinian, including 431 children and 114 women, the report said. The 13 Israelis killed included three civilians and six soldiers killed by Hamas, and four soldiers killed by friendly fire, it said. The report said the Israeli operation resulted in ""a dramatic deterioration of the living conditions of the civilian population."" It cited ""targeted and indiscriminate"" attacks on hospitals and clinics, water and sewage treatment facilities, government buildings, utilities and farming and said the offensive ""intensified the already catastrophic humanitarian situation of the Palestinian people."" It said Israeli strikes damaged more than 200 schools and left more than 70,000 people homeless. ""There are strong and credible reports of war crimes and other violations of international norms,"" it said, adding that many observers have said war crimes investigations should be undertaken. ""The alternative is de facto impunity,"" it said. It called for the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the free passage into the territory of food, medicine, fuel and construction supplies. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, called the report ""another example of the one-sided and unfair attitude of the rapporteur of the Human Rights Council, a council that has been criticized by current and previous secretaries-general for its unbalanced attitudes toward Israel."" He added, ""The negative fixation on Israel by the council has done a disservice to the issue of human rights internationally as has been attested to by the leading NGO's [nongovernmental organizations] on human rights."" Another report issued Monday also was critical of the IDF. The report from Physicians for Human Rights said the Gaza incursion violated IDF's own code of ethics. The report by the medical group, which shared the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, cited instances where it said IDF forces did not evacuate injured civilians for days and prevented Palestinian teams from reaching the wounded, and said some of them died as a result. It said 16 Palestinian medical personnel were killed by IDF fire and 25 were wounded during the IDF operation, and accused the IDF of attacking 34 medical centers in violation of the IDF's own ""ethical code for fighting terror."" In response, the IDF accused Hamas of having used medical vehicles, facilities and uniforms to conceal its members' activity. ""Hamas used ambulances to 'rescue' terror activists from the battlefield and used hospitals and medical facilities as hiding places,"" the Israelis said in a written statement. ""Despite this, throughout the fighting, IDF forces were instructed to avoid firing at ambulances, even if they were being used by armed fighters. They were instructed only to shoot if there was fire towards our forces emanating from the direction of the ambulance."" Regarding the reported delays in casualty evacuations, ""there existed real difficulties in evacuating the injured, due to the roadblocks, booby-trapped roads and dirt mounds placed by the Hamas as well as the considerable damage to the infrastructure,"" the statement said. Nevertheless, it said, an IDF investigation is ongoing and its conclusions will be made public once it is complete. But Dr. Dani Filc, PHR-Israel chairman, was skeptical that the investigation would prove useful. ""There are considerable doubts that the IDF is the correct institution to investigate suspicions of these violations,"" he said. ""The IDF's repeated promises to the High Court to look into attacks on medical teams and medical centers have gone unfulfilled, and there are suspicions concerning its seriousness and readiness to carry out the matter."" The Israeli military did accept criticism Monday on another matter -- the practice of some Israeli soldiers of wearing T-shirts that appear to condone acts of violence against Palestinians. The Israeli daily Haaretz newspaper reported that Israeli soldiers who had finished basic training ordered the shirts, one of which showed a pregnant Arab in the crosshairs of a gun sight with a caption reading ""1 Shot 2 Kills."" Another showing a small child in a gun's sight was captioned, ""The smaller they are, the harder it is."" ""The examples presented by The Haaretz reporter are not in accordance with IDF values and are simply tasteless,"" the Israeli military said in a written statement. ""This type of humor is unbecoming and should be condemned."" Israeli soldiers said last week that Palestinian civilians were killed and Palestinian property intentionally destroyed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to Haaretz. The IDF has said it is investigating the claims, but its top general expressed skepticism Monday. ""I don't believe that soldiers serving in the IDF hurt civilians in cold blood, but we shall wait for the results of the investigation,"" Lt. Gen. Ashkenazi, the chief of staff, said in a speech. ""I tell you that this is a moral and ideological army."" He blamed Hamas for choosing ""to fight in heavily populated areas. ""It (was) a complex atmosphere that includes civilians and we took every measure possible to reduce harm of the innocent,"" he said, according to an IDF statement.","Israel: U.N. Human Rights Council has ""one-sided and unfair"" attitude .

"FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky (CNN) -- The 101st Airborne's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide, a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1, two of them in the past week. An Army honor guard stands ready to fire a salute at Fort Campbell. ""If you don't remember anything else I say in the next five or 10 minutes, remember this -- suicidal behavior in the 101st on Fort Campbell is bad,"" Brig. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend told his forces. ""It's bad for soldiers, it's bad for families, bad for your units, bad for this division and our army and our country and it's got to stop now. Suicides on Fort Campbell have to stop now."" Fort Campbell's suicide rate, the highest in the Army, ""is not a good statistic,"" he said in remarks to one of four divisions he addressed during the day. After nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between January and mid-March, the Army instituted a suicide prevention program that ""seemed to be having good effects"" until last week, when two more suicides occurred, he said. ""Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem,"" Townsend said. ""Screaming Eagles don't quit. No matter how bad your problem seems today, trust me, it's not the end of the world. It will be better tomorrow. Don't take away your tomorrow."" He urged anyone feeling hopeless or suicidal to ""tell somebody."" ""You wouldn't hesitate to seek medical attention for a physical injury or wound; don't hesitate to seek medical attention for a psychological injury."" Townsend exhorted any soldier who suspects that a fellow soldier may be feeling suicidal to act -- first by asking how the soldier feels, then by escorting him or her to help. ""Do not wait,"" he said. Soldiers can turn to their leaders, chaplains, medics, social workers, teammates, family and friends, he said. ""Don't let yourself, your buddies or your families down,"" he said, ending his comments by repeating, ""This has got to stop, soldiers. It's got to stop now. Have a great week."" But Townsend's message -- called a Second Suicide Stand-Down event -- is likely to be ineffective, said Dr. Mark Kaplan, a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, who has researched veterans' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue-ribbon panel on suicide risk. ""It sounds like an order,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I'm not sure that a command like this is going to alter the course of somebody who is on a trajectory of self-harm."" He suggested the Army might want to adopt the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs model. ""They're dealing with a comparable problem with a similar population,"" Kaplan said. ""They have infused more sensitivity to their approach to suicide prevention as opposed to this. This is like any other order."" The military culture attaches a stigma to mental illness that needs to be reduced, he said. Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions, such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms, he said. If the Army is serious about addressing the problem, it needs to address the stressors common to soldiers, including financial problems, marital problems, frequency of deployments, length of deployments, deployments to hostile environments, exposure to extreme stress and service-related injuries, he said. The role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered, he said. ""More often than not, these are individuals who'll get liquored up, so to speak, and have access to a gun and die from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" Kaplan said. Bill Lichtenstein, who serves on the board of the Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism, the advisory council of the Center for the Advancement of Children's Mental Health at Columbia University, and on the advisory board of Families for Depression Awareness, was equally unimpressed with Townsend's tack. ""It's the equivalent of 'Just Say No' to prevent drug abuse,' "" he told CNN in a telephone interview. Screening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide, he said. ""Prominent among them, if not the most important question is: Have you made a plan for suicide? Using a simple battery of questions, you can suss out people who might be at risk, which is far more important than telling somebody, 'Don't take your life,' "" Lichtenstein said. The problem is not limited to Fort Campbell. The Army has reported 64 potential active-duty suicides this year; 35 have been confirmed as suicides, and 29 are pending determination of manner of death. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this story.","Brig. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend spoke to troops about suicide problem .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A contrite head of the Federal Protective Service took the blame Wednesday for security lapses that allowed covert investigators to sneak bomb components into 10 federal government buildings. A GAO report cites lax security in federal buildings after investigators got bomb components past guards. The Government Accountability Office, which conducted the tests, testified that they showed the service to be ""an agency in crisis."" Plainclothes investigators testing the effectiveness of private contract guards at federal office buildings were able to smuggle in bomb components in all 10 attempts. Only one investigator was stopped and questioned, but he was allowed to pass with the components of a liquid bomb. Once inside the facilities, the testers assembled the bombs in restrooms, put them in briefcases and ""walked freely"" into government offices, according to the Government Accountability Office.  Watch undercover agent smuggle bomb » . Asked point-blank at a Senate hearing Wednesday why the security guards had failed, Protective Service Director Gary Schenkel said, ""It's purely a lack of oversight on our part."" He added, ""I take full responsibility. I am the director of the organization."" Schenkel, who assumed his post in early 2007, said the police force was hampered earlier this decade by major budget cuts, which forced the agency to reorganize how it protects 9,000 federal facilities nationwide. Although police officers formerly protected federal buildings, the agency now uses a core cadre of 1,200 sworn federal officers or ""inspectors"" to oversee a small army of about 13,000 private security guards who man the X-ray machines and magnetometers at building entrances. Department of Homeland Security put out an official statement Wednesday focusing on steps the Federal Protective Service is taking to improve the situation, but Schenkel was at times more negative, outlining some of the problems the agency faces. The service, he said, used a ""stubby pencil"" system to keep track of guards, and it would take a ""full year, I believe"" for changes being made now to have an effect . ""When I came here, I made an analogy that we were a ship, and it takes 38 miles at sea to turn a ship, an aircraft carrier. I think we are probably on mile six, but we've certainly initiated the turn,"" he said. Mark Goldstein of the Government Accountability Office testified about the investigators' operations. ""We brought in all the components that we needed to make a real bomb,"" he said, though the concentration of explosives was ""below the trigger point"" for safety reasons. Investigators obtained the components at local stores and over the Internet for less than $150, the report says. ""In a number of the locations -- three or four of them -- the guards were not even looking at the screens that would show materials passing through,"" Goldstein said. ""If a guard had been looking, they would have seen materials that are ordinarily not brought into a federal building, and should have stopped our investigators and asked, 'Why are you bringing these kinds of things into a fed building, and what is your purpose?' But in really no case did that occur. ""In only one instance did a guard ask about something that an investigator was carrying, [and] after a brief explanation, that guard let it go through,"" Goldstein said. The covert agents then assembled bombs in the bathrooms, he said. ""In some cases, bathrooms were locked, but federal employees let us in,"" he said. Having assembled the bomb, typically in less than four minutes, the agents placed it an a briefcase ""and walked around a variety of federal offices -- both legislative branch offices and executive branch offices in the four cities we went to,"" Goldstein said. He blamed the lapses on an ""antiquated approach"" to security, saying federal building security is directed in part by the buildings' tenants, who form a committee to determine the appropriate level of security. So decisions are made ""by people who, frankly, ought not be making them,"" he said. He also said security is ""budget-driven; it's not risk-driven."" But he shied away from recommending that the contract security jobs be federalized, a move the government took for airport security screeners following the September 11 terrorist attacks. That would be a policy decision, he said. But he said the Protective Service was lax in assuring that security standards it set were followed by the private contract guards. Of 663 randomly selected guards, 411, or 62 percent, were missing some form of required certification, such as an up-to-date firearm qualification, background investigation or CPR or first aid training. Included in the Government Accountability Office report is a photograph of a guard asleep at his post. The report also detailed an instance in which a woman placed an infant in a carrier on an X-ray machine while retrieving identification. Because the guard was not paying attention and the machine's safety features had been disabled, the infant was sent through the X-ray machine, according to the report. The Protective Service dismissed the guard, who sued the agency for failing to provide X-ray training. The agency lost the suit because it could not prove that the guard had been trained, the report says. In one region, the service ""has not provided the required eight hours of [X-ray] or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004,"" the report says. It report also says the service does not have a national guidance on how often its inspectors should check on the contract guards. In several instances, when inspectors have checked on guards, they found ""instances of guards not complying with post orders."" In one case, the report says, a guard was caught using government computers to manage a for-profit adult Web site. All of the buildings involved in the bomb smuggling test were ""Level IV"" buildings, meaning they house more than 450 federal employees and have a high volume of public contact. The Government Accountability Office has declined to identify the specific buildings ""because of the sensitivity of some of the information,"" the report says. After the report was obtained by CNN late Tuesday, ahead of its release Wednesday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, called the test results ""simply unacceptable."" Added Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ""In this post-9/11 world that we're now living in, I can not imagine how security lapses of this magnitude were allowed to occur. "" Both Lieberman and Collins said they were putting the Federal Protective Service on a list of ""high-risk"" agencies and asked Schenkel to provide them with details of how he would fix the security lapses. Although the investigators ensured that bombs assembled in the buildings would not explode, they later videotaped the detonation of several of the devices at a remote site to demonstrate the their destructive power.","Report questions effectiveness of Federal Protective Service .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank will introduce a $50 billion note -- enough to buy just two loaves of bread -- as a way of fighting cash shortages amid spiraling inflation. Zimbabwe's dollar is virtually worthless, with foreign currency now being used to purchase basic items. The country's acting finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, made the announcement in a government gazette released Saturday. Although Chinamasa did not give the date on which the $50 billion and new $20 billion notes would come into circulation, an official at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the notes would be distributed to all banks by the end of Monday. Zimbabwe is grappling with hyperinflation now officially estimated at 231 million percent, and its currency is fast losing its value. As of Friday, one U.S. dollar was trading at around ZW$25 billion. When the government issued a $10 billion note just three weeks ago, it bought 20 loaves of bread. That note now can purchase less than half of one loaf. Realizing the worthlessness of the currency, the RBZ has allowed most goods and services to be charged in foreign currency. As a result, grocery purchases, government hospital bills, property sales, rent, vegetables and even mobile phone recharge cards are now paid for in foreign currency, as the worthless Zimbabwe dollar virtually ceases to be legal tender. Once a regional economic model, Zimbabwe is in the throes of an economic crisis, with unemployment running at more than 80 percent and many families unable to afford a square meal. President Robert Mugabe's critics blame his policies for the economic meltdown, but he says the West is sabotaging his efforts. In order to attract foreign currency, Zimbabwe's central bank has, since September, licensed at least 1,000 shops to sell goods in foreign currency. All mobile phone service providers are now licensed to accept foreign exchange for airtime and other services. John Robertson, an economist in Zimbabwe, said he's puzzled by the introduction of the $50 billion and $20 billion notes. ""I am not really sure what these notes would be for,"" he said. ""No one now accepts the local currency. It is a waste of resources to print Zimbabwe dollar notes now. Who accepts a currency that loses value by almost 100 percent daily?"" In August, the RBZ slashed ten zeros from the currency. But the zeroes have bounced back with more vigor. A power-sharing deal between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed in September, and brokered by former South African leader Thabo Mbeki, raised hopes of halting Zimbabwe's plunge into economic destruction. But the pact has stalled over the allocation of key cabinet ministries, with Tsvangirai accusing Mugabe of grabbing all key posts such as defense, home affairs, local government, foreign affairs and finance.","Zimbabwe grappling with hyperinflation estimated at 231 million percent .

"(CNN)  -- Iran's parliament has asked authorities to arrest ""the main instigators and directors"" of Sunday's violent anti-government protests, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday, the same day massive pro-government rallies were held in Tehran and other cities. Legislator Hassan Noroozi named three people he said ""must be arrested"": Mehdi Karrubi, Mir Hossein Moussavi and Fa'ezeh Hashemi. Karoubi and Moussavi are opposition politicians who challenged President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in June's elections. Hashemi is the daughter of the former reformist president, Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. ""They must not remain on the sidelines and be safe,"" Noroozi said. ""Those who issue statements and invite people to create chaos in the streets and attack one another must be dealt with according to Islamic laws."" In Sunday's protests, at least seven demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces, although the Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone. Still, a video released Tuesday appeared to show green and white Iranian police vehicles driving into crowds of protesters and running over at least one. Other videos purported to show people said to have been killed by the police vehicles. Iranian authorities reported that most of the seven dead had died after being struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes,"" according to chief prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi. Amateur video shot by demonstrators showed clashes, and a number of protesters with serious and possibly fatal injuries, including some with apparent gunshot wounds. But the battles -- depicted in sometimes grainy and shaky amateur videos anonymously posted on the Internet -- have drawn harsh criticisms from the international community, and subsequently harsh criticisms from the Iranian government. State media sourced an official as saying that about 500 people had been arrested in conjunction with the clashes. The protests fell on Ashura, a holy day for Shiite Muslims commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D. Earlier Wednesday, IRNA reported that ""two known plotters"" of the violent post-election protests and Sunday's demonstrations had ""escaped"" from Tehran and fled to the north of the country ""to be safe from people's anger."" But the Fars news agency later retracted IRNA's report, saying that ""informed sources have denied the news that leaders of the plotters have left Tehran."" As Wednesday's pro-government crowds headed toward Revolution Square in Tehran, they cried ""Death to America,"" ""Death to Israel,"" and ""Death to Moussavi."" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a group of Islamic students from Europe who were visiting Iran that international leaders who condemned Iran's actions ""want to malevolently change the facts and realities and are also influenced by the Zionist media,"" according to the Iranian Labor News Agency. No government opponents were seen at the rally, said CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr from the capital. Opposition Web sites advised their supporters to stay home. Bozorgmehr, who watched the demonstrations from the sidelines, said that at Vali Asr square, the crowd was so dense he could not make his way through on foot. From a bridge, he overlooked an area from Imam Hossein Square to Revolution (Enghelab) Square, a distance of about 18 kilometers (11 miles). There were ""easily hundreds of thousands, if not over a million people,"" he said. There also were protests in Tabriz, Shiraz, Arak, Gilan and Sistan-Baluchestan province, according to government-funded Press TV. Read more Iran coverage . State television ran messages across the bottom of the screen indicating the nationwide gatherings, which lasted at least two hours, were ""huge."" ""Millions of Iranians gather to condemn insulting Ashura,"" one ticker read. Others reported that marchers had renewed their allegiance to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, supported the Iranian system and renewed their allegiance to the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led Iran for a decade after the 1979 revolution. According to Bozorgmehr, ""The march was orderly and I saw no sign of security forces in any large numbers. The crowd was a mix of men, women and children, as well as large religious processions accompanied by loud speakers denouncing Sunday's protests."" Ahmadinejad said Wednesday's march showed that criticism by foreign nations can never have a negative impact on his country. ""The officials of these countries should understand that their attempts will not affect the Iranian nations' equations, stances and idealistic and perfectionist move,"" Ahmadinejad told reporters at the end of a Cabinet meeting. He said the United States and certain European countries were trying to foment unrest in Iran, and described those efforts as futile, Fars reported. Ahmadinejad also advised President Obama and his European allies to learn from the experiences of their predecessors. ""Officials of the U.S. and certain European states showed again that they have embarked on wrong plans, stances and attitude,"" Ahmadinejad said. The semi-official, state-run ILNA also reported Wednesday that Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki had summoned Britain's ambassador to Tehran, Simon Gass, and notified him of Iran's protest over the ""intervening stance of the British foreign minister."" Mottaki threatened Britain with a ""slap in the mouth,"" ILNA reported. Rally organizers distributed a news release after the march that condemned the Ashura protests. They accused those who participated of acting against Ashura, the holy Quran, Islamic values and the Islamic Republic, according to ILNA (Iranian Labour News Agency). The declaration called the rioters ""Mofsed Bel Arz"" (corrupt on Earth) and said they had waged war against God. The declaration also demanded that Iranian authorities review the country's relations with Britain and France, which, along with the United States, have criticized the Iranian government's intolerance for anti-government protesters. The document praises Iran's state media for their ""courageous work"" in exposing the ""plotters"" and those in the media who were influenced by foreign spy agencies and had ""incited people to riot."" Among the seven who died in Sunday's violence was Moussavi's nephew, Seyyed Ali Moussavi, who was buried quickly on Wednesday with security personnel watching from nearby. There were no demonstrations or disturbances during the burial, and several plainclothes and uniformed security personnel patrolled the area. According to NoroozNews, a pro-reformist news Web site, at least six journalists and political and civil rights activists were arrested early Wednesday. Among them were Badr-Alsadat Mofidi, director of the Professional Journalists' Association; Keyvan Mehregan; political director of the Eetemad Meli newspaper; Nasrin Vaziri, who covers parliament for the semi-official ILNA; and Morteza Kazemian, a staff writer and political activist for the opposition Web site Rahesabz.net, who was detained at 1 a.m. Another journalist, Masha-Allah Shams Alvazein, was arrested Tuesday morning, NoroozNews said. According to its report, ""three young agents showed up at his house with a nameless arrest warrant, and about one hour after he resisted and asked for a name-specific arrest warrant, two older agents showed up and threatened to take him by force if he did not go willingly."" NoroozNews said Mansoureh Shojaey, a women's rights activist, also was arrested Wednesday, shortly after midnight, at her house. There were reports that a prosecutor has signed arrest warrants for 200 journalists, NoroozNews said. In Jerusalem on Wednesday, international representatives of jurists, parliamentarians, human rights activists and Iranian dissidents held a news conference to reveal their petition for additional sanctions against Iran. They cited the country's ""harsh crackdown on opposition demonstrators"" as well as its defiance over its nuclear program. Leading the coalition of about 60 people was Irwin Cotler, a former Justice Minister of Canada, now a Liberal Party member of the Canadian Parliament. He accused the Iranian government of ""gross violations of international law."" ""What we are witnessing in Ahmadinejad's Iran is a toxic convergence of four distinct yet interrelated dangers: the danger of a nuclear Iran, the danger of state-sanctioned incitement to genocide, the danger of state sponsorship of international terrorism and the danger of a massive assault on human rights,"" Cotler said.","NEW: Iran's parliament calls on authorities to arrest three key opposition leaders .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Police cordoned off one of the busiest thoroughfares in the heart of the Greek capital Thursday as a bomb disposal team investigated a suspicious package found at the entrance to a bank. ""This is the second bomb I've been to today,"" said one motorcycle police officer, who said he was not authorized to release his name to journalists, as he guarded a police line blocking off the five-lane Vassilissis Sophias Avenue, less than a block away from the Greek parliament building. Moments later, a bomb disposal expert dressed in the heavy green armor made famous in the movie ""Hurt Locker"" walked briskly away from the suspicious package. Another member of the team counted down loudly in Greek, and then a controlled explosion echoed down the empty boulevard. Authorities later said the package was not a bomb, but that wasn't the case earlier Thursday, when police destroyed another parcel at a courier office. Hellenic Police spokesman Maj. Athanasios Kokkalakis confirmed the parcel contained a ""booby trap bomb."" The parcel was addressed to the French Embassy in Athens and the bombers put the archbishop of Athens as the sender of the package. Greek officials said it was the 14th explosive device to be discovered originating from Greece in the past four days. The events came as the two suspects in the largest letter-bomb campaign in Greek history were remanded into custody after appearing for testimony before a prosecutor, the Citizens Protection Ministry said. The two men are accused of participating in a wave of attempted bombings that has forced the Greek government to suspend air postal deliveries outside of the country for 48 hours. They were arrested in Athens on Monday in possession of two parcel bombs, Glock pistols, a bulletproof vest, and a wig. Many of the packages were addressed to various embassies in Athens, but one arrived at German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office in Berlin and another, addressed to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, made it to Italy. Panagiotis Argyrou, 22, and Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24 were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device which had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the Embassy of the Netherlands in Greece, police said. ""These are stake-holders ... important members of a terrorist group,"" Kokkalakis said. Greek authorities have stressed that they believe the wave letter bombs is the work of a home-grown Greek terror group that does not have ties to international organizations like al Qaeda. Before this week's attacks, one of the suspects, Argyrou, already faced an arrest warrant for his alleged membership in an illegal organization called the Conspiracy of Cells of Fire. Both suspects have so far refused to cooperate with authorities, Greek officials said. ""Until this moment, they keep silent. They don't talk to anyone,"" Kokkalakis told CNN. ""It is their strategic tactic."" When they appeared Thursday before a prosecutor Athens, they refused to testify, saying they ""do not want to take part in this process."" They were then remanded into custody. For decades, leftist- and anarchist-inspired radical groups have carried out acts of political violence in Greece. The most notorious and deadly of these groups, November 17, claimed responsibility for the assassination of the British Embassy Defense Attache Stephen Saunders in Athens in 2000. Greek police, backed by British investigators, eventually succeeded in arresting the masterminds of November 17 in the years that followed. Terrorism experts say they have seen an increase in Greek acts of terror since the 2008 shooting death of a Greek teenager by police in Athens. That incident sparked angry riots and a wave of small bomb attacks on banks and Greek police. The group Conspiracy of Cells of Fire is believed to have emerged during this period. ""This new generation of terrorists have a different motive ... money, publicity,"" said Ioannis Michaletos of the Institute for Security and Defense Analysis in Athens. Michaletos compared these groups to the anarchists who terrorized Europe at the start of the 20th century. ""They don't have a specific leftist ideology,"" he said. ""They just state in their proclamations that their aim is to destroy the system."" In June 2010, a Greek police officer was killed opening a letter bomb that was addressed to the country's top law enforcement minister. Authorities have so far avoided linking that deadly attack to this week's parcel bombs, which apparently contain smaller amounts of explosives and have so far wounded one female employee of a private courier service. In fact, some Greek officials have sought to downplay the threat posed by this week's letter bombers, by describing the suspects as young, poorly trained amateurs. ""The police found them with bus tickets and cards to make telephone calls. A professional wouldn't do this,"" said Vassilis Papadimitriou, a spokesman for the office of the Greek Prime Minister. But the letter bombers have succeeded in forcing the Greek government to take the unprecedented step of halting international parcel delivery for 48 hours. They also have further rattled a society that is already struggling to deal with a deep financial crisis. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou denounced the bombers Wednesday, accusing them of trying to destabilize his government's efforts to rescue the Greek economy. ""Democracy will not be terrorized,"" Papandreou announced on local television.","A suspicious package found outside a bank was not a bomb, authorities say .
A parcel found earlier at a courier office was a bomb, police say .
The two suspects in the case appear before a prosecutor but don't testify .

"New York (CNN) -- A new terrorism warning system will provide the public with information on specific threats, replacing the color-coded alerts put in place after the September 11, 2001, attacks, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Wednesday. In announcing the new system at New York City's Grand Central Terminal, commonly known as Grand Central Station, Napolitano said a main goal was to provide better understanding of the nature of the specific threat, what people should do in reaction to it and how they could help security officials in responding. ""It will provide alerts based on specific, credible information about potential terrorist activity,"" Napolitano said, adding that the alerts would contain ""as many details as we can provide."" Right now, she said, there is no threat that would reach the level to warrant one of the new alerts, which will take effect on April 26. Napolitano made the announcement in the city where more than 2,700 people were killed when two hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center's twin towers. She was joined by New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who both praised the new National Terrorism Advisory System as an upgrade that enhances current security efforts. However, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, cautioned that the new system must ""effectively disseminate threat information in a timely manner and provide sound guidance to the public and affected homeland security partners on the actions they should take to protect themselves and the nation."" Collins urged Napolitano's department ""to keep communication lines open with our state and local homeland security officials and with the private sector so that implementation of the system meets the vision"" set by the secretary. The new system has two levels of alerts, compared to the previous system's five levels, Napolitano said. The two alert levels of the new system are ""elevated threat,"" which ""warns of a credible terrorist threat"" to the United States; and ""imminent threat,"" which ""warns of a credible, specific and impending terrorist threat,"" according to a Department of Homeland Security statement. Any alert will automatically expire after a two-week period, although they could be extended if new information shows a threat persists, DHS said. Napolitano told reporters in a morning briefing that the alerts posted on a department website -- www.dhs.gov/alerts -- will provide details to show the nature, location and other information about terrorism threats. Therefore, she said, a specific warning may apply to a particular address, community, city or region, rather than the non-specific general warnings of the color-coded system. Alerts also will be announced by her office and made public via traditional media such as television announcements and radio broadcasts, as well as social media, Napolitano said. She conceded that the color-coded system ""has faded in utility except for late-night comics,"" noting that the warning level at airports had been at orange since 2006. ""That's one of the reasons why people (stopped) paying attention to them,"" Napolitano said. Instead of a constant state of undefined warning, she said, the new system will react to actual threats. ""We don't want people to live in fear,"" she said. ""We want people to live in a state of alert and awareness."" Her department is asking the public to be on alert for any suspicious activity, incorporating the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority's trademark slogan ""If You See Something, Say Something"" into its alerts. Evaluating the current threat for Wednesday under the old system, the Department of Homeland Security put it at yellow, or elevated. Under the new system, it does not warrant an alert. CNN's Jeanne Meserve contributed to this story.","NEW: Secretary Napolitano says people ignored the old system .

"The airline industry has seen fewer travelers take to the skies in the wake of the global financial downturn and rising fuel costs. The knock-on result is that flight operators too, have had to cut costs. In some cases that meant reducing routes or removing the additional amenities like the airline goodie bags of socks, toothpaste and eye masks. But one thing that hasn't changed is the care and attention paid to the fine wines and champagnes available on board. According to wine connoisseurs and airline experts, the aviation world purchases several million gallons of wine annually and with many operators providing the finest vintages on offer, airline budgets can go into millions of dollars. Read more: Happy snapping food critics take to the skies . But it is a tricky situation as at high altitudes the human taste palette changes, and so the sommeliers of the skies must combat this disparity while offering delicious wine for the travelers to savor. Robert Joseph, the editor-at-large of Meininger's Wine Business International tells CNN: ""What happens at altitude is that the product doesn't change, it's the way you perceive it that changes. Within your body you perceive less of the fruit that is in a wine and more of the acidity and more of the tannins, the hard texture, you'll get in red wines. ""Ironically, some of the finest wines in the world, some of the finest Bordeauxs, actually don't taste good at altitude,"" he says. ""Some sweeter wines from say Chile or California which are fruitier but softer to drink, merlot, pinot noir wines are often more fun to drink than cabernet sauvignon wines in the air."" Joseph also points out the act of air travel, which can often leave a traveler dehydrated and in a state of some tension, can also have an effect on the taste of a glass of wine for a passenger. Doug Frost is the master sommelier for the world's largest airline, United, which serves seven million bottles each year. He is charged with the mammoth task of finding wines with a rich bouquet and unique palette, while also providing passengers with a vibrant array of choices. ""We're not certain why things change but what we can say is that....we need to pick wines that ramp up the intensity, that ramp up the character and flavors."" Passengers are given the choice of a champagne, two reds and two whites, but give little consideration as to how or why that particular wine was chosen by the airline during planning stages, which see wine choices made often months or even a year in advance. Read more: 'Hidden' airline charges -- Dirty tricks or customer choice? Frost says: ""My focus is very much about whether the wine is stable -- so that I know the fruit and character of that wine is going to be the same in three to six months because it may be that long before we board it. ""I also need to know that the fruit is so forward that the wine is expressive, that the wine has so much to say that at 35,000 feet I can still smell it,"" he adds. Frost meets with the rest of his team once a year and they go through the wine options provided for tender and pick 75 blends for the following year. If a wine can pass the altitude taste test and make it on board, the producing vineyard has a great opportunity to broaden its market. Certainly for the first class cabin or business class, Frost says: ""[Winemakers] see that as a really sexy place to be -- as a place they want their label to be seen."" An airline's selection often reflects the national and regional preferences of their passengers. With United, Frost chooses a variety of new and old world wines. Read more: Beating the stress of business travel . ""If you like wines across the board, new world wines tend to have brighter fruits, jammier fruits, so they're going to show a little better than older world wines. [But] that's painting with a very broad brush."" Other flight operators pride themselves on taking the opportunity to showcase their national range of wines. For example, Qantas say they invest over $25 million dollars in the Australian wine industry annually through their Qantas wine program. The program has a panel of wine judges and winemakers who choose a diverse selection of 250 specially chosen local wines. Alison Webster, Qantas executive manager customer experience says: ""We pride ourselves on developing a selection of wines, from the latest wines made by boutique winemakers to the iconic drops that form the very base of Australia's great winemaking legacy."" And it seems this national focus has paid off for the airline, who earlier this year, won six accolades at the Cellar In The Sky Awards, a 27-year-old internationally-recognized competition that focuses on naming the airlines with the best wines annually. Joseph says that for countries like Australia, who have strong wine production industries, showcasing a national wine selection is not unusual. ""You could argue that for airlines like Qantas, that's not so difficult. Air France... you could argue that they would find it easy. The Turkish airline for example, there are some very good Turkish wines but you've got a smaller range to choose from,"" he says. ""There is a question of how open is the tender? The ideal is obviously an airline with deep pockets that is prepared to buy wine from a broad range of countries and is aware of what you need to have to be serving wine in the air.""","Airlines might be cutting costs but not when it comes to their annual wine budget .
Wines must be carefully chosen for consumption at altitude as human palette changes .

"A leading humanitarian organization has urged soccer's ruling body FIFA and the Qatari government to honor their commitment to reform employment laws for migrant workers ahead of the 2022 World Cup, amid fears that stadiums will be built using an exploited labor force. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has compiled a 146-page report -- ""Building a better World Cup: Protecting migrant workers"" -- examining Qatar's recruitment and employment system, where 94% of its workforce are migrant workers. The Qatari government recently suggested it will replace the current sponsorship scheme  --  where all foreigners must be sponsored by local employers to work and reside in the country -- with a system of contracts between employers and employees. But HRW said that it might prove of no benefit to the workers constructing the stadiums needed to host the tournament. ""The government needs to ensure that the cutting-edge, high-tech stadiums it's planning to build for World Cup fans are not built on the backs of abused and exploited workers,"" HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said. ""Workers building stadiums won't benefit from Qatar's general promise to end the sponsorship system. They need a deadline for this to happen before their work for the FIFA games starts."" Qatar is smaller than the Bahamas in land area, has less than 300,000 citizens, but  boasts the highest per capita GDP in the world. But in HRW's interviews with 73 migrant construction workers they reported a host of problems, including unpaid wages, illegal salary deductions, crowded and unsanitary labor camps, and unsafe working conditions. The Qatari Labor Ministry denies that workers are being exploited. ""The Ministry has received no complaint of forced labor and it is inconceivable that such a thing exists in Qatar as the worker may break his contract and return to his country whenever he wishes and the employer cannot force him to remain in the country against his will,"" it said in a letter to HRW, an international non-governmental organization which conducts research on human rights. The report seeks to address apparent concerns over worker safety in Qatar's construction industry and claims that discrepancies exist between the number of construction worker deaths reported by local embassies and the number reported by the government. While the Nepali embassy reported 191 Nepali worker deaths in 2010, and the Indian embassy reported 98 Indian migrant deaths -- ncluding 45 deaths of young, low-income workers due to cardiac arrest, so far in 2012 -- the Qatar Labor Ministry says there have no more than six worker deaths over the last three years. Qatar's success in being chosen by FIFA as 2022 World Cup hosts is likely to mean an anticipated construction boom in the Arab state. The local organizing committee for the tournament, the Supreme Committee for Qatar 22, and the company it appointed to help oversee World Cup construction, CH2M HILL, have said they will establish labor standards that builders and other contractors hired to build World Cup venues must meet. FIFA, meanwhile, has pledged to raise worker rights issues with the Qatar government. Those commitments are a beginning, HRW says, but it wants additional steps, including minimum employee standards in line with Qatari law and international labor standards for private contractors involved in World Cup-related construction. ""Ensuring international standards for workers' rights and conditions has and will continue to be at the forefront of our committee's strategic planning and implementation,"" said the the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee.  ""We are fully committed to ensuring that preventative measures are in place to safeguard workers ahead of all construction projects directly relating to the 2022 FIFA World Cup."" Fifa was not immediately available for comment.","Human Rights Watch issues warning over employment laws for migrant workers ahead of 2022 World Cup in Qatar .

"(CNN) -- American airstrikes earlier this month during a western Afghanistan battle with Taliban militants may have killed up to 30 civilians, an interim U.S. military report said on Wednesday. Villagers sit near the graves of victims of airstrikes in Garni, in western Farah province. The report is part of an ongoing investigation into a fight in Farah province, where villagers reported civilian casualties as a result of U.S. bombing runs on May 4. ""A review of the physical evidence is inconclusive in determining the exact number of civilian and insurgent casualties,"" the military said in a statement detailing the report. ""In all, the investigation team estimates that 60-65 Taliban extremists were killed in these engagements, while at least 20-30 civilians may have been killed during the fighting. The investigators continue to attempt to better confirm casualty numbers."" The report was released amid widespread dismay and anger in Afghanistan over several incidents of civilians caught in the crossfire of the war between international and Afghan forces, and Taliban militants. As the report was released, NATO's command reported that a Tuesday airstrike caused casualties among civilians it says were held as human shields by insurgents in the southern Afghanistan province of Helmand. Complicating the U.S. military effort to determine an accurate death toll for insurgents and civilians in the Farah incident is the fact that Muslims quickly bury their dead and the Taliban don't wear traditional uniforms. The military statement said that incident began when ""a large number of Taliban fighters"" came to the villages of Ganj Abad and Grani on May 3 and demanded payments from village officials. The military said there were reports that militants executed three former officials of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Afghan National Police and soldiers embarked on an operation to oust the Taliban militants, the report said. When police approached Grani, they were ambushed and five police died. That prompted the local governor to call in coalition troops. As coalition and Afghan troops worked to help the police, Taliban militants fired on those forces. During this fight, the coalition called in F/A-18 air support to counter enemy fire and rescue a wounded Afghan soldier trapped by Taliban fire. That soldier, a first sergeant, was hustled to safety by coalition and Afghan troops. ""Following this, one B-1 provided fires in coordination with the ground commander on buildings and a tree grove insurgents were firing from or massing in,"" the military said. Afghan and U.S. forces remained in the area until morning and saw the return of villagers who fled the area before fighting. A U.S. military source, who requested anonymity because the full investigation has not been made public, said a review of combat camera footage and cockpit audio recordings indicates three F/A-18s and a single B-1 bomber took sequential turns over Farah province during the fighting. The B-1 dropped three bombs and the F/A-18s dropped five, the official said. The military statement said video ""clearly depicts insurgents entering the buildings, which were then targeted in the final strikes of the fight."" ""Combined with audio recordings of the ground commander and air crew conversations, the investigators were able to confirm that the insurgents fleeing from the firefight were regrouping in several small rural buildings, which were then subsequently destroyed."" The source said civilian deaths were ""most likely"" accidental. Military investigators who went to the region found one grave site with 22 fresh mounds and another site with four. They also went to a mass grave, but could not determine how many people were buried there. Military investigators thought it was an insurgent grave site, because the mass grave was not pointed toward Mecca -- usual for Muslim burials -- and did not have the markings of a traditional grave of the region, the official said. Insurgents usually are buried in that untraditional manner, the U.S. military source said. In the past, the U.S. military has paid compensation to victims' families and intensely criticized the Taliban for holding civilians in conflict zone -- and did so again on Wednesday. ""We regret the loss of any civilian life and express our condolences to the families who lost loved ones in this fighting with insurgents firing from and regrouping in villagers' homes,"" said Col. Greg Julian, a U.S. military spokesman. ""We continue to work closely with the Afghan National Security Forces to bring security and progress to Afghanistan, and to do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties. We strongly condemn the Taliban for their brutality in deliberately targeting and using civilians as human shields."" NATO's International Security Assistance Force said on Wednesday that an airstrike targeting militants in Helmand province caused civilian casualties and said possibly eight civilians died. The incident occurred in Nawa -- south of Lashkar Gar in Helmand province on Tuesday, and it began when about 25 insurgents attacked an ISAF patrol. Troops called in air support during what ISAF called a ""dangerous situation,"" and an aircraft dropped ""one piece of ordnance, which ended the engagement."" ""The ISAF troops, however, were not aware that the insurgents were once again using civilians as human shields. If this information had been known by ISAF troops, no ordnance would have been used,"" ISAF said. ""This terrible incident again shows the insurgents' blatant disregard for the lives of Afghan people."" The bombing happened about 8 a.m. Wednesday (0430 GMT) on the road between Kabul and Bagram. The attack was under investigation, a military statement said. Further information was withheld, pending notification of next of kin. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan killed 30 Afghan civilians, U.S. says .

"(CNN) -- Can-Do founder Eric Klein spent most of 2010 in Haiti helping people recover from the devastating earthquake. As he returns to Haiti in 2011, his first stop will be at an orphanage that his charity helped rebuild last year. The 50 children there call him ""EK."" The orphanage is completely out of food and resources. ""When you get out there, it is again the first day of the disaster -- it is like you are there for the first time,"" Klein said. ""The need is still so great -- the disaster is not over, and in some ways it is just getting worse."" ""Why do I do it? Anger and frustration. If it was your kids, and you were in the same situation, you are going to do whatever you can. You are not going to stop. And for the aid workers, the Haitian people have become family and we are emotionally invested, so we will see it through."" For all the efforts of aid workers, Haiti is still struggling with tattered tent cities, scarce basic necessities, and a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 3,000 people. ""It is hard to go back,"" Klein said. ""People are out there, risking their lives and trying to make a difference, but they are limited, and for many the funding is gone. There is so much to do in Haiti that it is overwhelming."" And while donors, and prospective donors, are frustrated with the results of the dollars they sent in the wake of the quake, Klein is frustrated too. ""I don't want to say nothing has been done, and you don't want to take away from the groups that are out there, trying their hardest to make a difference,"" Klein said, ""but where is the master plan? People are dying. People are running out of time."" According to Klein, nongovernment organizations working in Haiti are mostly responsible for slow progress, and he encourages donors to hold them accountable. But the Haitian election and resulting political turmoil have delayed the launching of much-needed recovery projects, he said. ""We have supplies right now with Haiti's customs, still being processed, which was originally sent over there, and needed there, more than three weeks ago"" Klein said. ""It discourages you when they are in total desperation and they look at you as the person to help them -- and your hands are tied. You can't get the stuff out and you go back to them empty-handed, and it is the worst feeling in the world."" Despite aid worker frustrations, Caryl Stern, president and CEO of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, has seen improvement. During the earthquake, roughly 4,000 schools in and around Port-au-Prince were destroyed. By the end of 2010, UNICEF had completed 57 semipermanent schools, with another 70 under construction. It has also re-equipped 2,000 temporary schools with learning materials such as backpacks, blackboards and furniture. Stern's greatest encouragement is the children's crisp white uniforms. ""A month ago I was awed by 40 schoolgirls at a semipermanent school, who were wearing spotless white school uniforms,"" she said. ""Most of these girls are still living in tents, but every day they scrubbed their shirts, stretched them to remove wrinkles, folded them tightly to their textbook and placed them under their mattress. If this is what their future means to them, who am I to give up and say no?"" Her frustration with donor fatigue is that it has turned into an intellectual debate, weighing donations and speed of progress. Stern said this debate ignores the fact that these are people, and their lives are in the balance. ""I don't want America to stop from asking these tough questions, because they have to keep all of us on the ball. I just want them to understand that the option to stop helping Haiti, while we address those questions, is that people will die,"" Stern said. This additional crisis of cholera in Haiti is being met by organizations already dealing with exhausted volunteers, donor fatigue and doubt. ""We are really stretched right now in our own capacity, and we are making a call to other organizations to step up response."" said Jennifer Tierney, development director for Doctors Without Borders. Thus far, Doctors Without Borders has treated 84,500 people suffering from cholera, and the group does not see an end to the epidemic on the immediate horizon. Samaritan's Purse has also issued an urgent call for medical professionals to volunteer in Haiti. In addition to volunteers, the group needs financial support to continue to provide medical supplies. It has sent 10 planeloads full of these supplies, but the supplies are barely keeping pace with the need. ""It can take 24 bags of IV solution, eight bags a day for three days, per person. If you then look at thousands of people affected, you can see the overwhelming need."" said Melissa Strickland of Samaritan's Purse. She understands the frustration donors feel, and said the slow progress weighs heavy on the aid workers as well. ""It hits your heart, to see more suffering on top of suffering. We are working such long hours, and you just try to focus on what is being done, and hold the hand of the mom who is scared her baby is going to die, and you reassure her and tackle the task at hand -- you focus on that, and that is what keeps you going,"" said Strickland.","Haitian customs processes are keeping medicine from getting to earthquake survivors, said Klein .

"A three-judge panel court on Tuesday acquitted Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon of charges in the shooting death of a man in his hometown. Simon was charged with involuntary murder in the death of Michell Esteban Castillo, 25, and with injuring the victim's cousin Starlin Castillo, 17, early on January 1 in the nearby town of Luperon. Defense attorneys argued that the prosecution failed to prove Simon fired the pistol that killed Castillo, who he said was a childhood friend, during a New Year's Eve celebration. Prosecutors claimed that Simon had bribed witnesses, including the wounded cousin, who on Tuesday appeared less certain that Simon was the shooter than he had been in previous statements to police and the media. Prosecutors said they will wait for the official verdict to be released but plan to appeal to the regional appellate court in Santiago. In the Dominican Republic, prosecutors can appeal an acquittal to a higher court within 20 working days. Simon faces a 10-year sentence on the charges. The 30-year-old right-hander started 23 games for the Orioles this season and posted a record of 4-9 with a 4.90 earned-run average. According to local news website gentetuya.com, Simon is expected to sign a $12 million contract with the Orioles.","Alfredo Simon was charged with killing one man, wounding another on January 1 .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Zimbabwe slashed 12 zeros from its currency as hyperinflation continued to erode its value, the country's central bank announced Monday. Patrick Chinamasa, Zimbabwe's acting finance minister, arrives last week at Parliament to present the '09 budget. ""Even in the face of current economic and political challenges confronting the economy, the Zimbabwe dollar ought to and must remain the nation's currency, so as to safeguard our national identity and sovereignty. ... Our national currency is a fundamental economic pillar of our sovereignty,"" said Gideon Gono, governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. ""Accordingly, therefore, this monetary policy statement unveils yet another necessary program of revaluing our local currency, through the removal of 12 zeros with immediate effect."" The move means that 1 trillion in Zimbabwe dollars now will be equivalent to one Zimbabwe dollar. The old notes -- with the highest being 100 trillion dollars -- not enough to buy a loaf of bread -- will remain valid until June 30, after which they will cease to be legal tender. One U.S. dollar is trading above 300 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. This third attempt to lop off zeros comes barely six months after the Zimbabwe government last adjusted its currency as it continues to lose value. World-record inflation estimated to be in the billions of percent -- but officially at 231 million percent as of July last year -- has quickly eroded the currency's value again and again. The highest note on the new set is 500 Zimbabwe dollars. Many Zimbabwean traders have stopped accepting the local currency, preferring foreign currency due to the hyperinflationary environment. Last week, the country's acting finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, allowed the use of foreign currency by everyone else. Despite the use of foreign currency, the Zimbabwe dollars are in acute shortage, resulting in many people sleeping outside their banks hoping to get money the following day. Regarding the cash shortages, Gono blamed Germany for dropping a contract that helped the country print money. ""The country has suffered bouts of cash shortages, which have disadvantaged both the corporate and household sectors,"" he said. ""As a country, we have come to terms with this stubborn reality that we were put under economic sanctions by Germany, which unilaterally cut a 50-year-old contract to supply us with currency printing paper, machinery, spare parts and inks without notice in July last year.""","One trillion in Zimbabwe dollars now will be equivalent to one Zimbabwe dollar .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children. One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns. Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in. The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem. See more stories on VBS.TV . Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand. The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s. These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army. This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations. But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government. For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.","VBS.TV gains rare access to gun market in Pakistani tribal area .

"Nahuala, Guatemala (CNN) -- Officials say at least 46 people were buried in two landslides here. Four of them were Carlos Coti's family members. ""They left behind 20 orphans, because each one had 4, 5 or 6 children they left,"" he said. The first landslide knocked a number of vehicles and a bus off the road. When nearby residents rushed to the scene to help, a second mudslide crashed down on the same spot, the nation's disaster agency said. Constant rains have forced rescue crews to stop and restart their searches for the missing, as anxious family members look on. CNN video shows men, dressed in rain-jackets, digging through the thick mud with shovels and then later carrying bodies on stretchers. Disaster officials report that torrential rains and landslides have left at least 46 people dead, 56 injured, and 16 missing. On Monday, President Alvaro Colom declared three days of national mourning. ""The firefighters and rescue teams are working with the government's equipment so that we can come out of this human tragedy,"" Colom said as he visited one landslide site. Around 11,500 residents have been evacuated and 9,000 have taken refuge in shelters, the nation's disaster agency said. More than 50,000 people have been affected by the punishing rain, said to be the strongest in 60 years. Over the weekend, authorities closed parts of the Inter-American Highway after rains washed out sections of the road and caused at least two accidents. Thousands of homes, in addition to infrastructure and fields of crops, also were damaged by the heavy rains. The torrential downpours come several months after more than 150 people died when Tropical Storm Agatha hit Guatemala in May. Destruction from that storm was widespread throughout the nation, with mudslides destroying homes and buildings and burying some victims. At least nine rivers had dramatically higher levels and 13 bridges collapsed, Guatemala's emergency services agency said. The May downpours created a sinkhole the size of a street intersection in northern Guatemala City. Residents told CNN that a three-story building and a house fell into the hole. Roughly 263 people have died in Guatemala so far this year as a result of rain, the president said. Journalist Alexia Rios Hayashi contributed to this report.","NEW: Emergency officials report 46 dead and more than 50,000 people affected .

"Editor's note: Ken Ballen is president of Terror Free Tomorrow: The Center for Public Opinion, a nonprofit institute that researches attitudes toward extremism. Patrick Doherty is deputy director of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation, a think tank that promotes ideas across the ideological spectrum. Kenneth Ballen says whoever won the election, Iranians strongly favor free elections and a free press. (CNN) -- In a poll conducted three weeks before Iran's June 12 vote, our nonprofit organizations found a consensus among Iranians, including almost all of those who told us they would vote for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. And that consensus is that Iranians want a truly democratic system. Given Iranians' own priorities for their government, the events of the past few days may ultimately weaken President Ahmadinejad's standing -- even among those who did vote to re-elect him. In fact, our survey found that more than 86 percent of Iranians who said they would vote for Ahmadinejad also chose ensuring free elections and a free press as among the most important priorities they have for the Iranian government. The recent events -- the early announcements of election returns, the shutting down of communications networks, the massive protests and now the bloodshed -- have the potential to change what was once an electoral contest into a broader struggle for the soul of the Islamic Republic and the future of Iran itself. Let us be clear: Our polling indicates that the government's actions run counter to the priorities of almost all Iranians, including its own supporters. And our survey shows beyond dispute that Iranians of all political persuasions want more democratic freedoms, not less. Our op-ed published on Monday has drawn much attention -- and misunderstanding. Our nonprofit organizations conducted the only independent and transparent nationwide public opinion survey in Iran before the June 12 vote. The poll found that Ahmadinejad was leading his nearest opponent, the more reform-minded candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, by a more than 2-to-1 margin, with almost a third undecided. Our poll concluded three weeks before the election. It does not predict the final vote, nor does it measure a possible surge for Moussavi, which many believe occurred in the final weeks. Instead, as we wrote on Monday, our survey indicates ""the possibility that the vote is not the product of widespread fraud"" because of Ahmadinejad's formidable early lead. This single finding, however, has obscured our most important findings, and their significance to what is now enfolding in Iran. Nearly 80 percent want the right to vote for all their leaders, including the all-powerful supreme leader, while nearly 90 percent chose free elections and a free press as the most important goals they have for their government -- virtually tied with the top priority of improving the Iranian economy. And here is the most important fact of all: More than 86 percent of those who told us they support Ahmadinejad also choose free elections and a free press as their most important priorities for their leaders. In other words, in our survey, Ahmadinejad supporters back real democratic reforms in Iran as much as supporters of the more avowedly reform candidate Moussavi. Put all together, our polling shows that Ahmadinejad, running a competent campaign, may have had enough support three weeks before the vote to possibly win the election under the electoral rules as they stood. With Ahmadinejad's early lead, it is possible that the vote reported did actually reflect the will of the Iranian people, though now, it is impossible to know. Analysts pore over ""ambiguous"" election results . Yet the government's actions since the election may have changed the debate in Iran from being about candidates to being about democracy. While we do not know whether the election results were rigged, the government's handling of the election itself runs counter to principles of democracy, free press and free elections -- goals our polling shows almost all Iranians, whether or not they support Ahmadinejad, strongly support. Moussavi appears to understand this. Yesterday in a massive rally in Tehran, Moussavi stated as much, saying ""The vote of the people is more important than Moussavi or any other person."" Meanwhile, the subsequent killing of protesters by government security forces will likely only work against Ahmadinejad and by extension now, the supreme leader, even among more than 86 percent of their supporters. While our poll showed Ahmadinejad with an early commanding lead, by the government's post-election response, the irony is that Ahmadinejad may indeed end up stealing the election -- from himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen and Patrick Doherty.","Ballen, Doherty: Iranians, including Ahmadinejad backers, want more democracy .
They say their poll can't determine whether Moussavi had a late surge .
They say government actions have shifted debate to democracy not to who won ."
"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- An audio message purportedly from the highest-ranking at-large member of Iraq's Saddam Hussein regime has been released. The speaker is identified as Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, Iraq's former military commander and vice president who has eluded capture since the fall of the Hussein regime more than seven years ago. The message -- issued on the occasion of the 1968 bloodless coup that brought the Baath Party to power in Iraq -- saluted people who resist the ""occupation."" CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape, posted Friday on a website devoted to national resistance in Iraq. There have been at least five other purported audio messages from al-Douri. Al-Douri, 66, served as vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council. He has been reported killed and captured during the post-U.S. invasion insurgency, but those reports later turned out to be erroneous. He is the King of Clubs (No. 6) on the U.S. military's card deck of most-wanted regime officials. In the message, al-Douri calls himself ""secretary-general"" of the Baath Party. The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2003. However, the military says his influence has waned while he has been in hiding. U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri has erroneously been reported killed in the past .

"(CNN) -- The driver of a truck that crashed into a crowd of spectators in a California desert, killing eight, will not face criminal charges, a spokesman for the highway patrol said on Monday. Four people were also taken to hospitals in serious condition after the Saturday crash at an off-road race in Southern California's Mojave Desert. Five others suffered minor to moderate injuries. ""The reason we are not going to file criminal charges is because it was a sanctioned event,"" said Mario Lopez, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Lopez added that California vehicle codes did not apply to the race because permits were issued to the event's organizers. He said any safety violations would be investigated by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which owns the land where the race happened, or by agencies that handle permitted events. The 200-mile race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, said Tim Franke of the San Bernardino County Fire Department. The Bureau of Land Management has said it is looking into the deadly crash, as well as conducting a safety review of other off-road vehicle events in the state's deserts. The race's sanctioning body, Mojave Desert Racing, urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course. ""But as you can tell, there are no delineations to where the track begins and where the track ends at this point,"" said Joaquin Zubieta, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. Mojave Desert Racing was not immediately available for comment. The land management bureau has said the group was responsible for the safety of everyone at the race. ""You can give all the warnings you want, but at the end of the day, they're out there, they're on their own and they do what they want,"" Larry Webster, automotive editor for Popular Mechanics magazine, said about off-road race crowds. ""It's almost like a vehicular version of running with the bulls, and obviously we can tell it's really dangerous,"" he told CNN. Authorities have identified Brett Sloppy as the driver of the out-of-control truck. In a Facebook message, Sloppy, who has not responded to repeated requests by CNN for comment, said he was devastated by what happened. ""Soo incredibly lost and devistated [sic] my thoughts and prayers go out to all the familys and friends involved,"" the San Marcos resident said on his Facebook page late Sunday. ""Thank you too all my friends for sticking with me even thru these tragic times I love you all."" Vince Dimiao, a driver who was running just ahead of the truck that crashed, said races often take place at night because of the extreme daytime heat. He said officials initially halted the race for an hour because of the crash, then canceled it when the scope of the ""carnage"" became known. Keith Carty, who had a friend killed in the California crash, told CNN's HLN that races attract a certain type of person -- someone who wants to participate as much as watch an event. ""These are hard-core, off-road enthusiasts,"" he said about people who attend off-road races. ""It's not anybody's turn to baby-sit us. We're out there -- we understand the risk. Everybody that was there understood the risk -- the drivers, the spectators, everybody,"" said Carty. Jonathan Davy, who attended Saturday's deadly race and captured the accident on video, said he sensed the danger even before the crash. The event was his first off-road race. ""What seemed to be like a great day ... something I had never been to before, just turned tragic,"" he said. ""It's forever going to be in my head. I couldn't sleep last night. I got chills right now just thinking about it.""

"(CNN) -- E-mail is not usually considered as a form of mobile communication, but new research indicates that it might be time to rethink that. This week, a comScore study indicates that Americans are increasingly shifting e-mail usage from their computers to their mobile phones (smartphones as well as most feature phones support e-mail) and tablets. According to comScore, the number of people visiting Web-based e-mail sites such as Gmail or Yahoo mail from their computers in November 2010 declined 6% compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, the average number of pages viewed on e-mail sites declined even further, by 15%. These statistics do not include usage of dedicated computer-based e-mail programs such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. During the same period, comScore reports, the number of people who accessed e-mail, both Web-based and via dedicated apps, from their mobile devices grew by 36%. Overall, males were 14% more likely than females to use mobile e-mail. Teens aged 12 to 17 showed the steepest declines in computer-based Web e-mail usage, with drops this year of 24% in unique visitors to e-mail sites, 48% in total minutes spent, and 53% in total pages viewed -- likely a result of more teens messaging through social-media tools such as Facebook. But during the same period, this age group showed a 6% rise in mobile e-mail usage. The strongest growth in mobile e-mail usage was for mobile users aged 25 to 34 (60% increase) and 18 to 24 (46% increase). But even the oldest demographic studied, age 65+, showed a 25% increase in mobile e-mail usage. ComScore's research echoes earlier research by Nielsen. Their survey found that in May 2010 U.S. mobile users spent far more time (38.5%) doing e-mail on their phones than any other internet-supported mobile activity. Social media was a distant second, at 10.5%. ComScore vice president Mark Donovan speculates that the growth in mobile e-mail usage is driven primarily by the increasing penetration of smartphones. But the nearly ubiquitous availability and affordability of e-mail on feature phones could also play a strong role. Internet-enabled feature phones are common and affordable from every carrier. Often e-mail service is included with the carrier's basic data plans. In some cases, activating standalone e-mail service may cost a little extra -- $5 to $10/month -- for feature phones. Feature phone users, still the vast majority of all U.S. mobile users, often need e-mail access and either don't own or frequently aren't near a computer. So they're often willing to pay a modest fee to get mobile e-mail service.","Americans are increasingly shifting e-mail usage from their computers to mobile phones .

"London -- Canada and Britain announced Thursday that they have rejected the authority of self-proclaimed President Laurent Gbagbo to make any decision regarding their representatives. Britain noted it has recognized Alassane Ouattara as the democratically elected president of Ivory Coast, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. ""It recognizes the legitimacy of statements made by or on behalf of his government,"" the statement said. ""The British government does not accept the validity of statements made by others."" A spokeswoman for Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the statement was issued ""in response to reports in the press that our high commissioner has been de-recognized."" Britain's representative to Ivory Coast, Nick Westcott, lives in Ghana, she said. Canada's representative was also de-recognized by Gbagbo's representatives. But Canada's minister of foreign affairs, Lawrence Cannon, said in a statement that he has not received a request from ""the legitimate government of Mr. Alassane Ouattara"" to end the ambassador's functions in Ivory Coast. ""Canada does not recognize Laurent Gbagbo's claim to government,"" Cannon said. ""As such his request is illegitimate. We will continue to urge Laurent Gbagbo to cede power to President Ouattara who has been recognized internationally as the legitimate president of Cote D'Ivoire following the November 28 elections.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Information about how and when the government gathers and uses cell phone location data to track certain criminal suspects should be made available to the public, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. At issue was whether the Justice Department could be forced to release once-sensitive records from past cases, following a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said the public's interest outweighed any privacy concerns raised by the government over their warrantless wiretapping. ""The disclosure sought by the plaintiffs would inform this ongoing public policy discussion by shedding light on the scope and effectiveness of cell phone tracking as a law enforcement tool,"" said the judges in their 35-page ruling. ""It would, for example, provide information about the kinds of crimes the government uses cell phone tracking data to investigate."" The ACLU had filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act, asking for court docket information on current and past cases of those tracked using mobile location data. The civil liberties group also wanted to know about the government's policies, procedures and practices when using the tracking technology. The government will now be compelled to release the docket information in cases where there was a conviction or public guilty plea. For cases that resulted in an acquittal, dismissal or were sealed for national security purposes, the appeals court ordered a lower court to re-examine the issue. The government had argued it has the authority to obtain the cell phone data from private telecommunication companies without prior judicial determination of probable cause. The larger constitutional question of whether the Obama administration's warrantless wiretapping policy is proper was not addressed by the appeals court. The current dispute, said the judges, was merely about public access to the information. Shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks a decade ago, the Bush administration stepped up use of domestic covert electronic surveillance, aimed mainly at suspected terrorist activity. The government has strongly opposed efforts to disclose information about their covert surveillance program in certain classified cases. The Justice Department has raised what is called the ""state secrets"" defense, which allows courts to block lawsuits against the government on grounds that the litigation could harm national security. But the judges in the current dispute said the information here ""contains little that is personal"" and that any privacy invasion would be ""marginal."" ""The fact that information about these proceedings is readily available to the public reduces further still the incursion on privacy resulting from disclosure,"" wrote Judge Merrick Garland. ""The most that disclosure is likely to lead to is the fact of a single conviction, not a comprehensive scorecard of a person's entire criminal history across multiple jurisdictions."" He noted such information can be readily found on the Internet and through the media. There was no immediate reaction to the ruling from the ACLU or the administration. The U.S. Supreme Court in November will hear a separate case dealing with police use of a global positioning system tracking device for tailing criminal suspects in their vehicle, without a warrant. The case decided Tuesday is ACLU v. U.S. Department of Justice (10-5159).","Justice Department will have to release some records, ruling says .

"(CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, who grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang raping her, has been forced back to Libya, which she had fled in fear. Qatari authorities took her and her parents from a hotel in Doha, the capital, and forced them onto a military plane that left Qatar early Thursday and landed in rebel-held Benghazi. Al-Obeidy, who has gone into hiding in the city, said the Qataris beat and handcuffed her before forcing her onto the plane. Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. Hours before her deportation, Obeidy told CNN that armed guards had been posted outside her room, preventing the UNHCR representative from assisting her. The Qataris deported her despite repeated requests from U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and unnamed third parties, a UNHCR official told CNN. ""Forcibly returning a refugee who survived gang rape not only violates international law, but is cruel and could trigger further trauma,"" said Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch. ""All eyes are now on the authorities in eastern Libya, who should allow al-Obeidy to leave the country."" Human Rights Watch called on the Transitional National Council to allow al-Obeidy to leave the country immediately. HRW added that an NTC spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad. Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men. She later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families. French diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar. She was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life. But her deportation to Benghazi puts her in a city that remains unstable. A bomb detonated Wednesday night outside the Tibesti Hotel in Benghazi, which has housed foreign journalists, aid workers and foreign officials since the Libyan conflict began. CNN spoke by phone with al-Obeidy from Benghazi, where she had gone into hiding. She said that, besides beating her and forcing her onto the plane, the Qataris had taken everything from her and her parents, including cell phones, her laptop, and money. In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said Thursday that the department is ""very concerned"" about al-Obeidy's safety and had communicated with her. He said officials were working with international organizations to make sure she is safe and finds asylum in ""a third country."" A number of nongovernmental organizations said they were making efforts to get al-Obeidy out of Benghazi to a destination in Europe in the next few days. After arriving in Qatar, al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council -- the Libyan rebel leadership -- was using her. The council denied that, but her presence in Qatar appears to have become an embarrassment to the organization. Qatar's government is allied with the rebels. The UNHCR said it was seeking an explanation from Qatari authorities for al-Obeidy's deportation. An official at the Qatari Embassy in Washington asked CNN to e-mail questions about the deportation, but did not respond to them. CNN's Khalil Abdallah and Tim Lister and Journalist Sherif Elhelwa contributed to this report.","NEW: Rights group official says ""all eyes"" are on eastern Libya officials .

"Calling recent financial losses ""an unacceptable and unsustainable result,"" Qantas CEO Alan Joyce announced Wednesday the airline will cut 5,000 positions over the next three years. Joyce also said the Australian-based carrier would sell or defer the order of 50 planes as it tried to realize $2 billion Australian in savings by 2017. About 1,500 of the job reductions will be in management and nonoperational roles. Other cuts will come as the result of changes to the fleet of airplanes and as some routes are taken off the schedule. ""We have already made tough decisions and nobody should doubt that there are more ahead,"" Joyce said. The CEO put some of the blame on Virgin Australia, which has increased its flights in Australia since 2011 and has the advantage of an ""uneven playing field."" ""The Australian domestic market has been distorted by current Australian aviation policy,"" he said. He also cited record fuel costs and economic volatility. Joyce told investors that Qantas lost $252 million Australian in six months. The airline employs 33,000 people, according to the company website. About 93% of them are based in Australia.","Qantas CEO Alan Joyce says the company needs $2 billion in savings .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Opposition activists formed a human chain outside one of the entrances to Tahrir Square on Saturday afternoon to prevent two Egyptian military tanks from crossing through barricades into what has effectively become an anti-Mubarak enclave in the heart of the Egyptian capital. An eyewitness said scuffles broke out after an army general asked demonstrators to take down their makeshift barricades of corrugated steel and debris, which were built up during 48 hours of bloody fighting with regime supporters next to Cairo's landmark Egyptian Museum. ""This general went through the barricades, they [the soldiers] knocked down some barricades on the way to the museum, which caused some panic and scuffling,"" said photographer Ron Haviv. ""When he did it all chaos broke loose."" Haviv said that initial tension was defused after Gen. Hassan Al Roweni began negotiating with medics who have established a first aid station for wounded combatants just behind the first line of barriers. ""He is still talking to doctors at the clinic,"" Haviv said. ""He is asking them to remove the clinic."" Later, Roweni made a tour of Tahrir. Military guards in red berets struggled to hold back the enthusiastic crowd as many Egyptians tried to embrace and kiss the general amid chants of ""The military and the people are one hand."" Over the past week, Tahrir Square has been transformed from a bustling urban center into a fortified campground inhabited by thousands of well-organized anti-Mubarak demonstrators. It includes sidewalk first aid clinics and stations for charging cell phones, and the protesters respond to threats by blowing whistles and clanging metal rods. The alarm prompts scores of men to race to the entrances to the square, where rocks for stone-throwing are stockpiled in preparation for possible battles. Eyewitnesses said Roweni's visit appeared aimed at trying to persuade demonstrators to reopen the square to ordinary traffic. The officer took to the stage erected at the north end of the square for several minutes and made an unsuccessful attempt to appeal to the demonstrators. ""You can all express your views and opinions freely, but I ask you to put the security of Egypt first,"" Roweni announced through a loudspeaker system. ""This is directed to the youth of January 25th,"" he added, referring to the date when protests first erupted, throwing Egypt into what many observers now call a political revolution. ""There are many people who are manipulating you,"" Roweni said. The crowd chanted a simple answer: ""No, no, no.""

"They've got it all: Free food, fitness facilities, massage rooms, hair dressers, laundry rooms and on-site doctors.  Are they Hollywood celebrities? No, they're Google employees in Mountain View, south of San Francisco, and if you're an employee here you're encouraged to spend 20% of your time on a project of your choosing. It's no surprise Google places fourth on the U.S. Fortune '100 Best Companies to Work For' list. First place belongs to SAS, the world's largest privately held software company which offers free on-site medical care for employees and their families, low-cost high quality child care, a fitness center, library, and summer camp for children of employees. How could this possibly pay off? ""It pays off spectacularly,"" says Milton Moskowitz, journalist and co-author of the Fortune '100 Best Companies to Work For' list since its beginning in 1998.  ""We keep track of stock market performances of companies on this list, and they are consistently outperforming other companies,"" he adds. The payoff shows up in increased innovation and productivity, low turnover, low sickness rates, and high employee satisfaction. In a world warring for increasingly sparse talent, a strong employer image is also not to be underestimated. ""It means you can attract and attain some amazing people"", says Laszlo Bock, senior vice president of people operations at Google. ""People who are exceptional and motivated, and who are driven beyond a good job and a paycheck."" ""Employees matter, and the thought that they just 'turn off their lights' when they come to work is ridiculous"", says Jennifer Mann, vice president of human resources for SAS. ""You are not going to succeed unless you have a stable workforce. Our voluntary turnover is 4% or less in an average industry of 22%, and we estimate it is saving the company hundreds of millions in company turnover."" The approach is a far cry from the 1900s sweatshops of the U.S. So, what's changed? Perhaps not as much as you might like to think. The companies on this list are ""exceptional,"" says Moskowitz. ""They are not the norm. We still have a lot of ground to cover, but 25 years ago it was such a hierarchical business structure and that's changed a lot."" ""The realization that there is a relationship between employee welfare and productivity is actually not new,"" says Daniel A. Wren, author of  Evolution of Management Thought. ""Henry Ford tried a workers' welfare program to deal with high turnover, even paying people $5 a day at a time when that was unheard of. Others have tried similar programs. But, we've come a long way since the backbreaking work of the 1920s. Workers today are smarter, more skilled, more demanding. They want different things."" Research by the Great Place to Work Institute, co-publisher of the Fortune annual list, shows us that today's employees really do want different things - and it is not in their paychecks. Their work with more than ten million employees worldwide reveals that what people want is: Trust in leadership and each other, pride in their work, enjoyment of the people they work with, and fairness and transparency; all things that companies like Google and SAS seem to do well. The key to making this approach successful, they say, is a sincere focus on employee wellbeing. ""A lot of companies think, they can fix just one thing, says Mann, who through SAS also works with companies globally to help them create better work environments, ""They think that if they add a healthcare centre then that will do. But it's a much bigger picture."" Bock agrees, ""The important thing to note is that you don't need a lot of money to do what Google has done. If you give people freedom, they will amaze you."" So, how can you begin to reap the benefits of a happy staff? Simple, says Moskowitz: ""Sit down and talk with your employees. Ask them what they want.""","Google employees in Mountain View get free food, fitness facilities and on-site doctors .

"Washington (CNN) -- Even as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the ultimate goal for the U.S. was to see Libya's president cede power, a senior administration official says the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone and military action to support it would not necessarily last until Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi steps down. This official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said that ""right now, we're focused on stopping the violence."" Clinton said Friday, ""The first and overwhelming urgent action is to end the violence. And we have to see a clear set of decisions that are operationalized on the ground by Gadhafi's forces to move physically a significant distance away from the east, where they have been pursuing their campaign against the opposition."" The purpose of the no-fly zone, the administration official said, is to prevent Gadhafi from attacking his own people. ""It's not designed to have him go. That's not the purpose,"" the official said. ""The purpose of the military action is to prevent massive humanitarian loss of life, to stop the violence. If the violence stops, then you shouldn't leap to say then the military action will continue until he leaves."" The ultimate aim of U.S. policy, the administration official said, remains to force Gadhafi step down. But to accomplish that, the administration's strategy hinges on ""sequencing."" ""There are a lot of different measures,"" the official said. ""If you have a cease-fire in place that is verifiable, then you can continue turning the noose without taking necessarily further action. What we're trying to do is freeze his advance. And then work from there to what was the original call, which was that he has lost legitimacy and he needs to go. But you have to sequence it."" The official conceded that there are many scenarios that could unfold: Gadhafi could remove his forces, or he could temporarily cease attacking, only to later resume fighting. A standoff could ensue. ""That is exactly the crux of the matter. No one can define that."" But, this official says, the administration's main approach now is: ""Keep the international community focused on this, and the result will be that he leaves, but that may take some time."" A top State Department official raised the concern that Gadhafi could return to underwriting terror plots. ""I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well,"" Undersecretary Nicholas Burns said Thursday. ""The danger of him returning to terrorism, and violent extremism himself, the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region."" But a second U.S. official said the intelligence community has been assessing the Libyan leader's capabilities and intentions. There is no indication that Gadhafi will respond with a terrorist attack; he is ""distracted by events in his country,"" but the official said ""no one is discounting his brutality."" The official said it is unlikely Gadhafi could orchestra a ""sophisticated plot"" such as the Pan Am Flight 103 or Berlin disco bombings, but there is always the possibility of smaller-scale attacks. President Barack Obama met Friday with security officials and leaders of Congress, including Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The Michigan Republican said there was a consensus against putting American troops on Libyan soil. ""I think that is a terrible idea. It would be a terrible option,"" said Rogers, who supports the no-fly zone. ""I can't foresee a circumstance that would require U.S. soldiers on the ground in Libya."" Rogers said that protecting civilians and chemical weapon stockpiles are the top priorities. ""This buffer zone is incredibly important to protect those people and other Libyans who have stood up to Gadhafi and said 'no more, we want freedom and self-rule,' "" the congressman said. CNN's Pam Benson and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","NEW: Consensus is against using U.S. ground troops, congressional leader says .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- An American attorney representing Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier said Saturday that the former dictator returned to Haiti in hopes of recovering millions frozen in Swiss bank accounts and channeling them through a U.S. intermediary to help rebuild his troubled homeland. In the past, Duvalier has attempted to personally claim the $5.7 million in a bank account belonging to a family foundation. But attorney Ed Marger said the highly controversial and polarizing former leader now wants to use the money to help Haiti, devastated a year ago by a massive earthquake. ""He doesn't want the funds for himself,"" Marger told CNN. ""He wants a transparent entity to release the funds."" Marger is working with two other Georgia attorneys -- former Republican congressman Bob Barr and Mike Puglise -- to find a company that could transfer those funds. Marger named business consultants Ernst & Young and Deloitte as two possibilities. Duvalier stands accused of pillaging Haiti's national treasury during his brutal 15-year rule. Haitian authorities are investigating allegations of corruption and embezzlement but the strongman has not yet been formally charged. He also could face further charges of human rights abuses committed under his leadership. Amnesty International wants Duvalier to face justice for the alleged torture and killings of thousands of Haitians. Barr, who represented Georgia's 7th District from 1995 to 2003, and was the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nominee, said Saturday that the allegations against Duvalier are just that. ""I deal with allegations all the time,"" he said. ""They are the cheapest commodity on the market."" Barr said he returned to Port-au-Prince for the first time in nearly 30 years because he believed Duvalier is genuinely interested in alleviating Haiti's suffering. He said the Caribbean nation was in worse shape now than it was when Duvalier was at the helm. ""I also am reminded of others who have risen from the ashes,"" Barr said. ""The city of Atlanta is the Phoenix city. The people of Haiti, likewise, will rise from the problems created by last year's earthquake and emerge stronger and better than before. That I know is Mr. Duvalier's deep wish and something that he knows in his heart."" He said the three American lawyers were not involved in Duvalier's legal problems in Haiti. They were there to advise him on international matters. On Friday, Duvalier spoke publicly for the first time since his unexpected return. He stopped short of apologizing to the Haitian people but said he regretted their suffering. ""The desire to participate at your side in this national reconstruction effort is more important than any of the problems I could face,"" he said. ""The price to pay is not important. The essential (thing) for me is to be with you."" He made no mention of political ambition, though his return at a tumultuous moment in Haitian history has fueled speculation about his real intentions. Haiti's November elections resulted in controversy and have yet to be resolved. But many people believe Duvalier's actions were motivated not by power but money. Reviled by some Haitians who remember the despot's lavish lifestyle in the Western hemisphere's poorest nation, Duvalier reportedly lost much of his wealth in his bitter divorce from Michele Bennett in the early 1990s. Marger said Duvalier was living an austere life and was dependent on the generosity of friends and family. He has laid claim to the $5.7 million in Switzerland but that battle has dragged on for a quarter century. A new Swiss law that goes into effect February 1 eases the repatriation of the money even if Haiti declines to prosecute Duvalier. However, Haitian authorities must show that the country lacked the resources for legal action or that Duvalier was not within reach. By making himself available, Duvalier could potentially erase Haiti's right to the funds. After the earthquake, Duvalier pledged some of the money to the Red Cross for relief efforts. His attorney in Haiti, Reynold Georges, told CNN that Duvalier had already transferred money to the agency. ""There have been media reports for more than a year about a donation from Mr. Duvalier for Haiti earthquake relief, but the American Red Cross has no record of ever receiving any donation from him,"" said Laura Howe, spokeswoman for the Red Cross. In any case, she said, the Red Cross is not willing to accept Duvalier's money. ""We simply would not accept a donation from someone accused of taking funds from the coffers of a government entity,"" she said. Marger, who has known Baby Doc from childhood, said Duvalier had changed in exile. Marger found the 59-year-old Duvalier to be much more humble than he was when he became president for life at the young age of 19. ""He's a lot more interested in doing something productive,"" Marger said. Duvalier set foot on Haitian soil after 25 years in exile. He came back to nation struggling to recover from the earthquake's destruction, a cholera epidemic and political chaos. It's unclear what his presence in Haiti will mean for its future. CNN's Kimberly Segal contributed to this report.","Duvalier is seeking advice from three U.S. lawyers, including former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr .

"(CNN) -- Several Western powers banded together Saturday in urging Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to do all he can to prevent bloodshed and speedily fulfill his promises of reform. The heads of England, France and Germany joined their counterpart in the United States on Saturday in calling on Egypt's leader to institute substantive policy changes in short order as well as new, open elections. ""It is essential that the further political, economic and social reforms President Mubarak has promised are implemented fully and quickly, and meet the aspirations of the Egyptian people,"" said a joint statement issued by British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""The Egyptian people have ... a longing for a just and better future,"" the statement continued. ""We urge President Mubarak to embark on a process of transformation, which should be reflected in a board-based government and in free and fair elections."" Acknowledging the ""moderating role"" played by Mubarak in the Middle East, the Western leaders urged him to ""show the same moderation"" in Egypt and allow people to demonstrate peacefully. They also called for ""full respect for human rights and democratic freedoms, including freedom of expression and communication."" Meanwhile, Washington continued Saturday to keep up pressure on the Egyptian leader, on the same day he announced a new deputy, among other Cabinet changes. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley tweeted that the Egyptian government ""can't reshuffle the deck and then stand pat.""  He added that Mubarak's ""words pledging reform must be followed by action."" ""With protesters still on the streets"" in Egypt, he wrote, ""we remain concerned about the potential for violence and again urge restraint on all sides."" The people of Egypt ""no longer accept the status quo,"" Crowley added. ""They are looking to their government for a meaningful process to foster real reform."" President Barack Obama had said Friday that he had spoken with Mubarak after the Egyptian president made a televised speech. Mubarak, in his address, said he understands ""these legitimate demands of the people and I truly understand the depth of their worries and burdens, and I will not part from them ever and I will work for them every day."" Obama said he told Mubarak ""he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise."" ""Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people,"" Obama said in a televised appearance Friday. ""Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away."" Members of Obama's diplomatic and national security teams, including Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a two-hour discussion on Egypt Saturday morning, according to White House spokesman Tommy Vietor. Obama himself convened a similar meeting on the situation in the early afternoon. In an interview conducted Friday morning in Davos, Switzerland, British Prime Minister Cameron told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that ""reform and progress in the greater strengthening of democracy and civil rights"" is needed in Egypt. The interview will air at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Sunday on the ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" program on CNN. Cameron said ""just the act of holding an election isn't enough,"" urging a ""more mature and thoughtful approach"" to build a stronger democracy. He made a point that he didn't think the overthrow of Mubarak -- whom he called ""a friend of Britain"" -- was necessary. ""What we support is evolution, reform, not revolution,"" the prime minister said. ""We'd all be better off if there were more countries with more democratic institutions,"" he added. ""But let's recognize those institutions need to be built from the bottom up, not always sort of dropped in from the top down.""","NEW: In an interview to air Sunday, U.K. leader calls Mubarak a 'friend of Britain'

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Brief clashes erupted Saturday in Yemen between hundreds of pro- and anti-government demonstrators who staged rival rallies in the capital. The clashes, which left a small number of people injured, followed an anti-government protest Friday night in which men armed with knives attacked more than a thousand demonstrators, according to human rights groups. A group of around 700 people turned out Saturday morning at the gates of Sanaa University to give their support to the Egyptian people following the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, said Fuad Dahaba, a member of parliament for the opposition Islah party. The protesters also demanded change in Yemen and called for the fall of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime. ""Yes to the revolution, no to oppression,"" they chanted, alongside cries of ""The people are the power"" and ""Saleh, leave -- leave while you can."" Thousands of other anti-government demonstrators began marching through Sanaa's streets to join the protest at the university. At the same time, about 400 pro-government demonstrators had been gathering at Sanaa's Tahrir Square in a festival atmosphere, chanting ""No to chaos, yes to peace."" Those pro-government demonstrators then walked from the square to the university gates, where their rival protesters tried to stop them from gathering in the same spot and clashes erupted, according to Faisal Al-Namsha, 32, an anti-government demonstrator. Al-Namsha said he was attacked by the government supporters, who began hitting with sticks and fists when the clashes began. Anti-government protesters, some of whom were also carrying sticks, fought back, Al-Namsha said. At least six anti-government demonstrators were hurt, he added. Security forces then stepped in and the demonstrations ended. Anti-government protests have recently spread across Yemen, inspired by the revolts that ousted the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents. The protesters Friday had initially taken to the streets of Sanaa to support Mubarak's ouster but later changed their focus to Yemen. ""Yesterday Tunisia, today Egypt, tomorrow Yemen will open the prison,"" some chanted Friday, according to Human Rights Watch. A prominent Yemeni human rights lawyer, Khaled Al-Anesi, said he suspected pro-government demonstrators involved in the knife attacks Friday were security forces in civilian clothes, but government spokesman Tareq Shami denied that. ""We did not call for any protests and those out today from both sides were expressing their opinion,"" he said Saturday. Al-Anesi said at least 17 people were arrested, most of them rights activists. A day after the clashes, Yemen said it is confident the military council that took over Egypt will steer the nation through the political crisis, the Yemeni official news agency reported Saturday. Yemen ""expresses its respect for the choice and the will of the Egyptian people,"" a government official said, according to Saba news agency. Saleh has said he will not seek another term and would postpone parliamentary elections scheduled for April to allow more time for reform talks with the opposition.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels said Saturday that they were gaining traction in a series of offensives in several parts of Libya controlled by ruler Moammar Gadhafi -- claims that the Libyan government swiftly disputed. Heavy gunfire was heard in al-Zawiya, located about 33 miles west of Tripoli, where rebels had arrived. Rebels entered the city center and managed to cut off the road to Tripoli, they said. Talha Jwaili, a rebel fighter, told CNN that rebels control al-Zawiya. Ten rebels died in the fighting, four from Zintan and six from al-Zawiya, he said. More than 20 people were reported injured. A spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region said that rebels control about 85% of the city and that clashes there are ongoing. CNN could not independently confirm Saturday who was in control of al-Zawiya, nor other details of the rebels' accounts. A government spokesman downplayed the fighting, telling reporters in Tripoli that the town is ""absolutely under our control."" Al-Zawiya is strategically important because the coastal road through the city is the main supply line from the Tunisian border to areas held by Gadhafi. Government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said fewer than 100 rebels moved in on al-Zawiya from the southern side of the city, but were stopped. Another group of fewer than 50 rebels was waiting inside the city, but ""took action too early,"" he said, adding that the group is still on the run. ""They are mad. ... This is not an advance. This is what you call a skirmish, what you call a suicide mission,"" Ibrahim said, noting that al-Zawiya is the country's third-largest city. While forces loyal to the Libyan leader tried to defend the capital from the west, rebels announced that they had cut off an important military supply route to the south. Sixty miles to Tripoli's south, rebels said they captured the town of Garyan and pushed the Gadhafi forces to the south, cutting them off from the road to Tripoli. The soldiers left behind heavy artillery and ammunition, rebel field commander Adel al-Zintani told CNN. ""We captured many anti-aircraft artillery vehicles, two full fuel tankers and 106 anti-tank piercing artillery and shells,"" he said. Seven people were injured in the clashes, he said. ""The rebels have 95% control of Garyan and have surrounded a Gadhafi brigade inside a military camp inside Garyan,"" said the spokesman in the media office of the Military Council of the Western Mountain Region. Finally, in the opposition-held port of Misrata, missile attacks by Gadhafi forces ended after rebels captured the nearby town of Tawargha, National Transitional Council spokesman Guma El-Gamaty told CNN. That city was being used by Gadhafi forces to launch missiles indiscriminately into Misrata, he said. Rebels also took a crucial bridge that links Tawargha to Sirte, Gadhafi's hometown and loyal stronghold, he said. However, Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim said government fighters had pushed the rebels away from Tawargha and back to Misrata. Ibrahim also downplayed the rebel claims in other towns. ""Small groups of armed gangs, 50 here, 50 there, some attacked south of al-Zawiya, some attacked north of Garyan, and Tawargha, but they have very weak influence on the ground,"" government spokesman Musa Ibrahim told reporters. ""The people's armed forces are dealing with them, they do not represent a real threat. Tripoli is safe."" He later noted that Gadhafi's forces are ""very strong"" and have the support of ""thousands upon thousands"" of armed volunteers. ""You have to remember we are very powerful,"" Ibrahim said. ""The tens of thousands and tens of thousands of volunteers are armed right now. It doesn't matter whether NATO advances or not, whether rebels advance or not, because we will always be able to fight, in a year's time, in two years, in three years."" Five months into the Libyan war, the rebels have won international support in their effort to oust Gadhafi. They have been aided by NATO airstrikes that began in March after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that ordered civilians be protected. This week, the government accused NATO of killing 85 civilians, including 33 children, in airstrikes Monday near the embattled city of Zlitan. NATO has said there is no evidence that the strikes killed civilians, though journalists, including CNN reporters, taken by Gadhafi's government to the site of the strikes, reported seeing bodies of women and children. It was impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties and if they were all civilian. Kaim on Friday criticized the United Nations for what he claimed was an organizational silence over claims that NATO has violated the mandate of the Security Council by killing civilians and conducting a naval blockade. Ibrahim renewed the government's accusations Saturday, saying NATO is aiding the rebels, whom he described as ""armed gangs."" The comments follow a statement a day earlier by a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon, who said the U.N. secretary-general ""is deeply concerned by reports of the unacceptably large number of civilian casualties as a result of the conflict in Libya."" Ban urged ""all Libyan parties"" to engage with his special envoy, Abdel-Elah Al-Khatib, ""and respond concretely and positively to the ideas presented to them, in order to end the bloodshed in the country,"" the spokesperson said. Ibrahim repeated Saturday his own calls for an end to the conflict, telling NATO: ""Stop this aggression and let's talk peace.""

"After a year of doubt, Serena Williams proved that she is back and as strong as ever as the American secured her sixth U.S. Open title. The world number one blew Caroline Wozniacki away in the final of the U.S. Open, beating the Dane 6-3 6-3. Almost as soon as Billie Jean King had officiated the coin toss, the match was never in doubt as Williams overpowered Wozniacki. The Dane, in her second grand slam final, just had no answers to Williams' power and her serve. At one point early in the second set the 33-year-old Williams had hit 22 winners. Wozniacki had hit just one. Sweet eighteen . The victory secured Williams' 18th career grand slam singles title, taking her level with Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. Williams is now just four behind Steffi Graf, who holds the all time record with 22 career grand slam single titles in the open era. Yet the thought of Serena, who won her first U.S. Open at the age of 17, adding to her 17 grand slam titles seemed slim earlier this year. She had not made the quarter finals at any grand slam this season. Her retirement from Wimbledon during a doubles match added to the sense of crisis. But Williams is judged differently to other players. She's still the world's number one player and has been in imperious form during the past fortnight. Williams didn't even drop a set during the tournament. Wozniacki overpowered . It was a disappointing end to the tournament for Wozniacki, who has returned to form after a difficult period in her personal life after breaking up with Rory McIlroy. But she was gracious in defeat. ""You are an unbelievable champion and an inspiration on and off the court,"" Wozniacki told Williams after the match. ""And we'll go for drinks later,"" she added. Serena Williams was emotional and close to tears after her victory. ""It was a really wonderful feeling,"" she said. ""It was wonderful finish."" Presentation . The victory meant that Williams picked up a cool $4 million, but that wasn't the highlight of the presentation. Navratilova and Evert presented Williams with an 18-carat gold Tiffany bracelet to commemorate her 18th title. But thoughts will now turn to whether Williams can match, or even surpass, Steffi Graf's all time record. ""Now I've got to go home,"" Williams said, ""and get fit again for Australia.""

"(CNN)It's a sunny April afternoon at the University of Rwanda College of Education in Kigali. Some students huddle in groups conversing in hushed voices; others hurry between buildings carrying books. Exams begin in a week. On a grassy knoll behind an office block, Jean Claude Nkusi is giving his 24 children a talking to. ""Study hard everyone,"" he says. ""If you work hard you can improve your life and make it better."" This isn't your typical family. Nkusi is 23. None of his ""children"" share his DNA. In fact, the only thing linking them is that they're all genocide survivors -- ethnic Rwandan Tutsis who lost their families in the 1994 violence that killed 800,000 people. 'It's because of history' Creating ""artificial families"" to help young genocide survivors cope is the brainchild of an organization called the Association for Student Genocide Survivors (AERG). Originally founded by 12 University of Rwanda students in 1996, they've expanded to 43,397 university and high school students from across the tiny east-central African country today. AERG initially creates families from members based on the secondary school or university they attend, after which the newly-formed family meet to democratically elect a willing father and mother from among their ranks. Though they don't all live together, they do help each other out financially and attempt to pool their resources. In the University of Rwanda's College of Education alone there are 21 such families, with hundreds more being set up across the country. ""(We) Rwandans, we used to have big families but during the genocide many people were killed,"" says Daniel Tuyizere, AERG's second vice coordinator at the University of Rwanda. ""To fight against that, we have to build artificial families so that we can go back to the way we were,"" he adds. ""That's why you can find a father with 25 children -- it's because of that, it's because of history."" AERG National Coordinator Constantine Rukundo explains that the concept stems from a basic necessity. ""You need someone to care about you,"" she says, adding that the aim is that the families will stay together for life. ""When you get married your family will be there; they'll be the first to help you."" Scarred by war . UNICEF estimates that 95,000 children were orphaned as a result of the genocide. Seventy per cent witnessed murders or injuries, while many were victims of violence and rape themselves. Their problems continued after 1994. By 2001, an estimated 264,000 Rwandan children had lost one or both parents to AIDS, a disease which was partly spread through the use of rape as a tool of war. Today many of these young people suffer disproportionately from poverty, homelessness, trauma and legal issues, including having had their deceased parents' land taken away from them when they were too young to claim it. Bringing light back . Rwanda is currently in the middle of 100 days of mourning. The 20th anniversary commemorations have been upsetting for many of the young people who still carry both physical and mental scars from the past. Kelsey Finnegan, Project Officer at Survivors Fund, says that trauma permeates into many different aspects of their lives: ""Many for example have difficulties studying, maintaining relationships, or have issues with drugs and alcohol."" Kevin Mugina, 21, says that being in a family environment helps young people to deal with their emotions. ""Some people used to be very angry."" He says that together they discuss their feelings and how to control them enough so that they can live peacefully with their neighbors. Yet, he adds, trauma among his peers is still a huge issue. ""We have kids who have been so shocked from genocide that they have a permanent shock -- that is one of our big problems."" But overall, it seems that they are in good hands. Augustin Nsengiyumua, 27, calls up his artificial mother for all sorts of small things. ""For example if I don't have a pen, or I don't have soap,"" he says. Younger than several of his artificial offspring, Nkusi says that fatherhood is a lot of responsibility but he relishes it. ""You have to know every situation that your children are in -- if they're studying without any problem, if they're eating, everyday life. If one of them is sick I have to be the first one to know it."" He has named their family Urumuri. ""Urumuri,"" Nkusi says, ""means to light something up. It's when something was dark, and now it is bright again."" READ THIS: Intimate images capture the new Rwanda .

"At $83,200 a night, the Royal Penthouse Suite at Geneva's Hotel President Wilson is the most expensive hotel room in the world. Guests are not left wanting for much: the suite has 12 bedrooms and 12 marble bathrooms, plus a wraparound terrace with views of the Alps that have been said to move a handful of famous musicians to song (there's a Steinway piano, should the backdrop not be enough). VIPs traveling without an entourage can make use of the private staff -- butler, chef, personal assistant. While such super-premium suites are nothing new, it used to be that they were a one-off. These days, luxury hotel are clamoring to turn over space (and a lot of it) for these ultra-luxury abodes. Infographic: A short history of hotel room perks . ""There were five-figure rooms in the '90s, but there were fewer,"" acknowledges Nikhil Bhalla, vice president of equity research in lodging at FBR Capital Markets. ""Since then, the world has produced many more millionaires than what existed 20 or 30 years ago, so clearly the number of people who can easily afford these rooms has gone up many fold,"" he says. Last year, as part of a $140 million renovation, the New York Palace Hotel unveiled a couple of specialty suites, including a penthouse overlooking Central Park for $28,000 a night. According to Paul James, the global brand leader for Starwood's luxury brands, of the 40 or so new properties the hotel group has in the pipeline, about half will be outfitted with premium rooms. ""We call them our e-wow suites -- short for 'extreme wow,'"" he says, referring to suites at the W Hotels. Bhalla says that emerging markets are helping to push the demand for luxury rooms to new levels. ""There's more money in the world today than there was five, or even two years ago. In countries like China or India, there's a whole new class and level of people moving up the economic ladder who can afford these luxury experiences. As other parts of the world get developed and their economies get bigger, I imagine that will continue to be the case."" A new class of amenities . Given the price point, it's important these premium rooms offer more in the way of perks than generic shampoo bottles or a pillow chocolate. In many suites -- which these days mimic apartments, or even mansions in size -- bath products range from L'Occitane to Hermes. Butlers, private chefs, personal trainers, drivers and masseuses are on call (and often included in the price). There's usually extra bedrooms, dining and living rooms for hosting and offices for conducting work. Exceptional views and a prime location are a must, as is discretion (most suites have private entrances). Read more: Shhhh! These hotel rooms are a secret! According to Christopher Noton, the president of hotel operations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for the Four Seasons, the real worth of a luxury stay is the service, not the space. ""Our clients go from having multiple expectations to hyper-expectations, and what that means is that we must know who they are, how they act and what they want,"" he says. ""If you want to be left alone, I sense that, and I make sure that happens. If you want to be fussed over, we'll fuss over you. Really, it's the total custom experience."" High expectations? Of course, when someone's dropping that kind of money on a hotel stay, the pressure to make it perfect is heightened. ""There are very high expectations, but then, there's a very high level of personal service,"" says James. Bhalla adds that the higher the price tag, the greater the importance of adding experiential elements to the package -- everything from stunning views of sporting events to NBA-sized basketball courts. ""It's almost a funny thing to say at this price range, but at the end of the day, what people are looking for is value. If I'm spending $25,000 a night at a hotel, am I getting an experience that makes me feel it's worth it?"" he says.","A rise in millionaires throughout the world has created a market for luxury suites .
These swank rooms can cost as much as $83,200 a night .
Perks include everything from private NBA-size courts to a Bentley rental ."
"Ohio voters will repeal a controversial law Tuesday limiting the collective-bargaining rights of public workers, CNN projects based on reported results. With 28% of precincts reporting, 62% of people voted for repealing the law, while 38% voted to keep it, according to the office of the Ohio Secretary of State. The measure was a referendum on state Senate bill 5, the latest in a showdown between union groups, business leaders and lawmakers over the ways state governments negotiate with their employees. It was seen as a barometer for next year's general election in the key battleground state. The bill passed the Republican-controlled state legislature in March and would have limited the bargaining rights of public workers -- including police, teachers and firefighters --  to salaries, workplace conditions and hours. ""Tonight Ohioans have spoken, and spoken freely,"" said Courtney Johnson, a teacher in Hilliard, Ohio, who spoke at an election night rally. ""We don't turn our backs on the people who watch ours."" The law would have also prohibited strikes and promotions based exclusively on seniority, and required public employees to contribute at least 10% of their income toward their pensions. It would have required workers to cover at least 15% of their own health care premiums. Republican Gov. John Kasich signed the measure into law in March, but it was held from going into effect pending the results of the referendum. On Tuesday, he congratulated his opposition. ""It's clear that the people have spoken,"" the governor said. ""Part of leading is listening to and hearing what people have to say to you."" Wisconsin passed a similar measure in March, igniting a firestorm of political activism that drew thousands to the state capital in protest. In perhaps the most visible confrontation of a debate being played out in states including New Jersey, Michigan and Indiana, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's controversial bill pitted unionized labor against statehouse Republicans and raised broader questions about the long-term fiscal health of state and local governments. Since then, activists in Wisconsin and Ohio have collected thousands of signatures in a bid to pressure state lawmakers into overturning the bargaining restrictions. ""Unlike Ohio, Wisconsin workers do not have the opportunity to put a referendum on the ballot. Thankfully we have the right to recall. Today's win in Ohio has energized and excited Wisconsin workers to recall Gov. Walker and put a stop to his attack on working families,"" Phil Neuenfeldt, president of the Wisconsin state American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations said late Tuesday. Tea party activists had lauded the Ohio law as a necessary move to trim government spending, while union groups said it unfairly targeted state workers. ""Although the parts of the law that require public workers to contribute to their retirement and health care costs are popular with voters ... the strong opposition to curtailing collective bargaining and seniority rights apparently is what seems to be carrying the day for the law's opponents,"" said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. But the law's supporters cried foul. ""There is still the opportunity to negotiate contracts (under the law),"" said GOP Caucus spokesman John McClelland, ahead of the vote. ""But there's a certain level that you should have to contribute."" McClelland pointed to slower population growth and a poor economy as cause for retooling the current system. ""All of this just compounds over time,"" he said.","Republican Gov. John Kasich congratulates his opposition .

"On my first full day in the most economically divided county in America, people started telling me about the man who wanders the streets here with an American flag wrapped around his shoulders. Everyone knew him, but no one had many details. Me: Where will I find him? You know, around. Me: Right ... Like where, though? Near the lake, maybe. Sight unseen, this man became a sort of mythical being for me -- a representation of the soul of this part of the Mississippi River Delta, where a body of water and centuries of history largely separate the rich from poor. Surely, he must have something to say about the American Dream. As I wandered around both sides of Lake Providence, the town and the sickle-shaped body of water that separates the rich on the north from the poor on the south, I looked for the man with the American flag at every turn -- on Lake Street, with its boarded-up businesses; at the Grab Bag, a local gathering point; near a cemetery, where locals go to scratch off lottery tickets; at the Dock, a restaurant with a cartoonish red crawfish on the roof and warning signs for alligators. I struck out, again and again. I began to wonder whether the man and the flag actually existed. There's that scene in every great Western film (and in a dream sequence in ""Wayne's World 2"") where the cowboy looks across the desert and sees an elder or shaman in the heat-rippled haze of the horizon. Maybe all of these people imagined the man and his flag? Maybe they wanted a source of hope in a place that's about as economically depressed and desperate as they come. About 40% of people in the parish live in poverty. There would be good cause for a mirage. A reason for an imaginary mascot. But then, five days into the trip, I saw him . He was sitting on a metal parking barrier off Interstate 65. I was scheduled to interview the owner of My Dream Eatery, a rare new-business success story in a town that needs plenty more of those. But I knew I would miss him if I went to the interview. Hell, I was worried if I looked away, he would disappear. I peeked my head into the restaurant as quickly as I could to say that I was going to be a few minutes, sorry, but something had just come up. As I walked toward him across the parking lot, I tried to look nonchalant but also wanted to catch his attention by waving, which is an impossible combination -- one employed successfully only by Mormon missionaries or maybe sex offenders. I said hello -- hi, ahem, my name is John, and I'm from CNN. I'm working on this story, and I, well, I've heard about you. (!) I mean, I've heard about you. (...) George Estes, 59, was kind enough to speak with me. The American flag was neatly folded and wrapped around a backpack, not his shoulders. He was wearing several layers of clothing, a dress shirt, a tie, a tuxedo vest and a jacket. It felt like 100 degrees that day. Few clouds, if any. As we talked, he wiped beads of sweat from his face. But he looked completely and remarkably dapper for a person who walks five, six, seven, eight miles a day -- going nowhere and everywhere in particular. He wears a large backpack, he said, to stop his back from hurting. Estes' parents both died when he was relatively young, and he dropped out of school in seventh grade. He has struggled with mental health issues, he told me. He survives on government disability insurance. ""I'd rather work than just be sitting here waiting on a check,"" he said. But there aren't many jobs here, and he's largely given up. I told him about the gist of my project. I was in East Carroll Parish because it has the highest level of income inequality -- the biggest rich-poor gap -- of any parish or county in the country. Lake Providence is the parish's largest town. Estes told me knows nothing about the wealth that exists in the parish. That's all on the other side of the lake, far away. But he knows about the poverty. ""It's just like anybody else,"" he said. ""Surviving's about the best you can do."" He lives in a rental house owned by his sister Ann Newson. She's never understood why her brother walks so much. They have 12 siblings in all, and he's the only one who insists on walking the streets all day, sometimes into the night. There are many stories I could tell you about Estes, but I'll leave you with two, both about objects he carries with him at all times as he walks around Lake Providence. The first, inside his backpack, is a cornet. Estes used to play taps and did so at his mother's funeral. Now he marches up and down the streets playing his horn, but only if he feels that God wants him to. He hasn't felt that calling in weeks. His sister told a slightly different tale. ""Everyone used to love to hear him blow it,"" she said later. ""I'm sure they would love to hear it now, but he smokes too many cigarettes."" In a nod to one my new favorite philosophers, John Rawls, whose 1971 book ""A Theory of Justice"" is a staple among inequality wonks, I asked Estes whether he thought his life would have been different if he were born on the other side of the lake -- if he were born into wealth rather than relative poverty. My heart broke when he answered. ""I probably would have been a college graduate,"" he said. ""I probably would ... I don't know what I would've been. (An) architect? But I've always been inclined to music, because everybody loves music. ""I ain't got no teeth in the front, but I still blow my horn,"" he said. The second object is the flag. Estes found it crumpled up and discarded on the edge of Lake Providence, the symbolically named lake that's the barrier between rich and poor. ""It was abandoned, and I was abandoned, and he seen me, and I needed it."" He told me he was collecting money to have the flag dry-cleaned. He was embarrassed by how dirty it had become. A few weeks later, on a second trip to Lake Providence, I saw Estes walking by the cemetery. I stopped to say hi and asked about the flag. He revived my belief in humanity when he told me a local dry cleaner tidied it up, free of charge.","East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, has the highest income inequality in America .

"Vladimir Putin delivered a lump of coal in the Kremlin's stocking this year when he announced Thursday that he has canceled holiday vacations for members of the government. Russia's President delivered the bad news at a December 25 meeting he convened of his government, but for those thinking that his timing was merely the diabolical twist of a maniacal scrooge, Christmas is celebrated in Russia on January 7, the traditional date in the Eastern Orthodox Church. ""The Government and its various structures cannot afford such extensive holidays, at least not this year,"" Putin told government ministers in a speech broadcast on state television. ""You know what I am talking about."" He was talking about Russia's battered economy. ""We have been making efforts to change the structure of our economy, to refine it and make it more innovative ... quite a lot has been done in this direction,"" he said.  ""However, recent events show that this is not enough."" It was a change in tone from just a week ago, when Putin largely blamed the West for Russia's woes, even suggesting a U.S.-Saudi conspiracy theory to bring down oil prices at his annual press conference. At Thursday's meeting, however, the President admitted at least some fault . ""The difficulties we have come across are not only of an external type. They are not only due to some sanctions or limitations caused by the global market situation -- they are also the result of our own shortcomings that have piled up over the years.""","Vladimir Putin says government cannot afford to take holiday vacation this year .

"Mexico's federal police had harsh words Wednesday for an American-born accused drug lord who claimed he paid off top security officials. Edgar Valdez Villarreal has repeatedly ""tried to blackmail authorities to obtain privileges,"" Mexico's Public Safety Secretariat said. ""Held in a federal maximum security prison, he has tried to get benefits during his stay, including threatening hunger strikes to pressure them."" Read more: Police: Accused drug lord moved tons of cocaine to U.S. Police released the statement after Mexico's Reforma newspaper published a letter purportedly from the alleged drug lord, a former Texas high school football star known as ""La Barbie"" because of his blue eyes and light complexion. In the letter, Valdez claims that Mexico's top security officials have received bribes from him, ""from drug trafficking and from organized crime."" Valdez told Reforma that authorities arrested him in 2010 after he refused to participate in a deal President Felipe Calderon was allegedly trying to negotiate with the country's major drug gangs. In an address broadcast Wednesday night, Calderon did not respond to that claim, but the outgoing president has repeatedly spoken out against organized crime and corruption. Investigators have described Valdez as one of the most ruthless drug traffickers in Mexico. His letter, police said, aims to stop ""authorities' actions against criminal organizations by publicly discrediting those who have fought them."" Read more: Police: American-born drug kingpin arrested in Mexico . Federal police said Wednesday that Valdez is connected with many violent homicides and implied that he could be trying to avoid justice with his letter. ""Organized crime and its allies historically have tried to maintain themselves in impunity and avoid at all costs that the Mexican government pursues and captures them,"" police said. Spokesman Jose Ramon Salinas read the federal police statement Wednesday but did not take questions from reporters. He said federal police had arrested 128,242 criminals in the past six years, including nearly 3,500 connected with the command structure of organized crime groups. The letter's publication comes amid increased scrutiny of Genaro Garcia Luna, who heads Mexico's federal police. He is scheduled to testify before lawmakers Thursday about his division's human rights record. And his agency is in the crosshairs of Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, who takes office Saturday. Mexico's new leader to U.S.: Let's get beyond the drug war . Pena Nieto has proposed a bureaucratic overhaul that would eliminate Garcia Luna's Cabinet post and place the force under Mexico's Interior Ministry. Asked why she released the letter from Valdez, the accused kingpin's lawyer said she was ""simply and sensibly complying with an instruction my client gave me,"" according to Reforma, and said that her client could be extradited to the United States at any moment. Attorney Erendira Joselyn Guerra Gutierrez told the newspaper that Valdez had a right ""for facts to be clarified and for justice to be done."" GPS: Misconceptions about Mexico . Valdez is accused in the United States of attempting to launder money and conspiring to import and distribute cocaine. Valdez is believed to have played a key role in shipping roughly 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of cocaine across the border at Laredo, Texas, every week for much of 2005, U.S. authorities have said. Before his arrest, U.S. Justice Department officials offered a $2 million reward for information leading to the capture of the alleged cocaine kingpin. In Mexico, Valdez faces charges that include drug trafficking, kidnapping and arms possession, Mexico's Attorney General's Office has said. Mexican authorities touted his 2010 arrest as a high-profile win in the nation's drug war. Defiant former mayor in Mexico is killed . Valdez was allegedly a one-time top lieutenant of Mexico's most wanted man, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. He later joined the breakaway Beltran Leyva cartel, but the leader of that group, Arturo Beltran Leyva, was killed in a shootout with Mexican officials in late 2009. Beltran's brother Carlos was arrested, leaving Valdez in a fight to fill a power vacuum in one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels.","Federal police say Edgar Valdez Villarreal has tried to blackmail authorities .

"Walt Disney Studios is chipping a new ""Frozen"" film off the old block. On Wednesday, the studio announced that its blockbuster 2013 movie will soon have a miniature sequel in the animated short ""Frozen Fever."" The film will reunite the award-winning creative team behind ""Frozen,"" including ""Let It Go"" songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and will bring the film's central characters back to life. Inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen tale ""The Snow Queen,"" ""Frozen"" told the story of two sisters, Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), and how an impressive but isolating gift of Elsa's almost came between them. When ""Frozen"" was released in November, critics praised it as a return to Disney's prime, and the box office backed that up. Domestically, ""Frozen"" earned about $400 million and was the third highest-grossing film of 2013. Disney's new short, ""Frozen Fever,"" will focus on Anna's birthday as her sister, Elsa, and rugged love interest Kristoff ""are determined to give her the best celebration ever.""

"One country, two languages -- and one dream of winning the World Cup. If Belgium is divided by the Flemish speakers who live in the north and the French-speaking Walloons in the south, the nation's footballers are united with one goal. And with its place at the 2014 World Cup finals almost secure, midfielder Mousa Dembele believes Belgium's multicultural array of stars can follow in the footsteps of France's 1998 winning team. Like Les Bleus -- a team which included players of African and Caribbean heritage -- Belgium's class of 2013 has a cosmopolitan feel. Striker Christian Benteke was born in Kinshasa, Congo, while the likes of Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku are both of Congolese heritage. Then there is Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini, who along with Tottenham's Nacer Chadli and 17-year-old starlet Zakaria Bakkali is of Moroccan descent. Dembele himself was born in Belgium after his father moved from Mali -- of which he remains proud. And while the 26-year-old considers himself Belgian, he believes the ethnic mix within the team has made his time in the national setup a more enjoyable experience. ""We get on very well, I think,"" Dembele told CNN ahead of Friday's trip to Croatia, where a draw will be enough to clinch Belgium's 2014 place as winner of Group A with a match to spare. ""It makes us strong. We have all kinds of players and perhaps you can compare us to the France side which won the World Cup in 1998. ""I think it's fair to say we're like them. Perhaps you could say we're also like Germany in a way. ""With Germany, you can see there's a real mix of nationalities in their team. I like that approach because I'm of mixed nationality myself."" It's a nuanced response from Dembele and contrasts sharply with the view of Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who said this week only English people should play for England. While the Belgium players remain united, the team will often arrange separate interviews for Flemish and French speakers. Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen will speak to the press in Flemish, while Zenit St. Petersburg midfielder Axel Witsel, whose father came from the Caribbean island of Martinique,  will give his thoughts in French. One team . But the divisions stop there -- on the pitch these players have come together to give Belgian football its most exciting generation of players since the team reached the 1986 World Cup semifinal. The path to today's array of riches has not been an easy one -- Belgium has failed to qualify for the past five major tournaments and only an extensive overhaul of its playing structure has ensured that the country has not been left behind. ""Some 13 years ago the Belgian Football Federation decided to reorganize Belgian football programs and set up in every province an elite academy,"" leading Belgium youth football coach Michel Bruyninckx, who has long been interested in maximizing the way players use their brain in games as part of his innovative training sessions, told CNN in a recent interview. ""In collaboration with all the universities in our country and after studying the strategies of other countries the Belgian FA composed a plan with the new vision implemented in the different federation academies and then step-by-step integrated in the club programs. ""Just as importantly the Ministry of Education agreed to create a school curriculum to extend the number of weekly training hours. ""That meant we could guarantee young talents would have about 20 hours training time a week and their school programs were never in danger. ""The structure, organization and lifestyle in the academies was regularly checked to make sure that this project delivered professional players or highly qualified young people."" Youth program . The project has been a huge success -- Belgium's top club side Anderlecht competes in the European Champions League with a team boasting an average of just 22.5 years. The club's youth teams have been dominating on both the national and European stage, while the Belgian Under-21 side recently defeated Italy 3-1. ""Anderlecht have won five of the eight national youth championships and many important European tournaments such as the Viareggio, the Aegon Future Cup and the Premier League Cup,"" added Bruyninckx. ""The integration of many very young players in the first team is the proof of the success of what has happened in Belgium. Most of all Youri Tielemans, the 16-year-old player who has surprised the whole of Belgium and is the product of the new strategy."" Star pupils . One of those players to have come through the Anderlecht system announced himself on the world stage last weekend. Adnan Januzaj scored twice on his full Premier League debut for Manchester United in a 2-1 win at Sunderland -- sparking a wild frenzy among a whole host of nations which want to secure his international future. The 18-year-old, who was born in Belgium, could potentially play for his country of birth as well as Albania, Turkey, Serbia or Kosovo, which has yet to be recognized by FIFA. Even England has made overtures in attracting the youngster to wearing the Three Lions. There may be a chance Januzaj will wear the red of Belgium, but that is for the future -- he has refused all international call-ups so far. Now Belgium is hoping that the culmination of the project will take place in Brazil next July with its group of players one of the most talented in Europe. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has starred in Spain's La Liga for Atletico Madrid, while Chelsea's Eden Hazard is regarded as one of the most exciting playmakers in the world. Benteke and Lukaku are two of the most lethal finishers in the English Premier League, while Fellaini commanded a $43 million transfer fee when he joined Manchester United from Everton in August. Then there is the prodigiously talented Bakkali -- who, at 17 years and 196 days old, became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Dutch league, for PSV Eindhoven in August. 'Something special' There is talent everywhere you look -- it is a squad which promises to thrill, excite, inspire and perhaps, just perhaps, win. ""For the past three years we've known that we've had some good players but we didn't always get the results,"" Dembele says. ""I think now you can see we have a lot more confidence there. With the World Cup, it's all looking good for us but it's not done quite yet. ""I think there are some difficult games to play but we're confident. ""We have a very good team, so we don't have to be scared. But we have to be concentrated, and I believe if we get to Brazil we can do something special, but we have to get there first.""","Belgium is considered one of the dark horses to win the World Cup in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Fighting between Yemen's government and rebel forces erupted Friday as the two sides were working on a peace agreement, a local journalist said. Fighting in and around the northwestern city of Saada caused the deaths of 13 government soldiers, 19 Houthi rebels and 22 civilians, Houthi rebel sources told Hakim Al-Masmari, the editor-in-chief of the Yemen Post. Yemen government officials did not confirm the death toll. Even amid the fighting, the Houthis have presented the Yemeni government with a detailed peace agreement, Yemen's foreign minister told Al-Masmari on Saturday. The government is considering the proposal, he said. The Houthis, Shiite Muslim rebels, had indicated last week that they were open to a cease-fire and to accepting the government's conditions. But the rebels demanded an end to government military operations first. The negotiations could put an end to the conflict, which had lasted more than five years. In August, Yemen laid out cease-fire terms that included removing checkpoints, ending banditry, handing over all military equipment and weapons and releasing civilians and military personnel. Yemen also demanded the rebels stop entering its northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia. The next month, government officials said Houthi leaders twice rejected the terms. The conflict is believed to be both separatist, over who will have power in the area, and sectarian, whether Shiite Islam will dominate even though the majority of Yemenis are Sunni. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. Humanitarian organization Human Rights Watch has noted allegations of war violations committed by both sides, and fighting has forced 250,000 people to flee their homes, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said.","13 soldiers, 19 Houthi rebels, 22 civilians killed, Houthi rebel sources tell newspaper .

"Nobody is being charged in a drunken brawl that involved a white limousine full of members of Sarah Palin's family, police in Alaska said Thursday. But it sure sounds like things got out of hand, with the host of the September house party where it all happened saying the Palins got into a fight they ""ended up losing."" The Anchorage Police Department released a report that includes more than two pages of details about the brawl, which happened after the former GOP vice presidential nominee's family and friends showed up at another friend's party. It details accusations that Bristol Palin punched the host in the face repeatedly, that Track Palin tried to start a fight with his father and more. Here are some of the details -- wildly different, depending on who's offering the information -- that Officer John Daily submitted in his official report: . 1. When he arrived, a shirtless, ""heavily intoxicated"" and ""belligerent at first"" Track Palin, Sarah Palin's adult son, was about to step into a white limousine with his parents, Sarah and Todd. They'd all been at the party at Korey Klingenmeyer's house. 2. Track told the officer some guys were ""talking rudely"" to his sisters and making them cry. So he stuck up for them. When one of his friends, identified only as Steven, got punched by one of the allegedly rude guys, the fight started. Todd said that's when ""everything escalated and it was a situation they couldn't walk away from."" 3. Bristol Palin ended up on the ground during the fight. The Palin family said that's because Klingenmeyer knocked her down. 4. Klingenmeyer offered a different version of the story. He told the officer he wanted to press charges against Bristol, who he said had told him ""he doesn't own this place and that she will kick his a--."" after he tried to stop her from fighting. Then, Klingenmeyer said, Bristol hit him. He said she could ""hit him again if it makes her feel better and she does."" After six or so ""pretty hard"" punches, he said he grabbed her fist and Bristol fell down. ""At that time,"" the officer reported, ""he said several guys from the party stepped in to help him and a fight broke out and the Palins ended up losing."" 5. Bristol ""appeared heavily intoxicated and upset,"" and explained that Klingenmeyer ""had drug her across the lawn by her legs and was calling her a [expletive deleted] and a slut."" She explained that another girl at the party had hit one of her sisters, Willow Palin, and said that's how things got started. 6. Track left the fight with a bloody mouth and injuries under his left eye and on his left elbow. Bristol had some dirt on her knees. Klingenmeyer ""stated his face felt swollen,"" but there weren't any ""obvious injuries."" The Palin family wouldn't comment Thursday on the report and the decision not to charge any of the brawl's participants. But Sarah Palin did defend her daughter Bristol in a Sept. 19 Facebook post. ""I love my Bristol!"" she wrote. ""My straight-shooter is one of the strongest young women you'll ever meet. I have to say this as a proud mama: right up there with their work ethic and heart for those less fortunate, my kids' defense of family makes my heart soar! ""As you can imagine, they and my extended family have experienced so many things (liberal media-driven) that may have crushed others without a strong foundation of faith, and I'm thankful for our friends' prayer shield that surrounds them, allowing faith to remain their anchor.""

"(CNN) -- Huddled in the hallway of his Alabama home with three of his friends, Tillman Merritt had a gut feeling to jump into a closet as the massive twister barreled into the Tuscaloosa neighborhood. Moments later, he was the only one to survive. ""I just heard a voice in my head saying 'go to the closet, go to the closet,"" Merritt said. The closet walls pushed down on him as a roar surrounded him, followed by the sounds of pieces of the house snapping off. Then the crack of glass was heard, and insulation was flying everywhere. When it was over, there was just a small hole for Merritt to crawl out of. Except for the closet he was in, the entire house -- and his three friends -- had been flung across the street. He found the other three in the wreckage of the house, in a pile. His roommate and life-long friend was dead, the two others would succumb to their wounds. As emergency responders continued to tally the dead on Saturday, stories began to emerge that illustrated the scope of what has become the second-deadliest, single-day tornado outbreak in U.S. history. Among the victims for whom memorial services are planned starting Sunday are four students of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. The area has been the focal point for the Wednesday disaster that swept through six southern states and has killed 337 people. Among those deaths is Morgan Sigler, a senior graphic design major from Bryant, Alabama, who was killed when the storm struck Merritt's house. She suffered internal injuries and died during surgery, her mother said. The Siglers' story is one of dozens of similar tales of tragedy in the South. ""She just lit up our world, she was our baby,"" Vega Sigler said. Morgan Sigler was the kind of person who reached to those in need, and enjoyed the mission trips she undertook with her church. ""We know where she's at, but it doesn't make it any easier,"" her mother said. The student was a creative type, and would build projects that she would give out as gifts to family members, Vega Sigler said. A professor even called to tell her parents how much potential Morgan Sigler had as a graphic designer. Not far from where Morgan Sigler lived, Cody Kirk watched from his apartment complex as debris flew in the air nearby. It sounded like an engine from a 747 airliner for about three minutes, he said. ""I go around the corner, and there's nothing. There's absolutely nothing,"" he said. Kirk was close friends with Morgan Sigler and knew the two other victims, Scott Atterton and Blake Peak. Atterton was known for having a kind heart, and was not the kind of person satisfied with a handshake. He would tell Kirk, ""bring it in for the real thing,"" and give him a hug. Peak was Morgan Sigler's boyfriend. He made her really happy, Kirk said. According to the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, at least 45 people people died during the storms in Tuscaloosa County, more than in any of the other five southern states that recorded deaths from Wednesday's violent weather. By early Saturday morning, emergency management officials tallied 249 deaths in Alabama, 34 in Tennessee, 33 in Mississippi, 15 in Georgia, five in Virginia and one in Arkansas. Hundreds are unaccounted for in Tuscaloosa alone, though not all have been officially reported missing. ""We're hopeful and prayerful that a large majority of that is just duplicates within our dispatch system,"" Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said. ""However, we are putting cadaver dog teams through the city in a frantic search to find everyone that is accounted for."" The University of Alabama student newspaper, The Crimson White, began tallying e-mails from students who were searching for missing friends. Within hours, the newspaper had received 68 e-mails from worried students. Graduate student Arefeen Shamsuzzoha toured much of the city Friday, taking photographs of the damage. ""The trees are completely stripped of all of their branches,"" Shamsuzzoha told CNN Saturday morning. ""The ones that are standing just look like sticks rising from the ground."" When President Barack Obama visited the city Friday, his motorcade passed street after street of homes reduced to splinters, crushed and flipped cars, and debris strewn all around. ""I've got to say I've never seen devastation like this,"" Obama told reporters. The storms also wreaked between $2 billion and $5 billion in insured losses across the region, according to the catastrophe modeling firm, Eqecat. Records go back to 1680, and since then there has been only one other date in U.S. history on which more people died during a severe weather outbreak. On March 18, 1925, a severe storm system swept across seven states killing 747 people, according to the National Weather Service. Weather officials say the reason why so many perished was due to the size and path of the tornadoes. Meteorologists rely on what is called an ""Enhanced Fujita Scale"" to rate the severity of tornadoes. The lowest ranking, EF-0, applies to twisters with recorded 3-second wind gusts of between 65 mph and 85 mph, according to the National Weather Service. The highest, an EF-5, is assigned to tornadoes with speeds of over 200 mph . The weather service has so far recorded 11 tornadoes with EF-3 ratings or higher that struck central and north Alabama on Wednesday. Some of the twisters were three-quarters of a mile wide and traveled dozens of miles, experts said. ""That's an astounding amount for a single day tornado event."" said Krissy Scotten, a weather service meteorologist in Birmingham. ""It's one of those instances where you had very large tornadoes on very long tracks hitting heavily populated areas."" ""When you put that together, you're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation,"" Scotten said. An EF-4 touched down in Hackleburg, killing 29 people in the town of nearly 1,600 residents. The storms destroyed almost every business in the city.  A doctor's office. The pharmacy. A ball field. ""It's pretty much wiped out,"" said Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams. ""It looks like a war zone."" From there, the tornado traveled more than 39 miles across three counties, said Chelly Amin, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Huntsville. The same tornado, Amin said, virtually destroyed the tiny town of Phil Campbell, which has a population of little more than 1,000. Those who survived the disaster thanked God or simple luck. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Phil Gast and Sarah Hoye contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll from South's latest tornado outbreak tweaked to 337 .

"(CNN) -- Prison-issued toilet paper is what musician William Michael Dillon used to write down most of his songs, including ""Black Robes and Lawyers,"" which has just been released on iTunes. ""I was arrested for murder on August 26, 1981, for a crime I didn't commit,"" Dillon tells his audience as he starts strumming his guitar. ""I was released on November 18, 2008. Thank you to the keepers of justice."" According to Dillon, justice prevailed when he was released from prison after 27 years. He is now on the Innocence Project of Florida's list of 13 prisoners exonerated by DNA evidence. It was Dillon's life story and not his music that moved Grammy Award winning music producer Jim Tullio to invite Dillon to his Chicago studio to record the songs he wrote in prison. ""I was just blown away by this story,"" says Tullio, who learned about Dillon's wrongful incarceration and his dream to record an album. ""I just thought it was an injustice and I thought this guy deserves a break,"" recalls Tullio, adding that he did something he never does and reached out to Dillon. ""I said whatever you bring me I am sure I can help you make it better,"" Tullio remembers telling Dillon during their first conversation. Not caring if he had any real talent, Tullio arranged for Dillon to spend a couple of weeks in the studio. Tullio expected to make a CD for Dillon to play while he was riding around in his truck. ""I did this because I was compelled,"" says Tullio, ""but when he came and I heard him sing I was just knocked out."" Tullio says he quickly realized that Dillon's life story might attract an audience, but his voice would turn them into fans. During those recording sessions, the talk often turned to Dillon's fight, not only for his freedom but also his continuing battle for compensation. It was August 17, 1981, when James Dvorak was found murdered on a Florida beach. The beach was in an area Dillon frequented. The police questioned Dillon about the murder and eventually investigators charged him for Dvorak's death. The 27 years Dillon spent behind bars tested his will to survive. ""I contemplated suicide many, many times."" He says that 12 years into his life sentence, he decided to let go of the anger. It was difficult for a man who eventually learned he would be paroled in 2043, when he would be in his 80s. While in prison at Avon Park Correctional facility, Dillon helped develop a music program. He learned to play the guitar and sang with fellow inmates in a band. Music was a main focus of Dillon's when in 2006 a law clerk asked him if he had ever had his DNA tested. That test would be the key to his freedom. ""In Bill Dillon's case, there was much evidence that pointed away from him having committed this crime,"" says Seth Miller of the Innocence Project of Florida, the group that helped secure Dillon's release. At the time of his release, Dillon's time behind bars was longer than any other person exonerated in the United States, according to the Innocence Project. Dillon assumed that when he gained his freedom he would be compensated for the time he spent in prison. ""If you are releasing me from prison on DNA, for a crime I didn't commit, you should be handing me the money so I could get on with my life,"" says Dillon. That didn't happen and Dillon has been relying on the kindness of others. Florida has a compensation law that pays $50,000 per year to those who are classified as wrongfully incarcerated. Dillon, like almost all the Innocence Project of Florida's 13 DNA cases, doesn't qualify for the money. In order to receive compensation in Florida, an exonerated person must have ""clean hands."" This means the person cannot have a felony on record from before they were wrongfully imprisoned. ""When I was 19 years old I got caught with a Quaalude and a joint in my pocket with nine college kids coming from a bottle club at 4 o'clock in the morning,"" says Dillon. Dillon believes that arrest cost him more than $1.3 million from the state. Dillon's efforts to get a claims bill passed through the Florida Legislature have been unsuccessful. Earlier this year, Bram D.E. Canter, Florida Senate Special Master, released his final report to the Senate president. Canter noted that State Attorney Norman Wolfinger wrote a letter stating he did not think DNA testing exonerated Dillon. Canter's final report also makes a reference to Brevard County Sheriff Deputy Thom Fair. Fair worked on the Dillon case. Now retired, the report notes that Fair continues to believe Dillon murdered Dvorak. In his conclusion, Canter notes that his burden of proof is a ""preponderance of the evidence"" and recommends that Dillon be compensated for his years in prison. The report says, ""There is no physical evidence linking Dillon to the victim or the crime scene and Dillon would probably not have been found guilty with the credible evidence available to the prosecutors."" As his attorneys continue to try to get his compensation bill passed by both the Florida House and Senate, Dillon continues to make music. He dreams of having the ability to make money with his music. But Dillon says he is realistic about the odds of being able to support himself in the entertainment industry. ""I am hoping,"" says Dillon. ""I would love it but I just don't know."" What Dillon does know is that his first album is slated for release this summer and he is already thinking about what he is going to write about in his next musical endeavor. ""I want to put the soul and feeling I have into songs of everyday life,"" says Dillon. ""I see the world with baby eyes. I don't see the world like you see the world because I just started living in it.""","William Michael Dillon is free of a murder conviction after DNA evidence .

"The population of the least populous town in the United States appeared to at least double Thursday when two mysterious businessmen from Vietnam won the tiny hamlet with a bid of $900,000 at auction. About a dozen bidders gathered around the town's one business to bid on Buford, Wyoming, which consists of a gas station, a three-bedroom house and a few small outbuildings on 10 acres along Interstate 80. The bidding began at $100,000 and quickly escalated. The winning bidders were immediately whisked away by auction officials, who would not let them speak to the media. The town's only resident, Don Sammons, watched from the sidelines. He moved to Buford in 1980 with his wife and son. His wife died in 1995, and his son moved away in 2007. He had bought the town in 1990. He fought back tears as the auctioneer declared the town sold. ""I don't know when it will hit me. I've lived here half my life. I'm an emotional person, and I hope I handle it in an adult manner,"" he said. Tonjah Andrews, a real estate broker from Cheyenne who was hired to represent the men, said she would not disclose their names. She said the men flew in from Vietnam after learning about the auction from online news stories. She would not comment on what the men plan to do with the town. Sammons bought a house in Windsor, Colorado, to be closer to his son and plans on writing a book about his 32 years in Buford. He said he'll miss his one-man town, but one thing he won't miss is the billboard with his face on it that has become a familiar sight to drivers in Interstate 80. Buford is about halfway between Laramie and Cheyenne and is the second oldest town in the state. ""I can always rent one somewhere if I need to see my face,"" he said with a laugh.","Two businessmen from Vietnam buy the nation's least populous town .

"For everyone who has condemned the numerous protests, rallies and vigils demanding justice for Trayvon Benjamin Martin, the 17-year-old gunned down in Sanford, Florida, a month ago, please listen to these two words: Shut up! Of course that may seem harsh, but that is exactly how I feel. I don't want to hear the nonsense to let the system run its course. Others say, ""Let's not do anything until all of the facts are in."" Let's cut to the chase: There would be no special prosecutor had thousands across the national not mobilized, organized and took to the streets to demand justice for Trayvon. Would a grand jury be convened on April 10? Not a chance. Would the 911 tapes be released showing admitted trigger man George Zimmerman calling Trayvon suspicious, and owning up to following him? No. Would the Florida Legislature be reviewing -- and discussing changing or abandoning -- the controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which is at the heart of this case? No. Would the Department of Justice have launched an investigation into the case, as well as the Sanford Police Department? Nope. Would Sanford's police chief, Bill Lee, have stepped down if the inept investigation hadn't been exposed? No. Instead of critics condemning the protests, they should be saying, ""Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"" Whether folks want to admit it or not, this has always been the story of African-Americans. Go through history and you will find many examples of cases not being investigated or, if they were brought to trial, prosecuted or judged atrociously: Scottsboro Boys. Clarence Brandley. Lenell Geter. Medgar Evers. The Sixteeenth Street Baptist Church bombing. Justice is supposed to be blind, but for African-Americans, it has commonly been deaf, dumb and blind. As a result, we've had to live by the admonition of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said, ""Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!"" It was also Douglass who stated, ""Power concedes nothing without a demand."" The main demand in the Trayvon Martin case from Day One was for Zimmerman to be arrested and for justice to be served. This wasn't about a ridiculous bounty on the head of Zimmerman by the New Black Panther Party. It wasn't about the selling of T-shirts. It wasn't about who showed up and led a march or why. It was about holding a legal system accountable that clearly gave more credence to a 28-year-old gunman than the 17-year-old, unarmed man who was gunned down. For all of our talk about law and order in this country, there is a lot that is wrong with our legal system. We all should feel ashamed when someone is freed from death row or life in prison after DNA testing revealed him or her not to be the real killer or rapist. It should pain our heart when the prosecution withholds evidence in a case that could exonerate someone. And all of us, regardless of race or economic status, should scream to high heaven when the police don't do their job equally for all citizens. We are a nation of laws, and sometimes they work for some and not others. When we've prayed, cried and pleaded, oftentimes the only thing we have left to do is march. That is a right that is afforded every one of us in the U.S. Constitution, be it the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street or those demanding justice for Trayvon. No one should be condemned for taking to the streets and letting their voices be heard. They shouldn't be called race-baiters, rabble-rousers or radicals. We all should call them exactly what they are: true Americans.","Without protests, the Trayvon Martin case would be going nowhere, Roland Martin says .
History is rife with examples of injustice against African-Americans, Martin says .
Instead of condemning those clamoring for justice, we should thank them, he says ."
"Two days ago we heard that Dr. Sheik Umar Khan, a leading doctor from Sierra Leone specializing in viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), had died aged 39. He contracted the Ebola virus while treating more than 100 patients and was called a ""national hero"" by the government. Khan's sickness added to fear and vulnerability felt by many doctors and nurses treating Ebola patients. They reasoned ""if even Dr. Khan can get sick, then any of us can."" Sierra Leone's health facilities were struggling to cope even before this outbreak. The country has a major shortage of doctors, nurses and infrastructure, meaning we're all working in challenging circumstances. Tracing people who have had contact with Ebola sufferers is very difficult, and made more challenging by poor roads and overcrowded housing. Amongst the wider Sierra Leone population we've seen a lot of mistrust -- many people believe that Ebola is a government myth created to steal their organs or money. Others believe that if they go to hospital they will be killed. So many hide at home and are cared for by relatives -- who then get sick themselves.  Some patients have escaped from hospitals with relatives' help. During this crisis, the King's team have all faced difficult questions. The most fundamental being whether our organization should be involved in the Ebola response at all. Our work at Connaught Hospital in Freetown was not hands-on clinical care but consulting on how to strengthen the health system over the long term. Although our small team is highly qualified, we didn't really have the funding or equipment to deal with such an outbreak. But after team discussions and with senior colleagues back at King's in London we decided that as an organization we had a duty to respond and that we had the capacity to do so safely and effectively. All our staff are volunteers and this isn't what they originally signed up for -- so we gave them the option to withdraw from clinical activities if they wanted to. We were, however, fortunate to have Dr. Colin Brown on hand -- our infectious diseases adviser in the UK, who has experience with viral hemorrhagic fever. Rumors and misinformation . Within hours of the first National Ebola Taskforce meeting in Sierra Leone, the King's team was invited to join the response, advising Connaught Hospital on how to develop a preparedness plan, identify cases, set up isolation units, protect staff and dispose of medical waste. These guidelines were held up as a model for other hospitals, and we continue to act as advisers to the Health Ministry, along with groups such as Medicines Sans Frontieres, Emergency Hospital and the World Health Organization. As the King's team ran urgent training for nursing and medical staff at Connaught, suspected cases began to emerge. Rumors and misinformation were rife with a nurse having been one of the first victims. The fear amongst hospital staff was palpable. We found ourselves amongst the first responders, alongside heroic Connaught colleagues such as Sister Cecilia (Sister-in-Charge of A&E) and Dr. Modupe Cole (Consultant Physician) who did not hesitate to step forward and manage the response. Staff worked into the night to set up an expanded isolation unit and now work to provide treatment and take blood specimens. It is sweaty and exhausting work, scrubbing floors with bleach in full gowns, masks and protective clothing in the intense rainy season heat. We immediately isolate anyone who shows symptoms. They sometimes have to wait three to four days for the lab results. About a quarter of the patients who have been isolated have died at Connaught, meaning most recover or are referred for treatment elsewhere. Most health workers are still coming to work, but almost everyone is afraid. We're all aware of how much is at stake. We ask ourselves -- are we acting beyond our competency and putting ourselves at risk? Ebola is the main conversation, in government, the media and on the street. People are now starting to truly understand the scale of risk. Businesses have buckets of chlorine at the doorstep, people wear gloves and have stopped shaking hands. The population is not yet panicking though. The people of Sierra Leone have been through many challenges over the years, from war to cholera, and they remain resolute. There's no doubt that it's going to be an intense and exhausting next few months for medical staff as the outbreak continues. But, after some initial nerves, they are working together, gaining experience and confidence to help Sierra Leone to fight its latest, life-threatening challenge.","Two days ago one of Sierra Leone's leading doctors died after contracting Ebola .

"A cult operating in Mexico, along the U.S. border, is accused of kidnapping and forcing victims to work and have sex, the country's National Migration Institute said Wednesday. Fourteen foreigners -- accused by victims' relatives of demanding ""tithes"" from local followers -- were detained, and at least some are in the process of being deported, said the federal attorney general's office, or PGR. Three Mexican citizens are being held on suspicion of human trafficking, the PGR said. Immigration authorities and police raided the Defenders of Christ group in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, the migration institute said Tuesday night. Nuevo Laredo is across the border from its sister city, Laredo, Texas. Six of the detained foreigners were Spanish, two Brazilian, two Bolivian, two Venezuelan, one Argentinean and one Ecuadorean. The Defenders of Christ are not officially registered as a religious organization under Mexican law. Authorities released the name of only one of those involved with the group, Jose Arenas Losanger Segovia, a Venezuelan identified as the leader of the organization, which ""was characterized by its recruiting of people at the national level."" CNN Freedom Project: Ending modern-day slavery . A website for the cult identifies Losanger as an ""apostle"" of the reincarnation of Christ. The group believes that a man named Ignacio Gonzalez de Arriba is the reincarnation of Jesus. CNN has reached out to the prosecutor's office and the lawyers of those involved but has been unsuccessful in getting replies. Myrna Garcia, coordinator for the Support Network for Victims of Cults, says her group first received complaints about Gonzalez in December 2011. In February 2012, the group filed a complaint with authorities about the Defenders of Christ. Garcia called Gonzalez ""very dangerous because he manipulates the minds of people to satisfy his whims."" The accusations that the cult victims network gathered paint a picture of a man who forced people into labor without pay or threatened to deny food. ""He was able to convince them that they had to behave in certain ways to satisfy his economic and sexual needs,"" Garcia said. Women were made to have sex with the men in the group, and polygamy was promoted in the cult, Garcia said. Women were beaten and forced to prostitute themselves, she said. Many of the victims became suicidal and lost contact with their families and children, she said.

"The number of children with autism in the United States continues to rise, according to a new report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The latest data estimate that 1 in 88 American children has some form of autism spectrum disorder. That's a 78% increase compared to a decade ago, according to the report. Since 2000, the CDC has based its autism estimates on surveillance reports from its Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network. Every two years, researchers count how many 8-year-olds have autism in about a dozen communities across the nation. (The number of sites ranges from six to 14 over the years, depending on the available funding in a given year.) In 2000 and 2002, the autism estimate was about 1 in 150 children. Two years later 1 in 125 8-year-olds had autism. In 2006, the number was 1 in 110, and the newest data -- from 2008 -- suggests 1 in 88 children have autism. Read the CDC report (PDF) Boys with autism continue to outnumber girls 5-to-1, according to the CDC report.  It estimates that 1 in 54 boys in the United States have autism. Mark Roithmayr, president of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, says more children are being diagnosed with autism because of ""better diagnosis, broader diagnosis, better awareness, and roughly 50% of 'We don't know.'"" He said the numbers show there is an epidemic of autism in the United States. Early recognition of signs of autism -- a neurodevelopment disorder that leads to impaired language, communication and social skills -- is vital because it can lead to early intervention, says Dr. Gary Goldstein, an autism specialist and president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. ""There have been studies -- double-blinded studies -- to show that behavioral early intervention changes the outcome for children,"" Goldstein says. Roy Sanders and Charlie Bailey sensed something was wrong with their son Frankie Sanders when he was 9 months old. ""Our pediatrician at the time who was a friend of ours tried to tell us that we were being too cautious, we were being too anxious,"" Sanders says. Frankie's pediatrician thought his parents were seeing developmental delays that weren't really there. But Frankie wasn't talking, Sanders says. ""He didn't have speech; he didn't have any communication skills at all. He didn't point. He would flap quite a bit. He would stare at fans; he would stare at lights; he would become frantic if he didn't have a Thomas the [Tank] Engine because he was obsessed with Thomas the [Tank] Engine."" His parents kept pushing, and Frankie, now a ninth-grade nose guard and defensive guard for the Decatur Bulldogs football team in Decatur, Georgia, was diagnosed with autism when he was 15 months old. iReport: Have a child with autism? Sign up to participate in a project with CNN. ""Early detection is associated with better outcomes,"" says CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden. ""The earlier kids are detected, the earlier they could get services, and the less impairment they'll have on their learning and in their lives on a long-term basis is our best understanding."" The CDC is working with the Academy of American Pediatrics to recommend that children get screened for autism at ages 18 months and 24 months, Frieden says. CDC: What you should know about autism . However, according to the CDC report, most children were diagnosed between ages 4 and 5, when a child's brain is already more developed and harder to change. ""Doctors are getting better at diagnosing autism; communities are getting much better at [providing] services to children with autism, and CDC scientists are getting much better at tracking which kids in the communities we're studying have autism,"" Frieden says. ""How much of that increase is a result of better tracking and how much of it is a result of an actual increase, we still don't know. We know more about autism today than we have ever known,"" he says, ""but there is still so much we don't know and wish that we knew.""","One in 88 U.S. kids thought to be autistic, CDC says; for boys it's 1 in 54 .

"Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday announced new regulations for the more than 200 halfway houses operated by federal contractors, requiring them to provide transportation and allow inmates to use cell phones to reconnect with family and friends, and to start looking for jobs. The new regulations also require the half way houses to provide mental and substance abuse treatment to inmates, and are part of Holder's ""Smart on Crime"" initiative, under which prosecutors are seeking ways to reduce sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders. The Justice Department said Holder's moves can be at least partly credited for the biggest drop in the federal prison population, a reduction of 4,000 inmates compared to the end of last fiscal year in September. Federal prisons incarcerate 216,000 people in the United States, which accounts for only 5% of the world's population but holds 25% of its prisoners. While states have made moves to cut prison populations, partly due to budget reasons, changes in the federal prison population has lagged for some time. The new Justice Department regulations affect contractors that run halfway houses for the United States Bureau of Prisons, which uses such facilities to hold inmates near the end of their sentences as they prepare to transition to life outside prison. Holder said the changes ""will enhance the programs that help prisoners overcome their past struggles, get on the right path, and stay out of our criminal justice system.""","Justice Department steps impact more than 200 facilities run by contractors .

"George Zimmerman's estranged wife said Thursday that while she respects the jury's not guilty verdict in his second-degree murder trial, she now has doubts about his innocence. ""I believe the evidence, but this revelation in my life has really helped me to take the blinders off and start to see things differently,"" Shellie Zimmerman told NBC's Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show. Zimmerman was referring to the couple's struggles since the verdict, including an ugly spat earlier this month that resulted in police being called -- and headlines being made. ""I think anyone would doubt that innocence because I don't know the person that I have been married to,"" she said. George Zimmerman was acquitted on July 13 in the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman told police he shot the teen in self-defense. Despite her doubts about her husband's innocence, Shellie Zimmerman said she believes he did not profile the teen, who is black. ""So had Trayvon Martin been white, you think the night would have ended in the same tragic fashion?"" Matt Lauer asked. ""Yes, I do,"" she said. Shellie Zimmerman called 911 just days after filing for divorce, claiming her estranged husband punched her father in the nose, took her iPad out of her hands, smashed it and cut it with a pocket knife. She also said the former neighborhood watch volunteer threatened her and her father with a weapon. She stands by that story, despite police saying they never saw or confiscated a gun at the scene. ""I did not see a gun, but I saw -- I know my husband. I saw him in a stance and a look in his eyes that I have never seen before,"" she said. ""His shirt was halfway unbuttoned and he was putting his hand in his shirt and saying, 'Please step closer, please step closer,' so I think that logically I assumed he had a gun on him."" Shellie Zimmerman has not pressed charges but police are still investigating the case. They say it could take months to recover video evidence from the damaged iPad. While she stood by her man through his trial and the months of living ""like gypsies"" in the woods leading up to it, she said everything changed after the verdict. ""He just kind of treated me like I was disposable ... after standing by him,"" Shellie Zimmerman said. ""He kind of left and I guess kind of went on a victory tour without me, and I thought that I was living a life with him and that we were going to kind of rebuild after all of this, (but) he had other plans for me.""","Recent events have ""really helped me to take the blinders off,"" Shellie Zimmerman says .

"Two suspected U.S. drone strikes killed seven al Qaeda militants and eight civilians in the southern part of Yemen on Tuesday, three Yemeni security officials said. It was the latest of several U.S. strikes in Yemen, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, described by U.S. officials as the al Qaeda affiliate that poses the most serious threat to the United States. At least seven civilians were injured in the Tuesday strikes, the officials said. Across Yemen, at least 49 people were killed, including 31 militants, according to a security official. The dead also included eight civilians, five troops and five pro-government local resistance fighters, according to the official. The United States has increased the pace of airstrikes in Yemen in the last few years. At least 24 of 31 such strikes conducted since 2002 have happened in the last two years, according to the Long War Journal, which analyzes how the U.S. conducts its fight against terrorism. According to the security officials, one of Tuesday's strikes targeted a militant hideout in Jaar district, a militant stronghold. Another strike targeted a home believed to be harboring militants in the same district. Three senior al Qaeda leaders were among those killed, the officials said. Jaar district residents said civilians were killed after they rushed to the site of the first strike. ""Our lives are valueless in the eyes of our government, and that is why civilians are being killed without a crime,"" resident Ali Abu Abdullah said. One of the security officials expressed regret for the civilian casualties and injuries. ""The targets of the raids were not the civilians, and we give our condolences to the families of those who lost a loved one,"" the official said. U.S. and Saudi authorities recently foiled an al Qaeda plot based in Yemen to bomb a U.S.-bound airplane. Elsewhere in Yemen, in Lowder district, at least 17 al Qaeda fighters were killed when tribesmen loyal to the government clashed with militants and took over three strategic locations in the district.  Three security officers were killed in Lowder. At least 400 tribal fighters backed by hundreds of troops participated in the Lowder raids. Mohammed Aidaroos, a local leader, said the fighting erupted early Tuesday morning in Lowder, and government-supported fighters forced al Qaeda fighters to evacuate the area and leave behind huge caches of weapons. The tribal fighters took back control of Yasoof Mountain, which al Qaeda had controlled for more than a month. There was also a state of alert in the Yemeni capital. The Interior Ministry warned on Tuesday that al Qaeda is planning to conduct suicide operations in Sanaa. Tight security presence was noticeable near Western embassies and in the diplomatic zone of the capital. ""The ministry has been given intelligence information warning of a possible attack in the heart of the Yemeni capital and we are on high alert,"" one Interior Ministry official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Yemeni Information Minister Ali al-Amrani told CNN he was targeted Monday when a grenade was thrown near his home in Sanaa. The grenade landed about 100 meters from his home, al-Amrani said, and he was not injured. In January, Al-Amrani escaped an assassination attempt unharmed when at least 10 shots were fired in the direction of a vehicle he was entering. Witnesses said there were at least two gunmen. Al-Amrani's spokesman said following that attack in January that al-Amrani was being targeted in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups.","Yemeni capital on high alert over warnings of possible attack, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Red Cross President and CEO Mark W. Everson has stepped down after revelations he was ""engaged in a personal relationship with a subordinate employee,"" the organization announced Tuesday. Mark W. Everson says he is leaving his post, effective immediately, for ""personal and family reasons."" The Red Cross Board of Governors asked for and received Everson's  resignation after it ""concluded that the situation reflected poor judgment on Mr. Everson's part and diminished his ability to lead the organization in the future,""  the Red Cross said in a statement on its Web site. Everson, 53, said in a written statement that he was leaving the $500,000-per-year job ""for personal and family reasons, and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken."" Everson -- who is married and has two children -- joined the Red Cross as president and CEO last May. The organization became aware of Everson's relationship with a female Red Cross employee 10 days ago, Chief Public Affairs Officer Suzy C. DeFrancis told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I think the board acted very quickly,"" she said, adding that the woman remains in her job. About Everson, DeFrancis said, ""We're grateful for his service."" The board of governors on Tuesday appointed Mary S. Elcano, general counsel and five-year Red Cross employee, as interim president and CEO. Everson had worked in the Bush administration from August 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service -- until he was hired by the Red Cross. ""This is flabbergasting, that's all I can say. It's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the IRS,"" said Suzanne Ross McDowell, a Washington-based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the IRS division that deals with tax-exempt organizations. ""From the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non-profit sector, it's just another news story that we would rather not see,"" she said. ""It's got nothing to do with the Red Cross,"" said Ira Milstein, a New York lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with Everson. ""He was a team player and a good leader. To have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad."" A search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding Everson's permanent replacement, the organization said. The job has been a challenging one. Marsha J. Evans resigned as president in 2005, after the Red Cross response to Hurricane Katrina came under fire. Four years earlier, Bernadine Healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out. Healy told reporters she ""had no choice"" about her resignation. Meanwhile, DeFrancis acknowledged Tuesday that, 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood, it has yet to meet federal safety and quality-control requirements.

"Four days before the opening of the Winter Games, some of the hotels being built for the Olympics are reporting construction delays that could affect the tens of thousands of visitors expected to descend on the region. The Sochi 2014 organizing committee announced that at least one of the hotels built to accommodate visiting journalists would not be ready. ""Dear Media,"" the committee wrote, ""this is to inform you that the official opening of the hotel Gorki Grand has been postponed due to technical reasons."" In a subsequent phone conversation, Anna Efimchenko, a Sochi 2014 spokeswoman, explained to CNN that the Gorki Grand Hotel was ""having some troubles with the water."" The committee said it would temporarily accommodate guests in another hotel. In the seven years since Russia won its bid to host the 2014 Olympics, authorities have built a highway, a high-speed train line, electric power stations and an entire series of resort villages in the Caucasus Mountains, where the alpine sport events will take place.  The massive project is estimated to have cost more than $50 billion. But on Monday, construction crews were still hard at work in Gorki Gorod, a cluster of six- and seven-story buildings on the banks of the Mzymta River, a short distance from the Olympic ski jump. Road crews were hammering in paving stones on a sidewalk, while yellow cranes stretched up to buildings where the interior was clearly still under construction. The delays appear to have affected at least one international hotelier. In an interview with the Reuters news agency, the manager of Swissotel Sochi said his hotel would accept its first customers on the eve of the opening of the Olympics, rather than in January as had originally been planned. ""It was slightly delayed, we actually planned to open already last month,"" Swissotel's Oliver Kuhn told Reuters.  ""Certainly I have worked in areas where the construction speed was a bit faster than here, but at the end of the day we have reached our target to be ready for the Games."" The International Olympic Committee is downplaying concerns. ""There are still some issues to be solved as it is always just before the Games, but also in this respect we are in contact with the organizing committee and we hope the situation will be solved in the next couple of days,"" IOC president Thomas Bach told journalists. Athletes have been arriving to this Black Sea resort in recent days.  The Winter Olympics are set to open Friday. As for the Gorki Grand Hotel, it continues to advertise on its website ""the elegance of hotel's 194 rooms and suites,"" and it still offers online reservations for February, next to the announcement ""Opening Soon.""

"(CNN) -- I love you Rihanna. You succinctly gave voice to the anger that's been building ever since Washington Post columnist George Will wrote skeptically about young women caught up in a ""supposed campus epidemic of rape, a.k.a. 'sexual assault.'"" You remember that? Will said, in his special Will way, that when colleges and universities ""make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate. "" You, Rihanna, gave voice to the anger that's been simmering since Rush Limbaugh said, ""no means yes if you know how to spot it,"" and Fox & Friends joked about ""taking the stairs"" 'cause there are cameras in the elevator to record you punching your lady. You, Rihanna, succinctly said, in two words, how many women feel for getting blamed for everything from raising ""problem children"" to ""feminizing"" men. F*** you! Rihanna slams CBS for pulling song . Mr. Goodell, if you're wondering why you're getting so much grief for that that two-game suspension you handed to Ray Rice for decking his fiancÃ©e, I'll spell it out. You provided the tipping point for the anger women feel for getting blamed for just about everything bad that happens to them. Voices of domestic violence . It's why Rihanna is so upset that CBS pulled her song ""Run This Town"" from Thursday Night Football because, well, in Rihanna's words: ""Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this ... CBS you pulled my song last week, now you wanna slide it back in this Thursday? NO, F*** you! Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this."" Oh, and don't say you didn't penalize Rihanna for what Ray Rice did to Janay Palmer. CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus told the Associated Press that Rihanna's history of domestic abuse at the hands of Chris Brown was ""among several factors considered (for pulling her song) but was not the overriding one."" To make matters worse, it wasn't even Rihanna's song! It was Jay Z's song. Rihanna was merely performing alongside the man who discovered her. As Rihanna tweeted, ""The audacity..."" and forbade CBS to use any of her songs in its Thursday Night Football lineup ever again. CBS promptly announced: ""Beginning this Thursday, we will be moving in a different direction with some elements of our Thursday Night Football open. We will be using our newly created Thursday Night Football theme music to open our game broadcast."" Wise move CBS. It would have been a colossal mistake to bully Rihanna into singing for the NFL. There have been so many strong, female voices speaking out about crimes against their sisters, and you know what? People are listening. Universities (Princeton most recently) are more aggressively tackling sexual assaults on campus, there are now consequences -- at least for some -- for spouting irresponsible garbage about female victims. And the NFL? It has now hired female advisers to shape its domestic violence policy.

"New details fueled debate Monday over security at the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi: Wanted posters of a terrorism suspect on the loose, warships at the ready and a video threat from beyond the grave. Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that his country has stepped up security and is prepared to handle any threats. But some U.S. lawmakers -- and at least one Olympic athlete -- have said they're worried about the situation. Hotels warned about terror suspect . Police in Sochi have handed out fliers at area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who may currently be in the city. One flier, obtained by CNN, asks workers to be on the lookout for Ruzanna ""Salima"" Ibragimova, described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the Caucasus region. The woman, according to the flier, may be involved in organizing ""a terrorist act within the 2014 Olympic region."" CNN obtained a copy of the flier, which is dated January 15, from security staff at a hotel in Sochi. The flier claims authorities have received information about Ibragimova's possible arrival in the region last week. Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi. Some describe her as a ""black widow"" -- a notorious type of terrorist that's emerged in Russia's clashes with Chechen separatists. Many of them are wives of insurgents killed by government forces, and they've been blamed for high-profile suicide bombings. Security experts stressed Monday that the woman is likely one of many suspects authorities are trying to find. ""I guarantee they're talking about this one black widow,"" former CIA officer Mike Baker said, ""but there are others that they're also worried about."" Video threat emerges amid security concerns . Official: U.S. military at the ready as contingency plan . The U.S. military will have up to two warships and several transport aircraft on standby under a contingency plan to help evacuate American officials and athletes from the Winter Olympics, if ordered, a U.S. official said Monday. The State Department would take the lead in organizing and evacuating Americans, if necessary, the official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN. Moscow would have to ask for such assistance before the United States would act, the official said. But planes and ships are clearly there ""if something happens like a major terrorist attack and we need to get Americans out,"" the official said. U.S. contingency planning calls for warships to launch helicopters to Sochi from the Black Sea. C-17 transport aircraft would be on standby in Germany and could be on the scene in about two hours. Other aircraft contracted to the State Department would also play a role in any emergency. A video threat from beyond the grave . In a video that surfaced Sunday, two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd made an ominous promise. ""We've prepared a present for you and all tourists who'll come over,"" the video says. ""If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's been spilled."" The video was posted on a well-known jihadi forum website Sunday and apparently was recorded before the Volgograd attacks, which targeted a train station and a trolley bus and claimed the lives of more than 30 people. Report: 7 militants killed in Dagestan counterterror operation . Putin pledges stepped up security . Putin has pledged that visitors to Sochi for the Winter Olympics will be kept safe. Russia has plenty of experience in keeping international events secure, Putin said, pointing to the G8 and G20 summits as examples. Access to Sochi is under heavy restriction ahead of the games, and Putin said Sunday in an interview with half a dozen Russian and international broadcasters that about 40,000 members of Russia's police and security forces would be guarding events. Security analysts have warned that terrorists targeting the Games may try to strike elsewhere in Russia during the Olympics. Putin says gays 'can feel safe' at games . U.S. lawmakers: Games won't be safe . U.S. Sen. Angus King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he wouldn't go to the Games himself, ""and I don't think I would send my family."" Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, also called on the Russian government to be more cooperative with the United States on intelligence sharing ahead of the Games. ""Their level of concern is great, but we don't seem to be getting all of the information we need to protect our athletes in the Games. I think this needs to change, and it should change soon,"" Rogers said. U.S. lawmakers: Winter Olympics aren't safe . In recent weeks, U.S. law enforcement agents have been conducting interviews with people in the United States with ties in the Caucasus region, CNN has learned. The region, which includes Dagestan and Chechnya, has been the scene of unrest and is in southern Russia, hundreds of miles from the venue of the Games. The interviews are informational and do not mean there are any particular threats being investigated, a U.S. official said. Law enforcement officials do ""knock and talk"" visits to meet people and to identify any potential issues. FBI agents conducted similar visits after last year's attack at the Boston Marathon. When asked whether he thought Americans would be safe at the Games, former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden said he trusts Russia's ability to provide security. ""I think Americans will be quite safe,"" he said. Will security concerns impact athletes? Over the weekend, at least one Olympic athlete said he was worried. ""My concerns with Sochi is safety in a way, because it's in a crazy war zone in a way,"" French snowboarder Xavier de la Rue said. ""It's in the middle of all these countries that want to kill Russia, so it's just scary 'cause I know that we're going to be a target in a way, although they do very well their job at keeping it safe but yeah, that's something that scares me a bit."" Tara Lipinski, who won a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and will be attending this year's games, said she feels safe -- and hopes competitors will, too. ""There have been so many threats at the Olympics,"" she told CNN Monday. ""I think athletes are used to that, and they know that, OK, we're going to hear about this. But when we go, we have people that are surrounding us and telling us where we should be and where we shouldn't be. And hopefully they do feel safe."" CNN National Security Analyst Frances Fragos Townsend described the security climate in Sochi as ""the most dangerous threatened environment that we've seen for the Olympics."" But she said competitors shouldn't have to worry. ""They'll go to real extremes to protect the athletes and the venues. ... There's a big falloff, though, when you talk about the families and the tourists,"" Townsend said. ""There really is, I think, a far greater vulnerability.""","Police fliers warn that a terror suspect could be in Sochi .

"A fleet of tiny satellites released from the International Space Station could be a tool to help solve future aviation mysteries like the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, said retired astronaut Chris Hadfield, who commanded the space station for five months last year. Speaking to the media after giving a talk at the opening session of the TED2014 conference Monday, Hadfield said that the shoebox-sized satellites, once fully deployed, will cover the entire planet with frequently refreshed images at a resolution down to 4 meters and could have helped in a mystery such as the question of what happened to the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777. Planet Labs, a San Francisco-based company, arranged for the first group of the satellites to be released from the space station last month. Hadfield said those satellites are in initial testing. Asked by CNN to comment, Planet Labs provided a statement by its co-founder and CEO, William Marshall, a former NASA scientist, who is due to speak later this week at TED:  ""Planet Labs just last month deployed a fleet of 28 satellites, Flock 1, from the International Space Station. This is the largest Earth imaging constellation in history. We are turning on each of the satellites and are now putting them into position. With this constellation, we will measure the planet on a more regular basis to enable various applications. One of those applications is disaster response, including natural and man-made disasters. Other applications range from monitoring deforestation to helping to improve agricultural yields to monitoring urban growth."" Another 100 such satellites are in the works, according to the Financial Times. Hadfield said ""tracking one thin aluminum tube"" like the Boeing 777, in a place that is not heavily covered by radar is very hard. ""Obviously something happened fast and deliberate, exactly what process, whether it was the crew themselves or someone forcing themselves in, we don't know,"" Hadfield said. He said he suspects that if the aircraft did crash, wreckage will eventually be found. How TED got famous . In his talk on the TED stage, Hadfield gripped the audience's attention with a message urging people to conquer irrational fears, with images of the Earth's beauty from space and with a performance on guitar of a portion of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity,"" a song he also sang while weightless on the space station. His video, one of about 100 he shot on the space station, went viral. Astronauts train themselves to overcome fear, and thus are willing to take considerable risks, whether being launched on a rocket or walking in space, Hadfield said. By contrast, some people will let themselves be paralyzed by unreasoning fear of spiders; the way to conquer that is to walk through spider webs (assuming the spiders aren't venomous). ""There's a difference between danger and fear,"" he said after the talk. And Hadfield said that, incongruously, ""I'm afraid of heights,"" but had mostly overcome it through training.","Former space station commander Hadfield: New satellites could help locate planes .

"(CNN) -- The mother of missing Alabama teen Natalee Holloway talked to the family of a murdered Peruvian woman whose case may be linked to her daughter's, the Peruvian family told CNN's sister network In Session. Beth Holloway gave the Flores family her ""sincere, sincere condolences"" when they spoke for the first time Wednesday, Enrique Flores told In Session's Jean Casarez. Flores' sister Stephany was killed May 30. Joran van der Sloot, who is being held in connection with the killing, was twice arrested but never charged in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in 2005. Beth Holloway told Enrique Flores she hoped his family would not go through what her family had suffered, he said. The Flores family had earlier spoken to Dave Holloway, Natalee's father. They told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday they hoped the eventual trial of van der Sloot can ease their pain and that of the Holloway family. ""I think the pain they are feeling, it's very hard,"" Enrique Flores said from Lima, Peru, where 21-year-old Stephany was killed. ""We saw the body of our sister. They don't have the body of their daughter."" Van der Sloot, a 22-year-old Dutch citizen, was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance but released for lack of evidence. Holloway's body has never been found. Van der Sloot has stated to Peruvian police that he wants to talk to Aruban officials about the Holloway case, Aruban Attorney General Robert F. Pietersz said Wednesday. ""I am not worried. I trust the justice in Peru. So, we are just waiting for the judgment,"" said Stephany's sister-in-law Carolina Jorge. ""We are praying that this case (will bring closure) ... for us and ... for Natalee's family, too."" Dave Holloway met with Aruban authorities on the Caribbean island Tuesday and told CNN he believes progress is being made in the investigation. He declined to elaborate further. Aruba also will have to wait to see what information may be contained in a laptop computer Peruvian authorities confiscated when they arrested van der Sloot, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said. The FBI will obtain that information from Peru and then share it with Aruban investigators, Blanken said. Authorities in Aruba say they do not know whether the computer contains any information that may help in the Holloway case. Van der Sloot has told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. He said he was in Peru for a poker tournament and met Flores while gambling. Police have said they think van der Sloot killed Flores to steal money she won. No trial start date has been set in the case, but a hearing is scheduled for next week, when van der Sloot will give his first statements before a judge. Flores' brother told Larry King that he's already heard enough. ""(Van der Sloot) keeps telling so many lies and each time he is changing his version,"" Flores said. ""He just killed her. ... He took money from her. He took ... her car. ... I mean, he sounds like a serial killer.""","Stephany Flores' family speaks to Holloway's mother for the first time, victim's brother says .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish warplanes and long-range missiles attacked Kurdish rebel positions in the mountains of northern Iraq near the Turkish border early Sunday, according to Turkish military officials. A Turkish commando on patrol near the Turkey-Iraq border. The air attack, which began around 1 a.m. and last for more than three hours, targeted Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) outposts in the Qandil mountain, the statement said. Turkish ground troops launched long-range missiles at the PKK positions after the air attack, the statement said. All warplanes returned safely to their bases in Turkey, the military said. Jamal Abdullah, a spokesman for Iraq's autonomous Kurdish Regional Government said the targets of the attack appear to be PKK fighters in the border area, but there are reports of civilian casualties in nearby villages. He had no details on the casualty figures. Tensions have been high along the Iraqi-Turkish border, with Turkey threatening to launch a full-scale cross-border offensive against separatist guerrillas from the PKK. Those militants have launched actions against Turkish troops from northern Iraq and have been fighting the Turkish government forces in southeastern Turkey, where the violence has been steady. The Turkish military government received approval from the parliament in October to take military action ""at any time."" There are tens of thousands of Turkish troops near the border area. The United States, the Iraqi government and the Kurdish Regional Government had pursued diplomatic efforts over the past two months to keep Turkey from launching an offensive against the PKK.

"(CNN)Beyonce had quite the play-date set for her daughter Blue Ivy -- a baby tiger, during their trip to Thailand. The Carter-Knowles clan's glamorous visit to Thailand during the holidays is well documented on Beyonce's Instagram page, but it's a fan photo of the family posing with a baby tiger that's not sitting well with an animal rights organization and critics. The photo shows Beyonce petting the baby tiger while it's being bottle fed at the Phuket FantaSea theme park, with hubby Jay Z and Blue Ivy looking on. ""Tourists like Beyoncé are often unaware of the cruelty tigers suffer for these tourist attractions,"" said World Animal Protection in a statement, ""The tigers used for these photos are often forcibly removed from their mothers to be fed artificially by tourists. They are also crammed into tiny cages or chained to the floor for long periods."" Beyonce and Jay Z aren't the first to be blasted for posing with a tiger. A recent New York State bill bans people from posing for photos while hugging, patting or touching tigers. The bill was introduced after men posing with wild cats became a trend on dating apps like Tinder and OKCupid, which even produced a Tumblr that collected photos of men posing with Tigers. Beyonce's elephant ride during the trip also came under criticism, with the organization One Green Planet reminding the singer of the ""incredible amount of suffering involved in Thai elephant tourism."" The PETA Foundation would like to see all tourists avoid visiting parks where animals are held in captivity. ""We're sure that the Carters, like many unsuspecting tourists, would be horrified to learn that baby elephants and tigers propped up for photo ops are typically torn away from their mothers, violently beaten by trainers, and deprived of everything natural and important to them,"" PETA Foundation deputy general counsel Delcianna Winders said in a statement to CNN. ""And the issues facing exotic animals don't stop in Thailand, of course. Roadside zoos and captive-wildlife breeders in the U.S. subject animals to the same abuses. PETA encourages all caring people to enjoy nature with their families in ways that leave captive animals out of the picture.""

"(CNN)Ambitious companies that ignore the imminent rise of Virtual Assistants as the gateway to the Internet run the same risks as those that dismissed the disruptive innovations of Google in 1998. The current generation of VAs are consumer products like Apple Siri, Google Now, Microsoft Cortana. Smaller innovators like Viv Labs are pursuing a less hardware or operating system dependent architecture. In the enterprise marketplace VA capabilities feature in technologies like IBM's Watson and Amelia from IPsoft. In 2014, there has been a surge in acquisitions of related artificial intelligence technologies by all the major technology companies. Rapid advancements in the underlying technologies have also been taking place -- from neural networks to natural language processing to wearables and emotional recognition systems. The launch of the first mainstream high-impact VA is perhaps four or five years away. What will a VA do? VAs will monitor mental and physical well-being, support lifestyle goals and ambitions through suggestions, prompts, and coaching. They will alert you when friends are nearby, translate both language and culture, help you budget or even intervene when you overextend. Just like a guardian or parent, they will advise you to avoid walking down a particular road at night, or tell you to apply sunscreen based on your skin type and sun levels. Many of these technologies currently exist in relative isolation and the power of the VA will be in consolidating all these data points into an integrated user experience. This could be on your phone, your watch, in your car, and in your home. You'll be able to choose if your VA is like a butler, friend, colleague, slave, or even master. Our research collaboration, Project Virtual Assistant, with global media agency Mindshare focuses on understanding what people really want from the next generation of these services. Our research findings . We worked intensely for two months with 12 workshop participants experimenting with the latest technologies. We conducted expert interviews with leaders in the field on the technical, legal, and socio-economic possibilities and implications, and surveyed 1,000 smart phone users in the UK. One clear finding is that every organization in the world needs to prepare now for a VA-infused future that will directly impact internal efficiencies and operations and external branding and growth strategies. Preliminary results from our previous Human Cloud at Work research indicated that wearables increased productivity in the workplace by 8.5%. Participants were keen to get real-time feedback on the potential correlations between data from their bodies and productivity and performance metrics. VAs will provide the automated opportunity to gather, analyze, and make recommendations from the data from not just one but all of your wearables in real-time. Similar to a football coach, managers will have the ability to put their best employees ""on the field"" and make split second decisions on productivity. The VA inside the company, and our heads . Internally, VAs will transform organizational behavior, leadership, and talent management. Companies will develop branded VAs supporting organizational culture and productivity. Think of them as super-powered Intranets or enterprise portals providing voice-activated access to training, coaching, assessment, knowledge, and internal communications. Early adopter companies can strategically position themselves as VA proponents. Already 62% of UK smart phone users say they are ready to integrate VAs into their everyday work lives. Well-being programs are increasingly important in organizational culture, and VAs can help individual employees learn about boosting their productivity and reducing stress in order to reach their rofessional goals and aspirations. VAs will also operate as gateways to business intelligence within a company.  Optimizing their design and functionality for the needs of each individual organization will by a key ingredient to job satisfaction, retention, loyalty, and recruitment. VA as disruptor . Another important component of the VA will be to disrupt the consumer journey. For example, at the moment firms sell branded painkillers in your local pharmacy for up to 10 times the price of generic painkillers with identical ingredients. These identical products are often right next to each other on the shelf and yet consumers, typically out of brand loyalty and emotional triggers, will buy the branded product. VAs will augment the consumer journey by filling in our behavioral 'black holes' and protecting us from simple emotional exploitations. Your head and your heart might be telling you to buy the branded product partially because of the successful impact of the brand's consumer behavior insight, but your VA will automatically reinsert rationality into your decision-making process. Organizations will need to adapt their strategies as technology succeeds in protecting customers from behavioral exploitation where regulatory bodies and self-regulating industries have failed. In 1998 Google search spawned a revolution in the digital economy and fundamentally changed the way we connect with people, products and services. VAs mark the next digital revolution and will have an even more profound impact on our organizations, everyday lives, commerce, interactions, and behaviors. Read more: How mentors make superstars .

"(This Old House) -- There are countless varieties of tomatoes available, each of which differs from the others in taste, the size, shape and ripening time of the fruit. ""There's only two things money can't buy. That's true love and homegrown tomatoes,"" songwriter Guy Clark says. When deciding what to grow, choose varieties proven to perform well in your area. Talk to neighbors and check with your extension service to learn the local favorites. And, if you're a novice grower, choose at least a few varieties designated as All-America Selections winners. This nonprofit group tests new varieties all across the country and awards only those with outstanding growth and flavor. Their logo appears with plant descriptions in most catalogs. It's always a good idea to experiment with a few plants of several varieties to determine the ideal tomatoes for your garden and taste buds. What's more, growing different varieties is an insurance policy of sorts -- a disease that strikes one variety might not harm the others. These are the qualities to consider when selecting tomatoes for your garden: . Growing basics . Start with healthy plants. Whether homegrown or store-bought, plants should be short and stocky (6 to 10 inches tall). Avoid plants with blossoms or fruit. You'll pay more for plants in individual 4-inch pots, but they usually have larger root systems than those growing in cell packs. As a result, they will grow faster after transplanting. Choose the right site . Tomatoes grow best in full sun (at least 8 hours daily) and well-drained soil rich in organic matter. Work a couple inches of compost or decomposed manure into the upper 6 inches of soil prior to planting. If a soil test shows the pH is below 6.0, apply lime. This Old House: Testing soil . Plant right . Set plants in the garden after the danger of frost and when the soil temperatures are above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. (Experienced gardeners sometimes plant earlier and shelter plants to protect them from cold and frost.) Space plants 1 ½ to 3 feet apart (closer for determinate varieties, which spread less). Wide spacing assures good air circulation, which discourages diseases. Plant seedlings in the ground deeper than they were growing in their pots so the lowest leaves are just above the soil level. Roots will grow along the length of the buried stem, resulting in stronger plants. And, don't forget to water freshly planted seedlings. Most experts recommend fertilizing at planting time. But go easy on the fertilizer. In this case, less is best because too much nitrogen fertilizer results in vigorous vines with few tomatoes. The recommendation from Clemson University Extension is fairly standard: Pour about 1 pint of starter solution (2 tablespoons of 10-10-10 or 5-10-5 fertilizer per gallon of water) around each plant. This Old House: Organic lawn care . Support plants . Stake or cage indeterminate plants (which develop long stems) at the time of transplanting. This keeps vines and tomatoes off the ground so the fruits will be larger, cleaner and less apt to rot. Supported plants are also easier to care for and tomatoes are easier to harvest. The most common method is to support each plant with a single sturdy stake, 6 to 8 feet tall and at least 1 inch thick. Drive the stake into the ground, about 4 inches from the plant. As the plant grows, attach its stems to the stake using commercial tomato ties, strips of soft fabric or old panty hose. Leave a little slack around the stems. The general idea with staking is to limit the vines to a couple of main stems, which requires regular pruning. Supporting tomatoes in wire cylinders or cages is also popular. This method requires more work initially, but there's no need to prune or train the plant. Give them TLC . Tomatoes aren't one of those crops you can plant and forget. Check soil moisture and give plants 1 to 1 ½ inches of water weekly, if not supplied by rain. Try not to splash water on leaves. About a month after planting -- once the soil has really warmed up -- apply a 3- to 4-inch layer of organic mulch, such as weed-free straw. If you mulch too soon, the soil will stay cool, delaying the harvest. This Old House: Mulching a tomato garden . If plants are staked, regularly pinch off the small suckers that sprout between the leafy branches and main stems. Don't cut a knife can spread disease. Give all plants a boost during the growing season by applying a 5-10-5 or 5-10-10 fertilizer according to package directions. The best times to fertilize are when fruits are about golf ball-size and again when the first tomatoes are ripe. And speaking of ripe, pick tomatoes when they are firm and fully colored. Taste one while it's still warm from the sun and you'll know why tomatoes rank No. 1 with home gardeners. Get 2 Free Trial Issues .

"A wave of attacks in Iraq killed at least 31 people and wounded nearly 100 more Saturday as Muslims marked the second day of the festival of Eid al-Adha, police said. At least 14 people were killed and 52 others were wounded in two car bombs and a roadside bomb in two separate locations in eastern Baghdad's Sadr City, police said. The first car bomb was outside a busy restaurant; the second was followed by a roadside bomb near an outdoor market in the city, police added. Sadr City is a predominantly Shiite district. At least five Shiite pilgrims were killed when a roadside bomb in Taji, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Baghdad, struck a minibus carrying them to visit Al-Askariya, or the ""Golden Mosque."" A dozen more were wounded in the blast. Police said most of the casualties were Iranian pilgrims. A roadside bomb exploded in an outdoor market in al-Mamel Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 13 others, police officials said. In the Sunni city of Mosul, five people were killed and seven more wounded in four attacks in and around the city, police said. Most of those affected were from the minority Shabak sect. The attacks included two shootings and two explosions targeting houses and shops related to the sect. On Saturday evening, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road in the al-Jihad neighborhood of western Baghdad, wounding four people. When police arrived to investigate and to evacuate the casualties, another roadside bomb detonated, killing one policeman and wounding two others, police said. In another incident, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Muqdadiya, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing one person and wounding six others, Baquba police said. Britain's ambassador to Iraq, Simon Collis, condemned as ""cowardly"" Saturday's attacks. The top U.N. envoy in Iraq, also condemned the attacks, some of which he said had targeted worshipers. ""This is an atrocious act of violence against innocent worshipers of various faiths,"" said Martin Kobler, the secretary-general's special representative and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. Last month, 365 people, including police and soldiers, were killed. It was the deadliest month since August 2010. Twin blasts kill 11 in Iraq .","U.N. envoy to Iraq condemns the attacks .

"(CNN)Among the casualties of conflict in Crimea, the travails of a Scottish whiskey distiller have barely registered. ""The sanctions are having an effect now,"" says Jimmy Robertson, who leads Angus Dundee in Russia, until recently one of the single-malt specialist's best markets. ""Customers are having to negotiate with banks, some of which have been targeted...Everyone is watching the ruble on a daily basis to decide when to place orders."" ""The Russians are coming to us asking if we can help at this difficult time, asking if we can reduce prices or extend credit. We are trying to be as flexible as we can,"" he said. Pressure to retreat . Angus Dundee's commitment to Russia is in stark contrast to that of many western businesses in the wake of crisis in Ukraine, and the resurrection of Cold War-era tensions. The imposition of sanctions by the U.S. and the EU, which includes a ban on transactions with many individuals and companies, and Russian counter-sanctions hitting foreign imports, have placed great strain on international businesses caught in the crossfire. Giants in fields from energy to banking and car manufacturing such as Exxon, JP Morgan and BMW are reducing their presence, while major deals such as BASF's partnership with Gazprom have been put on ice. Their flight has been spurred by falling oil prices that have wiped half the value from the ruble inside a year. Companies fear the consequences of non-compliance with the western sanction regime, which is both complex and ever-changing, placing greater risk on trading with the sanctioned country. ""It is an extra layer of care that companies must take,"" says Trevor Barton, head of the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce (RBCC). ""They have to employ risk analysts to study legislation -- and there is a lot of it from the EU, U.S., and Russia -- and check that operations are not in breach."" Taking advantage . But Barton and the RBCC are keen to emphasize that the Cold War has not returned, that business between Russia and the West remains possible at this time, even advantageous. ""Before this, Russia was the UK's fastest growing export market, due to the size of the market and the desire of a growing middle class with rising disposable incomes to buy Western goods,"" he said. ""We work with the UK government and the Russian Embassy to ensure people are aware of the possibilities...Sanctions have impacted certain sectors but not all; consumer goods, services, legal advice, construction -- much of what is needed for World Cup 2018 could come from Britain."" Barton sees the current tension as temporary, partly due to the value of Russia as an export market while the Eurozone remains stagnant. Such a thaw would reward companies that have withstood the pressure and remained, he predicts, as loyalty is highly prized in Russian business culture. The Washington think tank ""USA Engage"" has a more ambitious vision: to challenge the concept of trade sanctions that it believes hurt American businesses more than foreign political leaders. ""The U.S. has been the most aggressive country for sanctioning. Since Clinton it has been almost the only tool of diplomacy with an offending country,"" says CEO Richard Sewaya. ""The consequences fall on U.S. companies, in terms of cost of compliance, lost sales, and an altered strategic environment."" USA Engage and the coalition of businesses it represents is lobbying policymakers to make sanctions hit individuals rather than companies, and in turn their U.S. trading partners. It extends this principle even to avowedly hostile regimes, such as Venezuela and Iran, on the basis that relations between businesses would not endorse political leaders. Sewaya claims there is increasing sympathy among officials for a paradigm shift. Opportunities in Iran . Iran, subject to the harshest international sanctions that have seen British banks fined billions of dollars, could also offer lucrative opportunities for foreign investors. ""Iran potentially offers a large and underpenetrated market for foreign business,"" says Toby Iles, of the Economist intelligence Unit. ""If sanctions are lifted under a long-term deal, Iran could become a strategic priority for many businesses."" The opportunities are rich and diverse in an economy worth around $500 billion, Iles believes: ""Early interest is coming from automotive companies, suppliers of aircraft and industrial parts, and general retail and consumer goods as well as healthcare and pharmaceutical firms, with many companies drawing up business plans for how they can distribute their goods into the market."" ""Peugeot and Renault have led car-manufacturers, given their past experience co-operating with the Iranian producers, Khodro and Saipa, and would like to take Iran's annual vehicle production back from around 740,000 in the 2013/14 Iranian year to the peak of 1.6 million reached in 2011."" Ahead of the anticipated thaw, companies are already finding opportunities to position themselves in the new market, despite the continuing sensitivity over nuclear talks. Seeking trade with a perceived adversary may be a high wire act, but in due course there are likely to be rewards for those who hold their nerve.","Western companies are fleeing Russia - but could reap rewards from holding their ground .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A key Democratic lawmaker called Tuesday for the resignation of American International Group's CEO after the troubled insurer held a financial planners conference last week at a posh Arizona resort. Edward Liddy, AIG chief executive, said the conference educated external financial planners. The company responded that the event cost AIG very little and was aimed at boosting income. AIG had come under sharp criticism for sending executives on a lavish English partridge hunt and a weeklong retreat at a California resort after accepting an $85 billion bailout -- since grown to $150 billion -- from the federal government in September. ""These guys, they don't get it,"" Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""They came to us basically saying 'we are on the critical list, and we need a respirator,' and we bail them out, and the next thing we know, we turn around and they are going out partying and spending the taxpayers' dollars. And it's kind of -- it's very upsetting.""  Watch Cummings criticize AIG » . Cummings, a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called for the resignation of AIG CEO Edward Liddy, who joined the company only a few weeks ago as part of the bailout plan. But Liddy told CNN's Larry King later Tuesday that the conference was legitimate, stressing it was an event not for AIG employees, but for 150 outside financial planners wanting to learn about AIG's products. And AIG has said that although the event cost $343,000, AIG had to pay only $23,000 of it.  Watch Liddy explain event's purpose » . ""Ninety percent of [the conference] was paid for by the participants who were there and our partners at this conference,"" Liddy told King. Liddy said AIG was ""tightening the belt"" and has cut more than 160 conferences or other events in the past seven weeks. But he said some training events for external financial planners are needed ""so they understand the product, all of its features, and they know what to sell to whom."" ""We don't want a variable annuity sold to a 85-year-old widow,"" Liddy said. Liddy said the company will pay off the $150 billion government loan plus interest.  Watch Liddy say AIG will pay back the loan » . ""We appreciate what the taxpayer and the federal government has done for us. ... We intend to pay back every penny we've borrowed,"" Liddy said. Earlier, AIG spokesman Nicholas Ashooh also defended the conference, saying Cummings was ""responding to an incomplete picture."" ""This was a legit meeting. It was really for independent advisers at very little cost to AIG.""  Watch AIG's CEO explain the retreat at a Arizona resort » . Ashooh also said AIG canceled a speech by former NFL quarterback Terry Bradshaw at the conference. The conference, Ashooh said, was one ""that any insurance company has to do"" and not a ""junket for AIG top executives."" Phoenix TV station KNXV, a CNN affiliate, reported that AIG tried to keep its connection to the 2008 Asset Management Conference a secret by ensuring that no AIG logos were on the property. Undercover footage shot by KNXV shows top AIG executives, including Larry Roth, president and CEO of AIG Advisor Group, sitting poolside and drinking coffee while conference-goers attended meetings. Another executive -- Art Tambaro, head of AIG subsidiary Royal Alliance -- stayed in one of the resort's two-story villas. The footage also shows a few executives being shuttled in a luxury Lincoln Town Car one night and enjoying dinner and drinks at a McCormick & Schmick's seafood restaurant, where they spent more than $400, KNXV reported. Ashooh insisted that the conference was legitimate. ""We've certainly done some things in the past that have been worthy of criticism, but this one's really been mischaracterized,"" he said. Ashooh said AIG indeed tried to keep the event low-profile ""because everything has been subject to so much criticism."" ""But it wasn't an effort to disguise it. It was an effort to minimize costs and to keep the profile down, because we don't even want to do anything that would even be perceived as expensive,"" he said. The U.S. government agreed to an $85 billion loan in September to stave off AIG's immediate collapse. On Monday, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department modified the original loan into a $150 billion deal with a lower interest rate and used another $40 billion to buy preferred stock. The dealings have left the federal government owning 80 percent of AIG. But AIG ran into criticism almost from the start. There was a $440,000 retreat at St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, and an $86,000 partridge hunt at an English manor. Last week's conference was held at the Hilton Squaw Peak Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona. Under an agreement with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, the company agreed to freeze $19 million in payments to its former CEO, Martin Sullivan, and block distributions from a $600 million deferred compensation and bonus pool for the company's financial products subsidiary. The company also withheld a $10 million severance payment to its former chief financial officer. Sullivan was replaced in June by Robert Willumstad, who in turn was replaced by Liddy as part of the bailout. Willumstad voluntarily gave up a $22 million severance package. AIG reported a $24.5 billion loss in the third quarter.","NEW: AIG executive: Event was for outside financial planners, not our employees .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin appeared on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live,"" along with Palin lookalike Tina Fey. The show's opening sketch featured a mock press conference with Fey reprising her role as the Alaska governor. The piece then cut to a shot of Palin watching Fey's performance on a television monitor with Lorne Michaels, the show's executive producer. ""I just didn't think it was a realistic depiction of the way my press conferences would have gone,"" she said. ""Why couldn't we have done the '30 Rock' sketch that I wrote?"" she asked, referring to the NBC comedy which stars Fey. ""Honestly, not enough people know that show,"" Michaels responds. The opening sketch also featured a surprise visit by Alec Baldwin, Fey's ""30 Rock"" co-star, who mistook Palin for Fey, and tried to convince Michaels not to let Fey appear on the show with the governor. He snapped his fingers, trying to remember the nickname some had given Palin. ""Caribou Barbie,"" Palin reminded him. Baldwin, still oblivious that he was talking to the governor, continued: ""You want her, our Tina, to go out there and stand there with that horrible woman,"" he asked. ""What do you have to say for yourself?"" Michaels points out he was standing next to the real Palin. ""Forgive me, I must say this,"" Baldwin backtracked. ""You are way hotter in person. I mean seriously. I mean, I can't believe they let her play you."" Palin laughed and responded that Baldwin's brother, Stephen, was her favorite. Stephen Baldwin, also an actor, is a Christian conservative with his own ministry. Palin then took the podium and told the reporters she was not going to take any of their questions. She then uttered the signature line that opens the show every weekend: ""Live from New York, it's Saturday Night."" Later in the show, Palin appeared on SNL's ""Weekend Update"" with cast members Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers. ""I've been thinking it over and I'm not going to do the piece we rehearsed,"" Palin told Meyers. ""My gut is telling me it might be a bad idea for the campaign."" Poehler said she would do the part and launched into a rap about being Sarah Palin. Among her backup dancers was cast member Jason Sukeikis who impersonated Palin's husband, Todd. Palin grooved along to the music, even raising her hands when Poehler sang ""All the mavericks in the house, put your hands up! All the plumbers in the house, put your pants up!"" The plumber reference was meant to invoke the now-famous Joe ""the Plumber"" Wurzelbacher, who Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain has held up as a small business owner who will see his taxes rise if his Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, wins the election. In both skits, Palin delivered her lines with a straight face but mostly played the comic foil to the show's cast of mischief-makers. On Thursday, multiple sources told CNN that Palin planned to appear on the hit show. ""Saturday Night Live"" has featured three opening skits in which former cast member and Palin lookalike Tina Fey portrays the Alaska governor. Fey first appeared as Palin for the show's season premiere last month in a sketch with SNL cast member Amy Poehler, who played Sen. Hillary Clinton. Fey reprised her role as Palin two weeks later, again alongside Poehler, who played CBS's Katie Couric in a parody of Palin's interview with the CBS anchor earlier that week. Earlier this week, Palin told reporters that she'd love to appear on the show with Fey, The Associated Press reported. ""I love her, she's a hoot and she's so talented,"" Palin said, according to the AP. ""It would be fun to meet her, imitate her and keep on giving her new material.""

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- The highest active volcano in Colombia erupted Monday night, prompting authorities to order the evacuation of up to 15,000 people. An eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Huila volcano last year caused damaging mudslides. The Nevado del Huila volcano erupted at 11:08 p.m. Monday (12:08 a.m. Tuesday ET), according to the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining. Officials urged 13,000 to 15,000 people to evacuate, according to Caracol Radio, a radio station. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.  See an aerial view of the eruption » . The eruption amounted to a ""Level Red"" -- the institute's most severe designation for volcanoes -- but authorities told Caracol Radio that darkness made it difficult to gauge precisely what had happened. Monitoring equipment confirmed an eruption, but authorities do not know whether it has produced a column of smoke or spilled lava, Marta Cavache, an official with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, told the radio station.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Cancer was once assumed to be a death sentence because the disease was often incurable, but a new survey suggests the crisis for many today is paying for available treatments. High cost-sharing, caps on insurance benefits and policy limitations raise treament costs for people with insurance. ""It is a big surprise that 20 percent of people with health insurance can't afford to have the cancer therapy they need to save their lives,"" said John Seffrin of the American Cancer Society. The survey, jointly conducted by ACS and the Kaiser Family Foundation, includes 20 profiles of cancer patients and their struggles to find affordable medical coverage. The report was presented at a news conference Thursday, the same day U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had surgery for pancreatic cancer in New York. Ten-year-old Taylor Wilhite's leukemia means cancer in her bones and blood. The cost of treatment and medicine since last March is now approaching the lifetime limit of $1 million from her father's family health insurance plan. Fifty-eight-year-old Jamie Drzewicki is in remission from breast cancer after treatment and surgery. But she's unable to pay endless bills left over when her $100,000 insurance policy ran out. She said the stress from that debt could kill her if she let it. ""I can't go on with the fear that I'm gonna get cancer again, and have this stress every day, and I have to let it go, and try to pay what I can,"" she said. Seffrin, who has led the American Cancer Society for 17 years, said it is troubling that money, not medical science, may keep the disease a top concern for society. ""We can now begin to talk about eliminating cancer as a major public health problem in the United States early in this new century. If we can pay for it,"" he said. The survey, based in part on requests for financial assistance received by the American Cancer Society, found several consistent factors facing those who otherwise had medical insurance. They include high cost-sharing, where the cancer patient is responsible for some of the expense; caps on insurance benefits that are far lower than what today's cancer treatments can cost; and limitations on policies when an employee becomes too sick to work. The report did not make recommendations, but Seffrin said the study of cancer patients should underscore the need for health care reform.","Paying for cancer treatment has become a barrier for many with the disease .

"The wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling claims the two are just business partners and denies she was involved in the team's response in the hours after racist comments by her husband were released online, Shelly Sterling's attorney said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported Donald Sterling tried to cover up the scandal and met with his wife and the team president to craft a response to an audio recording where he made disparaging remarks about African-Americans to his friend V. Stiviano. Team President Andy Roeser, who is on leave, also was in on the drafting of the statement that questioned the validity of the recording and suggested it was released by someone seeking revenge against Donald Sterling, according to the newspaper's account of the NBA document. ""Shelly Sterling had no involvement whatsoever in any decision on the content or release of the April 26 statement by the Clippers regarding her estranged husband. Moreover, she had no knowledge of the statement until after it was issued by the Clippers,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a written statement. The Times report cited a 30-page NBA document detailing the charges against Donald Sterling that could lead to the Sterlings losing the team they have owned since 1981. The Sterlings own the franchise through a family trust, with each spouse having a 50% share. The league said it has been damaged by Sterling's racist remarks, which were posted online in April by TMZ, and other bigoted comments aired in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC 360."" O'Donnell also denied the NBA's claim, as reported by the Times, that the Sterlings aren't estranged. He said they have been living in separate homes for more than a year and have both announced they intend to divorce. But they remain business partners, he said. While the NBA states in document that the Sterlings went to dinner after the scandal broke and Shelly Sterling appeared to defend her husband from media charges of racisim, O'Donnell explained that it was Donald Sterling's birthday. He said Shelly Sterling was invited at the last minute by a friend, who hoped she might persuade her husband to apologize for the racist remarks. When she left the restaurant with her husband, she thought the media recording the Sterlings was asking her whether she was a racist, O'Donnell said. ""Shelly has denounced his racist statements in the strongest terms,"" he said. A person at the office for Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, said they will have no comment until they have all documents from the NBA's investigation. May 27 deadline to respond . The Times reported that the NBA document it obtained accuses the billionaire real estate investor of trying to persuade V. Stiviano to tell a league investigator she altered the recording and it wasn't Sterling making racist remarks on the audio. According to the story, the NBA alleges Sterling and Stiviano met on May 2, about a week after the recording containing racist remarks was released by TMZ and just before Stiviano was interviewed by Barbara Walters on ABC. ""Sterling asked Stiviano to tell the NBA that she lied in her previous meeting with the league,"" the Times reported. On Monday, the NBA released a summary of the charges against Sterling, who has until May 27 to respond. In it, the NBA said: ""In the course of the investigation into Mr. Sterling's conduct, it was discovered that relevant evidence was destroyed, false and misleading evidence was provided to the NBA's investigator, and (the franchise) issued a false and misleading press statement regarding this matter."" The newspaper also reported the NBA is prepared to argue at a special June 3 meeting of the NBA board of governors that Roeser heard the recording on April 9, weeks before it went online, after a Clippers employee sent Roeser a copy. The document says Roeser told the employee to delete the audio file and text messages about it from a cell phone. Roeser is now on indefinite leave from the team. When asked by a CNN producer at a Tuesday news conference what evidence had been destroyed, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he wouldn't comment on the specifics of the investigation. NBA charges Sterling, schedules June 3 vote . NBA commissioner: League will oust Sterlings . Silver said on Tuesday he is confident the league will be able to force the Sterlings to sell the franchise for violating the NBA constitution, though the new commissioner would prefer they sell the team without the league's pushing. ""It is their team to sell,"" Silver, who has been commissioner for three months, said ahead of the league's draft lottery. ""(They) know what the league's point of view is. If (they) wanted to sell the team on some reasonable timetable, I prefer (they) sell it than we go through this process."" The chances of that happening appear unlikely. Sterling, through his lawyer, sent a letter to the league saying he won't pay a $2.5 million fine and threatening to sue if he isn't afforded due process. To terminate the Sterlings' franchise rights, 75% (23) of the 30 team owners would have to vote to sustain the charge and force a sale at the board meeting. Because Sterling is banned from any NBA activities, he is not allowed to vote, but the Clippers will have a vote, the NBA said. In the case of a forced sale, the league does have a duty to the Sterlings to sell the team for the highest possible price, Silver said. The commissioner, who took over from David Stern in February, told reporters if it gets to that point, the league will hire investment bankers to conduct the sale. Silver expressed confidence that eventually a new group will own the Clippers, who, led by all-stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, advanced to the second round of the NBA playoffs this season before losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Some analysts have said the team could be worth more than $1 billion. Forbes magazine lists the franchise's value at $575 million. ""We know we're doing the right thing and I know I have the owners behind me,"" Silver said. CNN interview damages Sterling's case . In his interview with CNN's ""AC 360"" last week, Sterling talked about his relationship with Stiviano and racism in America, and he trashed Magic Johnson and other minorities. ""That's one problem I have. Jews, when they get successful, they will help their people. And some of the African-Americans, maybe I'll get in trouble again, they don't want to help anybody,"" said Sterling, who is Jewish. Sterling: I'm not a racist; I'm a giver .

"Four more potential cases of Ebola were under observation Tuesday in Spain, health authorities said Tuesday, a day after a nurse's assistant became the first person known to have contracted the deadly virus outside Africa in the current outbreak. The woman helped treat two Spanish missionaries, both of whom had contracted Ebola in West Africa, one in Liberia and the other in Sierra Leone. Both died after returning to Spain. Spain has outbreak's 1st known case of contracting Ebola outside of Africa . The developments come just as the organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) reports that a Norwegian staff member has contracted the deadly virus. The staffer had been working in the Sierra Leone city of Bo and was placed in isolation Sunday after developing a fever, the organization said. The worker is being sent to a treatment center in Europe. In Spain, no details have yet been given of exactly how the nurse's assistant contracted the virus, and her condition is unknown. Francisco Arnalis, head of internal medicine at the Carlos III Hospital, told a news conference that the three other potential Ebola cases are being monitored there. A hospital spokeswoman said later Tuesday that another nurse's assistant -- who is on the same team as the infected nurse's assistant -- is under observation. This more recent case was admitted to the hospital after she ""started having a little bit of a temperature,"" said the spokeswoman, who wasn't named as is customary in Spain. Earlier, health officials explained that one of the people being monitored is the original nurse's assistant's husband, who faces a high risk of infection and had no protection. Another is a suspected case in a man who traveled overseas and has tested negative twice. The fourth, a nurse, is not a suspected case but has been brought in as a precaution after suffering diarrhea. She was exposed, but she was wearing protective gear, Arnalis said. Thirty people from Carlos III Hospital and 22 others -- from Alcorcon hospital plus family members -- are being monitored, according to authorities. It was not immediately known whether the nurse's assistant hospitalized late Tuesday was one of these 30 contacts at Carlos III Hospital. The hospital will not release information about the status of the nurse's assistant, who has not been named, in order to respect her privacy, director Rafael Santamaria said. The hospital has two potential treatments at its disposal, said Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas, one using an IV drip with the antibodies of Ebola survivors and the other an antiviral drug. ""This is a treatment that the WHO (World Health Organization) has recommended, even though they haven't verified its efficacy,"" he said of the IV drip. EU: We need to know what happened . Spanish authorities have said that all the proper protocols and procedures were followed in the care of the two missionaries. But the European Union has asked for an explanation as to how the woman was infected. European Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said on Tuesday that ""Spain told us all the protocols have been followed, but obviously something wrong happened."" There have been 10 evacuations of Ebola-infected patients from Africa to Europe, eight of those within the European Union, Vincent said -- and it is first time that something like this has happened. ""The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,"" he said. ""If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU. But again, zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital, where staff deal with sick people. ""We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures."" There will be an extra meeting of European officials to discuss the Spanish Ebola case on Wednesday, he said. The World Health Organization said it was ""ready to provide support to Spain, as and if required,"" as it investigates the case and traces the infected woman's contacts. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron will lead a Cabinet meeting to discuss way to coordinate how to handle response to Ebola there, if it's necessary. Cameron called Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma to discuss the status of the outbreak in the West African nation and talk about how aid the UK has provided is helping. According to Downing Street, the Sierra Leone leader said the situation continues to be ""very serious"" and there was a need to train more medical staff, improve burial processes and develop a better system for running service treatment centers. Unions question equipment used . Some Spanish unions have blamed the government, saying they warned it that the personal protective equipment used by the medical team was not of the highest standard. Angry doctors and nurses outside the Carlos III Hospital where the nurse's assistant is being treated -- and where the two missionaries were cared for before her -- said they were outraged the pair had been brought to the hospital, one in August and the other in September. Ebola drugs in the works . They said that the two priests, Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, were almost dead when they arrived, and that they should not have been brought back to Spain, thereby putting other people's lives at risk. Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato announced Monday that testing had confirmed the nurse's assistant has the virus. The husband of the nurse's assistant, who is under observation, is not sick, a spokesman for the Health Ministry said. It was not clear whether he is under quarantine. The couple have no children. The assistant was one of about 30 health professionals in Spain who helped treat the Ebola patients. They and the ambulance team that took her to the hospital are now reportedly under observation. No word on where she took her vacation . Health officials said the assistant developed symptoms on September 30. She was not hospitalized until this week, when her only symptom was a fever. She was first taken to a hospital in southern Madrid before being transferred to Carlos III Hospital, where she had helped care for the Ebola patients. The second of the missionaries died on September 26, and she went on vacation a day later, health officials said. They have not said where that vacation was taken. A few days later, she reported that she was not feeling well but her temperatures were not very high, officials said. It was only several days later that her temperature soared and she was hospitalized. An investigation is underway to find everyone the assistant may have had contact with while infectious. So far, there are no other known related cases. Health authorities have urged people to stay calm, as they hope that the virus' spread is contained. ""We are working in coordination to give the best care to the patient and to guarantee the safety of all citizens,"" said Mato, the health minister. Obama: National security priority . The news came amid growing fears in the United States that the disease could spread. The first person to be diagnosed in the United States with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, remains in critical but stable condition in Texas, according to Candace White, a spokeswoman for Texas Health. He is on a ventilator and receiving kidney dialysis, she said, adding that his liver function, which declined over the weekend, has improved. He is continuing to receive an investigational medication, White said. During a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention press conference on Monday, CNN asked Texas Department of State Health Services Dr. David Lakey how care protocols in Spain compared to those involving Duncan in Texas. Lakey said he personally went to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital ward in Dallas where the patient is being treated, and saw that there was extensive security and a detailed method of how providers were protecting themselves. ""They take this really seriously,"" he said, describing treatment protocol as ""meticulous."" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said none of the people who Duncan came into contact with before his diagnosis that the CDC has identified for monitoring has shown symptoms. Frieden also said the agency has not made final decisions about possible ways to screen at airports in the United States. Meanwhile, some of the U.S. military personnel being deployed to Liberia to help tackle the Ebola crisis may come into contact with the virus, a Pentagon official said Tuesday. The head of U.S. Africa Command, Gen. David Rodriguez, said that while the majority of U.S. troops involved in the mission would not be exposed to the disease, those in mobile testing labs could have contact in that environment. ""They're all trained at a very, very high level,"" Rodriguez told reporters of the lab personnel, who constitute a ""separate, specialty element of the force."" President Obama told reporters Monday, ""As I've said from the start of this outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority. This is not just a matter of charity. ... This is an issue about our safety."" Obama called for protocols to help stop the spread of the disease, including additional air passenger screening, while downplaying the risk of an epidemic in the United States. In Liberia, Ebola is killing Thomas Duncan's neighbors . Ebola has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, with more than 7,400 suspected, probable and confirmed cases. The virus is transmitted through close and direct physical contact with infected bodily fluids, the most infectious being blood, feces and vomit. The incubation period, from the time of infection to symptoms, is two to 21 days.","Madrid hospital: Another nurse assistant being observed for possible Ebola .

"Suspected jihadist militants opened fire on Israeli troops near the Israel-Egypt border Wednesday afternoon, wounding a female officer and a male soldier, the Israeli military said. The militants shot at and fired an anti-tank missile at the troops, who belong to an infantry battalion responsible for defending the border, the military said. The attack happened at about 2 p.m. near Esoz, Israel. The wounded soldiers were taken by helicopter to a hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva; details of their injuries weren't available. The militants' location at the time of the attack wasn't immediately clear. A post on the Israeli military's Twitter account said that the troops were hit by ""fire directed at them from Egypt."" Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner later said only that the attack happened close to the border, near Esoz. Lerner did not say whether the Israeli military returned fire. He said more Israeli forces were being sent to the area, and the people who live in the area should stay in their homes.","Female officer, male soldier hurt in attack by suspected jihadist militants, Israeli military says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the Senate Finance Committee met Tuesday with treasury secretary nominee Tim Geithner over concerns involving his personal taxes and the immigration status of a former housekeeper, transition officials said. Timothy Geithner has been nominated for the post of treasury secretary in the Obama administration. The Geithners employed a housekeeper whose employment authorization document expired about three months before she stopped working for them in October 2005, according to a written statement from the Senate Finance Committee. Later, the housekeeper, who is married to a U.S. citizen, was granted a green card, transition officials said. The second concern involves Geithner's taxes while he worked for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to a statement released by the committee, Geithner failed to pay self-employment taxes while the IMF paid him from 2001 to 2004. In 2006, the Internal Revenue Service audited Geithner for tax years 2003 and 2004, and he paid $16,732 for the taxes and interest for those years, the statement said. After Obama nominated him for treasury secretary, Geithner voluntarily amended his taxes for 2001 and 2002, paying $25,970 for those taxes and interest, the committee said. The presidential transition team told Finance Committee staff about Geithner's taxes early last month, the committee said. As an international organization, the IMF does not withhold money from employees' paychecks to pay Social Security and Medicare. U.S. employees are required to pay them on their own. Robert Gibbs, the incoming White House spokesman, called Geithner's tax issue a ""common mistake."" ""The president-elect chose Tim Geithner to be his treasury secretary because he's the right person to help lead our economic recovery during these challenging times,"" Gibbs said in a written statement. ""He's dedicated his career to our country and served with honor, intelligence and distinction. That service should not be tarnished by honest mistakes, which, upon learning of them, he quickly addressed."" The Finance Committee said it would continue to review Geithner's tax returns and other information ahead of a nomination hearing. ""When errors or issues of concern are discovered, transparency is vital to allow members of the committee and the entire Senate to fully review and assess the relevant information before hearings and votes occur,"" the committee said. ""I believe that these errors, although serious, do not rise to the level of disqualification. He is an extremely competent man,"" said committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Montana. ""The errors were, in my judgment, honest mistakes. He did not in any way intentionally make those mistakes."" Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, also said the mistakes were ""not at all disqualifying."" ""Tim came to the committee, admitted he had made some mistakes, and was very contrite,"" he said. ""I continue to strongly support his nomination and given the tough economic conditions, hope we can confirm him as quickly as possible.""","Committee: Housekeeper worked for 3 months after employment document expired .

"Legazpi, Philippines (CNN) -- The deadly storm that battered the Philippines for days weakened Monday as it rumbled from one island to another, passing close to the densely populated capital city of Manila. Officials revised the death toll downward to 25 from 27 on Wednesday after two people were found alive, Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon told CNN. Tropical Storm Hagupit, which was downgraded from typhoon strength Monday, slammed into the eastern Philippines late Saturday. It brought fierce winds and torrential rain to roughly the same region ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November last year. But while Haiyan left more than 7,000 people dead or missing, Hagupit's toll so far remains in the double digits. Hagupit has had a powerful impact across several major Philippine islands, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their houses, tearing down trees and causing floods. It has destroyed nearly 1,000 homes, Gwendolyn Pang, the secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, told CNN. ""I am worried -- I am thinking of my children and my grandchildren. They are so young, that's why we're here,"" said Pilar Rangosajo, a grandmother taking refuge in an evacuation center in the city of Legazpi. ""It's so hard for me because every typhoon damages our home. We don't have the money to fix it."" Her concerns are common in a country where many people live in lightly built wooden houses. Teams try to reach remote areas . As Hagupit -- known locally as Ruby -- continued to howl over the archipelago, officials have begun to assess the scale of the damage in the regions it hit. Emergency response teams are trying to reach some of the remote areas where little is known about the storm's effects. But officials praised the success of efforts to relocate large numbers of people away from vulnerable coastal areas, citing fears of a repeat of last year's devastation as a motivating factor. ""People didn't have to be pushed anymore,"" Gordon said. ""They knew that they could face another Haiyan, and Haiyan killed a lot of people from storm surges."" In Tacloban, the city hardest hit by Haiyan, around half the 200,000 residents evacuated to safer areas ahead of Hagupit, the U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA Philippines said. Fishermen fear typhoon will 'destroy everything' Heavy rain concern for capital . Hagupit has been less powerful than Haiyan, but it is moving at a much slower pace. Weather forecasters said that means Hagupit will dump large amounts of heavy rain on areas in its path, increasing the risk of landslides and flash floods. ""It doesn't matter right now if it's a typhoon or tropical storm -- this is a rainmaker,"" meteorologist Tom Sater said. Noel Rosal, the mayor of Legazpi, said that ""for almost 20 hours, we were battered by rain and strong winds."" Flooding concerns are particularly acute for Manila, the national capital whose metropolitan region is home to nearly 12 million people. Because of the area's geography, many parts of Manila are susceptible to flash floods. Hagupit passed to the south of Manila late Monday and early Tuesday, over the province of Batangas. Humanitarian workers were also facing challenges coping with the sheer number of people relying on evacuation centers for support. ""Health issues are kind of difficult when you have 900,000 people crammed into rescue centers,"" Gordon said, raising concerns about sanitation and respiratory illnesses in particular. Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . Saima Mohsin reported from Legazpi, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat, Yoko Wakatsuki, Pedram Javaheri and Andrew Stevens contributed to this report.","Nearly 1,000 homes have been destroyed, the Red Cross says .

"The most esteemed guardian of the English language has bestowed a prestigious honor upon debatably the most embarrassing phenomenon of the digital age: the selfie. So, grab a smartphone, put on your best duck face and celebrate. Oxford Dictionaries' word for the year for 2013 is ""selfie."" And when you share that filtered photo on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, you'll join not just Anthony Weiner and Geraldo, but millions of others around the world perpetuating a tradition started over a decade ago, Oxford says. The word ""selfie"" first popped up in an Australian chat room on September 13, 2002,  to describe an undignified scene, the dictionaries' publishers believe. Related: Young drivers snap selfies behind wheel . This was the post: ""Um, drunk at a mates 21st, I tripped ofer and landed lip first (with front teeth coming a very close second) on a set of steps. I had a hole about 1cm long right through my bottom lip. And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie."" Yes, the first-ever known mention of the word ""selfie"" stemmed from an inebriated mouth with teeth protruding through its bottom lip. Given those circumstances, Oxford may not much care how you spell it. You could go with ""ie"" or ""y,"" as in ""selfy."" Oxford says that doesn't change the official definition: . ""A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website."" Complete unknown . For years after its birth, ""selfie"" crept through the web largely unnoticed. But in 2012, the word of the year began its ascent to digital fame, Oxford says. Suddenly, everybody around the world was using the word, as they self-snapped away. Related: 'Selfies at funerals' must die . By August this year, Oxford proclaimed it a real English-language word and gave it a place in the dictionary -- but that was merely a stepping stone to lingual infamy. ""Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year,"" Oxford wrote in justifying its choice. ""Selfie"" beat out seven competitors, including ""twerk,"" ""schmeat"" (synthetically produced meat) and ""bitcoin"" for the Word of the Year crown. ""Selfie"" is not slouching on its thrown, Oxford says of its word of the year. It has spawned herds of images on social media. There are 57 million photos bearing its hashtag -- #selfie -- on Instagram alone. There is even a user account called ""selfie."" And, yes, it contains nothing but selfies. ""Selfie"" has also been busy pumping out offspring in its namesake. It has given birth to ""helfie"" -- a photo of one's own hair; ""belfie"" -- a snapshot of one's own backside; and ""welfie"" -- a selfie taken while working out, aka the most annoying kind. There's also the ""drelfie"" -- a photo of yourself when you're drunk. Fitting, since a drelfie in Australia was the first ""selfie"" that ever bore the name.","Oxford's word of the year was ""selfie"" due to the drastic climb in usage this year .

"The Illinois Senate will vote Thursday -- Valentine's Day -- on whether to legalize same-sex marriage. Because Democrats have supermajority control of the General Assembly, the measure is expected to be approved. After the Senate vote, the measure would be considered by the House. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, has indicated he would sign the bill. If it is approved, Illinois would be the 10th state, plus the District of Columbia, to legalize same-sex marriage, according to Lambda Legal, a gay rights organization. Three other states are considering similar legalization, said Camilla Taylor, marriage project director for Lambda Legal. A bill has passed the Rhode Island House and has been sent to the Senate. A proposal has been introduced in the Hawaii legislature and another is expected in Delaware, Taylor said. ""All eyes are on us,"" said Taylor, who is based in Illinois. ""It's looking great. We're very excited about Illinois."" On February 6, Quinn said that ""marriage equality is a matter of fairness and equal rights under law."" ""We took the first step towards marriage equality two years ago when I signed civil unions into law. Since that day, thousands of committed couples in 92 counties across our state have entered into civil unions,"" he said. ""Now is the time for the next step in providing equal rights to all people in Illinois."" Five states, including Illinois, have civil union laws, according to Lambda Legal and the National Conference of State Legislatures. The others are Hawaii, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island. The groups list four states as having some type of domestic-partnership recognition: California, Oregon,  Nevada and Wisconsin. Lambda Legal lists Colorado as recognizing designated beneficiary agreements. Twenty-nine states have constitutional provisions banning same-sex marriage, the NCSL says. Polls show that legalizing same-sex marriage is gaining support across the country, although it remains less popular in some Midwestern and Southern states than in the rest of the country. Even Illinois Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady said last month that he supported same-sex marriage and urged legislators to vote for it. The move prompted criticism from conservative Republicans, including state Sen. Jim Oberweis. But Oberweis seemed resigned to Republicans lacking the votes to stop the bill. ""I hope that we resolve this issue sooner rather than later because the state of Illinois has some tremendous financial problems to deal with, which in my view is where we should be concentrating our focus and our time,"" he said.","A same-sex marriage law is expected to be approved in Illinois .

"(CNN)Al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra has taken over key districts of Idlib suburbs in northwestern Syria, ousting U.S.-backed Syrian rebels from their strongholds and raising fears of their wider ascendance in northern Syria, monitors and activists say. The Islamist militant group, also known as al-Nusra Front, pushed the Syrian Revolutionary Front and the Hazm Movement out of the Idlib suburbs of Jabal al-Zawia and Jisr Alshugur, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. One observer suggested the al-Nusra moves had taken about 70% of the territory once held by moderates. But these moderates held little sway within military circles of the rebel movement, and they had influence mostly because of their links to the U.S. Like ISIS, al-Nusra Front is trying to establish an Islamic state, though primarily in Syria. It has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the Syrian regime, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. The group has claimed hundreds of attacks in several cities, including suicide bombings, and is responsible for the deaths of ""numerous innocent Syrians,"" the U.S. State Department said. Islamist rivals in Syria find a common enemy in 'crusaders' coalition . One focal point of the al-Nusra offensive was Syrian Revolutionary Front leader Jamaal Marouf, long seen as a moderate benefiting from U.S. assistance. He appeared in an online video saying that he had decided to withdraw from Jabal al-Zawia, his hometown, to stop further loss of life and that al-Nusra had killed more Syrians than the regime. However, there were reports the two sides were considering talks and a Sharia court may be used to arbitrate if Marouf personally appeared. There were also reports of defections from moderates to al-Nusra. One activist said many fighters were pressured by their families to defect as al-Nusra was popular in their hometowns. There are concerns that al-Nusra was moving to homogenize its control of the Idlib area, where it has long been dominant, and might target a key border crossing. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that al-Nusra fighters have mobilized in the town of Sarmada, near the Turkish-Syrian border crossing of Bab Al Hawa, leading to fears they may seek to take over that key border post. CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","U.S.-backed Syrian rebels have been ousted from their strongholds, monitors say .

"Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman had an assault rifle handy when authorities raided his beachside hideaway over the weekend, but the world's most wanted drug lord never opened fire. That's because marines used infrared and body-heat scanners to pinpoint the locations of everyone inside the condo and make sure they were asleep, a Mexican official told CNN. Saturday's pre-dawn operation that captured Guzman in the Mexican Pacific resort town of Mazatlan marked a dramatic twist in a case that has long captivated the country and frustrated investigators on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. The notorious Sinaloa cartel leader's nickname, which means ""Shorty,"" belies the tall and near-mythic status Guzman achieved in recent years for his ability to elude capture by using bribes, safe houses and an army of cartel helpers. His 13 years on the lam ended Saturday inside a no-frills condo tower, where investigators found Guzman lying shirtless next to his beauty-queen wife. The Mexican official, who asked not to be identified because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said that Guzman's body guard and the drug lord's 2-year-old twin daughters were also sleeping in the condo. ""He had an AK-47 next to the bed. When the Mexican marines entered the condominium, he was still asleep,"" said Michael Vigil, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who says he was briefed on the raid. ""They used the element of surprise, and he did not have a chance to react and seize his weapon."" Escape through sewer tunnels . Guzman had an assault rifle and ammunition close by when Mexican marines broke into the apartment in a ""surgical"" operation, the Mexican official said. Authorities had been closing in on Guzman for months before Mexican marines swooped in, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam told reporters. Earlier police operations yielded a trove of intelligence, including cell phone and other data, a U.S. law enforcement official said. That helped Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents hunting Guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him. Before Guzman's capture, Mexican federal forces made several significant arrests of Sinaloa cartel associates, including two people authorities said were suspected of providing security for top leaders of the cartel. A key discovery earlier this month marked a turning point in the investigation: seven houses in the Mexican city of Culiacan, connected by secret tunnels that also tied in with the city's sewage system. Mario Hidalgo Arguello, a courier who flipped during questioning by Mexican authorities, told interrogators about the series of safe houses, according to U.S. officials familiar with the hunt for Guzman. When authorities raided one of them last week, it turned out to be Guzman's main residence in the town of Culiacan. The time it took Mexican marines to get past the house's reinforced steel doors was enough to allow Guzman to escape via a hidden hatch under a bathtub, the officials said. ""But the investigation was so thorough that we continued,"" Murillo said. With authorities temporarily off his trail, Guzman slipped out of Culiacan through the sewer tunnels, the Mexican official told CNN. Eventually he made his way to Mazatlan, a beach resort city about 125 miles (200 km) away. Informants and wiretaps . Months before authorities nabbed him there, U.S. authorities made a major break in the case. In November, they arrested Serafin Zambada-Ortiz at the Nogales, Arizona, border crossing. He is the son of Guzman's closest lieutenant, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, likely the Sinaloa chief's heir apparent. The arrests intensified in recent months, with each providing phones that led to a trove of new data that helped map associates in ever-closer touch with Guzman, U.S. officials familiar with the hunt said. Agents from the DEA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Marshals Service have fed intelligence gleaned from wiretaps and informants to Mexican authorities for years. Each cell phone led to dozens of others over time. ""It went from phone to phone, just basic law enforcement,"" one of the U.S. officials said. In recent months, investigators focused on five wiretaps -- four operated by the DEA and one by ICE, which yielded valuable intelligence, the officials said.​ As the hunt intensified, Guzman and his lieutenants stopped using certain phones, apparently aware of the surveillance. In the final days, the ICE wiretap was the only one still producing activity, the officials said. Captured alongside Guzman was Carlos Manuel Hoo-Ramirez, who U.S. authorities say appeared to serve as ""El Chapo's"" communications conduit. He carried multiple phones that proved crucial to finding the drug boss, the officials said. Hunt marked by rumors, close calls . Ever since his escape in a laundry cart from Mexico's Puente Grande prison in 2001, the hunt for Guzman has grabbed headlines. During the drug lord's nearly 13 years on the lam, rumors swirled about his whereabouts. From time to time, investigators suggested they were hot on his trail. But even as Mexico stepped up its pressure on cartels, he remained an elusive target. Many in the country suggested that his whereabouts were an open secret -- and that the government must have been deliberately steering clear of capturing him. In 2009, the archbishop of Mexico's Durango state told reporters that Guzman lived near the mountain town of Guanacevi. ""Everyone knows it, except the authorities,"" he said. Days later, investigators found the bodies of two slain army lieutenants in Durango's mountains, accompanied by a note: ""Neither the government nor priests can handle El Chapo."" A year later, when asked by reporters again about Guzman's whereabouts, the archbishop said, ""He is omnipresent. ... He is everywhere."" In 2012, a Mexican official told the Associated Press that authorities nearly caught Guzman in a raid on a beach mansion in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, barely a day after Hillary Clinton had met with other foreign ministers from across the hemisphere in the same resort town. Last year, Guatemalan authorities said a man who resembled Guzman died in Peten, Guatemala, during a shootout. Later, they changed their story and said Guzman wasn't killed and the shootout may never even have happened. Family still in spotlight . While Guzman managed to avoid authorities' attention, the wrath of his rivals and the media's glare, other members of his family weren't so lucky. Authorities arrested Guzman's brother, known as ""El Pollo"" (The Chicken), in Mexico City in September 2001. Three years later, he was shot to death by a fellow inmate in a maximum-security prison. Legend has it that ""El Chapo"" Guzman was also once arrested in Mexico's capital, according to an account in Malcolm Beith's book ""The Last Narco: Inside the Hunt for El Chapo, the World's Most Wanted Drug Lord."" ""At the police station, he lifted up a suitcase and put it on the desk of the capital's chief of police,"" Beith writes. ""Inside was $50,000 in cash; within minutes, Chapo was out the door."" Members of a rival cartel gunned down Edgar Beltran Guzman, one of El Chapo's sons, in a Mexican shopping mall parking lot in 2008. Police found more than 500 bullet casings at the scene. Last year, authorities arrested Guzman's father-in-law in Sonora, Mexico, charging him with drug-related crimes. But not all of the focus on Guzman's family has been tied to organized crime. In September 2011, word eked out that Guzman's beauty-queen wife, Emma Coronel -- a citizen of both the United States and Mexico -- had given birth to twin girls at a hospital in Lancaster, California. About a year later, authorities arrested Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar, one of El Chapo's daughters, at a border crossing in San Ysidro, California. She was deported back to Mexico several months later. Her attorneys said she was pregnant and had been coming to the United States to have a baby.","During raid, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman had an AK-47 next to his bed .

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year, Roge Agujero's family went back to the plot of land near the sea where their house once stood. ""We did not see anything, not even a single post,"" he said. INTERACTIVE: See the latest satellite and path of the storm . The ferocious storm had obliterated the building where more than a dozen of Agujero's family members lived, one of thousands of homes destroyed in the area around the Philippine city of Tacloban. Entire neighborhoods were smashed into tangled heaps of debris. More than 6,000 people were killed. Agujero's family has spent much of the past year rebuilding their house, taking pains to make it sturdier than its wooden predecessor by using concrete. The work isn't finished, but a new threat is already on the horizon. Another powerful storm, Typhoon Hagupit, is approaching the Philippines from the same part of the western Pacific Ocean as Haiyan did 13 months ago. On Friday morning local time, the storm was downgraded from a super typhoon to a typhoon, but is still packing potentially devastating winds. For residents of Tacloban and the surrounding region, the parallels between the two storms are deeply unsettling. ""I'm more than nervous because I have experienced what Yolanda brought,"" 23-year-old Agujero said, using the Filipino name for Haiyan. ""I don't know what will happen next after another super typhoon."" Life in Tacloban's 'danger zones,' one year on from Typhoon Haiyan . Exact path uncertain . It's not yet clear exactly what path Hagupit will take. Some forecasts have it on a similar path to Haiyan, crashing into the central region around Tacloban over the weekend. National authorities warn that about 44 provinces may be in Hagupit's potential path -- home to about 35 million people, reported CNN affiliate 9News. Typhoon Hagupit, also know nationally in the Philippines as Ruby, had sustained winds of up to 143 miles per hour (231 kilometers per hour) as of Friday morning, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council anticipates heavy rainfall from 7.5 to 20 millimeters per hour. Many local residents around Tacloban aren't taking any chances. Long lines were reported Thursday at supermarkets, ATMs and gas stations as people stocked up on supplies. The local government and relief organizations have begun putting emergency preparation plans into action. ""Unlike last year, there are a lot of UN agencies and INGO partners on the ground in Tacloban and other cities ... ready to provide support and assistance,"" said Maulid Warfa, chief of UNICEF's office in Tacloban, referring to international non-governmental organizations. Local people also appear to be more attuned to the potential risks. As Haiyan bore down on Tacloban last year, a lot of residents didn't hear or heed government warnings to relocate from coastal areas. Some of them pointed to the blazing sun in the sky the day before the storm hit as proof that there was no need to be concerned, Agujero said. Haiyan's massive storm surge caught many of them in their homes as it roared in off the Gulf of Leyte, splintering buildings and tossing large ships onto dry land. One year after Typhoon Haiyan: Resilience rebuilds the Philippines . Evacuations under way . The sun was high in the sky once more Thursday, but Agujero said nobody trusts it now. He's working for the humanitarian group Catholic Relief Services and has already warned his family, whose youngest member is only a month old, to evacuate from their half-built house near the water in the town of Palo to a school building safely inland. His relatives all survived Haiyan by taking shelter in a chapel, including his octogenarian grandmother who can't walk anymore because of a stroke and had to be carried. But some of them, including his brothers and father, left it late to get out of the house before it was swept away, he said. And Agujero himself was hit on the head by falling debris and had to be rescued from the flooded ground floor of a convent where he'd gone to volunteer his help. The lines of communication to carry warnings to residents appear better established than last year. Are you there? Share photos, video if you can safely . The local government has identified 21 evacuation centers around the city and has started the evacuation of people already, UNICEF's Warfa said, adding that the number of evacuation centers is expected to increase. Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez, whose waterfront house was destroyed by Haiyan, wasn't available for comment Thursday. Tens of thousands of people in Tacloban are still living in coastal areas designated as danger zones by authorities. Officials say a shortage of temporary housing and other problems over the past year have prevented them from permanently relocating most residents of the communities at risk. Those areas look set to be vulnerable once again as Hagupit -- known locally as ""Ruby"" -- draws near. Panoramic photo shows Haiyan devastation . Strength of Category 5 hurricane . ""Even in the best case scenario, we're going to have very heavy winds and rain"" that bring the risk of flooding, said Renee Lambert, the head of the Catholic Relief Services office in Tacloban. The sense of unease among residents was palpable, she said, with some stores closing and roads appearing quieter. ""I certainly see the city hunkering down,"" Lambert said. The storm is the equivalent of a strong Category 5 hurricane, according to the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. With Hagupit's precise path still uncertain, Philippine authorities issued storm warnings for 56 of the country's 81 provinces, covering around 70% of the country's population of 100 million, CNN affiliate 9news reported. Agujero said he hoped that the Tacloban region would be spared this time around. His biggest concern, he said, was for his family. He was less concerned about their unfinished home. ""If the house gets destroyed again, we can still rebuild it,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A recent college graduate is suing her alma mater for $72,000 -- the full cost of her tuition and then some -- because she cannot find a job. Trina Thompson has sued her alma mater, Monroe College of New York. Trina Thompson, 27, of the Bronx, graduated from New York's Monroe College in April with a bachelor of business administration degree in information technology. On July 24, she filed suit against the college in Bronx Supreme Court, alleging that Monroe's ""Office of Career Advancement did not help me with a full-time job placement. I am also suing them because of the stress I have been going through."" The college responded that it offers job-search support to all its students. In her complaint, Thompson says she seeks $70,000 in reimbursement for her tuition and $2,000 to compensate for the stress of her three-month job search. As Thompson sees it, any reasonable employer would pounce on an applicant with her academic credentials, which include a 2.7 grade-point average and a solid attendance record. But Monroe's career-services department has put forth insufficient effort to help her secure employment, she claims. ""They're supposed to say, 'I got this student, her attendance is good, her GPA is all right -- can you interview this person?' They're not doing that,"" she said. Thompson said she has fulfilled her end of the job-search bargain, peppering companies listed on Monroe's e-recruiting site with cover letters, résumés and phone calls. But no more than two employers have responded to her outreach, and those leads have borne no fruit. Her complaint adds, ""The office of career advancement information technology counselor did not make sure their Monroe e-recruiting clients call their graduates that recently finished college for an interview to get a job placement. They have not tried hard enough to help me."" She suggested that Monroe's Office of Career Advancement shows preferential treatment to students with excellent grades. ""They favor more toward students that got a 4.0. They help them more out with the job placement,"" she said. iReport.com: ""Don't sue your alma mater"" Monroe College released a statement saying that ""while it is clear that no college, especially in this economy, can guarantee employment, Monroe College remains committed to working with all its students, including Ms. Thompson, who graduated only three months ago, to prepare them for careers and to support them during their job search."" Thompson says she has not hired an attorney to represent her because she cannot afford one. When she filed her complaint, she also filed a ""poor person order,"" which exempts her from filing fees associated with the lawsuit. Asked whether she would advise other college graduates facing job woes to sue their alma maters, Thompson said yes. ""It doesn't make any sense: They went to school for four years, and then they come out working at McDonald's and Payless. That's not what they planned."" CNN's Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","Monroe College graduate says career office didn't help her with job placement .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard promised a ""thorough review"" Friday after a training exercise intended to have been ""normal"" and ""low profile"" wound up instead triggering concerns about the security of the president on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. U.S. Coast Guard vessels participate in a training exercise Friday on the Potomac River. ""We are going to take a good, hard look at what we did here today and ensure that, if we need to modify procedures, if we need to modify communications, we will do so in the future,"" Vice Adm. John Currier of the Coast Guard said. The incident began shortly before 10 a.m., when CNN journalists monitoring video from a Washington TV station saw Coast Guard vessels apparently trying to keep another vessel from passing. The Coast Guard vessels were moving rapidly in the water as the president's motorcade drove on the nearby Memorial Bridge, after a September 11 commemoration event at the Pentagon. In a Coast Guard radio transmission audible over police scanners monitored by CNN, a voice could be heard saying, ""You're approaching a Coast Guard security zone. ... If you don't stop your vessel, you will be fired upon. Stop your vessel immediately."" Later, someone could be heard saying ""bang, bang, bang, bang"" and ""we have expended 10 rounds."" CNN called the Coast Guard immediately after the initial reports suggesting possible trouble in the water; a spokeswoman said she had no information about activity in that area. Over the next 20 to 25 minutes, CNN made several phone calls and sent several e-mails to the USCG spokeswoman, asking for information. The spokeswoman said she was attempting to get information but was not able to get any. After CNN heard the radio transmission saying 10 rounds had been expended, CNN went to air with the story. At 10:23 a.m. ET, after CNN had aired its initial report, the spokeswoman said that she had heard the incident may have been an exercise but that she did not know the source of that information. At 11:09 a.m., CNN received a Coast Guard e-mail confirming that it was a training exercise. The Coast Guard said that a training frequency had been used for communication. Currier said that such radio transmissions generally begin with an announcement that they are training exercises but added that he did not know whether that was done in this case.  Watch as Currier describes a ""normal training exercise"" » . Officials said that no shots were fired and that the radio announcements were a standard part of the exercise. Other agencies, including the Secret Service, which protects the president, had not been notified of the exercise in advance. The Secret Service said Obama had returned to the White House by the time reports surfaced of possible shots fired in the area.  Watch how the exercise on the Potomac stirs up commotion » . Federal agency emergency operations centers were neither aware of nor notified about the exercise and began implementing response procedures as though it had been a real event, a federal source said. The report led officials at Reagan National Airport to ground flights from 10:08 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., said Diane Spitaliere of the Federal Aviation Administration. The FBI, upon hearing media reports, dispatched agents who had reached the water's edge before they learned from other law enforcement agencies that the incident was an exercise, said Supervisory Special Agent Katherine Schweit, a spokeswoman for the Washington Field Office. The Metropolitan Police Department Harbor Patrol, which is responsible for patrolling the Potomac, was not notified either, law enforcement sources in Washington said. The patrol has now demanded that the Coast Guard notify it in before carrying out any training exercises on the Potomac, the sources said. Currier said such exercises take place four times a week, and other agencies are generally not informed. Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, was critical of the way the exercise was handled. ""The anxiety caused by this situation on such a solemn day is extremely disturbing,"" he said in a statement, adding that he would like to hear from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. ""It sounds very much like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing."" Military Families United, an advocacy group, called for an investigation. The incident was ""at the height of irresponsibility,"" the group said in a statement, adding that whoever commissioned it ""should be held accountable."" ""These families have traveled from all over the country to convene at the Pentagon on this tragic anniversary, and this training exercise not only caused unwarranted stress for these families but it was a distraction from the purpose of today. ... This kind of incompetence and insensitivity cannot be permissible and should be addressed at the highest levels of government."" Frances Townsend, a CNN contributor and homeland security adviser under former President George W. Bush, called the incident an act of ""felony stupidity."" The Coast Guard said in its statement, ""The best way that we in the Coast Guard can remember September 11 and our security obligations to the nation is to be always ready and this requires constant training and exercise. To ensure the appropriate readiness posture we conduct training scenarios across the nation on a daily basis."" Asked whether the Coast Guard's action was appropriate, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said, ""That's a decision that's made by the Coast Guard."" He said he saw no parallels to an incident in April, when a plane resembling Air Force One flew low over New York as part of a government-sanctioned promotional photo shoot. The incident triggered security fears and angered the White House. Regarding Friday's incident, Gibbs instead criticized the media -- specifically CNN, which reported the incident as it was unfolding. ""I think, it appears as if a lot of this might have been avoided,"" he said, referring to what was ""on television."" Expressing frustration, he said to a CNN correspondent, ""It's not directed at you, just writ large at CNN."" ""If anybody was unnecessarily alarmed based on erroneous reporting that denoted that shots had been fired, I think everybody is, uh, everybody is apologetic of that,"" Gibbs said. In a statement, CNN said, ""Given the circumstances, it would have been irresponsible not to report on what we were hearing and seeing. As with any breaking news story, information is often fluid, and CNN updated the story with the official explanation from the Coast Guard as soon as it was provided.""","Coast Guard will ""take a good, hard look"" at handling of exercise, official says .

"In the space of just 48 hours last week, Turkey went from calling the PYD -- the Kurds defending the Syrian border town of Kobani -- a terrorist group to opening up an arms corridor from Iraq to aid its fight against ISIS. That dramatic change in policy, along with growing collaboration between the United States and the PYD (the armed wing of the Democratic Union Party), could tip a month-long battle against ISIS militants in favor of the Kurds. It could also, finally, pave the way for a resolution between Turkey and the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the Turkish state. This would remove a major irritant in the coalition's strategy in Syria. Turkish leaders in Ankara resisted domestic and international pressure to aid the PYD for a month while Kobani became the focal point of the operation against ISIS. Turkey's Kurds took to the streets to demonstrate against what they saw as the government's refusal to protect their kin next door. In reaction to President Erdogan's indifference to the prospect of the massacre of Kurds at the hands of the Islamic State, the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said that if the town fell he would end the peace negotiations with Ankara that have been in progress since 2012. With help arriving from the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga and the United States, the prospect of losing Kobani is no longer imminent. The Turkish government can breathe a sigh of relief, but not for long. Washington's decision to help the PYD militarily marks the emergence of a new alliance at a time when Turkey has already been unnerved by the recent diplomatic boost the group has received in the West. In response to the growing Islamic State threat, the PKK, the Peshmerga, and the PYD have established a united Kurdish front, with the PYD militants coming to the aid of Peshmerga fighters and halting the jihadi group's advance into the autonomous region of northern Iraq. PYD forces helped thousands of Yazidis escape from the western part of the region as ISIS attacked, making the group the West's best hope for on-the-ground troops and winning it positive reviews in the Western media. Since the PKK started its assault against the Islamic State in northern Iraq, there has been a lot of talk in Western capitals about removing it from the terror list. The U.S. move to openly ally with the PYD only adds to Turkey's fears. But if Turkey's leaders manage to look beyond their long-running Kurdish phobia, they could turn the PYD-U.S. dialogue to their advantage. The PKK, with its new international legitimacy and the alliance the United States forged with its Syrian offshoot, is unlikely to put these gains at risk by resuming violence against Turkey. For Turkey, the Kurdish issue is more than a domestic security problem; its concern over Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria has diminished its room for maneuver and has kept it from playing an effective role both in the anti-Assad and the anti-Islamic State coalition. Turkey has already been marginalized in regional affairs due to other foreign policy miscalculations, and it cannot afford to miss out on a seat at the table on Syria because of its reservations about the PYD. Turkey shares a long border with Syria, hosts 1.6 million Syrian refugees, and has historical ties to Syria's ethnic and sectarian communities. Home to well-established Salafi networks, Turkey is one of the countries most vulnerable to attacks by the Islamic State. It is thus in Ankara's interest to treat the peace process with the PKK more urgently so that it can attend to these pressing matters. Nevertheless, Turkey's policies still prioritize undercutting the Kurds over any other concern.  Its policies are largely to blame for the Syrian Kurds' failure to join the Western backed Syrian opposition, and it has been dragging its feet to join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State because it views ISIS as an effective fighting force not just against the Assad regime, but also against the PYD. A U.S.-PYD-Turkish partnership, however, could work toward the removal of the Assad regime, which Ankara says is its top priority in Syria. Turkey has criticized the U.S.-led coalition for prioritizing the removal of ISIS without addressing the root cause of the problem: the regime in Damascus. The United States, however, could engage the PYD in pursuing both objectives. With the right push from Washington and Ankara, the Syrian Kurds, with their secular bent and effective fighting force, could become part of the ground force that the West so desperately needs in Syria. The United States has taken a positive step in reconsidering its approach vis-à-vis the PYD.  At a time when the lingering Kurdish issue has caused Turkey to become marginalized in the fight against ISIS, both the PKK and Ankara would be well-served if they took steps to advance the stalled peace process. Let's hope the U.S. and Turkish decisions to help the PYD are more than tactical moves.READ MORE: Meet America's newest allies, Syria's KurdsREAD MORE: Peshmerga fighters  'to enter Kobani soon'","Turkey has switched from calling Kurdish PYD fighters terrorists to supporting them .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Shivering in pain and calling for her mother, Shamsia's hands shake uncontrollably, her eyes swollen shut and her skin peeling from terrible acid burns. Shamsia and Atifa remain determined to get their education despite the attacks. The 19-year-old was heading to school along with her 16-year-old sister, Atifa, in Kandahar, Afghanistan. It was a warm November morning last year and their only anxiety was being late for class. ""We saw two men up ahead staring at us. One was standing off and the other one was on their motorcycle. I wanted to go but there was a black object in his hand and he took it out,"" Atifa says. The girls thought it was a water pistol.  Watch acid attack in Afghanistan » . ""He grabbed my arm and asked, 'Will you be going to school anymore?' He then threw acid on my sister and threw acid on me,"" Shamsia says. They weren't the only ones attacked that day. Several other teachers and students were targeted on their way to Meir Weis Mena School in Kandahar, the nation's third-largest city and one where the Taliban have long been influential. Atifa was burned so badly that her red scarf melted onto her dark brown hair. Parents were so frightened that many students were kept at home for weeks afterward. It's not the first time girls in Afghanistan have been targeted for attending school. The Taliban have been responsible for dozens of attacks on girls' schools and female teachers, but even they condemned this attack. Kandahar was the headquarters for the Taliban during its five-year rule of Afghanistan and was home to Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar. During that time, girls were forbidden to attend school. If they tried to get an education, they risked beatings by the religious police, or worse. Parents and family members were threatened, and sometimes killed, for allowing their girls the chance to be educated. Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the Afghan government has tried to extend access to education, with some success. About 6 million children attend schools throughout the country, 2 million of whom are girls, according to government figures. The case of Shamsia and Atifa gained national and international attention. See how you can help . ""A real man would never throw acid on the face of a little girl, a real man wouldn't even want to make a little girl unhappy,"" Afghan President Hamid Karzai said shortly after the attack. ""Beside it being a cowardly act, it is an un-Islamic act."" Laura Bush, the first lady of the United States at the time who advocated for the education of girls in Afghanistan, called the attacks a ""cowardly and shameful"" act. ""My heart goes out to the victims and their families as they recover from this cruel attack,"" she said. A few weeks after the attacks, the story took a strange turn. The governor of Kandahar announced that 10 men had been arrested and some had confessed. But none was seen until a video made by Afghan Intelligence was released by the Interior Ministry, and aired on Afghan State Television in late December. One of the accused, Jalil, said in the video that a major in the ISI, or Pakistani intelligence unit, approached him and offered him the equivalent of $2,000 for each attack. ""He told me I will give 200,000 Pakistani rupees for a teacher's death, 500,000 for burning a school, and 100,000 for throwing acid on a schoolgirl,"" Jalil said,  seeming frightened and agitated as he looked into the camera. He said the major gave him a letter for the Pakistani Consulate in Kandahar, where he received the money. But President Karzai seemed intent on defusing any tensions with Pakistan stirred by the release of the video. During a news conference earlier this month in Kabul with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, Karzai said that in this case, Pakistan displayed real cooperation to find the culprit. In the past, Karzai has often accused Pakistani officials of being involved in terrorism in Afghanistan and supporting the Taliban. ""For the first time, we had a very sincere and brotherly approach to the issue, which is of satisfaction to us and I hope we can succeed together,"" Karzai said. Pakistani officials tell CNN that the claims about the consulate's involvement are ""hogwash."" For once, the attacks have not set off tit-for-tat accusations between the Afghan and Pakistani governments, as both countries deal with the extremists working to keep girls from getting an education. None of the men who appeared on the video has had his day in court. The victims have their own ideas for justice. ""Their punishment should be that they should have acid thrown on their faces in front of me. Just like they threw acid on me, we should throw acid on them,"" Shamsia says. But her greatest revenge, she says, is an education. When asked if she would stop attending school, Shamsia was quick with her response. ""Why wouldn't I want to come to school? I want our country to persevere. I have to do something for my country, I must go to school.""","Shamsia and Atifa were attacked with acid on their way to school in November .

"(CNN)The police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, is expected to step down as part of the effort by city officials to reform the police department, according to government officials familiar with the ongoing discussions between local, state and federal officials. But Chief Thomas Jackson and the city's mayor say the reports aren't true. Under the proposed plan, after Jackson leaves, city leadership would ask the St. Louis County police chief to take over management of Ferguson's police force. The announcement could come as soon as next week. It would be one step in what local officials hope will help reduce tensions in the city as the public awaits a decision on whether the St. Louis County grand jury will bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. ""The animosity that existed in Ferguson were way before Mike Brown's shooting, justified or not. So, unfortunately, the leadership in the police department has to change,"" said CNN legal analyst Mark O' Mara. ""And if he's sort of a sacrificial lamb to get this started, it's going to have to be. Ferguson's going to have to more forward. And it doesn't seem they can move forward with this police chief in place."" Jackson said Tuesday he is not being pushed out. ""Nobody in my chain of command has asked me to resign, nor have I been terminated,"" he said on the phone to CNN. And Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said there is no plan in place for the police chief to step down. When asked whether the federal government was pressuring the city to force out the police chief, he told CNN: ""People have been saying that for months, I mean for him to step down. But we've stood by him this entire time. So there is no change on that."" The St. Louis suburb drew national attention after protests erupted following Wilson's shooting of Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed African-American. Wilson, who is white, hasn't been charged in the case, though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment. CNN analyst Michael Smerconish think Jackson's removal, if true, is indication that the grand jury may decide not to indict the officer. ""To me this is all calibrated and intended to take the temperature down of the community,"" Smerconish said. ""I'm absolutely convinced we're headed for no indictment in this case. Jackson had faced criticism over his department's handling of the Brown shooting and the protests in its aftermath. Last month, weeks after the Justice Department announced it was investigating Ferguson police, Jackson told CNN he would not step down despite calls for his ouster. ""I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,"" he said. ""Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through."" Speaking about his job and the fallout over the Brown shooting, he said, ""This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it."" Justice Department investigators are looking at the Ferguson Police Department's use of force, analyzing stops, searches and arrests and examining the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said. That complicates plans expressed by some officials who want to dissolve the entire Ferguson Police Department and turn over law enforcement to county police. In an interview with CNN last week, Holder said the Justice Department was looking at the leadership of the Police Department as part of its ongoing investigation of the department's practices. ""We have an ongoing -- having a practice investigation into the Ferguson Police Department.  And we're looking at a whole variety of things, including the leadership of that department, the practices that the department engages in, the nature of the interaction between the department and the community that it is supposed to serve,"" Holder said. ""So I think it's a little premature for me at this point to comment on the leadership of the Ferguson Police Department. That is certainly something that we are looking at."" Last month, Jackson released a video apology he said was directed at Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest the teen's death. ""The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the incident had sparked a larger conversation about societal issues. ""Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation. As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution,"" he said. He conceded that Ferguson and the surrounding areas have ""much work to do."" ""For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility. It's an honor to serve the city of Ferguson and the people who live there. I look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems, and once again, I deeply apologize to the Brown family,"" he said. Later that day, he waded into the crowd at a protest and apologized again. Some people seemed satisfied by his apologies. But not everyone was anxious to hear from him. One man shouted into a bullhorn: ""If you are not resigning tonight, go home."" Complete coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests . CNN's Sara Sidner, Meridith Edwards, Eliott C.

"(CNN)As one of the world's leading financial capitals, Hong Kong is a dream destination for business travelers. With more skyscrapers than any other city in the world and some of the finest dining on the planet, the city might well leave you begging for a flight cancellation so you can squeeze in an extra day. To help you enjoy a few of the city's highlights, here's a guide to getting into town, eating/sleeping well, buying the best souvenirs and leaving with an expense account you'll be proud of. Easiest, most comfortable airport transfer . Forget everything you know about subways -- Hong Kong's Airport Express train service blows away even the most jaded commuter. Trains are clean, comfortable, spacious, always on time and get you to the city in 24 minutes flat, faster than any car service can ever aspire to. Better still, the trains are easy to walk to and the procedure simple to figure out upon arrival -- there's virtually no stress about how to get tickets or where to get the trains as you exit the arrival terminal. At HK$100 per ride, trains depart at 10-minute intervals from 5:54 a.m. to 11:28 p.m. and 12-minute intervals from 11:28 p.m. to 12:48 a.m. daily. Memorable meals . There's no shortage of Michelin-starred restaurants in Hong Kong. But finding a memorable local meal you'll be thinking about for months is far more challenging. Luk Yu Teahouse has it all: a historic art deco-inspired feel, waiters that have stuck by the place through decades, killer Cantonese food not found anywhere else, a glamorous clientele and a storied past that includes a mob hit in the dining room. You'll have to get here early for a breakfast of old fashioned dim sum, such as duck and chestnut pastry. Luk Yu Teahouse, Luk Yu Building, 24-26 Stanley St. Central; +852 2523 1970 . Centrally located room with a view . For a true home-away-from-home feel, the penthouse suites at The Upper House are a good call. With more than 180 square meters of understated elegance, wraparound views of Hong Kong and a spa-inspired bathroom, this is the ultimate city stay. Bonus feature: the chance of bumping into a celebrity in the elevators. The Upper House, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Admiralty; +852 2918 1838 . Where to get a unique addition to your wardrobe . Hong Kong's fashion design scene is young, eclectic and fun. A place to get a taste of it is K11 Mall, dubbed an ""Art Mall"" for its support of Chinese contemporary art and reputable gallery in the basement. The mall houses local designer brands, and offers its own curated selection of designer products at the K11 Design Store. K11, 18 Hanoi Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon; +852 3118 8070 . Where to take a killer photo . Sure, you could ride the historic Peak Tram with the tourists and snap a great photo of Hong Kong at the top of Victoria Peak -- it's foolproof. But you could also join local hikers (of which there are many) to walk up Lion Rock Peak for the most incredible sweeping panorama of Kowloon, all surrounded by pristine nature. Experience the heart of the city . To see Hong Kong, past and present, in a walkable nutshell, head to the Central and Sheung Wan Districts. Some of the oldest parts of the city, with crumbling colonial-era tenement buildings and decades-old shops, can be found in these areas. Gentrifying comfortably, Soho and ""Poho"" (the neighborhood between Po Hing Fong and Hollywood Road) areas offer thoughtful eateries and unpretentious boutiques. General directions: Keep walking west on Queen's Road Central, or the parallel Hollywood Road. Graham Street is where things start to get interesting. Classy, easy-to-pack souvenir . Some of the best memories visitors take away from Hong Kong are centered on food. To take a little bit of local flavor home, you can pick up a couple jars of XO sauce. Every restaurant worth its reputation will have its own secret recipe for the mildly spicy local condiment made from dried and often precious seafood, as well as Chinese ham. We love the one at the Mandarin Oriental Cake Shop ($35/small, $45/large jar).

"The Illinois Senate passed a measure Thursday to legalize same-sex marriage, voting 34-21. The state House will consider it next. Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat, has indicated he would sign the bill. Illinois would be the 10th state, plus the District of Columbia, to legalize same-sex marriage, according to Lambda Legal, a gay rights organization. Three other states are considering similar legalization, said Camilla Taylor, marriage project director for Lambda Legal. A bill has passed the Rhode Island House and been sent to the Senate.

"(CNN) -- Despite the retail madness of Black Friday, small businesses traditionally see little difference in their sales. Bookstore owner Laura Keys actually recalls losing revenue last holiday season after Target, Wal-Mart and Amazon battled each other in a price war over last season's hardcovers. ""People are concentrating on malls and stores for the big deals,"" said Keys, owner of Blue Elephant Book Shop, an independent business in Decatur, Georgia. ""We aren't exactly the focus of activity when everyone is looking for great deals on flat-screen TVs."" According to Cinda Baxter, American Express retail expert and former small business owner, Black Friday has evolved to exclude smaller merchants. ""Since the big-box businesses came in with such financial strength in the last decade ... it's been impossible for independent businesses to compete."" To boost small business sales, American Express held its first-ever Small Business Saturday, where consumers are encouraged to spend locally. Baxter said Small Business Saturday is an opportunity for American Express to flex its financial muscle to help out local economies. ""This is our way of working together ... to bring consumers back together with the independent businesses."" According to Civics Economics, analysis and strategic planning consultants based out of Austin, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois, 68 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays within the community. Big retail chains keep 46 cents of every dollar within the community, the company says. With online purchases, unless the product is shipped to the same ZIP Code as its origin, the local community keeps none of the profits, said Baxter. To motivate consumers, American Express gave a $25 credit to 100,000 card members who register their card and use it to shop on Small Business Saturday. American Express also gave $100 worth of Facebook advertising to 10,000 business owners who signed up to participate on Facebook. Despite Small Business Saturday's widespread publicity, some small business merchants such as New York boutique owner Ronen Jehezkel had not ever heard of the program. And although some retailers knew of Small Business Saturday, few reported noticeable sales increases. Keys said two customers made purchases at her store on behalf of Small Business Saturday. ""Our sales are up today for a normal Saturday. It's hard to identify exactly why but I think [Small Business Saturday] may be having some influence."" In Scituate, Massachusetts, toy store owner Jerry Burke saw little, if any, difference to clientele. ""It's a busy Saturday this weekend regardless, but it didn't feel significantly busier because of Small Business Saturday."" Yet, Baxter said that the annual Small Business Saturday is just the beginning of American Express' effort to build up small businesses. The company plans to introduce more local business-building initiatives. ""We want to make sure the independent business owner has a stake in the game again,"" she said. ""This is the way to do it.""","Program intended to boost local businesses .

"(CNN) -- Police tentatively identified remains found on a remote farm as the Virginia Tech student who disappeared in October during a Metallica concert. Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old education major, went to the concert at the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia, on October 17. She was separated from her friends and was the subject of repeated searches. Police said skeletal remains were found after 9:30 a.m. Tuesday by a farmer driving a tractor through a hay field on his 700-acre farm. The area has no public access point, police said. The farm is about 10 miles from where the concert was being held. The farm's owner, David Dass, told CNN affiliate WTVR that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard over the past week. He told WTVR that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a human skull, and my first thought was that it was Morgan Harrington,"" Dass told WTVR, adding that he immediately called 911. WTVR: State police 'confident' remains are Harrington . There was significant evidence leading police to believe that the remains are Harrington's, Virginia State Police Col. W. Steven Flaherty said, though he declined to specify what the evidence was. Police said the area where the remains were found had not been searched during the early stages of the investigation into her disappearance. The girl's parents, Dan and Gil Harrington, were in town to identify the remains, WTVR reported. Dan Harrington, in tears, told WTVR that ""this is a horrible day"" for his family. Gil Harrington expressed concerns Saturday that there was beginning to be complacency in the search, she wrote in a blog on the Web site set up to help find their daughter. On Sunday, more than three months after Morgan went missing, Gil Harrington still clung to hope. ""Despite the length of time Morgan has been gone I remain hopeful,"" she wrote. ""Part of me is waiting to be surprised. Waiting for God to pull the rabbit out of the hat and bring Morgan home. ""I remember that the light always returns, it cannot help but return. Will the light of my life return soon? I cannot imagine that all the water of Morgan's potential is to run down the drain and be wasted. Can it really play out like that?"" Now, it appears, the Harringtons finally have their answer. Police say they have now switched their focus to finding out how Morgan Harrington ended up in the remote farm and who put her there. During the concert, Harrington left her friends to use the restroom, police said. When she did not return, they called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy, police said, but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home. There are restrooms inside the arena, police said, and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside. Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone, police said. About 9:30 p.m. that night, witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, police said. No further sightings were reported. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. A friend had driven Harrington's car to the concert, she said, and was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated. Harrington was reported missing the day after the concert, when she did not show up at her parents' home to study for a math exam with her father. Working with police and the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center, the Harringtons organized community searches, saying they would not give up hope that their daughter would be found. A $150,000 reward has been offered for information leading to Harrington's whereabouts, police said. Of that, Metallica contributed $50,000. The couple was joined at a news conference after her disappearance by Ed Smart, whose daughter Elizabeth was abducted in 2002. She returned home nine months later, after police say they found her in the custody of Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child. Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt, a black miniskirt, black tights and black boots when last seen.","NEW: Man tells WTVR he found remains in area more than a mile from main roadway .

"A massive statue of Pharaoh Amenhotep III was toppled in an earthquake some 3,000 years ago. It has risen again. The 50-ton, 13-meter (42-foot) statue was unveiled on Sunday at the ancient city of Luxor, Egypt, restored to its former grandeur due to the hard work of Egyptian and German archaeologists. The same team, including noted German archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, unveiled two other massive statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in March. Sourouzian heads the temple of Amenhotep III conservation project. The latest statue to be restored depicts Amenhotep III standing tall. ""These are up to now the highest standing effigies of an Egyptian king in striding attitude,"" Sourouzian told Agence France-Presse. The temple of Amenhotep III was erected between 1390 and 1353 B.C. for the pharaoh, according to the World Monument Fund. It was 100 meters wide and 600 meters long, but only the lower sections of the structure remain. Egypt dig unearths 3,600-year-old mummy . The newly restored statues can be found at the funerary temple of Amenhotep III. They join a pair of already-famous giants at the temple known as the Colossi of Memnon -- two 16-meter images of Amenhotep III seated on his throne. The Colossi of Memnon, which mark the entrance of the temple of Amenhotep III, are the most visible remains of what was once the most richly ornamented of all Theban monuments, says the World Monument Fund. ""The temple structure was originally destroyed by earthquakes, and, since it was never fully excavated, the site was overgrown with vegetation and threatened by seasonal floods and agricultural development,"" says the organization. Pharaoh's tomb sheds light on shadowy Egyptian dynasty . Located more than 600 kilometers (370 miles) from Cairo, Luxor is divided by the Nile into two areas commonly referred to as the East and West Bank. The West Bank is home to some of Egypt's most prized ancient temples and monuments. The unveiling comes at a time when Egypt's tourism sector is fighting to pull itself out of a slump due to political instability that's lingered since the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in 2011.","Restored ancient statue of Pharaoh Amenhotep III unveiled in Luxor, Egypt .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ending a decade-long campaign led by African-American lawmakers, the House Wednesday approved and sent to President Barack Obama a measure to reduce the disparity in penalties between use of crack and powder cocaine. Under a 25-year-old law, mandatory minimum sentences involving crack cocaine -- a drug more commonly used by blacks than whites -- led to far more severe penalties than for offenses involving powder cocaine, generally preferred by whites. ""The Fair Sentencing Act will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1,"" said Congressman John Conyers, D-Michigan, who applauded the passage. Conyers said the crack mandatory sentences had pushed the number of drug offenders in federal prisons from fewer than 5,000 in 1980 to nearly 100,000 in 2009. The law drops the five-year mandatory sentence for first time offenders, and for repeat offenders with less than 28 grams of crack. Current law sets the mandatory sentence for conviction at five grams. Support for reducing the disparity with powder cocaine offenders increased with reports beginning in 2002 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission calling for Congress to change the crack cocaine law. The commission is independent agency in the  judicial branch that develops national sentencing policy  for the federal courts. The House measure, passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support, follows passage by the Senate in March. President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder had both pressed for passage of the law. ""This day was long in coming,"" said Holder. He said the bill will ""go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough, consistent, and fair."" Members of the Congressional Black Caucus had led the battle for passage for 10 years. Holder also singled out key Republicans including Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who had joined with Democrats. Conyers tipped his hat to House GOP members Dan Lungren, R-California, James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, and Ron Paul, R-Texas, for their support. Not all Republicans joined the majority, however. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee Lamar Smith, R-Texas, argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake. ""Reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused Congress to act in the first place,"" Smith said. ""Crack cocaine is associated with a greater degree of violence than most other drugs. And more than any other drug, the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions,"" Smith said. The White House is expected to schedule a presidential signing ceremony within a month.","A 25-year-old law set mandatory minimum sentences in crack cocaine cases .

"Paris, France -- A bomb threat that led authorities to use sniffer dogs to inspect the Eiffel Tower and surrounding areas Tuesday turned out to have been a hoax, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported, citing police. The police press office said the telephone threat was reported at 8:20 p.m. and was treated as a routine occurrence; the tower was inspected to determine whether the threat was real. A telephoned bomb threat also led authorities to briefly evacuate the St. Michel metro station, police said, according to BFM-TV. It was reopened within 30 minutes. Some 2,000 people had been in the area of the Eiffel Tower and the park in which it sits when the evacuation was ordered, police said, according to BFM-TV. Briefly evacuated were a number a nearby apartment buildings and businesses, according to news reports. ""One person on the scene said the police came by and said there was a problem and they had to leave the area quickly, and that's what they did,"" CNN's Jim Bittermann reported. A taxi driver said he drove to the tower two tourists who were planning to eat at the Jules Verne Restaurant, where they had made reservations two months ago, but they were turned back by police. More than 100 cameras -- more than a third of which are infrared for nighttime surveillance -- are located on the monument, according to the tower's website. It also includes a network of sprinklers, and more than 150 extinguishers. A water pipe from the ground feeds hydrants on the first two floors; the top floor's hydrants get water from pressurized water tanks. The 324-meter-high (1,063-foot-high) tower is usually open from 9:30 a.m. until 11 p.m. in September. It was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1889, and was intended to last for 20 years, according to the tower's website. But it was saved by the advent of wireless telegraphy -- and its use as a platform for antennae. It currently holds 120 antennae. The tower weighs 10,100 tons and is held together by 2.5 million rivets. CNN's Pat Thompson contributed to this story.","Incident ends with nothing found .

"Washington (CNN) -- Solar panels and a solar hot water heater will soon be installed at the White House, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said Tuesday. Chu announced the conversion at the 2010 GreenGov Symposium in Washington, accompanied by Nancy Sutley, chairwoman of the Council of Environmental Quality. ""This project reflects President Obama's strong commitment to U.S. leadership in solar energy and the jobs it will create here at home,"" Chu said in a written statement released by the Energy Department. ""Deploying solar energy technologies across the country will help America lead the global economy for years to come."" By installing the solar panels on the White House, Sutley said the president is underscoring a commitment to ""lead, and the promise and importance of renewable energy in the United States."" The solar panel system, which should be installed by next spring, will convert sunlight directly to electricity, while the solar hot water heater will have a solar collector facing the sun to heat water for use in the White House residence. The Energy Department said a competitive procurement process will be used to select the company that will make the installations. This is not the first time solar energy has been tapped at the White House. Former President Jimmy Carter had solar panels installed on the roof of the White House residence during his term. They were removed during the Reagan administration. Former President George W. Bush also used solar energy to help power a maintenance building on the White House grounds, and to assist in heating the swimming pool there. The announcement comes on the one-year anniversary af an executive order signed by the president that called on the federal government to lead in the establishment of a clean energy economy.","Solar panels, solar hot water heater will be installed in the White House .

"(CNN) -- Unauthorized immigrant women do the jobs that put food on the plates of Americans, but face harassment and other challenges daily in the workplace, a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center found. The report, titled ""Injustice On Our Plates,"" is based on interviews with 150 immigrant women from Mexico, Guatemala and other Latin American countries. ""Despite their contributions to our economy, these immigrants live at the margins of U.S. society -- subsisting on poverty wages, enduring humiliation and exploitation in the workplace, and living in constant fear that their families will be shattered if they are detected,"" according to the report. The anecdotes collected by the organization provide a glimpse of the hardships faced by agricultural workers who are in the United States illegally. The women interviewed mostly said they came to the United States to seek a better life for their families, the report said. Critics of illegal immigration say those who want to work in the United States should get in line with others seeking a legal path in. Many of the women interviewed said they didn't meet any of the established criteria for obtaining a green card and so decided to cross illegally. The subjects that the report focused on worked in places such as Florida, New York, North Carolina and California. They worked picking tomatoes, lettuce, green beans, apples and other produce. ""Regardless of what sector of the food industry these women worked in, they all reported feeling like they were seen by their employers as disposable workers with no lasting value, to be squeezed of every last drop of sweat and labor before being cast aside,"" the report said. The challenges include low pay -- one woman reported that she earned $5.75 an hour, or sometimes 45 cents for each 32-pound bucket filled with tomatoes. ""You have to run to do 150 [buckets] to make your money for the day,"" the woman, identified only as Maria, told interviewers. Sometimes, after two weeks of work, they would not get paid, she said. One boss wouldn't let the workers go to the bathroom, she said. Farmworkers are also exposed to harmful pesticides that can cause birth defects, the report said. According to the report, about six in 10 of America's farmworkers are unauthorized immigrants. Of the total illegal immigrant population, women are estimated to make up 4 million. Another woman interviewed for the study, Olivia, told how she was raped by one of her supervisors. Sexual violence and harassment is widely reported by unauthorized female immigrants, the report said. ""Sexual predators view farmworker women and other undocumented women as 'perfect victims' because they are isolated, thought to lack credibility, generally do not know their rights, and may be vulnerable because they lack legal status,"" the study said. A majority of the women interviewed by the center reported facing sexual harassment at work. The report's recommendations included enacting comprehensive immigration reform that provide a path for legalization. Such efforts in Congress have been unsuccessful in the past. The center also recommends tightening labor laws for agricultural producers.","The Southern Poverty Law Center finds that immigrant women face daily challenges .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Pointing to a graphic of a spider's silk-spinning organ projected on a giant screen, scientist Cheryl Hayashi said, ""That's the business end of a spider,"" drawing laughs from hundreds in the TED2010 conference audience. ""Hey don't laugh, that's my life."" Hayashi held the audience's attention with a passionate talk about her fascination with spiders even though they ""jostle with rats and snakes for the title of the most despised animal."" There are 40,000 described species of spiders and Hayashi is endlessly absorbed with them, particularly with the fact that they generate an amazing variety of silk which can be used for many of their purposes -- and ours. Spider silk, she said, could potentially be used for medicine in the form of artificial tendons, guides for regrowing nerves and scaffold for tissue growth and even body armor that could be more lightweight and flexible than any in use now. When she decodes new information about spiders in her lab at the University of California at Riverside, she said, ""it's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me. That's why I'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spiders."" Hayashi isn't alone. TED,  which stands for  Technology, Entertainment, Design, is a nonprofit dedicated to ""ideas worth spreading."" TED2010 has featured speaker after speaker for whom their subject matter is their life's work. And not just on stage -- audience members are taking turns giving their own five minute talks on subjects that obsess them and volunteering their thoughts on a wide range of issues in casual conversations in the conference's elaborately fashioned social spaces, where espresso bars and racks of organic snacks co-exist with promotional messages for the corporate sponsors. Check out CNN's tech blog for TED2010 updates . To the strains of Jackie DeShannon's recording of ""What the World Needs Now,"" the conference theme, the presentations began Wednesday before an audience of 1,500 and hundreds of others watching via simulcast from Palm Springs, California. Prominent names from London, England, and Washington were represented. In a surprise appearance, British Conservative Party leader David Cameron, who's the odds-on favorite to become prime minister if his party holds its lead in this spring's election, sketched a plan for improving government without spending more money by increasing transparency, choice and accountability. And Valerie Plame Wilson, the former CIA agent whose identity was leaked, presented the case for controlling nuclear weapons before terrorists are able to explode a device in one of the world's cities. Here are 10 big ideas from TED2010, which concludes Saturday: . $60K a year can make you happy . Psychologist and Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman says millions of dollars won't buy you happiness, but a job that pays $60,000 a year might help. Happiness levels increase up to the $60K mark, but ""above that it's a flat line,"" he said. ""Money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery,"" he said. But the real trick, Kahneman said, is to spend time with people you like. Save the world through games . Jane McGonigal, a game designer, says playing online video games gives people ""superpowers"" that help them improve the real world. We currently spend a collective 3 billion hours a week playing online games, she said, but we need to spend seven times that much time doing so to make sure we're up to real-world challenges. ""My goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games,"" she said. To do so, she develops social games that merge the real-world challenges with online gaming. Anonymity promotes honesty . Christopher ""Moot"" Poole runs one of the seedier corners of the Internet. His site, called 4chan, is known as a den of porn, hacking and anonymous rants. But Poole, a 22-year-old college student, says 4chan also protects its users privacy and promotes honest discourse. Without names in the way, people can focus on ideas, he said. ""It's anonymous and it has no memory. There's no archive. There are no barriers. There is no registration,"" he said of the site. ""That's led to this discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered."" We can end slavery . Kevin Bales, founder of a group called Free the Slaves, said he was surprised to learn slavery still existed when he read a pamphlet saying just that. Now he's on a crusade to end modern slavery, which he says is every bit as bad as the type of slavery that preceded the U.S. Civil War. Some 27 million people are enslaved today; and a person in some parts of India can be sold into slavery for about $5, he said. But awareness and action could abolish slavery for good in 25 years, he says. Moral ideas are right or wrong, not both . Writer Sam Harris -- who is perhaps best known as a stern critic of organized religion -- says we use science to prove or disprove hypotheses, and we should similarly use evidence to say some activities are moral and others are not. ""Why does every opinion have to count? Why does every culture have a point of view worth considering? Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics worth considering: No."" 'What we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day' William Li, president and medical director of The Angiogenesis Foundation, which focuses on the connection between blood vessel growth and aggressive cancers. There are 11 FDA-approved drugs that inhibit growth of blood vessels that sustain cancers, but Li pointed out that there are a number of foods and beverages that could offer substances that accomplish the same thing -- and could help prevent cancer. ""Men who consume two to three servings of cooked tomatoes per week have a 40 to 50 percent reduction in risk for prostate cancer,"" he said. Red grapes, strawberries, soybeans, dark chocolate, oranges, and green tea are among the foods with the ability to prevent blood vessel growth. The ukulele can stop war . Ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro says his traditional, Hawaiian instrument, which he learned to play at age 4, can make the world a less violent place. ""I've always believed it's the instrument of peace,"" he said, ""because if everyone played the ukulele, this would be a much more peaceful place."" Shimabukuro says people can't help but smile when they hear the two-octave, stringed instrument. He likened its tone to the sound of children laughing. $28 billion mostly wasted on placebos . Holding up bottles of herbal supplements, writer Michael Specter spoke out against what he sees as a growing rejection of science. He says it's resulted in parents refusing to vaccinate their children due to an unfounded connection to autism and people shunning genetically modified foods that have the potential of helping the world fight increasing hunger. The herbs, he said accomplish one thing: ""They darken your urine. You want to pay $28 billion for dark urine? That's OK."" 'Stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV' Elizabeth Pisani, epidemiologist who has studied drug abusers and sex workers who are involved in the spread of HIV-AIDS, said nations that have followed former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's example by creating programs to provide sterile needles to drug abusers are much more successful in curbing the spread of the disease. Nations such as the United States that have resisted such programs have seen higher spread of the disease among drug users who share needles. Every eight days, the toll of a Haiti quake . Esther Duflo, a professor in MIT's economics department, said, that every day, 25,000 children die of preventable causes, adding up every eight days to the approximate death toll of the Haiti earthquake. Though $2 billion has been pledged for the Haiti earthquake, Duflo asks why we don't make the same level of commitment to prevent the daily death toll of children. Amid the conference's many ideas, one thing is clear -- the joy speakers experienced in having a receptive audience to share their deepest thoughts and feelings. David Cameron noted that politics has been called ""show business for ugly people."" TED2010, in some ways, is summer camp for brainy ones.

"(CNN) -- A Tel Aviv district court Thursday found former Israeli president Moshe Katsav guilty of multiple charges of rape and sexual harassment. The case involved three women -- two in the president's office and one in the tourism ministry. In total, the three-judge panel found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment. Katsav left the court without saying a word, but his son defended him. ""We will continue to be proud of our father ... the whole nation will know that my father is innocent,"" said son Ariel Katsav. ""This is a difficult verdict. It is difficult for the family."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it's a ""sad day"" for Israel. ""The court today stated two clear and unequivocal messages about the equality of all before the law and about a woman's right concerning her own body, Netanyahu said in a statement. Katsav had agreed in 2007 to plead guilty to lesser charges and pay a fine to avoid jail time, but pulled out of the deal when it came time to enter his plea. The plea bargain caused a public storm in Israel, mainly because it did not include charges of rape, contrary to what had been suggested in a draft indictment. Katsav, of the center-right Likud Party, was president of Israel from 2000 to 2007. He was minister of tourism before that. The charges stem from allegations made against him in both jobs. He resigned the presidency in June 2007 because of the sexual assault allegations.","NEW: Israeli prime minister calls it a ""sad day"" for the country .

"(CNN) -- An airliner vanishes over the waters of a Southeast Asia ocean. There's no distress call, no wreckage, nothing but water and questions. So far, the story of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 sounds remarkably similar to that of Malaysia Airlines MH370, which remains missing nearly 10 months after it disappeared from radar screens on a flight between Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Beijing. But it isn't, analysts say. Here are four ways the two incidents appear to differ: . 1. There's not anywhere near as much intrigue. When MH370 disappeared, the plane's identifying transponders appeared to be intentionally shut off, its pilots stopped making radio transmissions and the airliner made a mysterious turn before possibly traveling for hours until all traces vanished. Concerns over hijackings and terror permeated that case, but so far they haven't come up in the AirAsia case. ""In this case you had normal communications with the pilot, a line of weather that appeared to be pretty difficult, severe, and he was asking to climb as high as he could to get out of it,"" said Peter Goelz, an aviation expert and former National Transportation Safety Board official. What role did weather play? 2. The water is much shallower and a commonly used shipping channel, making wreckage easier to find. The area where MH370 is believed to have gone down features extraordinarily deep water. It's also relatively mysterious -- the seabed had never been charted in some places, making getting a fix on the plane's pingers very difficult. In the AirAsia case, if the plane went down in the water, it likely rests in no more than a few hundred feet of heavily traveled ocean, making the task of locating and recovering it much simpler, analysts say. 3. Airlines and governments have learned a lot since MH370. In the hours after the Malaysia Airlines jetliner vanished in March, confusion reigned. When officials spoke at all, the information was often contradictory or confusing, and families of passengers and crew complained about how they were treated. In this case, both government and airline officials appear to be striking a more appropriate tone. Families of AirAsia flight passengers given support through the 'nightmare' AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that his ""only thought"" was the passengers and crew and pledged to do ""whatever we can."" Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein also tweeted his support: ""I will be there with you,"" he said. And the search appears to be getting off to a more efficient start. Indonesian officials quickly posted a search plan, indicating ships from its navy, as well as assets from Malaysia, Singapore and Australia, were being called to help. CNN's Will Ripley said the way Fernandes is handling the crisis is notable. ""What he's doing is something that Malaysia Airlines did not do in the initial hours, the initial days and weeks, which is being very transparent, acknowledging this is a terrible situation,"" Ripley said.

We almost certainly won't be searching for this plane in 10 months. With a more precise fix on where the plane was when it lost contact, a smaller search area and shallower seas, the airliner almost certainly will be much easier to find, said Steven Wallace, former director of the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Accident Investigations. It's ""very unlikely that we're going to see anything remotely close to what we saw with Malaysia 370,"" he said. ""It will not surprise me if this airplane is found in the next 12 hours of daylight, because they know to a fairly high degree of certainty where it was, the water is 150 feet deep as opposed to 10- or 20,000 feet deep in the Indian Ocean.""","AirAsia investigation unlikely to be as frustrating as MH370 case, analysts say .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN)For the first time since an international coalition began striking ISIS, one of its pilots has been shot down and taken captive by the Islamist extremist group. The captured F-16 pilot is Moaz al-Kasasbeh, a member of Jordan's military, according to his uncle, retired Jordanian Maj. Gen. Fahd al-Kasabeh. A source in Jordan's armed forces said that the pilot was downed carrying out a mission Wednesday around Raqqa, the militant group's de facto capital in northern Syria, according to Jordan's official PETRA news agency. ""Jordan holds the terror organization and those who support it responsible for the safety of the pilot and the preservation of his life,"" the source said. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported earlier Wednesday that ISIS had shot down an unidentified warplane near Raqqa, a city that has been a chief target in the U.S.-led military coalition's air campaign. Photos purported to be of the downed pilot appeared on an ISIS-affiliated Twitter account, images that Fahd al-Kasabeh said showed his nephew. The retired general told CNN that he'd asked Maj. Gen. Mansour S. Al Jabour, head of the Royal Jordanian Air Force, to investigate the case and take all necessary actions. Jordan part of international coalition . The international coalition has been conducting airstrike after airstrike against ISIS in Syria since September, an effort that began weeks after first going after the group in neighboring Iraq. In that period, the coalition has claimed many successful hits that have damaged the militant group. But this time, it's the coalition that has taken a hit. While the United States has been at the head of this coalition, it's relied on a number of other countries to help militarily as well as to help legitimize the effort internationally. Many nations have signed up to do so in Iraq, whose government is actively partnering with the coalition to target ISIS. But Syria has been a bit more complicated. Officials from the United States and elsewhere support moderate forces in Syria's years-long civil war trying to unseat President Bashar al-Assad, despite the fact they are both fighting against ISIS. Some Middle Eastern nations, however, have joined the United States in going after ISIS in Syria. Jordan -- which borders Syria, Iraq and Israel, and has a history of working with Washington --  has been notable among them. ISIS' grisly reputation for atrocities . One big question now becomes what ISIS does with Moaz al-Kasasbeh, now that it has him in captivity. Their track record, unfortunately, speaks for itself. The beheadings of hostages, including American journalist James Foley, was one of the things that spurred the United States to step up its fight against ISIS. Those were just some of the many atrocities blamed on the Sunni extremist group, committed during its quest to create a caliphate -- which it calls the Islamic State -- under its strict form of Sharia law.  ISIS has tried to justify its raping and enslaving of women and children, not to mention mass killings of civilians, as part of its campaign to purge ""nonbelievers."" The Jordanian military source cited by PETRA noted ISIS' past when talking about its capture of the F-16 pilot. ""It is well-known that this organization does not hide their terrorist schemes,"" the source said. ""And they have carried out many criminal acts of destruction and killing of innocent Muslims and non-Muslims in Syria and Iraq."" Journalist Hadel Ghaboun reported from Amman, Jordan, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The captured F-16 pilot's name is Moaz al-Kasasbeh, his uncle says .

"Sen. Rand Paul, a fierce critic of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance programs, will oppose the NSA reform bill in the Senate in large part because it includes an extension of the Patriot Act, a senior Paul aide said Friday. Known as the USA Freedom Act and proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the bill bans bulk collection of Americans' phone records by placing narrower limitations on government searches. Read the bill's text | Supporters . The legislation also extends the Patriot Act's sunset from June 2015 to December 2017. The Senate will vote probably next Tuesday whether to take up and begin debate on the bill. It's unclear if they'll have the votes to move forward, but with Paul's opposition, it will make it that much tougher to clear that procedural hurdle. Paul ""strongly favors reforming the NSA"" and while he may have been expected to support the current bill, a senior aide said the Kentucky Republican won't back the legislation. ""Due to significant problems with the bill, at this point he will oppose the Leahy bill,"" the aide told CNN. The aide pointed out the extension of the Patriot Act as a key issue, but declined to name other ""significant problems."" Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . The aide said that if the Patriot Act provision were dropped from the bill and if some of the reforms were strengthened, Paul would be more likely to support it. The bill's Republican sponsors include Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Dean Heller of Nevada. Democratic sponsors include Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Dick Durbin of Illinois, among others. NSA reform efforts began in earnest after former contractor Edward Snowden revealed the scope of the agency's domestic spying program last year.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has attempted to deliver humanitarian aid from an international flotilla to Gaza, but Hamas -- which controls the territory -- has refused to accept the cargo, the Israel Defense Forces said Wednesday. Palestinian sources confirmed that trucks that arrived from Israel at the Rafah terminal at the Israel-Gaza border were barred from delivering the aid. Ra'ed Fatooh, in charge of the crossings, and Jamal Khudari, head of a committee against the Gaza blockade, said Israel must release all flotilla detainees and that it will be accepted in the territory only by the Free Gaza Movement people who organized the flotilla. Israel said it had 20 trucks of aid found on the ships, such as expired medications, clothing, blankets, some medical equipment and toys. Israel has released all foreign flotilla detainees by Wednesday, but four Israeli Arabs remain in custody. Nine people died Monday when Israel intercepted an aid vessel bound for Gaza. Under Israeli policy, humanitarian aid must come through Israel and be checked by Israeli authorities who are looking to intercept smuggled weapons bound for militants aiming to attack Israel. As part of this policy Israel forbids ships from dropping off goods at Gaza ports and works to thwart smuggling via tunnels between Gaza and Egypt.","Trucks of flotilla aid halted stopped at Gaza crossing .

"In the two months since the United States and coalition allies first launched airstrikes against ISIS targets inside of Syria, the missions have killed more than 900 people, nearly all militants, a monitoring group said Saturday. But 52 civilians, including eight children and five women, are among those who have been killed in the coalition airstrikes inside Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The London-based organization is aligned with the Syrian opposition. The United States had mostly stayed out of the Syria's civil war, which has been ongoing since March 2011, but as the battlefield fractured with the entry of jihadists like ISIS, the calculus changed. Of the 910 deaths the observatory has linked to the airstrikes, some 785 were ISIS fighters. That number is likely even higher because of incidents in which the group had difficulty documenting. Seventy-two of those killed belonged to the al Qaeda affiliate al-Nusra Front, the observatory said, and one was a militant from the Islamic Battalions. More than 191,000 Syrians have been killed in the civil war, as of August, according to the United Nations.

"(CNN)Three U.S. Navy sailors were assaulted and had bags placed over their heads during a stop in Istanbul, Turkey, according to U.S. military officials. The incident, captured on video, happened Wednesday when sailors from the USS Ross were attacked by members of the Turkish Youth Union, according to local Turkish press accounts. ""US Navy officials are working with the embassy and NCIS to investigate the incident. The three sailors were unharmed and are safely back aboard. They did not require medical attention,"" Capt. Greg Hicks, a spokesman with U.S. European Command told CNN. The assailants appeared to be neo-nationalists shouting slogans like ""Yankee Go Home,"" according to local press accounts.  They did not appear to be tied to ISIS, which is based in neighboring Syria. ""The incident does not reflect the hospitality nor the welcome reception our ships receive in port in Turkey,"" Hicks went on to say, and added that leave for sailors from the ship was canceled for the remainder of the day. The U.S. Embassy in Ankara condemned the attack through its official Twitter feed.

"By the big smiles, warm hugs and loud cries of ululation, the video seems to show a joyous celebration. An Egyptian prosecutor looked at the same footage and saw something very different: a ""satanic ceremony"" with images that are ""shameful, regrettable and anger God."" However it is characterized, the event has landed eight men in jail for three years, an Egyptian court ruled Saturday. The men will face three years of probation upon their release, according to Egypt's state-run Ahram Online. It's all because of a roughly 1-minute video set upon a Nile riverboat. It shows several well-dressed men, one of which pulls out a ring and slips it on another man's finger. The two had a brief kiss, then hug -- all as others on the boat cry out happily around them. There's a cake with two men's picture on it. ""May your night be filled with pomp and ceremony,"" one man says. The video went viral after posting online. In early September, the suspects were detained as part of an investigation ordered by Prosecutor-General Hisham Barakat for allegedly broadcasting footage that ""violates public decency.""  The prosecutor's office accused the men of ""debauchery"" and ""undermining public morals"" for their part in what it described as a same-sex wedding. The prosecutor's statement claims the event took place in April, but was only recently posted as an act of revenge against one of the men filmed in the video. Very soon after, on September 8, Egypt's forensic authority announced that seven of the arrested men had been physically inspected and were determined to be ""not gay,"" according to another Ahram Online story. The authority's spokesman, Hisham Abdel-Hamid, said the inspection found that they ""have never had sex with other men."" The eighth suspect -- who was an alleged groom in the video -- didn't show up for a physical inspection, according to the report. A man in the video has denied, in an interview with privately owned Rotana Masriya TV, that it depicted a marriage between the two men. Rather, he claimed that he was holding a birthday party for a friend and gave him a silver ring as a gift. There are no laws explicitly against same-sex relations in Egypt. Still, other laws -- such as those against  ""shameless public acts"" -- have been used in recent years to arrest and prosecute gay men in recent years, Ahram Online notes. The eight men in this case, for instance, were convicted on charges of ""debauchery."" In September, a judicial source told Ahram that six men were arrested and soon thereafter sentenced to two years in jail with labor for ""committing debauchery"" after an apartment raid. Four men were sentenced to prison in April for similar morality charges. And in 2001, Egypt arrested more than 50 men in a raid on a gay nightclub on the Queen riverboat.","Eight arrested after an online video showed what authorities called a same-sex wedding .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Xyza Cruz Bacani has lived in Hong Kong for nine years and still doesn't feel like she belongs. But that changes every time she reaches for her camera. Bacani, 27, is a migrant domestic worker or ""helper"" who moonlights as a photographer. She spends six days a week cooking, cleaning and babysitting for an affluent Chinese family. On her day off, Bacani wanders around the city capturing black and white scenes. ""When I'm wearing my camera I'm not a helper anymore, I'm an ordinary girl."" Bacani says. ""It's a way of protection because when you're a helper here, there is a kind of stereotyping that they do,"" referring to Hong Kongers. Lately, Bacani has been documenting a group of women at Bethune House Migrant Women's Refuge, a shelter for abused migrant workers. ""When I see the girls, I talk to them, I absorb all their emotions and I can't really believe that some people can do that to other human beings,"" Bacani says. ""We're the same. We're migrant workers. But I have a boss that treats me with respect and like a human being but these people — they were treated badly."" Bacani dropped out of college in the Philippines to work as a maid when she was only 19 so her younger brother and sister could stay at school. She began shooting street scenes four years ago, after asking her boss for a loan to buy a Nikon DSLR camera. Bacani's outsider status helps her to capture the city differently. She often peers at her subjects through a glass window or mirror and plays with lighting to create dramatic, melancholic contrasts. She posts new images on Facebook or her blog almost daily. That's how she caught the attention of Filipino documentary photographer Rick Rocamora who introduced her to a community of mentors. Soon after, doors began to open -- first, a profile in The New York Times' Lens blog, then a Fuji Film sponsorship and an exhibition at the Philippines Consulate General in Hong Kong. In December, Bacani walked into the Foreign Correspondents' Club in Hong Kong where her prints were hanging in 20 x 29 inch frames against a yellow, brick wall. It's easy to see why Bacani gets mistaken for a tourist or just another 20-something visitor on the streets of Hong Kong. She sports a blue hoodie, braces and side-swept bangs. It's Bacani's second solo exhibit in a year but the first time she had seen her images enlarged. As she approached the back wall, Bacani couldn't quite hide the thrill of seeing her photos displayed. She pulled out her smartphone and snapped a picture of the gallery to send to her mom and dad.READ MORE: Taking a different look at photography .","Filipino domestic worker captures Hong Kong's street scenes with black and white photographs .

"Smartphones may attract nearly all of the marketing hype and news coverage, but comScore's latest statistics show that smartphones still comprise only a minority of the U.S. mobile market -- about 35%, as of July 2011. The other 65% of U.S. mobile handsets in use are ""feature phones"" -- which tend to be much less expensive to buy and own. Often, these phones do not require a pricey two-year wireless service contract with hefty early termination fees. Even though smartphones cost much more, these devices have been getting popular with U.S. consumers, even in light of the country's economic recession. After all, a 35% market share is nothing to sneeze at -- especially considering that smartphones have only been widely available in the U.S. for about five years. At some point, a majority of U.S. mobile users will indeed own smartphones. But that shift won't happen as quickly as early forecasts anticipated. Back in March 2010, the Nielsen Company proclaimed that smartphones would overtake feature phones by 2011. Specifically, they predicted that by the end of Q3 2011 (about a month from now), most U.S. mobile users would own smartphones. That ambitious prediction doesn't seem to be panning out. For over a year, comScore has been publishing monthly mobile-market-share statistics that show the percentage of U.S. smartphones. I've been tracking these figures. Based on this data, it looks like it'll be roughly October 2012 before smartphones actually take over as a majority of U.S. handsets. That's about a year later than Nielsen's forecast. Even then, there will still be plenty of feature phones in the U.S. market for quite a while. They're definitely not vanishing any time soon. What might speed up or slow down the proliferation of smartphones in the U.S.? It's mostly a cost-benefit tradeoff. Decisions about which mobile phone to purchase are driven by functionality (what people want to do with their phones), access (the quality, speed, and geographic availability of local wireless networks), cost (both up-front and monthly bills), and flexibility (the ability to switch carriers, plans, or to cancel at will). Right now smartphones win in terms of functionality because people can use apps to do almost anything a much bulkier computer would let them do. Still, many consumers prefer simpler phones, and view the mobile app frenzy as a confusing and unnecessary excess. This market segment (and it's not just determined by age, education, or income) will probably keep using feature phones the longest. Access divides on urban and rural lines. Once you get outside of major metro areas, wireless coverage gets spottier. Also, carriers are very slow to roll out faster ""4G"" networks in less-populated rural areas. Using a smartphone on a slow or spotty data network can be pretty painful, and might not seem worth the extra cost. In terms of overall cost and flexibility, feature phones are the clear winners -- which is probably why they remain so popular. It's easy to get a pretty good, no-contract feature phone for $50 or less (or even for free), and then get a month-to-month or pre-paid plan that allows Web browsing, e-mail, and other data access. That costs around $50 per month. Generally users can cancel these phones at any time, with no early termination fee. In contrast, smartphones typically cost $100 or more (sometimes much more) at a subsidized price on a two-year contract from a wireless service provider. Monthly bills typically start at $80-90, and if you want to cancel early you'll still owe the carrier up to a few hundred dollars for an early termination fee. If the overall U.S. economy improves significantly -- and especially if lots more full-time jobs get created soon -- it's likely that smartphones would take over sooner. But if the recovery continues at its current pace or slows, feature phones could remain the majority into 2013 or beyond. It's also possible that manufacturing advances could bring the cost of smartphones down. Or the major U.S. carriers might decide to offer more smartphones on more flexible and consumer-friendly terms. Personally, I'm not holding my breath for either of these outcomes. The good news is that, for people who stick with feature phones, those devices aren't as limited as they used to be. One of the biggest areas of improvement in the U.S. feature phone market is the Web browser. Most feature phones come with some kind of Web browser, and users can opt to pay a little extra for a data plan that allows them to access the mobile Internet. It used to be the case that feature phones came packaged with horrible, frustrating and slow browsers that displayed most Web pages poorly or not at all. But now it's fairly easy for most U.S. consumers to find feature phones that include a much better pre-installed Web browser such as Opera Mini or Bolt. These display most Web pages pretty well and are easy to use, offering a vastly superior mobile browsing experience. According to Per Wetterdal, Opera's U.S. regional manager, American consumers can currently purchase Opera Mini-equipped feature phones that don't require a two-year contract from AT&T and Virgin Mobile (a brand from Sprint) -- and by this holiday season also from Verizon. (The stock AT&T mobile browser is actually a branded version of Opera Mini.) Discount carriers such as MetroPCS and third-party retailers such as Wal-Mart generally don't yet offer feature phones pre-installed with better proxy browsers. But any feature phone owners usually can download a better browser for free. The possible drawback is that once installed, it may take some extra clicks to launch. Opera Mini and Bolt offer additional benefits that may appeal to smartphone owners, too. These browsers, and others like them, are ""proxy browsers"" which compress data significantly before transmitting it to the phone. This means they load Web pages faster, and they help control mobile data consumption. So if you're on a tiered data plan, even if you own a smartphone it might be a good idea to install a proxy browser. Using it can help you avoid hitting your data cap, getting charged for overages, or even getting throttled. This will probably work well enough for most of your Web browsing, and you can switch to a fully-featured non-proxy browser for sites that warrant it. Some proxy browsers are specifically designed for smartphones. Opera Mini offers versions for all smartphone platforms, Bolt has BlackBerry versions, and Skyfire offers Android and iOS versions that also play Flash video (something still not fully supported by Apple's Mobile Safari browser). But if you want to stick with a feature phone for a while, don't worry too. You'll probably still get a good-enough mobile online experience if your phone has a decent mobile browser. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Approximately 65% of U.S. mobile phones are ""feature phones""

"(CNN) -- Country singer Trace Adkins lost his home to fire Saturday, but his three young daughters were saved by following fire safety tips they learned at school, Adkins' wife said. The flames apparently ignited in the garage, but quickly spread to the attic of the large home Saturday afternoon, said Brentwood, Tennessee, Fire Chief Brian Goss. The house is considered a total loss. ""Stuff is stuff,"" Rhonda Adkins told a reporter for CNN affiliate WSMV in Nashville as she stood on a neighbor's lawn watching her home burn. Her three young daughters and their dog were inside the home with their nanny when the fire started. Rhonda Adkins was driving a few blocks away when a neighbor called her. ""She said that the house was on fire and we looked up in the air and we saw the black smoke,"" Adkins said. ""And I said, 'Oh, my God, this isn't happening, this isn't real.'"" When she pulled up to her yard, she found her children there unhurt, she said. ""They ran to their safe place like we practiced, in the front yard at a big tree,"" she said. ""And it worked. You know, fire safety is so important, and today we used it."" Brentwood firefighters, the same ones who were inside her home battling the flames, visited her children's elementary school to teach fire safety earlier this year, she said. One lesson was to place a yellow ribbon where the family should gather if the house caught fire. ""I tied the yellow ribbon around the tree to go to,"" she said. ""It stayed there for about a month. Trace kept going, 'When you gonna take that ribbon down?' and I'm like, 'You know, I might need it one day.'"" Adkins said she never really expected it to be needed. ""But we did what those firefighters told us and we practiced it today,"" she said. ""It saved my kids' lives."" With her daughters, their nanny and the family dog safe, Adkins said it was easy for her to be calm and thankful despite the loss of her home. She did have one regret, though. ""I have not backed up all my photographs, and I'm just sitting here sick because those are the things that matter the most,"" she said. ""It's your memories, our wedding pictures, I don't have, because the negatives are in the house. ""Please, everybody, practice fire safety, and back up all your pictures,"" she said. Her husband was on a plane to Alaska for two shows and some fishing when the fire happened. His publicist said he immediately boarded a return flight to Tennessee when he landed. ""Trace wishes to express his gratitude for the immediate response of the Brentwood Fire Department and is humbled by the outpouring of concern from friends and fans,"" his spokesman said in a written statement to CNN Sunday. Coincidentally, Adkins' newest single, ""Just Fishin,'"" is being released this week. The video, which features the singer and his youngest child, Trinity, on a father-daughter fishing trip, was released Friday. Adkins, 49, was a finalist on NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2008, but host Donald Trump chose Piers Morgan, now a CNN talk show host, as the winner.

"The grand jury hearing evidence on the Michael Brown shooting is preparing to meet Friday for what might be its final session, and a decision on whether to charge Officer Darren Wilson could come the same day, law enforcement officials briefed on the plans said. St. Louis County prosecutors are preparing to present more evidence to the grand jury before starting deliberations, and a decision on an indictment is expected soon after, the law enforcement officials said. If a decision comes Friday, prosecutors are expected to provide law enforcement with 48 hours notice before making a public announcement, possibly on Sunday. The current plans could still change and prosecutors could shift the planned grand jury session, the officials said. In the shadow of the storm called Ferguson, a quiet grave . Prosecutor Robert McCulloch has said he plans to make public all evidence and testimony presented to the grand jury, but there is growing concern from some on how to deal with the identities of people who have testified, the sources say. Concerns have also been raised that some witnesses could be put at risk once their testimony and identities become public, law enforcement officials said. In some cases, witnesses might have testified differently under oath, providing different accounts than the ones they gave in media interviews, the official explained. Others may have provided testimony that may be interpreted as helpful to the officer's account of the August 9 shooting. A spokesman for McCulloch's office said the prosecutor hasn't decided whether to redact names of witnesses. The spokesman declined to comment on possible timing of the grand jury decision. A city on edge . A tense Ferguson is awaiting to hear whether a St. Louis County grand jury believes Wilson should stand trial in the fatal shooting of the unarmed Brown. Jurors have until January, but the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come in mid-November. For weeks, lawyers, analysts and journalists have speculated on when it will be announced. Ferguson became a flashpoint for racial tension after the teen's shooting; Brown, 18, was black, the officer is white. Street demonstrations and violence erupted, and heavily armed police came face to face with angry protesters demanding justice. Some predict that will be the case again when the grand jury's decision is announced. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Monday as a precaution in the event of unrest or violence. Along West Florissant Avenue, the ground zero of violent protests, businesses put back the plywood boards they had taken down from their windows and doors. Business owners were tired of answering questions about how they had fared through the weeks and weeks of tension. ""How do you think we are doing?"" asked Dan McMullen, owner of Solo Insurance Services on West Florissant. ""I just want to get this over with and move on,"" he said, sitting at his desk behind the boarded-up entrance to his strip mall office. He said some protesters came in wanting to leave fliers with information in his office. ""I told them to get the hell out. You broke my windows and now you want me to put out your literature?"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told local media this month that he expected demonstrations across the region and warned authorities to ""prepare for the worst."" 'We've had three months to prepare' St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said Tuesday that his officers are ready for whatever happens. ""We've had three months to prepare. ... Acts of violence will not be tolerated,"" he said. ""Our intelligence is good. Our tactics are good. We can protect lawful people and at the same time arrest criminals."" On Tuesday, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay wrote the city's aldermen, singling out Alderwoman Phyllis Young, chairwoman of the city's public safety committee, to explain that 400 National Guard troops would be requested for the city. ""We will not, unless something happens that we have not foreseen, post them where there are organized protests,"" Slay wrote. Rather, he wrote, they will be placed with police officers at 45 locations around the city to prevent violence and property destruction. The city's police will wear normal uniforms, as ""we do not want to appear to militarize our response to the demonstrations and want to do everything we can to de-escalate,"" the mayor wrote, adding that police may don riot gear if public safety demands it. ""If our officers put on their personal protective gear, it is not to intimidate peaceful protesters. It is for the sole purpose of keeping everyone safe,"" he wrote. Area school superintendents wrote a letter to city officials and authorities requesting that they announce the grand jury's decision on an evening or weeknight so it doesn't affect about 20,000 students traveling back and forth to schools. Many parents received notice to fetch their children from school if the decision comes out earlier in the day. A group of community members calling themselves the Don't Shoot Coalition has asked for 48 hours' notice before the ruling is made public. It also released 19 ""Rules of Engagement"" that touch on major points of contention between protesters and police. The group wants assurances that neither police nor the government will interfere with the flow of information, as well as a guarantee that police won't use rubber bullets, armored vehicles, rifles or tear gas. The group also requested that officers wear attire ""minimally required for their safety"" and that ""specialized riot gear be avoided except as a last resort."" Staging dry runs in cold weather . In the St. Louis area, protesters have been staging dry runs on how to face police. And continuing their demonstrations. Despite below-freezing temperatures Monday, about 100 activists disrupted lunchtime traffic in the nearby city of Clayton. Brown's shooting on August 9 also touched a national nerve, with protests decrying racism and police brutality taking place around the country since his death. The Ferguson National Response Network expects that reaction to the grand jury ruling will not be limited to the St. Louis area. It has set up a Tumblr account advertising about 90 ""planned responses"" to the ruling. They will take place from West Palm Beach, Florida, to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Brown's supporters have turned out in force, but Wilson's supporters have demonstrated on occasion as well. They point to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest Brown might have attacked Wilson, struggled for his gun and perhaps even charged the officer after the tussle over the weapon. McMullen, the insurance company owner on West Florissant, said that protesters have made this into a racial issue but have ignored the facts of the case. ""There is no way a police officer in America would just get out of his car and shoot someone for no reason,"" he said. Protesters are aware of the other version of events, but it doesn't stem their anger. Many told CNN in August that other witnesses allege Wilson shot Brown at least six times as he stood about 30 feet from Wilson's police cruiser. The fatal shots were fired as Brown had his hands up in surrender, they believe. Perhaps stoking the most anger is that all six shots hit Brown above the waist, leading community members to believe Wilson never had any intention of arresting the teen. Images of Brown's body lying on the street went viral through social media. Where he once lay is a makeshift memorial -- half on the sidewalk and half on Canfield Drive, in the middle of the road, exactly where Brown fell.

"The U.S. intelligence community now believes two key terrorist operatives targeted by the United States in the opening night of attacks in Syria are still alive and could be actively plotting, multiple officials tell CNN. The operatives are key members of Khorasan Group, the al Qaeda affiliate entrenched in Syria that the United States has declared poses a great risk to American national security.  One official with direct knowledge of the latest U.S. assessment said the working assumption now is that both Muhsin al-Fadhli, the leader of the group, and David Drugeon, a French jihadist and key member, who is believed to be a skilled bomb-maker, are alive. The United States does not know with certainty if they are injured. An intelligence analyst with knowledge of the intelligence tells CNN ""its 99.5% certain"" they are alive. There had been scattered press reports about the fate of both men. But until now the United States had not indicated this strongly that it believes both men survived or left before a barrage of 47 U.S. Navy Tomahawk missiles on September 22 on several suspected Khorasan sites in Syria. Officials said news reports on Khorasan Group before the strikes may have had an impact on the effectiveness of striking the group. Drugeon is believed to be heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters back and forth from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe. His name has not been widely disclosed by the United States. Like al-Fadhli and the rest of the Khorasan Group, U.S. officials say Drugeon has ties to the core al Qaeda group in Pakistan and is believed to have come to Syria from Pakistan in the last two years. U.S. officials said he is believed to be one of the key bomb-makers in the group and may have been actively involved with creating easily concealed bombs that led to increased security measures at overseas airports this past summer. U.S. intelligence officials said it's possible he may still be living in Syria. The United States is tracking a number of al Qaeda leaders believed to have moved into Syria, some having transited Iran to get there. Al Qaeda in Yemen's master bomb-maker, Ibrahim Al Asiri, is believed to have shared techniques and technology with Khorasan. One of the targets during the U.S. attack this fall was a bomb-making facility. Another U.S. official told CNN about a month ago there were communications intercepts suggesting the militants were discussing the possibility of Al Asiri traveling to Aleppo, Syria, to offer direct assistance to Khorasan and the Al Nusra Front, a related jihadist group. What's the difference between ISIS, al-Nusra and the Khorasan Group? U.S. officials believe Al Asiri did not take the risk of traveling to Syria and would not do so because of the presence of U.S. reconnaissance and surveillance over Syria and the stepped up airstrikes. It is not clear to what extent those intercepts were verified as representing Al Asiri's views. U.S. officials have said recently they believe the missile attacks against Khorasan did not destroy the group and that it still poses an imminent threat to the United States because of its ability to make bombs that are not readily detected by airport screening technology. The recently retired director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Matthew Olsen, said the threat from the group is still significant. ""This group was in a position to train without any sort of interference, they were able to recruit operatives. We saw that they were looking to test explosives. So they were in the advanced stages of plotting. And again they had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack,"" Olsen told CNN""s Jim Sciutto. ""I don't think there's any realistic likelihood that some limited airstrikes even just for a period of time will degrade that threat altogether. Those individuals, they're hardened, seasoned veterans, and they've got an ability to operate pretty freely in Syria. So I think it's unlikely that threat's altogether been eliminated."" The United States has not acknowledged striking against the Khorasan Group since that first night in September.","Khorasan Group has been thought a target of U.S. airstrikes .

"(CNN) -- Once the most popular smartphone, the BlackBerry has been losing ground in the past year to iPhone and Android models. So Research in Motion is trying to carve out a new market with the PlayBook (the upcoming BlackBerry tablet) due to hit stores in the U.S. and Canada on April 19. Prices start at $499, same as for the iPad 2. However, the BlackBerry operating system is definitely not on the cutting edge of smartphone platforms. So there's been ample skepticism about how attractive a BlackBerry tablet might be to consumers, especially compared with slick offerings such as Apple's iPad and the growing array of Android tablets. On March 24, in a move apparently aimed at compensating for the weaknesses of the BlackBerry OS and relatively lean BlackBerry App World offerings, RIM announced that the PlayBook will support Android apps, as well as the Java-based apps that currently run on BlackBerry smartphones. According to the news release, ""RIM will launch two optional 'app players' that provide an application run-time environment for BlackBerry Java apps and Android v2.3 apps. These new app players will allow users to download BlackBerry Java apps and Android apps from BlackBerry App World and run them on their BlackBerry PlayBook."" However, the release also notes that ""The new app players for the BlackBerry PlayBook are expected to be available from BlackBerry App World this summer."" So if you rush out to buy a PlayBook this spring, you'll have to wait a few months to get those Android apps and see how well they run. Crackberry clarified, ""This doesn't mean that RIM is working with Google to bring Android marketplace to BlackBerry, but rather that developers who have made Android apps can sign up as BlackBerry App World developers (which is now free of charge) and distribute their apps to BlackBerry PlayBook owners via App World."" And as to the user experience, Crackberry notes, ""Because these Android Apps and BlackBerry Smartphone apps will be running in a sandboxed environment, to use RIM's vocabulary we can likely expect the experience to be more along the lines of simple open-and-use 'apps' rather than the deeply integrated 'super apps' that RIM often likes to talk about."" Media analyst Jean-Louis Gassée sharply criticized RIM's app strategy for the PlayBook, as well as RIM's entire business approach of late. He points out that touting the PlayBook as running Android apps is misleading, since consumers won't be able to download apps from the Android app market and run them on the PlayBook. Rather, developers will have to adapt their Android apps to run within the PlayBook's app player and then get them approved to be offered in the BlackBerry App World, a hurdle few developers are likely to be willing to jump for a new, unproven tablet with established competition. ""Launching what is clearly an immature product and trying to compensate for a dearth of applications with a misleading claim of compatibility with the wrong version of Android is insane,"" Gassée wrote. I'm puzzled by the market strategy here. Clearly, RIM is using the PlayBook to push hard to get more users in the consumer media and gaming market. But that represents a huge away shift from the company's original (and still strong) market base, which is mostly corporate users focused on messaging services. On that front, there's a further complication: The PlayBook reportedly falls short in terms of supporting the integrated messaging services that die-hard BlackBerry fans love. According to Information Week: ""The PlayBook will first launch in a Wi-Fi only configuration (Sprint will sell a WiMax version this summer). That means the PlayBook can only snag emails and other data when in range of Wi-Fi hotspots. Email, contacts, and calendar data are not 'live' on the PlayBook as they are on a regular BlackBerry. In fact, the only way to access live corporate PIM data is to tether a BlackBerry to the PlayBook via Bluetooth. The PlayBook will then mirror whatever data is on the BlackBerry."" This sounds like a huge drawback for RIM's existing business users. It means that in order to take advantage of the features BlackBerry users love, they'll have to carry around both devices and take the time to tether them. It's good that RIM is branching out in new directions, and a tablet makes sense. But why not build on the company's strengths to create a robust tablet experience for business users rather than go flailing after the consumer and gaming markets, a strategy that pits the PlayBook squarely against the iPad? Doesn't sound like a fair fight. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","BlackBerry's PlayBook tablet hits stores April 19 and will start at $499 .
In an effort to make the PlayBook more attractive, BlackBerry is opening it to Android apps .
But few Android app developers may be willing to jump through hurdles for an unproven tablet .

"On Wednesday, the Senate and House homeland security committees held their first-ever joint hearing, on the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, to address what has become a familiar theme for both committees -- the threat from ""homegrown"" terrorists. The hearing, chaired jointly by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Rep. Peter King, R-New York,  examined the threat to ""military communities"" posed by domestic terrorism, a threat that Lieberman said last week ""has increased dramatically"" since 2006, when he held his first hearing on the subject. Lieberman cited the attack, allegedly by U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, that killed 13 soldiers and civilians at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009; the shooting death of a soldier outside an army recruiting station in Arkansas the same year; and a purported plot by Army Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo to attack soldiers near Fort Hood with explosives and firearms this year. So what is the actual threat to America's military from homegrown terrorists? The New America Foundation and the Maxwell School of Public Policy examined 192 cases of apparent homegrown terrorism by Islamist militants since 9/11. We found that the American military at home and abroad is indeed a target for Islamist extremist plots. In a third of the cases we studied, the individuals who were charged had targeted the U.S. military. Of those, a little under half targeted military facilities or personnel in the United States, while 55% were targeting American bases and troops overseas. Additionally, attacks against military personnel have accounted for 14 of the 17 deaths attributed to jihadist terrorists in the United States since 9/11 (though all but one happened during the 2009 Fort Hood shooting). These deaths were all caused by gunfire, presumably because explosives are more difficult to acquire and build and often draw the attention of law enforcement. American law enforcement is quite focused on the threat of attacks against U.S. military targets. A government informant or undercover government agent took part in the investigations of 60% of the jihadist terrorism cases directed at U.S. military targets. While some of the anti-military plots were serious, in particular the deadly assault on Fort Hood, others were more aspirational than operational. Rezwan Ferdaus, for instance, is charged with hatching  a harebrained plan to attack the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol earlier this year using remote-controlled model aircraft loaded with explosives. Ferdaus was snared by government informants who supplied him with the cash to take his ""scouting trips"" to scope out the targets, and even to buy the model planes that were to be used in the plot.  He has pleaded not guilty. And the FBI declined to investigate Jose Pimentel, a recent convert to Islam arrested by New York police last month on charges of trying to build pipe bombs for use against U.S. service members returning to the United States because, as an anonymous law enforcement official told the Wall Street Journal, ""If the FBI declines a case, it's not a strong case.' The desire of Islamist militants to attack the U.S. military may decline as the U.S. completes its withdrawal from Iraq this month and transitions away from combat operations toward a training mission in Afghanistan over the next two years. New America and the Maxwell School also examined nonjihadist terrorist cases since 9/11 and found that while terrorists motivated by far right-wing or anti-government ideologies do not pose a threat to the U.S. military, they do pose a real threat to U.S. government personnel -- in particular to law enforcement. We examined the 118 cases of right-wing and left-wing terrorism since 9/11 and found that more than 40% of them involved plans to strike government facilities and personnel, including federal and local law enforcement officers. Police disrupted a number of such plots, such as the one allegedly organized by members of the ""Hutaree"" Christian militia last year in Michigan, who authorities said planned to kill a police officer and later ambush the funeral procession using explosives. During the investigation of the Hutaree group, law enforcement seized machine guns and a variety of explosives. On Monday one of the nine accused of the Michigan plot pleaded guilty to weapons charges, the first to do so. The guilty plea in the Michigan case underscores that while Islamist terrorists do pose a threat to U.S. service members, those with other types of extremist beliefs also pose a similar kind of threat to U.S. government officials and American law enforcement. Terrorist threats against U.S. officials and police that have nothing to do with Islamist militancy are surely also worthy of the scrutiny of Congress, but neither the Senate nor House homeland security committee, nor it seems any other congressional committee, has examined the issue in any detail since 9/11.","House and Senate panels hold hearings on homegrown terrorists and U.S. military .
Authors say study shows dimensions of the threat .
American military is a target for Islamist extremist plots at home and abroad, they say .
Authors: Congress should also study threat from non-Islamist terror groups of left, right ."
"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities have ordered a ban on women from watching live broadcasts of soccer matches at public movie theaters, the semi-official ILNA news agency reported. A state police agency that monitors Iranian businesses called for the ban because ""the presence of women and families at movie theaters increases security risks and inappropriate behavior,"" ILNA reported. Movie theaters in Iran's major cities have broadcast matches from this year's Asian Cup, where Iran's national soccer team has advanced to the quarterfinals after winning its first three matches. The final decision on the ban rests with a government office, according to an official with Iran's movie theater industry. ""Movie theaters operate under the authority of the Ministry of Culture and Guidance, so we're waiting for their decision in this matter,"" Amir Hossein Alamalhoda was quoted as saying. Women already are banned from attending men's soccer matches at stadiums. Hard-line government officials and clerics say the presence of women at men's sporting events is not compatible with Islam. Journalist Farbod Jamali contributed to this report.","Women not allowed to attend men's soccer matches .

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Leveled buildings, fallen trees and massive piles of rubble stretched across wide swaths of the South Thursday after destructive tornadoes and severe storms tore through the region. In all, the death toll from the wave of powerful storms that struck Wednesday and early Thursday was more than 280 people in six states. In Tuscaloosa alone, at least 36 people lost their lives. Officials scrambled to assess the damage. Doctors treated hundreds of injured. And dazed residents wandered the streets, telling harrowing tales of devastation and survival. Employees huddled in a windowless break room at a CVS drug store in Tuscaloosa as a tornado approached and a deafening roar filled the air, store manager Michael Zutell said. A mother cradling an infant sprinted inside just before the twister hit. ""Glass is breaking. The woman with the baby is screaming. Part of the drop ceiling fell and boxes fly in,"" he said. No one inside the store was injured, Zutell said. ""It's mind-boggling to think you walked away."" Nurse Rachel Mulder said she and her husband rode out the storm in the bathtub of their second-floor apartment in Duncanville, Alabama. After the tornado passed, only their bathroom was standing. ""My husband was walking around, looking for survivors and called me over and said...'Come here, someone is dying.' So I grabbed my first-aid kit and ran down the stairs to try and help her,"" she recalled. ""I tried to stop her bleeding and save her, but she was taking her last breath."" Bill Dutton found his mother-in-law's body hundreds of yards from the site of her Pleasant Grove, Alabama, home, which was swept away down to the foundation. ""The last thing she said on the phone, she was taking shelter in a closet,"" he said. Reba Self frantically searched for her mother after a tornado pummelled their home in Ringgold, Georgia. ""I'm screaming for her, 'Answer me, Mom -- please, Mom, answer me.' I didn't hear anything. It turns out she had gotten out of the house and walked around to the basement door, and she asked me if I was OK."" Now, they're trying to make the best of the situation. ""I'm laughing at her because she's in the house with a broom, sweeping. I told her, 'Mom, the house is gone, you can put the broom down,'"" Self said. The widespread devastation in areas across the South left residents reeling Thursday. ""It looks like an atomic bomb went off in a straight line,"" said Dr. Brian Wilhite, an internist at Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa who tended to the wounded. The facility was overrun with hundreds of people who suffered injuries, including head injuries or lacerations, he said. ""It looked more like a Vietnam War site than a hospital,"" Wilhite said. ""I know one physician who watched two people die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do."" A video shot from the third floor of the University of Alabama's basketball coliseum shows a large mass sucking everything into forbidding dark clouds above. Christopher England, who recorded the video, said the tornado looked like a movie scene. ""It was unreal to see something that violent and something that massive,"" he said. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox estimated that the destruction spanned a length of five to seven miles, and was a mile wide in some areas. The challenges facing the city were daunting. The mayor said they were short on manpower, materials and equipment. The lifelong resident of Tuscaloosa said the damage was unlike anything he had seen before. ""I don't know how anyone survived,"" he said. CNN's Wayne Drash, Reynolds Wolf, Mariano Castillo, Matt Cherry and Martin Savidge contributed to this report .","Survivors tell harrowing tales of the storm""

"(CNN)  -- E-books are revolutionizing the publishing industry and reader preferences, and Amazon might be in a unique position to hasten that change -- if they decide to start giving away their popular Kindle e-reader for free. Here's why they might want to do that. Last year, nearly $1 billion in e-books were sold, according to Forrester. By 2015, this is expected to jump to $3 billion. That's an awful lot of money to be made selling e-books. At that point, selling e-readers at any price might just become an obstacle to selling more e-books. So why not just give away some e-readers for free? Back in October 2009, blogger John Walkenbach noticed that the Kindle price -- currently $139 -- was falling steadily. By June 2010 this rate was so consistent that he projected that by November 2011 the Kindle price should be $0. Last summer, author Kevin Kelly asked Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about this projection. According to Kelly, Bezos ""merely smiled and said, 'Oh, you noticed that!' And then smiled again."" In a way, Amazon has already been giving away Kindles for awhile -- in the form of the free Kindle smartphone, tablet, and computer apps. Right now, about 6 million U.S. adults own e-readers -- but this field is getting much more crowded. According to recent research from Changewave, Kindle currently holds 47% of the e-reader market. Apple's iPad (which is much more than an e-reader, so I'm not sure that's a fair comparison) holds only 32% of this market. Sony's Reader, at 5%, is just barely leading the Barnes & Noble Nook, at 4%. Plus, Google recently acquired eBook Technologies, Inc., so it'll be interesting to see what that yields on the e-reader front. The Kindle's core business model has always been to sell books, not devices. So a free Kindle seems like a potentially savvy business move. Forrester analyst James McQuivey recently noted: ""Just 7% of online adults who read books read e-books. But that 7% happens to be a very attractive bunch: they read the most books and spend the most money on books. And here's the kicker: the average e-book reader already consumes 41% of books in digital form. ""Oh, and that includes the people who don't have an e-reader yet, which is nearly half of them. For those that have a Kindle or other e-reader, they read 66% of their books digitally. McQuivey believes the e-book market has plenty of room for growth and will, by conservative estimates, reach $3 billion by the middle of the decade. All e-readers, including the Kindle, have their pros and cons -- not the least of which are concerns about digital rights management, and whether you can loan or sell your used e-books. But if Amazon doesn't offer free e-readers, someone certainly will. I'm sure Amazon wishes to maintain its market lead. Here are three ways they might do that: . 1. Buy X number of Kindle books, get a Kindle free . And maybe the Kindle books you've already bought to read on your phone, tablet, or computer might count toward that benchmark. 2. Free Kindles for Amazon Prime members . Millions of Amazon.com customers already pay $79/year to get free two-day shipping on many items, plus (now) free video streaming. TechCrunch speculated on this a year ago. 3. Partner Kindle giveaways . Already some banks have started giving away Kindles to customers. But here's a more intriguing option, from the London Review of Books: ""The New York Times, if it stopped printing a physical edition of the paper, could afford to give every subscriber a free Kindle. ""Not the standard Kindle, but the one with free global data access. And not just one Kindle, but four Kindles. And not just once, but every year. And that's using the low estimate for the costs of [their] printing."" Personally, I think free e-reader devices, if they worked with library e-book lending programs (like the one in Oakland, California) and open e-book formats (like .mobi and .pdf) -- could help increase access to books for youths, seniors and low-income communities. For many in these groups, smartphones and tablets are too expensive or complicated, and it's not always easy to get to the public library -- especially if, as in Oakland and Los Angeles, public library hours are being steadily whittled away. As a matter of fact, I'm writing this article sitting in the former card catalog room of Doheny Library on the campus of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. It's a gorgeous space, all four walls lined with built-in wooden card catalog drawers, stacked six feet high. Every one of those drawers is empty. Like in most libraries today, students now search the library catalog from computer terminals. But they still must go to the shelves to get their books. With free e-readers, maybe libraries could be everywhere, and open all the time. Hmm, maybe Amazon wouldn't like that so much. But if their e-book market was big enough, they probably wouldn't care. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Amazon is in a unique position to hasten the change in the publishing industry .

"Police chased young men down Ferguson's streets and made arrests, as bottles flew again shortly before midnight. Protesters locked hand in front of the police line, while some urged the crowd to remain peaceful. The police presence rose significantly, as did tensions. Until then, the streets had been calm, as a much smaller crowd milled about, holding signs and chanting. A few hundred people walked up and down a small area past journalists' cameras. And as hours passed, the crowd thinned down to a few dozen. ""Hands up! Don't shoot"" was their mantra, as it has been every night. But many of the demonstrators added a second chant: ""We protesters, we don't loot."" Jameila White from St. Louis County walked a mile to hand out free water to protesters. ""We pooled together as a community to bring this,"" she said, pointing to three Styrofoam coolers of bottles water on ice. ""So, we can stay energized and keep walking because they're saying if we stand still we're going to get locked up."" White, who once lived in Ferguson, also poured out several bottles of water and filled them with milk, to help wash tear gas out of people's eyes. Police cars with flashing lights stood by every block of so apart. Officers in body armor congregated at a car wash alongside an armored vehicle. Even the police seemed surprised. Said one state trooper. ""Can we be peaceful? That's all I'm saying."" Things must change . Leaders in the Missouri town insisted earlier Tuesday that things must change. Ten days have passed since a white police officer's shooting of an unarmed black teenager triggered emotional, expansive protests that have increasingly devolved into violence. The state highway patrol captain tasked with maintaining security characterized what's happened in those 10 days as an embarrassment -- to Ferguson, to Missouri, to the United States. In a statement Tuesday, Ferguson leaders vowed to rebuild the city's business district, parts of which have been ravaged by looting and unrest. They promised to recruit more African-Americans to join the police in their largely African-American community, a relevant point since the Ferguson Police Department is overwhelmingly white. And they signaled their intention to raise money so that all officers and police cars would be outfitted with vest and dash cams. Those cameras are significant because they could have helped clear up many questions surrounding Michael Brown's death: Was Brown executed by a police officer while holding his hands in the air, as some activists claim? Or was Brown shot after rushing at Officer Darren Wilson, who fired fearing for his own life, as detailed in an account on a radio show? Sides remain dug in . Without any known video of that August 9 shooting, both sides remain dug in. The Brown family's supporters are as passionate as ever, some saying they lose more and more trust for law enforcement with every armored truck on the road and tear gas canister fired into the air. Wilson, meanwhile, has gotten more and more support of his own in recent days. Supporters held a rally in St. Louis this week, and as of Tuesday, nearly 900 people had donated more than $33,000 to a fund for Darren Wilson, according to a GoFundMe page set up to collect donations. The situation on the streets of Ferguson itself has deteriorated in many ways. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . From Monday into Tuesday, at least 74 people were arrested for failure to disperse. Two others were arrested on weapons charges and another person for interfering with an officer. In addition to this, two people were shot -- not by police, authorities said. Four officers were injured. Outside agitators . Police and protesters blamed agitators -- including many from outside Ferguson -- for the shots and violence. According to the jail records, many of those arrested were local residents. Others came from New York, California, Texas and Alabama. ""What we are dealing with right now are two groups of people,"" Missouri state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said. ""One, protesters who are peacefully demonstrating, expressing their First Amendment rights. And then we have a smaller group of people who have been infiltrating themselves in the crowds and creating all of this unrest."" But many have criticized the police response. Gen. Russel Honore, who handled crowd control in the chaos that ensued after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, joined them late Tuesday. ""You're there to protect people,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. ""They need to sense that from you."" Looking at crowd members through the scope of a gun sends the wrong message, he said. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes agreed on that point. ""The overall presence was too aggressive,"" he said. But he agreed with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. Looters and hooligans caused trouble that called for the response, he said. They used protesters ""as human shields."" Demands for prosecution . Many civic leaders worry the unrest is taking away from the main message of the protests: accountability for the officer who shot the 18-year-old Brown. Brown's parents believe the only real way out of this situation is for Wilson to be charged. ""Justice,"" the late teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NBC's ""Today"" show. ""Justice will bring peace, I believe."" A grand jury could begin to hear testimony from witnesses and deciding whether to return an indictment in the case as early as Wednesday. That's the same day that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is expected to visit Ferguson to check in on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation into Brown's death. ""At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn -- in a fair and thorough manner -- exactly what happened,"" Holder said in a commentary for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Legal expert Fuentes warned not to expect quick results. Much of the evidence has not yet been processed by crime labs, he said. Controversy has also embroiled St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. Some residents and community leaders contend that he has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases. Brown, meanwhile, will be eulogized by civil rights leader Al Sharpton at a public funeral Monday morning. Magazine: The aftermath in Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- When you want news or information about your community, do you sometimes turn to your cell phone or tablet computer? If so, you've got plenty of company. According to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project, nearly half (47%) of all U.S. adults get at least some local news and information on their phone or tablet. According to Pew, here are the types of local information that mobile users reported they've been getting: . Weather: 42% . Local restaurants and other businesses: 37% . General local news: 30% . Local sports scores and updates: 24% . Local traffic and transportation: 22% . Local coupons and discounts: 19% . News alerts: 15% . The growing trend in mobile local news and information isn't strictly a matter of civic consciousness; weather, dining and shopping did top the list, after all. However, Pew did find that ""[m]ore than a third (35%) of mobile local information consumers say they and others like them can have a big impact on their community. That compares with 27% of those who do not connect to their communities on their mobile devices who feel that level of personal efficacy."" Most mobile local news and information consumers (65%) believe that it's now easier to keep up with information about their community than it was five years ago. About half get local news via six or more different sources or types of media each month. And three-fourths use social networking services like Twitter or Facebook. About half of U.S. Hispanics (52%) and African-Americans (51%) reported getting local mobile news or information. Whites were slightly behind, at 45%. Despite conventional wisdom that young people don't care much about news or community, people ages 18 to 29 were by far most likely (70%) to access local information online -- and nearly half of these younger adults specifically report obtaining local news via their mobile devices. Among people ages 30 to 49, 63% get mobile local news or information. This dropped to 33% for people ages 50 to 64, and to 8% for those 65 and older. People who are parents of minor children are especially likely (64%) to get local mobile news or information -- compared with only 40% of people with no minor children. The mobile digital divide is evident on the local front. Wealthier people are especially likely to be mobile local news and information consumers. Among households earning $75,000 per year or more, 67% use cell phones or tablets to get local news or information, while only 39% of households earning $30,000 or less per year do so. Also, 58% of college graduates are local mobile news consumers, compared with 25% of people with less than a high school education. Also, while Pew didn't specifically explore this issue, the mobile consumption of local news and information definitely isn't just a smartphone thing. Pew surveyed 2,251 adults via both land lines and cell phones, so it did not focus solely on smartphone and tablet users. This is key, since smartphones are still in the minority. According to ComScore, as of January 2011, just under 30% of all U.S. cell phone users owned smartphones. Plus, Pew reports that currently, only 7% of U.S. adults own tablets (mostly iPads) and that most of those people also already own smartphones. Therefore, a substantial number of people must be getting local news and information via cheaper, simpler feature phones, the next step down in features from smartphones. All of these phones can do text messaging, and most of them can also do e-mail and Web browsing -- just with a clunkier, more limited interface and a slower data connection. This is significant because feature phones are probably not going away anytime soon. While smartphones are getting more popular, the huge popularity of feature phones is likely to continue for at least a few years. Most consumers aren't willing or able to pay the typically high costs for smartphone handsets and carrier contracts. Also, many consumers simply prefer less complex mobile devices. Furthermore, feature phones are getting smarter and more useful. In particular, in the coming year, Qualcomm's deal to make Opera Mini the default browser on feature phones powered by its popular BREW MP platform will vastly improve the Web browsing experience for a large portion of feature phone users. An improved user experience may soon lead to a boom in feature-phone Web browsing of all kinds, including for local news and information. Notably, only 13% of mobile users reported having a local news or information application (""app"") installed on their phone. This means that for most local news and information producers, getting an iPhone or Android app probably shouldn't be the first step in their mobile strategy. Other mobile channels -- especially the mobile Web, e-mail, text messaging and social media integration -- can serve a far larger mobile audience. In fact, Pew discovered that the only real difference between users of local news mobile apps and other adults is that local news app users tend to be generally more into high-tech. They aren't even generally more affluent: Only 19% of Americans with an annual household income of $75,000 or more have local mobile news apps, compared with 12% of people from households earning $30,000 or less per year. The survey was conducted January 12-25. Its margin of error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","65% of mobile consumers say it's easier to keep up with local information than 5 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Despite online security concerns, the number of Americans who use mobile devices to access financial services is growing fast, according to new data from comScore. In the fourth quarter of 2010, almost 30 million Americans accessed their bank, credit card or brokerage accounts from a cell phone or tablet, up 54% from the same quarter a year earlier. Here's how that growth breaks down for the three primary mobile banking channels (note that some people use more than one): . Smartphone/tablet app: 10.8 million users, 120% increase . Mobile web browser: 18.6 million users, 58% increase . SMS text messaging: 8.1 million users, 35% increase . Nearly half of those surveyed say they primarily access financial services online via a desktop or laptop computer; but 26% said they primarily use mobile services for banking. Only 10% of respondents primarily do their banking in person at a branch, and only 4% primarily handle their banking via voice calls. New services that help people avoid trips to the bank or ATM may be helping boost the popularity of mobile financial apps. For instance, many major banks now offer smartphone apps that allow you to make a deposit by taking a picture of the front and back of the check. Why don't more people access mobile financial services? comScore found some interesting differences between smartphone users and the nearly three-fourths of U.S. mobile users who own feature phones (simpler phones that are the next step down from smartphones). The biggest obstacle to using mobile financial services is simple habit or preference: 53% of smartphone owners and 45% of feature phone owners reported, ""I prefer to conduct my transactions online from a fixed device."" Intriguingly, a quarter of smartphone users reported, ""Accessing my account through my cell phone is too slow."" Yet only 9% of feature phone users had the same complaint, even though feature phones typically rely on slower wireless data networks and have browsers that are more limited and harder to navigate. Roughly a third of both groups reported concerns about mobile security -- and there is reason for concern. In October, Banking Info Security reported that even though computer-based internet access to banking probably poses more security risks, most banks now have a decade or more of experience with managing those risks. In contrast, most banks have less experience with mobile services and their attendant risks, and so the risks are amplified by what the banks simply haven't learned yet. Last fall, the Wall Street Journal reported that several banks were rushing to fix security holes in their mobile apps, mostly regarding how the apps were storing data on cell phones. In general, if you are using a mobile financial services app, it's a good idea not to save your password in the app. Also, it's more secure to use the app over your wireless carrier's network, rather than on an open Wi-Fi network. And, of course, remember to lock your phone with a security code or pattern.

"Today, Iowans will kick off the Republican nominating process for president of the United States with the first-in-the-nation caucuses. But why a Tuesday? The short answer: We vote on Tuesday for absolutely no good reason. This is true especially when you consider the United States, arguably the world's most famous democracy, has ranked near the bottom of all nations in voter participation for more than half a century.  And that's not because, as Mitt Romney suggested to me last month, we need great candidates to increase voter turnout. Heard of JFK? Reagan? The little-bit-longer answer: We vote on Tuesday because of a law passed in 1845 meant to make voting convenient for Americans traveling by horse and buggy. Seriously. When Congress set out to pick a day for Americans to vote, ultimately settling on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, voting could take two days:  a day to get to the county seat to vote and a day to get back for market day on Wednesday. They couldn't travel on the Christian sabbath, so by process of elimination, Tuesday,  the first convenient day of the week, was chosen. It was as simple as that. In 2012, it's as dumb as that. Just a few weeks ago I sat in Tom Thumb diner in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and as I looked out the window in one of the most fertile farming states in our country, I didn't notice a single Iowan hitting the highway in a horse-drawn carriage. So why are we still voting on a day set for a time when slavery was legal, only white males voted, less than half of our 50 states had been established and ""automobile"" was a made-up word? Since World War II, American voter turnout has averaged under 50% in federal elections. In 2008, with unprecedented excitement about the presidential campaign and record money spent by the candidates, voter turnout was about 64%, not a record, and a third of all eligible voters didn't make it to the polls. To understand the benefits to democracy of weekend voting, all you need to do is look at  the nations with the highest voter turnout and realize they vote on weekends or national holidays. In an America where 45 million 18- to 29-year-olds, the largest potential voting bloc in the country, are in school or at work all day, where single parents have to take care of their kids, and many of us, as much as we want to, are prevented by other obligations from making it to the polls in the middle of the week, it's clear it's time to move Election Day to the weekend. Critics and contrarians say that in an age of early and absentee voting, moving Election Day to the weekend isn't necessary. Indeed, that's exactly what Newt Gingrich said when I met him after my recent meal in Fort Dodge. But as I politely reminded him, absentee and early voting is not allowed in the Iowa caucuses. In about 14 other states, regular voting is still only Tuesday -- and in person, if you don't have an approved excuse. You don't have to remind me that moving Election Day isn't a pocketbook or kitchen table issue. I'm well aware election reform couldn't be less sexy or more wonky. Just last week I was asked by Simon Conway, the Iowa radio host, if the push to move Election Day was a ""serious campaign.""  I paraphrased what Thomas Paine once said: Voting is the right upon which all other rights are protected . That's exactly why Ambassador Andrew Young, congressional scholar Norman J. Ornstein and Drum Major Institute Chairman Bill Wachtel founded WhyTuesday.org, why U.S. Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, have introduced the Weekend Voting Act into Congress to move Election Day to Saturday and Sunday, and why I went to Iowa in December to ask our presidential candidates what they'd do to protect our right to vote. Although he didn't know why we vote when we do,  2012 candidate Rick Santorum said it best: ""I don't think there's anything magical about Tuesdays."" Any teenager will tell you that when your computer starts running slow, you don't sit around and hope that it fixes itself. You upgrade your operating system. The operating system of our nation, our democracy, is broken. There's certainly no silver bullet that will increase American voter participation. But we've voted on the same day for 166 years. Our voter turnout is terrible. It's time the United States upgrades to a voting system 2.0, and we should start with weekend voting.","Jacob Soboroff: The U.S. ranks near the bottom of all nations in voter participation .

"At least 11 suspected al Qaeda militants were killed in Yemen's southern province of Abyan in clashes that erupted Tuesday night and continued for at least 14 hours, according to officials and local residents. A senior security official in Abyan said that government troops shelled militants' hideouts to force them out of Abyan. ""The province turned into a gathering point for terror militants over the last five months. Fighters continue to arrive to Abyan from everywhere,"" said the security official, who is not authorized to talk to media. He added, ""Clashes with the militants were strong over the last four days -- and troops will not step down until the entire province is back in the hands of the government."" Eyewitnesses in the area confirmed that at least four of the killed were foreign fighters, one of them from Saudi Arabia. ""Because clashes were in the middle of the town, the bodies of foreigners laid on the roads for hours,"" said Abdullah Abu Kareem, a local in Zinjibar. Security officials in Abyan told CNN that at least 65 foreign fighters were killed in Abyan since May. ""They started entering the province in large numbers two months ago. Before that, nearly all of the al Qaeda fighters here were Yemeni,"" added Abu Kareem. A senior defense ministry official confirmed that foreigners were among the killed over the last week but said the they are in small numbers compared to the Yemeni fighters. Eyewitnesses told CNN that clashes took place on main roads and destroyed property. Yemen's security has been a worry for the international community for years, and has increased even more after the political stalemate in the country eased communication between terror networks in Yemen. ""Al Qaeda can still be dealt with in Yemen. It is not a great danger yet. However, if this file is not resolved soon, then al Qaeda could be a threat to not only Yemen but the entire region,"" said Mohammed Abulahoum, the president of the opposition Justice and Building party. Ansaar Sharia, an extremist militant group with links to al Qaeda, took over large areas in Abyan province last May after government forces evacuated hundreds of troops from their original posts. More than 100,000 residents left the province months ago and are living in shelters in neighboring Aden and Lahj provinces.","Clashes began Tuesday night and continued for 14 hours .

"Ken Henggeler poured his grief into the thing he loved most: carpentry. Shaken by the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, the retired teacher and longtime resident of Newtown went to his barn, picked up an oak children's bench and went to work. He sawed away, cutting it into two shelves. On one, he made 20 individual slots for candles, one for each slain child. On the other, he placed six candles for the heroic educators. He drove into town, unsure of his destination. At the intersection of Main Street and Sugar Street, he felt a tug. After all, the park there is called The Pleasance. On a tree and nearby street pole, there were two signs. Both read: Pray for Newtown. It was the perfect spot. Just enough room to fit the shelves, and just enough space to let people hug, pray and cry. He and his wife, Darla, placed the shelf for the children in front and the one for the educators in the back, as if still watching over their young students. Henggeler struggled to light each candle. First one. Then two. Then three. ""It was really hitting me,"" he said, ""with how many were involved."" Glimpses of normalcy amid reminders of horror . A car pulled up and a man placed a giant brown teddy bear next to the makeshift shrine. More people came. All wept. The memorial grew and grew. ""We did it to help ourselves, and maybe the town,"" said Henggeler, a resident of 15 years. ""I just wanted to do something. Now, I'm in awe."" The pain in Newtown is suffocating. It's felt on every corner, in every store, in every church. Each fresh news report -- each photo of those precious children, those tiny victims with so much youthful exuberance -- brings another wave of emotions, of sorrow, horror and disbelief. Did you hear a child was shot 11 times? Can you believe the strength of Robbie Parker -- whose daughter Emilie was killed -- to forgive the shooter's family? Why did the shooter take out his rage on such pure innocence? The shooter's name isn't mentioned in conversations. It's just too damn painful. Newtown is grappling with other pressing questions: How does the town handle 26 funerals with only one funeral home? What becomes of the school building, and when do Sandy Hook students begin school again? Soundwaves: Newtown wonders how to heal . Sunday was supposed to be a festive day, filled with holiday revelry as students prepared for the final week before Christmas holiday. Instead, churches overflowed with mourners. Gray clouds stretched from horizon to horizon, a cold drizzle dampening the already somber mood. Newtown was the idyllic New England community -- that Norman Rockwell setting of rolling hills, a town green and an unwavering slice of Americana. The bumper stickers throughout town declared: ""Nicer in Newtown."" And it was. The town of 27,500 had great schools and great people. Notable residents have included 1976 Olympic champion Bruce Jenner, ""Hunger Games"" author Suzanne Collins and cartoonist James Thurber. It served as a bedroom community for Danbury and even New York, with people making the 60-mile commute into the city. Founded in 1711, the town in southwestern Connecticut spans 60 square miles, the fifth largest town in area in the state. Newtown's most gruesome crime story had been a murder charge against a husband accused of killing his wife in 1984; her remains were found beneath the floor of a barn in 2010. But the town was best known for its 100-foot flagpole that sits, literally, in the middle of Main Street. The flagpole also had been the town's greatest source of controversy for nearly 100 years -- declared a road hazard as cars replaced ox wagons. Yet the flagpole survived every attempt by highway authorities to remove it. It also survived a lightning strike and a car that slammed into it going 55 mph. The 12-foot by 18-foot flag now flies at half staff, a sad reminder hovering above the town's center. Headlines in Friday's Newtown Bee reported on vandalism at a cemetery and warned of police plans for a sobriety checkpoint over the weekend. Then, everything changed. Remembering the victims . Librarian Beryl Harrison was celebrating with staff at their annual holiday party last Friday. They were preparing to sing Christmas carols when word came. ""We got a call that there was a lockdown at the schools,"" she said. Word spread. Rumors flew. At one point, they were told the library was in lockdown. ""We thought they were joking: What could we be locking down the library for?"" she asked. ""It just got worse as the day went on."" Many of those precious children had studied in the library's children's area, accompanied by their parents. She had volunteered at the school over the years; both her sons attended school there, too. One librarian, she said, plans to attend at least six funerals. ""We just can't believe it,"" she said in the gentle voice of a well-schooled librarian. ""I hope this doesn't define the town, because it doesn't deserve to be remembered as a place of horror."" Not too far from Harrison's desk, pamphlets were spread out for any resident to take. One began, ""Facts for Families: Children and Grief."" Another provided the number for a grief hot line ""should you or anyone you know need to talk to someone during this very difficult time."" The old town hall will be turned into a grief counseling center Monday, complete with privacy screens. The Newtown Savings Bank has established the Sandy Hook School Support Fund to help families pay for funerals. Librarians across the country have begun pitching in. One book that's being shipped is called ""Tear Soup,"" considered one of the best at helping people, especially children, cope with tragedy. Just up the road, Ken Henggeler stood near the memorial with his wife and 22-year-old stepson, Eric Puffer. Puffer had attended Sandy Hook in first grade. He couldn't help but wonder about that classroom of children. He likely had studied in that exact same room. Puffer had begun his first day at work on Friday, at a DNA sequencing job in Boston. He immediately came home. His friends teach at the school and ""students that they used to have are now dead."" ""I don't know what to even say to them,"" he said. ""It just doesn't make any sense why he would go into school where these kids can't even defend themselves."" Puffer was a senior in high school when the shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, was a sophomore. He doesn't remember much about Lanza other than the way he dressed. ""I would see him in the hallway just dressed up formally with a briefcase, like shirt and tie,"" he said. ""He stood out so much wearing such odd apparel to school when we don't have a dress code."" Puffer glanced at the memorial his stepdad made. ""It's a visual representation. Seeing how many candles there are, it's just terrible."" Jan Philbrick, from the nearby town of Redding, stopped to hug people standing at the memorial. ""This has always been the sweetest of towns. It's held onto its identity,"" she said. ""It's hard to bear for any town, but this is a particularly kind, good, open, balanced place."" She described the memorial as beautiful, and said she stopped at it ""because we're all in this together."" Henggeler accepted a hug. He taught woodworking, architecture and robotics at nearby Danbury High School for 37 years, retiring three years ago. He searched for words as to how the tragedy affected him. ""I taught high school, but I had a special place in my heart for young children."" Weeping, he walked off. Like the rest of town, he cried tear soup. Strangers inspired to honor Newtown victims .","The pain in Newtown is felt on every corner, in every store, in every church .

"The former spokesman for late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi denied a report Saturday that he was captured by Libyan special forces, saying in an audio message that he is not even in the country. Moussa Ibrahim said the report was simply an attempt to distract people from the government's alleged crimes in the city of Bani Walid, a former Gadhafi stronghold that has been the scene of clashes in recent days. Ibrahim was captured in the town of Tarhouna and that he was being taken to the capital of Tripoli, 40 miles to the north, according to the prime minister's media office. Two sources close to Ibrahim told CNN in recent months that the former Gadhafi spokesman was not in Libya, and Ibrahim said the same in the seven-minute video posted to his Facebook page late Saturday. ""We are currently outside of Libya and we have no communication with Bani Walid,"" Ibrahim said in Arabic. ""We are not even close to Bani Walid."" It is the second time this month that Ibrahim has denied a government report of his capture. Official sources also said Saturday that one of Gadhafi's sons, Khamis Gadhafi, was killed after fighting in Bani Walid. Later, Libya Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur tweeted:  ""I apologize for reporting the news of Moussa Ibrahim's capture and the death of Khamis Gadhafi , although I was informed of this by official sources it was not definitively confirmed."" News of his Khamis Gadhafi's death prompted thousands of residents in Tripoli to go out on the streets to celebrate, the state-run Libyan Arab News Agency reported. Omar Hmaidan, the spokesman for the General National Congress, said Khamis Gadhafi was captured in the Bani Walid clashes and injured, and that he died after being taken to a hospital in Misrata, about 60 miles away. Libya's deputy prime minister, Mustafa AbuShagur, said Khamis Gadhafi was killed in Bani Walid and that his body now lies in a Misrata hospital. Khamis Gadhafi's death could not be independently confirmed, however. There were no images of his capture or death, and he was already reported to have been killed in August last year in a battle with rebel forces between Tarhouna and Bani Walid. Moammar Gadhafi was killed a year ago after he was shot in the head while being captured by rebel forces in his hometown of Sirte, Libya. His dictatorship lasted 42 years. The current clashes in Bani Walid have been going on since Wednesday between army troops and pro-government militias circling the city and anti-government fighters inside. As fighting intensified Saturday, those in Bani Walid reported a worsening humanitarian situation, with at least 20 people, including women and children, killed and 75 people wounded. Local spokespeople also said shelling destroyed 40 homes. Outside the city, 22 members of the Libyan national army and a pro-government militia were killed in the fighting Saturday and 200 others were wounded, some critically, medical sources in Misrata told CNN. The head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya expressed his concern Saturday about the developments and the growing civilian casualties from reported indiscriminate shelling. Tarek Mitri also said a mediated settlement is urgently needed. The Bani Walid fighting stems from the death of a Libyan revolutionary fighter credited with capturing Moammar Gadhafi in October last year. The fighter, Omran Shaaban, and two others were kidnapped near Bani Walid in July. He was released two months later, at which point he was in bad physical shape; despite being transferred to a hospital in France, Shaaban died September 24 of the effects of gunshot wounds. The day after his death, the General National Congress authorized the government to arrest those responsible for his kidnapping and torture and to use force if necessary. The National Congress also called for the release of others being detained in Bani Walid, giving those in the city 10 days to comply. Army troops and militias surrounded Bani Walid more than two weeks ago, waiting for orders to enter if they didn't receive a list of those wanted for Shaaban's kidnapping and death. One of the pro-government militias outside the city -- a faction from Misrata, which has a long-standing rivalry with Bani Walid -- managed to take positions overlooking the city early Wednesday. But they then shelled the city, killing seven and wounding about 100 others, according to a spokesman for the Bani Walid fighters. Those fighters responded with mortar rounds that killed four rivals, Misrata medical sources said.","Libyan deputy PM tweets apology for reporting misinformation .

"(CNN) -- More than 1,000 people have died in Syria since the conflict there started in mid-March, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday, a grim milestone that reflects his alarm over the ""escalation of violence"" in the authoritarian Arab country. The unrest, which started percolating in the southern city of Daraa and then spread to the rest of the country, claimed more lives Friday in Hama, the city known for a 1982 government massacre against the civilian population. At least 34 were killed Friday and many more were wounded, according to Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an entity in regular touch with activists in the country. He said all of the deaths came from indiscriminate gunfire toward demonstrators, reviving memories of the decades-old crackdown. One witness, a dentist, told CNN he was taking part in the demonstrations when marchers were ""surprised"" by the military and the shabiha, armed pro-regime elements, opened fire in what he called an ""intense"" situation. The witness provided the names of nine slain people, whose bodies were seized by pro-regime people, and estimated the number of casualties at around 100. Another witness there reported at least one demonstration in which tens of thousands of people took to the streets. The witness said people were heading toward a square in the center of town and chanted, ""Freedom, freedom! National unity! Christians and Muslims are one! Leave, leave"" and, ""The people want the fall of the regime."" That same witness later reported small demonstrations in some areas, with protesters burning tires amid intermittent gunfire. Rahman said the wounded were being treated in private clinics, and while he's unclear about the situation at the city's main hospital, he said the medics he was talking to were in tears. CNN can't independently confirm the accounts. The Baathist government of Hafez al-Assad, who once ruled Syria, crushed the 1982 revolt in Hama against the Sunnis, who are the majority religious group in Syria. Estimates put the death toll then at between 10,000 and 30,000 people; the exact number was never known. The government has been dominated by the al-Assad family's Alawite community, a minority religious group that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The Hama protests erupted after this week's Friday Muslim prayers, which were dedicated to the children who have taken part in the persistent and angry uprising against the Syrian government. At least 51 children have been killed by security forces since the anti-government protests started in mid-March, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. They include Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, the 13-year-old Daraa boy whose killing has captured the world's attention, and a 4-year-old shot in Rastan, a town in restive Homs province. The overall death toll in Rastan has reached 80, the coordination group said, and an activist near Rastan said he heard the sounds of gunfire and artillery overnight. An eyewitness in Rastan said there wasn't a call to prayer Friday, people could not leave their homes and there were no demonstrations because security personnel promptly shelled gatherings when they saw them. Demonstrations after Friday prayers have energized the opposition in Syria and every week there have been different protest themes. The focus on children dovetails with the outcry over Hamza's death. Ban reflected the worldwide outrage toward the Syrian regime when said he is ""deeply troubled by the continued serious violations of human rights, including disturbing reports of the deaths of children under torture, live ammunition and shelling."" He also said that many people have been injured and thousands arrested over nearly three months. While noting the ""announcement by the Syrian authorities of an amnesty and the establishment of a committee to establish a national dialogue,"" Ban emphasized that ""violent repression by security and military forces must end immediately for a genuine and inclusive dialogue to take place and lead to the comprehensive reforms and change called for by the Syrian people."" UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said this week that since mid-March, ""reports of children injured, detained, displaced and at times killed have been increasing."" It said the use of live ammunition on demonstrators has reportedly killed at least 30 children, but it hasn't been able to independently verify casualty figures and the ""circumstances of their death."" It said Syria is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and ""has an obligation to ensure children's right to life"" their safety and other human rights, such as freedom of expression. ""We are particularly disturbed by the recent video images of children who were arbitrarily detained and suffered torture or ill-treatment during their detention, leading in some cases to their death.  We call on the government to thoroughly investigate these reports and ensure that perpetrators of such horrific acts are identified and brought to justice,"" the agency said. Another group caught in the middle of the discord in Syria is the Iraqi refugee community, an estimated 1 million people, according to the International Organization for Migration. They fled to Syria during the war in Iraq. The organization said Friday that there is ""growing concern"" of an influx of people returning to Iraq. It is working with government authorities and other humanitarian groups to prepare for immediate and long-term help for those people and the communities hosting them. There have not been ""significant"" increases in returns, but ""smaller-scale returns have been reported, primarily in Anbar and Baghdad,"" the group said. Migration organization monitors in Baghdad last month learned that ""126 families had returned from Syria due to violence and instability. Interviews are currently being conducted with these and other returnee families to better understand their reasons for return and their future intentions."" ""With nearly one million Iraqis still displaced within the country, the possibility of a major increase in returns from Syria poses a considerable challenge to Iraq's stability,"" said the International Organization for Migration's Iraq chief of mission, Michael Pillinger. ""IOM remains committed to working with the government to closely monitor the return situation and, if necessary, provide immediate assistance to vulnerable returnees,"" he said. CNN's Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini and Joe Sterling contributed to this report .","NEW: ""Violent repression by security and military forces must end immediately,"" Ban says .

"Phil Robertson, a star of A&E's ""Duck Dynasty,"" has been suspended indefinitely after slamming gays in a magazine interview. ""We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty,"" the network said in a statement Wednesday. ""His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.  The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely."" In an interview in the January issue of GQ, Robertson says homosexuality is a sin and puts it in the same category as bestiality and promiscuity.

"Ahead of a grand jury's decision on whether to indict a police officer in the killing of Michael Brown, Missouri has both called in the National Guard and diminished the role of the Ferguson Police Department. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Monday as a precaution, he said, in the event of unrest or violence. It's unknown when the grand jury will hand down a decision on whether to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for his fatal shooting of Brown, a teen. Prosecutors have suggested the grand jury would be done deliberating in mid- to late November. At the national level, the FBI last week issued a bulletin to law enforcement urging vigilance in the days before the Ferguson grand jury decision, according to a law enforcement official. The bulletin did not cite any specific intelligence to suggest there was any ongoing threat to officers. It was based on what had occurred during previous protests. The bulletin expressed concern over possible violence relating to Ferguson protests and warning officers to be vigilant. In addition, it also mentioned that officers should take proper precautions and be vigilant over possible hacking of their personal information, the law enforcement official said. 'Possibility of expanded unrest' Nixon said he signed the executive order because of the ""possibility of expanded unrest."" Nixon said people have the right to protest peacefully but that citizens and businesses must be protected from violence and damage. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said the governor's plan will bring National Guard troops to St. Louis County, where Ferguson is located, but he said their role is designed to be secondary to local law enforcement. As Missouri prepared to deploy the troops -- officials did not say how many -- the role of the Ferguson Police Department in the case of unrest in that city will be reduced. It's her Ferguson -- and it's not all black and white . In the event of unrest in Ferguson, that city's police will not be at the forefront of a response, Nixon said in a teleconference with reporters. The St. Louis County Police Department will lead any response, and they will be the ones coordinating with the National Guard, if needed. The governor expects the role of Ferguson officers will be to handle routine calls not related to protests or unrest.

'That ugliness ... cannot be repeated' ""In the days immediately following Michael Brown's death, peaceful protests were marred by senseless acts of violence and destruction,"" the governor said last week. ""That ugliness was not representative of Missouri, and it cannot be repeated,"" said Nixon. The state of emergency will expire in 30 days unless extended by another order. Slay said the exact positions of the National Guard troops has not been decided, but he said the troops will ""not be on the front lines, confronting protesters."" They will play a secondary role, he said, and will be partnered with local law enforcement anywhere they are posted. While Slay emphasized the back-up role of the National Guard, he said he agreed with the governor's decision to declare a state of emergency. The troops are needed for visibility and deterrence, Slay said. There are too many unknowns about what the grand jury decision might be and how the public may react, he said. Slay said it makes sense to be prepared in case there is violence. The governor said the goal is to keep citizens safe while protecting people's right to protest.

"Still mired in the worst economic crisis since its founding, the European Union will receive its Nobel Peace Prize at a ceremony on Monday in Oslo, Norway.  The three presidents of the EU's main bodies will take the podium together to accept it. The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the choice on October 12, praising the partnership of 27 nations for promoting democracy and reconciliation since World War II.  But the choice has not been without controversy. Within the EU, disparities have persisted between economically strong members -- such as Germany, which has fronted European bailout money -- and economically weaker countries like Greece, suffering from strict austerity measures and crushing unemployment. Three Nobel laureates called the award to the EU ""unlawful"" in a letter of protest in late November.  The Union does not qualify as a peacemaker as defined by the prize's founder, Alfred Nobel, said Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mairead Maguire and Adolfo Perez Esquivel. ""The EU is not seeking to realize Nobel´s demilitarized global peace order,"" they wrote. They asked the Nobel board ""to clarify that it cannot and will not pay the prize from its funds."" European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, EU Council president Herman Van Rompuy and European Parliament president Martin Schulz will represent the 500 million citizens of the union at the ceremony at Oslo City Hall. The EU will allocate the 8 million kronor ($1.2 million) prize money to support educational projects for children in conflict regions and will add to the sum to more than double it, according to a statement on the EU website. The projects are to include providing for protective spaces for children, raising awareness about land mines, and the re-establishment of school systems when conflicts end. In its announcement in October, the Nobel Committee said that the EU ""for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe."" It singled out the peaceful reconciliation between Germany and France -- an amity forged between neighbors who fought each other last century. ""Since 1945, that reconciliation has become a reality,"" the committee said in a statement. ""Today, war between Germany and France is unthinkable."" The committee also focused on the spread of democracy to newer member nations. ""In the 1980s, Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EU. The introduction of democracy was a condition for their membership,"" the committee said. All three countries saw dictatorships in the 20th century, even after World War II. It cited progress in peace made by EU candidate nations, such as the former Yugoslav republics. ""We have to keep in mind that there are not so many years ago since people on this part of Europe killed each other -- awful wars,"" said committee chairman Thorbjorn Jagland, referring to the warfare in Bosnia, Kosovo and Croatia. But in the Balkans, the award has been greeted with a great degree of skepticism. By failing to take a united position at the very earliest stages of the crisis, the EU is widely considered to have contributed to the bloody events that followed. At the same time, its failure to respond more decisively to the conflict once it had broken out is seen by many to have cost tens of thousands of lives, wrote political researcher James Ker-Lindsay of Eurobank EFG in a commentary for CNN. In the face of widespread fear of growing instability, the prize has been seen by many as a pat on the back for the struggling EU. ""The award by the Nobel Committee shows that in these difficult times the European Union remains a force of inspiration for countries and people all over the world and that our global community needs a strong European Union,"" said Barroso. This year's winner was picked from 231 different nominations -- 43 for organizations and the rest for individuals, the Nobel Committee said. Other large organizations have won the Nobel Peace Prize, including the United Nations, Doctors Without Borders, U.N. peacekeeping forces, the U.N. atomic energy agency and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.","Three past laureates have protested the choice of the EU for the peace prize .

"The first overseas tour by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- North America -- was an undisputed triumph. The couple, still basking in the glow of their globally televised wedding, drew vast crowds throughout Canada and California. Will their hosts in Southeast Asia be charmed as easily? Here's my best guess as to where and when the likely highlights will be. The most poignant moment would undoubtedly be at the start of the tour in Singapore. In 1997, the Singapore Botanic Gardens named an orchid after Prince William's mother, Diana, with the intention of presenting it to her on her next visit --  but she died before she had a chance to see it. William completed what Diana could not on the first day of his tour Tuesday. He and his wife also had an orchid named after them. The next stop, Malaysia, will take on a more excitable tone -- and it's all about Catherine. A bigger population means bigger crowds, and the British High Commission is doing what it can to whip up interest by tweeting details of where you can rub shoulders with the couple. The Duchess will give only her second public speech at a hospice in Kuala Lumpur. Public speaking doesn't come naturally to Catherine, but she clearly wants to make the hospice movement a key part of her public role: her first public speech as a royal was at East Anglia's Children's Hospices, the hospice charity she supports in the UK. Catherine will be more comfortable on Thursday night for what's set to be the most glamorous evening of the tour: full frocks and rocks for a state dinner hosted by the King of Malaysia, whose name -- Almu'tasimu Billahi Muhibbuddin Tuanku Alhaj Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah -- takes some getting used to. Luckily for the Duke and Duchess, the king -- who attended Oxford University -- speaks fluent English. From the city to the jungles of Borneo on Saturday and the couple will visit a conservation project in Sabah, recommended to them by Prince Charles, who shares a passion for the environment with his eldest son. Royal photographers are holding out for an encounter with orangutans as the couple negotiate rope bridges high up in the forest canopy. On Sunday, expect a big South Pacific welcome in the Solomon Islands and a canoe trip to paradise. After a series of formal engagements, the Duke and Duchess will spend the night at the luxury Tuvanipupu resort before heading off to their final destination: the remote island of Tuvalu, where the Queen is head of state and her husband, Prince Philip, is revered as a god. When William's grandparents visited Tuvalu they were carried on the shoulders of warriors, creating one of the abiding images of the Queen's 60-year reign. The Duke and Duchess are likely to get the same treatment when they arrive there next week as they cement their role as the next generation of British -- and Tuvaluan -- royalty.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hope to repeat success of their North America tour .

"On a wet day in Turkey's bustling capital, Ankara, healthcare workers busily go about their daily tasks. A temperature is taken here, a patient is wheeled into an operation room there while hospital doctors shuffle along their rounds. Turkey's population is over 74 million and growing. Every citizen, whether young or old, will need medical care at some point in their lives. The need to upgrade and build new facilities to meet growing demand is hence very real -- a fact not lost on the country's leaders. The Turkish government initiated a health transformation program in 2003 financed by both private and public funds. There are currently 36 medical facilities under development with the giant Bilkent Integrated Healthcare Campus in Ankara earmarked as the flagship project -- a site for science and knowledge. On completion, it will be one of the largest hospital complexes in the world, housing 1,300 doctors and double that number of nurses. Bilkent will also feature a hotel resort and conference area. Hopes are high that the facility will cater for a large number of medical tourists as well. ""This is the largest project of Turkey ever under the republic era,"" said Mehmet Ali of Dia Developers, the development company charged with taking Bilkent from the drawing board into construction. ""It's a historic moment for us."" So far, 86,000 iron rods and 900,000 tonnes of concrete have been used to build the 1.2 million square meter campus. Of the 35 million tourists who visited Turkey in 2013, meanwhile, close to 200,000 came for surgical procedures from cancer treatments to hair transplants. Neslihan Aybar, the regional director for Aecom, an architecture and engineering firm that specializes in healthcare projects, says part of the Bilkent strategy is to tap into this market. ""We have seen plenty of patients coming from outside of Turkey especially to the healthcare facilities in Istanbul,"" Aybar said. Challenges remain in ensuring these well laid plans come to fruition, however. Medical students at the nearby Ankara University will be key to the success of the transformation program. But graduate numbers still lag below the amount of staff needed. According to Turkish health minister, Mehmet Muezzinoglu, the powers that be have a plan in place to address this issue. ""At the moment we don't have a high number of health professionals working in Turkey,"" Muezzinoglu admits. ""(But) we plan to recruit highly qualified health professionals, including doctors and nurses trained in the west, especially Greece and wider Europe."" The government is pushing to implement its healthcare reforms by 2018. By then the Bilkent is expected to be serving 25,000 patients each day. It's an ambitious timetable given the staffing and training obstacles that must be overcome. ""We firmly believe that we will succeed ... based on our professional experience, based on our potential and the physical infrastructure we have been establishing,"" Muezzinoglu said. ""By the end of 2017 we are planning to complete it by 70% and by 2018 it's going to be accomplished 100%.""","Turkey investing in far-reaching healthcare facilities .

"Friends reacted with relief and joy Wednesday to the news that 32-year-old aid worker Jessica Buchanan had been freed after three months in captivity in Somalia. ""We are overwhelmed with gratitude,"" said Don Meyer, president of Valley Forge Christian College in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, from where Buchanan was graduated in 2007. She and her colleague, Poul Thisted, 60,  were rescued by U.S. special forces in an overnight raid in which nine gunmen were killed, the U.S. military said Wednesday. Buchanan's family has declined to speak about the rescue until after they speak with her, but others who know her portrayed her as someone passionate about making a difference. It may have been that passion that led her to a job as a regional educational adviser for the Danish Refugee Council's demining unit. More details on the rescue . She had attended a couple of other institutions before settling in at Valley Forge Christian College. There, she undertook one of the school's most rigorous academic programs, early childhood education. It was a semester of student teaching in Nairobi that opened Buchanan's heart to Africa. ""She did a semester of student teaching in Africa and that experience just planted in her a love and passion for Africa,"" Meyer said. That proved to be a turning point in her life. ""She could hardly talk about Africa without tears in her eyes,"" he said. The school where she served as a student teacher -- the Rosslyn Academy in Nairobi, Kenya -- hired her once she was graduated and she worked there as a classroom teacher for two years. Meyer said that, around this time, Buchanan met the man who became her husband and switched jobs. According to the Danish Refugee Council, Buchanan and Thisted were kidnapped in the town of Galkayo in central Somalia on October 25 during a visit to a project site in the area. Officials said that Buchanan's declining health triggered the rescue operation, but Meyer, who spoke with her family Wednesday, said those reports are overstated. ""She is strong, she is healthy, she is in very good condition,"" he said. The Valley Forge Christian College community, with about 1,100 students in suburban Philadelphia, kept close tabs on the aid workers' kidnapping, he said. They were advised of the incident by the family from the beginning, but were asked to avoid mentioning it publicly. Meyer said they were made sure the cameras that broadcast online the school's daily services were turned off when they prayed for Buchanan. Buchanan presented Prof. Glenn McClure with a carved elephant after a return from Kenya to thank him for helping her land her teaching job, he said. ""It's on my bureau and I see it often,"" he told CNN. ""I just breathe a prayer; say 'Help Jessica get through this.'"" Prof. David Scolforo's daughter, Christine, is a friend and former roommate to Buchanan. ""Every day you woke up wondering, 'Is this the day she's going to be free or this this going to be the day when you get news saying she's not coming home forever?'"" he said. Some of her college friends said they did not even know Buchanan had been kidnapped until news of her rescue broke. ""It was a shock, tears of sadness that that happened to her and tears of happiness that she was rescued by the Navy SEALs,"" said Clarimil Christian-Delker, who studied with her. Buchanan is a devoted Christian whose passion for helping those less fortunate took her to Africa, Christian-Delker said. ""Every time we spoke about doing God's work overseas, her eyes would light up,"" she added. The women met nine years ago, and when Christian-Delker faced a family tragedy, Buchanan encouraged her via Facebook. Christian-Delker said she did not suspect that Buchanan's recent silence on the social media site was a sign that she was living out her own tragedy.","""Help Jessica get through this,"" Professor Glenn McClure used to say .

"The fallout from the Susan G. Komen foundation's decision not to renew funding for some Planned Parenthood projects has led to threatened resignations, angry press statements and a letter from Senate Democrats. Now the mayor of New York has gotten involved. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he is giving a $250,000 matching gift to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America to help make up for the loss of funding announced Tuesday by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, his office said Thursday. ""Politics have no place in health care,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""Breast cancer screening saves lives, and hundreds of thousands of women rely on Planned Parenthood for access to care. We should be helping women access that care, not placing barriers in their way."" He was referring to Planned Parenthood's announcement Tuesday that the Komen Foundation had ""succumbed to political pressure"" by cutting its funding for breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood amid increased scrutiny by Congress over how Planned Parenthood provides abortion services. Bloomberg's gift comes on top of the $400,000 that Planned Parenthood reported raising online from 6,000 donors the first 24 hours after the announcement. Planned Parenthood's loss attracted moral support when CREDO, which describes itself as the largest corporate donor to Planned Parenthood, announced Thursday that 250,000 of its members had signed a petition urging the Komen Foundation to reverse its decision. ""The move is clearly connected to attempts by Republicans in Congress to defund Planned Parenthood,"" the organization said in a statement. ""In responding to questions about its decision, the foundation cited as its rationale a sham 'investigation' into Planned Parenthood launched by Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns as one of the most militant anti-choice members of Congress."" In September, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, on which the Florida congressman sits, began an investigation into Planned Parenthood over the organization's ""compliance with federal restrictions on funding abortions."" In Washington, at least 22 Senate Democrats signed a letter calling on Komen to reconsider its decision. ""This troubling decision threatens to reduce access to necessary, life-saving services,"" it said. ""It would be tragic if any woman -- let alone thousands of women -- lost access to these potentially life-saving screenings because of a politically motivated attack."" ""People respond powerfully when they see politics interfering with women's health,"" said Andrea Hagelgans, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, on Wednesday. ""That's why we've seen a tremendous outpouring of support."" But the American Life League said in a statement that the Komen Foundation's decision was justified. ""PPFA is currently the focus of a congressional investigation, and multiple affiliates are under state investigations,"" it said. ""Planned Parenthood operatives are lashing out at Komen across the Internet and throughout the media, in what appears to be a coordinated effort to paint Komen's policy as cowardly and politically motivated."" The Komen Foundation denied Thursday that its decision stemmed from politics. ""We've always had the right to cancel contracts for organizations that came under investigation for potential wrongdoing,"" said Nancy Brinker, CEO and founder of the group. In all, grants were not renewed to 16 of 19 Planned Parenthood clinics, she said. ""We don't base our funding decisions on emotions or politics or whether one side or another will be pleased."" Brinker was a political appointee of the George W. Bush administration, in which she served as U.S. ambassador to Hungary and as chief of protocol. Susan G. Komen was Brinker's sister. Komen Foundation President Liz Thompson said the funds will be redirected ""to other programs in our communities that can provide these services more directly."" She said there was ""amazing consensus"" among foundation board members about the decision, which was made ""over the better part of two years."" But that consensus did not include Dr. Kathy Plesser, a member of the foundation's medical advisory board in New York, who said she will resign if the decision is not overturned. ""I cannot as a physician and advocate for women's health continue to be a part of the organization if it continues in this direction,"" Plesser said. ""A big part of what Komen does is reach underserved communities of women. With this decision, they're not living up to this mission."" Mollie Williams, the group's managing director of community health programs, left Komen this month. ""It was an honor to oversee and expand their public health efforts during my six years there,"" Williams said.  ""At the same time, I respect the work of Planned Parenthood, including their lifesaving efforts to detect cancer in its earliest stages. The divide between these two very important organizations saddens me."" It wasn't immediately clear whether she had resigned.  Thompson said it's policy not to release information about employees other than  start and end dates. Deb Anthony, executive director of Komen's Los Angeles County chapter, did resign, the foundation said Thursday. But Komen denied that Anthony's resignation was about the decision. ""The Komen LA County Executive Director Deborah Anthony did submit her resignation in December 2011, effective April 1, 2012.  Her stated reasons did not include the recent grant making criteria changes by Komen's global organization that impact Planned Parenthood,"" said a statement from Elizabeth Berger, president of the Los Angeles County chapter.  ""We are deeply concerned by implications that there is any correlation."" Thompson said Stearns' investigation ""has little to do"" with the grant decision. Brinker said the ""quality of the grants"" was a factor. ""We like to have direct care being given,"" she said. ""We have decided not to fund, wherever possible, pass-through grants. In other words, we were giving them money; they were sending women for mammograms. They do not own mammography equipment. They do not do these grants within their clinics. They just send them out for screening and treatment and diagnosis. What we like to have are clinics that we can directly fund."" Asked how many other grantees provide abortion services, she said, ""That's not something that we ask people about."" Brinker said donations to Komen were up 100% over the past two days. Planned Parenthood said that funding from the Komen Foundation had largely paid for breast exams at local affiliates. In the past five years, grants from the group have supported 170,000 screenings, about 4% of the total exams performed at Planned Parenthood health centers nationwide, according to the group. In a statement Thursday, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Cecile Richards, expressed gratitude for Bloomberg's gift. ""This contribution will help ensure that politics don't interfere with women having access to health care,"" she said. ""People all across the country have stepped forward in the last 48 hours to offer help and support, and the mayor's donation will help ensure that no woman is denied breast cancer services because of right-wing political pressure campaigns."" Bloomberg, an independent who was first elected mayor as a Republican, is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, a multinational financial media company.","Officials leave Komen foundation .

"The scope and legality of the government's warrantless electronic surveillance programs was discussed Tuesday as a federal appeals court reviewed a lower U.S. court's injunction that would block collection of data from two plaintiffs who are suing . Activist Larry Klayman, an attorney who heads the group ""Freedom Watch,"" filed suit last year based on published reports of wrongdoing from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The former contractor with the National Security Agency accused authorities of misusing some of the capabilities he observed, and acting without a judicial or statutory basis. Klayman, using himself as an aggrieved party from the surveillance, used the lawsuit to accuse the government of conducting ""a secret and illegal government scheme to intercept and analyze vast quantities of domestic telephonic communications,"" along with communications ""from the internet and electronic service providers."" Tuesday he said he has the standing to bring the suit as a customer of Verizon, one of the companies known to be cooperating with warrantless surveillance. But when the appeals panel asked him for documented proof he had been targeted, Klayman said only that the broad scope of the surveillance made it likely. The other plaintiff is Charles Strange, whose son Michael was an NSA cryptologist and Navy SEAL in Afghanistan in 2011 when he was killed in the downing of his helicopter by insurgents. The father told reporters he has been the target of secret intelligence gathering because he's been asking questions about the circumstances surrounding his son's death. Both men late last year won a preliminary injunction that would have barred the government from collecting data on them, and it ordered authorities to destroy any data already gathered. But the District Court judge immediately stayed his order pending the appeal that was heard Tuesday, because of ""significant national security interests"" that could be affected. Justice Department attorney Thomas Byron, defending the government, asked the appeals court judges to reverse the injunction, saying a phone company's business records are not protected by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches. Byron said there was no documentation that any records gathered were ""intrusively acquired."" He said Congress passes laws to protect privacy, such as for hospital records and banking, and that the government's surveillance is constrained by the provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with activities judged by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Klayman responded by pointing out the government's admission of as many as 2,000 errors in how NSA conducted warrantless surveillance.  ""It's false to say 'we don't get into peoples' underwear,'"" Klayman said, asserting the indiscriminate collection alone is an intrusion he considers unconstitutional. After the hearing, Klayman told reporters on the courthouse steps that he expects a ruling early next year, and that he expects the case to go the Supreme Court. He called warrantless surveillance by the government a case of monumental importance. ""Just the inception of acquiring that information -- they're not entitled to it -- without any showing of probable cause, or reasonable suspicion of contact with terrorists, that's the problem. And that's a constitutional violation under our Fourth Amendment and our First Amendment."" Klayman acknowledged in court he's been a controversial figure over the years.  A judge asked him if he feels he is being personally targeted.  ""I'd be surprised if I'm not,"" he replied. Among his recent lawsuits is one filed in October accusing the Obama administration of supporting terrorism because of what he considers ""reckless and grossly negligent"" handling of the Ebola crisis. Klayman, in that lawsuit, said the lack of travel restrictions from areas affected by the Ebola crisis provides an opportunity for terrorists to use the disease for germ warfare.","Justice Department says safeguards ensure compliance with the law .

"Nigeria, Africa's largest oil producer, ended oil subsidies on New Year's Day that had kept gasoline prices artificially low. The cost of a liter of gasoline shot up from 65 naira (40 cents) to at least 141 naira (86 cents) virtually overnight. Furious Nigerians have since taken to the streets, staging 'Occupy Nigeria' protests and mass demonstrations across the country. Police have responded forcefully with many arrests. At least one person has died amid the unrest: 23-year-old student Muyideen Mustafa was allegedly hit by a police bullet in Ilorin, Kwara State, on January 03. Are you there? Send your images or video . A police spokesman in Kano State also confirmed to CNN that they fired teargas into a crowd staging a midnight protest last week in order to disperse a  largely peaceful demonstration by Muslims and Christians. What is the background to the decision? The government is attempting to deregulate the oil sector in the country and believes subsidizing consumption of oil is a drain on public finances that will prove unsustainable in the long term. Many argue that the only people the subsidy benefited were fuel importers. The government says the move will save the Treasury more than 1 trillion naira ($6.13 billion) in 2012. Reuben Abati, spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan, told CNN the money saved from removing the subsidy will help to improve public amenities and build much-needed infrastructure in a country with poor roads, lack of power and non-functioning refineries. Nigeria produces around 2.4 million barrels of crude oil a day but imports roughly 70% of its gasoline from countries as far afield as the United Kingdom and Venezuela, because its own refineries are inoperative after years of corruption-fueled neglect. Why has it caused such an outcry? Nigerians are angry because they believe the government has introduced the plan without any regard to how it will affect the cost of living in the country. They say they are already experiencing undue hardship as a result of the move, which they say has already affected the cost of transport, food, medicine, rent and school fees. Feyi Fawehinmi, an accountant and analyst, told CNN the government's abrupt move was like having a ""tooth pulled without a plier."" ""When you have so much poverty, a lot of business and lives have been built on petrol being at N65, which is not exactly cheap, even at subsidized rates. People are just not moving out of poverty quickly in Nigeria. There is an economic case but this is not something that can be quantified economically,"" he said. ""The government cannot tell how many businesses will be ruined or even how many people will die,"" Fawehinmi continued. ""The impact will be so wide-ranging. There should have been a plan to remove this in a sensible way, not in this crude manner."" he said. Many Nigerians see the subsidy, which gives them the cheapest gas price in the region, as the only benefit of being an oil producing country. Most live in grinding poverty and on less than $2 a day. There is little infrastructure, high unemployment and only intermittent electric power. Nigerians routinely have to buy generators to provide power and supporters of the subsidies say some may be left in the dark because they simply cannot afford fuel costs. Is there an economic case for the removal? Those who support ending  the subsidy removal say the move is long overdue because of simple economics. They argue that Nigerians have been paying N65 (40 cents) per liter for at least five years, while petrol prices have risen significantly elsewhere in the world, which means the government foots the bill when worldwide oil prices go up. They also say that the only people who get any real benefit from the subsidy are those involved in importing oil. The Nigerian oil traders import refined gasoline, claim the subsidy and then sell it on at a higher rate to neighboring countries. How will Nigerians benefit from any money saved? There is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure it says it will. Nigeria is regularly voted among the most corrupt countries in the world and citizens complain that the money saved will be siphoned by a few and salted away into off-shore accounts, as has happened in the past. They also bemoan the high salaries and daily allowances of government officials. According to Transparency for Nigeria website, the country's senators receive an annual pay of N182m ($1.2m). The national monthly minimum wage is set at N18,000 ($112), although all Nigerians do not currently receive this basic wage. While at the 2012 national expenditure reading in December, N992.57m alone ($6.2m) was allocated for the President and Vice President's annual food and general catering services. The sum includes the cost of purchasing foodstuffs, catering supplies and kitchen equipment for the president and his deputy's offices and residences, according to the 2012 Appropriation Bill presented to the Nigerian National Assembly. However, government spokesman Reuben Abati told CNN he understood Nigerians' concerns regarding a lack of trust because they had been let down by previous administrations. He added that the president has set up a high-powered committee to ensure money saved from ending the subsidy would not be misappropriated. What will happen next? Mass unrest and instability in the country is expected over the next few days, with citizens calling for a return to the cheap prices. So far, the government has refused but has announced the ""immediate distribution of 1600 mass transit buses to major cities."" Labor union leaders have called for national strikes and protests that they hope will lead to a mass shutdown across the country. ""We call on all Nigerians to participate actively in this movement to rescue our country. The emphasis is on peaceful protests, rallies and strikes while refusing to be intimidated,"" the unions' statement said. There are also calls from some quarters for President Jonathan to be impeached.","Nigeria's government removed fuel subsidy on New Year's day ending .

"(CNN)The next phase in the underwater search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has begun. The GO Phoenix search vessel arrived in the search area in the southern Indian Ocean and started its search Monday morning (Sunday evening ET), the Australian Transport Safety Board (ATSB) said. It marks the beginning of a potentially year-long search operation, spearheaded by Australian authorities. The ship, and two others which will arrive within the month, will conduct detailed sonar sweeps in an attempt to locate wreckage of the plane. The disappearance of MH370 is arguably the greatest mystery in the history of commercial flight, with an extensive search failing to turn up a single piece of definitive evidence of its whereabouts. Here's where we are with the search for MH370. What happened initially? Around 1:30 a.m. on March 8, air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lost contact with Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER, over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. The plane's transponder, which identifies the aircraft and relays details like altitude and speed to controllers, stopped transmitting, and the passenger jet seemingly disappeared without a trace. Planes and ships from 14 countries initially searched areas of the South China Sea, the south of Vietnam and the Malaysian peninsula. The search was then widened and then shifted location as it was determined, through careful analysis of aircraft performance, cross-referenced with data from the Immarsat ""handshakes,"" that the plane diverted south. Since then resources have been focused on a swathe of the Indian Ocean, around 2000 km (1242 miles) off the west coast of Australia, the so-called ""seventh arc."" Continued analysis of the satellite data, along with a better understanding of the communication between aircraft and satellite and of aircraft performance limits has enabled investigators to further refine the search areas. Although search teams have been focusing along the seventh arc or ""partial handshake,"" where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel, for months, it's only within the past several weeks that investigators have shifted their focus further south.  It is in this area that GO Phoenix has begun its underwater search. What has been done in the Indian Ocean so far? After seven weeks of intense but fruitless searching, the international air effort to find the plane ended in late April, shifting the focus to an underwater search. Hopes were raised in May as radio beacon signals -- ""pings"" -- were thought to have been detected, but the area where the pings were thought to originate from was discounted in May. Since the active search was postponed, the Australian government has been creating an accurate survey of the sea floor in the search area. One ship, from Dutch surveying company Fugro, continues to map the underwater topography. To date, over 111,000 square kilometers of the wide search area have been analyzed and mapped by the Australian government and its contractors. The existing data for the sea floor in that area is at a very low resolution, says Stuart Minchin, head of the Environmental Geoscience Division of Geoscience Australia, the agency overseeing the mapping process. Getting an accurate picture is crucial as the drones that will be conducting the underwater sonar search in the upcoming phase will need to be guided with precision to avoid damage. ""In the second phase of the search, which involves towing devices close to the sea bed to get a very fine resolution picture of what's down there it's important to have that level of detail so we don't run into objects,"" he said. ""It's a long way from shore at very significant depths so it's a logistical challenge. It's unprecedented in terms of doing a survey of this size and in this remote location."" It has been an involved, long and difficult process -- back in March, Mark Binskin, vice chief of the Australian Defence Force, said ""We're not searching for a needle in a haystack, we're still trying to define where the haystack is."" Authorities are confident that they have accurately identified the correct search areas now. Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner and CEO of the ATSB, the agency leading the search, told CNN's David Molko that, should satellite analysis have led his team to the right spot, the current technology would locate aircraft wreckage. ""What we'd say is we've probably limited it to a small number of haystacks, and we have very good techniques for detecting needles in those haystacks,"" he said. ""We have high confidence that if we've got the right haystack, we'll find the needle in it."" In a statement, the ATSB also said that the enhanced data from the detailed mapping will greatly assist the search teams. ""The recently acquired (underwater survey) data has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,"" the statement read. The survey also reveals finer features that were not visible in previous, low-resolution survey data. At the request of the Malaysian government, the Australian government -- in particular the ATSB -- has been tasked with leading what will almost certainly turn out to be a long, painstaking search. ""The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated,"" the ATSB says. ""It involves vast areas of the Indian Ocean with only limited known data and aircraft flight information."" What happens next? The Australian government said in August that it has picked Fugro Survey, a Dutch company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search, along with a vessel, the GO Phoenix, supplied by the Malaysian government. The latter arrived at its assigned search zone late Sunday and deployed towed sonar to begin the search on Monday. It will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to Fremantle, in western Australia, for resupply. The search vessel will be joined by the two Dutch ships, the Fugro Discovery and the Fugro Equator, later in the month. The Equator is currently finishing up detailed mapping of the search zones. ""The current plan envisages that we will progressively cover our priority search areas over the course of about a year,"" the ATSB's Dolan told CNN by phone. What we know is that the aircraft will be found close to the arc, the final attempt at communication between the aircraft systems and ground stations. We've done progressively more refined and detailed analysis of the other satellite information that has enabled us to prioritise (search areas) along that arc. ""We have a high probability that the aircraft will be found at the southern end of that long arc.  We now know in considerable detail what almost all of the search area looks like, we've mapped these in detail. We can tow our sonar equipment about 100 meters (329 ft) from the ocean floor in confidence that we won't run into any unexpected obstacles."" What happens if/when the wreckage is found? Dolan says that it largely depends on where, and how, the plane is found. The Australian contingent, he says, is still discussing plans with their Malaysian colleagues on how to proceed in the event of a positive identification of plane wreckage. ""If you have a debris field identified, to be able to know what to do with it requires careful mapping and photographing, which will take up to a month,"" he says. ""Until we've got that largely completed we won't understand the sequence of what we're able to do in relation to wreckage and human remains."" What happens if they don't find it within the current search timetable? There is AUS $60 million ($52.8 mil) earmarked by the Australian government for mapping and underwater search, and Australian expenditure is to be matched by Malaysian government. It is a significant resource upon which to draw, Dolan says. However, ""if at the end of that we haven't found the aircraft, then it's really going to be a matter for governments to decide what's next what resources they might wish to supply and I can't really preempt what that discussion might be."" A new air of ""cautious optimism"" pervades the search teams, yet it seems that there are still plenty of uncertainties to overcome before the MH370 mystery is finally put to rest.

"It is the trial of the century for Egypt. Egyptians crowded around televisions, struggling to glimpse former President Honsi Mubarak in a white prisoner's uniform when the court session began on August 3, 2011. Despite being the fasting holy month of Ramadan, hundreds of people braved the scorching heat and inevitable thirst to bare witness to these historic proceedings on a large monitor erected by the government outside the courthouse. The world's media was also in attendance trying to scavenge any scrap of information about the man who ruled Egypt for more than 30 years. The police rolled Mubarak into the courtroom on a hospital gurney and despite his sons' best efforts to shield their father, the image of a tired, sickly old man shot around the world. This was the first time we had seen the former president since handing over power on February 10, 2011. The trial would last almost a year during which rumors constantly swirled about Mubarak's health. Fueled by his lawyer, Mubarak always seemed to be on his deathbed. Numerous media reports also emerged of his death only later to be proven false. They got so bad that it became an Egyptian joke: ""Mubarak's doctor visited him in the hospital and told him, 'you have to stop dying, it isn't good for your health.'"" During the year of his trial, Egypt would witness the dramatic rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, which would come to dominate the political scene. The organization, once heavily repressed by Mubarak, would sweep parliamentary elections garnering almost 50% of the seats. The trial's proceeding concluded almost a month before President Elect Mohamed Morsy, from the Muslim Brotherhood, would be sworn into office. The verdict on June 2, 2012 reflected the times. Once again the world stopped to watch what would be the fate of the first Arab leader to stand trial since the beginning of the Arab Spring. The judge found Mubarak and co-defendants guilty on charges of failing to stop the killings of protesters. They were given life in prison, which in Egypt is 25 years. An 84-year-old Mubarak wouldn't see the outside of a prison again. The defendants appealed and the retrial began in January 2013. It would take more than 50 sessions to arrive at a verdict but this time Mubarak's trial would be overshadowed by growing turmoil in the country. Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court dissolved the first democratically elected parliament after declaring it unconstitutional. The Egyptian military ousted Morsy on July 3, 2013 following another popular uprising. Security forces began arresting the Muslim Brotherhood's leadership and thousands of their followers. The following August, security forces would clear Morsy supporters from two squares in Egypt resulting in more than 1,000 people killed. Morsy now stands trial over the death of protesters as well as an array of other charges. From the chaos emerged Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. He served as the head of military intelligence under Mubarak and was promoted by Morsy to be minister of defense. He oversaw the overthrow of Morsy and handover of power to Adly Mansour, although many believed al-Sisi remained the power behind the throne. In May of this year, Egyptians elected him president and thus the fourth recent leader of Egypt. Today's verdict reflects the times. Fewer people were outside the courthouse for the trial. Small bands of protesters took to the streets. Most Egyptians vented their anger online. Talking to Mubarak supporters and protesters on both sides, they did agree on one thing. They told me the revolution is dead. But the drama isn't over yet; the prosecution has one last appeal available.","Mubarak was convicted in 2012 for the deaths of protesters, but was given a new trial .

"(CNN) -- Hall of Fame football linebacker Lawrence Taylor pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he raped a 16-year-old girl in Rockland County, New York, a court official told CNN. The former New York Giants star was arraigned Tuesday before Rockland County Judge William K. Nelson. Taylor has been charged with third-degree rape for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone younger than 17 and third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage victim $300 to have sex. Taylor is free on $75,000 bail. Taylor, 51, was arrested in a Ramapo, New York, Holiday Inn room on May 6, a few hours after the alleged rape took place, authorities said at the time. Ramapo is about 30 miles northwest of New York City. Ramapo Town Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence and Police Chief Peter Brower told reporters after the incident that the alleged victim was a runaway from the Bronx and had been brought to Ramapo by a pimp. The girl texted an uncle after she returned to New York City the next day, and the uncle notified the New York City police, prompting the arrest of Taylor and the alleged pimp, St. Lawrence said. Taylor was cooperative with authorities, he said. Taylor's attorney, Arthur Aidala, said at an earlier bail hearing: ""My client did not have sex with anybody. Period. Lawrence Taylor did not rape anybody."" Aidala said that ""no violence, no force, no threat, no weapons"" were involved in the case. He noted the rape charge against Taylor was for consensual sex with a minor and said Taylor denied it. Taylor was a 10-time all-pro linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993 after earning All-American honors at the University of North Carolina. He played on two Super Bowl champion teams and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which noted that he ""redefined the way the outside linebacker position was played."" However, Taylor was twice suspended by the National Football League for substance abuse and battled a cocaine addiction long after retirement, resulting in several arrests and a downward spiral that he chronicled in a 2003 autobiography. After kicking drugs, he worked as a sports commentator and appeared as a contestant on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" in 2009.","NEW: Lawrence Taylor denies charges at arraignment .

"U.S. aircraft have concluded a third round of strikes against an al Qaeda cell inside Syria, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the just-completed mission told CNN on Thursday. The officials said it was a small number of strikes and that the targets included at least one top operative of what's known as the Khorasan Group. The sources would not say who was targeted. They said it is too early to have an assessment of the strikes' results. Khorasan is a group of hard-core al Qaeda operatives, many of whom moved to Syria from Pakistan in the last few years. The U.S. government has expressed concern about the group's ability to make bombs that can get past security screening in airports and elsewhere. It targeted the Khorasan Group with a series of strikes in Syria in September. Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland, as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time. The group has ""suffered"" setbacks as a result of the strikes, which have killed a number of fighters and forced it to spread out, one law enforcement official who has seen the intelligence assessments said Thursday. Another U.S. official said ""some have been killed. They're being hunted down and they have to think about what they do and that's disruptive."" At the same time, some of the Khorasan leadership is still believed to be alive and the group continues to pose a threat, according to the officials, who say some are still in Syria, actively plotting against the United States.","Strikes target what's known as the Khorasan Group, officials say .

"(CNN) -- The United States is doing what it must to ""take the fight to terrorists,"" leading a coalition of Arab nations in a series of airstrikes against the so-called Islamic State terror group in Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday. At the same time, the United States took action -- on its own -- against another terrorist organization, the Khorasan Group. Obama described its members as ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria."" U.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets. The plots against the United States were discovered by the intelligence community in the past week, an intelligence source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The source did not say what the target may have been, but said the plot potentially involved a bomb made of a nonmetallic device like a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material. A plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes ""was just one option they were looking at,"" a U.S. official said. ""Once again, it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,"" Obama said in televised remarks from the White House. Concern over a possible backlash by the terror groups has prompted the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to issue a bulletin warning law enforcement agencies to be on heightened alert for lone-wolf terror attacks on U.S. soil in wake of the airstrikes, a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the warning told CNN. The bulletin calls for vigilance as well as scrutinizing social media for anyone encouraging violence in response to the strikes, according to a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the warning's contents. It points to the use of social media as a tactic by ISIS to spread its message and call for violence. It also advises agencies to look for changes in appearance or behavior in those they're tracking, the official said. Terror group: 'Turk' is dead . The airstrikes, meanwhile, appear to have taken a toll on another terror group, killing the leader of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, according to a statement released by the group. It identified the leader as Abu Yousef al-Turki, also known as ""The Turk."" The al-Nusra statement posted on Twitter was accompanied by a so-called proof-of-death -- a photograph -- of the former fighter. CNN cannot independently verify al-Nusra's claims, but the monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the terror group was among those targeted during the airstrikes. The United States has not identified al-Nusra as a group targeted in the strikes. The airstrikes that began early Tuesday morning local time ""were only the beginning,"" Pentagon spokesman, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, said. He declined to comment about future military operations. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan took part in airstrikes on ISIS targets, the U.S. military said. Qatar played a supporting role, the U.S. military said. Saying he ""made clear that America would act as part of a broad coalition,"" Obama said: ""That's exactly what we've done."" ""The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone,"" the President said. Obama met hours later with officials from the five Arab nations who make up the coalition. There was an a strong agreement that ""the campaign against ISIS was a long-term one and they were all in it for the long haul,"" a senior State Department official with knowledge of the meeting said. ""Everyone at the table agreed there are times in the world when you need to take a stand,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. But Syria warned the United States not to repeat the ""American fiasco in Iraq by undertaking the same kind of blind military attacks,"" Bashar Ja'afari, Syria's ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN. What is the Khorasan Group? Strikes came in three waves . The airstrikes came in three waves, with coalition partners participating in the latter two, Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville Jr. said Tuesday. The first wave, which mostly targeted the Khorasan Group, started at 3:30 a.m. (8:30 p.m. ET Monday) and involved U.S. ships firing missiles into eastern and northern Syria. The second wave, 30 minutes later, involved planes striking northern Syria, with targets including ISIS headquarters, training camps and combat vehicles. The third wave, begun shortly after 7 a.m., involved planes targeting ISIS training camps and combat vehicles in eastern Syria, Mayville said. It's too early to say what effect the U.S. strikes had against the Khorasan Group, Mayville said. Maps: Arab nations join U.S., expand fight against terror to Syria . The airstrikes against ISIS focused primarily on the city of Raqqa, the declared capital of ISIS' self-proclaimed Islamic State. The operation began with a flurry of Tomahawk missiles launched from the sea, followed by attacks from bomber and fighter aircraft, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. The goal: Taking out ISIS' ability to command, train and resupply its militants. In all, 200 pieces of ordnance were dropped by coalition members, and four dozen aircraft were used, a U.S. official told CNN. About 150 weapons used were precision-guided munitions. The United States fired 47 Tomahawk missiles, eight of them against Khorasan targets. The strikes marked the first time the United States used F-22 Raptor stealth aircraft in a combat role. The military has previously run into problems with the aircraft. The number of casualties was not immediately clear. But U.S. Central Command said the strikes damaged or destroyed ISIS targets including fighters, training compounds, command-and-control facilities, a finance center and supply trucks. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 70 ISIS militants were killed and more than 300 were wounded. But CNN and other news outlets were unable to confirm the figures. Celebration amid fear . For months, civilians in Raqqa have been living under the harsh rule of ISIS after militants took over their city, which had been one of Syria's most liberal cities. The group now controls much of their lives, imposing a strict brand of Sharia law and doling out barbaric punishments, such as beheadings and crucifixions. Abo Ismail, an opposition activist inside Raqqa, said Tuesday that residents were elated to see the U.S. attacking ISIS targets there. But at the same time, he said, ISIS has increased security in the city. ""I would dance in the streets, but I am too afraid,"" Ismail said. A U.S. intelligence official said that while law enforcement is aware the airstrikes against ISIS in Syria could incite a response, there is no evidence to suggest any terrorist strike is in the works against the United States. The inclusion of Sunni-majority countries fighting a radical Sunni militant group sends a strong message, former CIA counterterrorism official Philip Mudd said. ""Prominent religious leaders have said ISIS is not representative of Islam, and now you have countries that are coming to the fore to attack it,"" he said. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi welcomed news of the coalition airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, so long as they ""do it right this time."" While he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour it was good some Arab nations joined the fight, he said he wished they had understood and acted on the danger posed by ISIS sooner. ""We have warned ... this is going to end in a bloodbath if nobody stops it,"" he said. ""Nobody was listening."" Rouhani: No legal basis for airstrikes . Iran lashed out at the air campaign. Meeting with journalists at the United Nations, where world leaders are gathering for the General Assembly this week, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said there was no legal basis for the strikes without U.N. authorization or an invitation from the Syrian government. But U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN that a number of countries, including Iran, were told the United States would be taking action. ""We obviously didn't say exactly when or where. We wanted to make sure that nobody got in our way,"" he said. The United States defended its actions in a letter to the U.N. secretary-seneral, invoking Article 51 of the U.N. charter -- acting when a country is unwilling or unable to handle a threat itself. ""The Syrian regime has shown that it cannot and will not confront these safe havens effectively itself,"" Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., wrote in a letter obtained by CNN. ""Accordingly, the United States has initiated necessary and proportionate military actions in Syria."" Problem-plagued plane hits ISIS: F-22 goes into combat .

"A security firm that had pointed the finger at a 17-year-old Russian last week updated its report Monday to identify a different Russian resident as being responsible for writing the malware used in an attack compromised the credit card numbers and other personal information of up to 110 million Target customers. In a statement published Friday, security firm IntelCrawler said the breach was the result of malware that infected Target's payment system and possibly compromised the systems of other retailers. Neiman Marcus reported a similar security breach this month. The 17-year old does not appear to be solely responsible for the attack. Independent security researcher Brian Krebs earlier reported that other code in the Target hack pointed to a Ukraine resident. Homeland security warns retailers . Experts say the author may have shared it with others. ""Well, we should be worried. One of the things the hackers do is take the malware as it's called. Once it's identified, then the security community can rally around it and put controls in place. But the problem is, the hackers know that. And they manipulate or mutate this malware, and then reuse it,"" SecureState CEO Ken Stasiak said. ""We believe that he originated the code, or the malware everybody's calling it now. And was able to put it up on the Internet for download for other hackers to then take, and potentially use it for malicious harm. And that's what we believe happened to Target and Neiman Marcus.""

"(CNN) -- L'Wren Scott, a noted fashion designer who has been Mick Jagger's companion for more than a decade, was found dead in her New York apartment Monday of an apparent suicide, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. She was 49. Scott's assistant found the designer hanging from a door knob with a scarf around her neck, the official said. There were no signs of forced entry, and police did not find a suicide note, the official said. Her assistant told police Scott sent a text Monday morning asking the assistant to ""come by, and when the assistant arrived at approximately 10:02 a.m., Scott was dead in the living room, prompting the assistant to call police,"" according to the official. The New York Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death, according to Sgt. Nieves with the New York Police Department . A spokesman for Mick Jagger said that the singer was completely shocked and devastated by the news. Scott had been dating Jagger, 70, since at least 2003. The lanky former model designed clothes worn by a number of celebrities, including Madonna, Allison Williams and Christina Hendricks. She also created many of Jagger's looks for the Rolling Stones' 50th anniversary tour, which began in 2012 and is currently in Australia. The band called off Wednesday night's show in Perth, following the news. ""Frontier Touring and Concerts West regret to announce that The Rolling Stones concert in Perth will not be going ahead as scheduled for Wednesday 19 March 2014,"" a statement on the Perth Arena website said. Ticket holders were told to hold on to their tickets for the show. In addition to her haute creations, she designed a collection for Banana Republic that was introduced late last year. ""I don't really jump on anything unless I believe it will deliver the quality and standards I stay true to. It is a very fun happy collection and I think it is classic and timeless and elegant,"" she told Vanity Fair at the introduction last October. Celebrities attending the event included Hendricks, Ke$ha, Rashida Jones and Michael B. Jordan, as well as Jagger. On Monday, several stars mourned Scott on social media. Actress Olivia Munn tweeted, ""Shocked and saddened by the passing of @lwrenscott ... she was an amazing soul, talented artist and an unbelievably giving friend. RIP.""

"Hong Kong is in the midst of its longest series of political protests since the 1997 handover. Pro-democracy activists say they are making good on a long-threatened vow to try and paralyze the city's financial district -- a key business hub for the region and beyond -- through sit-ins and civil disobedience. Clashes between students and police this weekend have been the most heated in a long summer of anti-Beijing protests. Dozens have been reported injured by authorities. Their goal is to pressure China into giving the former British colony full universal suffrage. Beijing has so far refused to cede ground on its stance, setting the scene for growing, and more intense, clashes. Here are five things to know about Hong Kong as political tensions ratchet up: . 1. It's not just another Chinese city . A city of towering skyscrapers on China's southeastern tip, Hong Kong is home to 7 million people. When the city was returned to China in 1997 a deal was struck promising ""a high degree of autonomy"" to Hong Kong under a formula dubbed ""One Country, Two Systems."" The city's Basic Law or ""mini-constitution"" has allowed the city to carry on with its own legal and financial system and Hong Kong enjoys civil liberties unseen in mainland China such as an independent judiciary, freedom of the press and the right to protest. It also states that ""universal suffrage"" is the ultimate aim for Hong Kong but it does not give a timetable or detail how political reform should take shape. Currently, Hong Kong's leader, known as the chief executive, is elected by a 1,200-strong committee stacked with Beijing loyalists. 2. People are fed up . Surveys show that the government's approval rating is sinking, while distrust of China's central government in Beijing is at its highest level since the handover. Discontent, especially among the young, is driven by a widening wealth gap and many resent the influx of free-spending mainland Chinese visitors to the city who buy up everything from apartments to baby milk formula. A survey released on September 21 said that one in five people were considering emigrating. The latest wave of protests came after Beijing in August rejected demands for people to freely choose the city's next leader in 2017. Pro-democracy groups responded by unleashing threats to disrupt the city's Central financial district -- where many big banks and other businesses are located -- in a campaign known as ""Occupy Central."" Democracy supporters come from a broad cross section of society including students, religious leaders, university professors and financial professionals. After months of forewarning, Occupy Central began formally on Sunday, with thousands of protesters, many wearing eye and clothing protection, beginning a sit in around government buildings. Supporters want to force discussions, and even concessions, over Beijing's influence on Hong Kong. 17-year-old Hong Kong student prepares for democracy . 3. Not everyone supports the protests . Pro-Beijing groups like ""The Silent Majority for Hong Kong"" say the activists will ""endanger Hong Kong"" and create chaos. They have held their own rallies against Occupy Central and ran advertising campaigns in local media to highlight their fears. The biggest rally, on August 17, was attended by thousands, although questions were raised about its legitimacy amid reports that marchers were paid to show up. Businesses fear that any campaign targeting the city's financial district will harm Hong Kong's reputation as a safe and stable place to do business. An opinion poll conducted this month by Chinese University said that 46% did not support the Occupy Central campaign, while 31% backed the civil disobedience movement. 4. China thinks Hong Kong is ""confused"" Beijing, in a policy document released in June, said that Hong Kong does not enjoy ""full autonomy"" and residents are ""confused or lopsided in their understanding"" of ""One Country, Two Systems."" The rhetoric indicates that Beijing is unlikely to budge on its prescription for electoral reform in the city. Li Fei, a senior Chinese official, suggested that screening candidates was necessary to ensure the chief executive ""loves China, loves Hong Kong and will safeguard the country's sovereignty, security and development interests."" China has also sought to blame the pro-democracy opposition in Hong Kong on interference by Britain and the United States. All eyes are on Beijing and how it will respond to the growing waves of protests. The central government is in a tricky situation of not being able to be seen as backing down on its stance but at the same time needing to be wary over the use of force and the implications of doing so. 5. The government says Hong Kong should accept deal on offer . The Hong Kong government says its people should accept the deal on electoral reform offered by Beijing. The new framework will allow Hong Kong's 5 million registered voters to select their leader, although candidates must be approved by a committee similar to the one that selected the city's top official in 2012. Critics say that this means only candidates favored by Beijing will appear on the ballot, but Hong Kong's current chief executive, C.Y. Leung, writing in an op ed for CNN, says that this is not the case.

"Three people were in critical condition and one in stable condition after a stabbing incident Wednesday afternoon in Columbus, Ohio, that ended with the suspect being shot by police, Columbus authorities said. The attack began inside a downtown building that houses Miami-Jacobs Career College, said Columbus Police Sgt. Rich Weiner. The stabbing victims in critical condition underwent surgery at Grant Medical Center, while the one with less serious injuries was taken to Mount Carmel West hospital, officials said. The suspect was in critical condition at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center, Weiner said. ""I was here within probably a minute, minute and a half of it being dispatched, and I can tell you it was a chaotic scene,"" said Columbus Police Chief Stephen Gammill. Weiner said a confrontation between two men in the college's admissions office led to one of the men stabbing the other.  A witness in the office tried to intervene and also was stabbed, he said. The fight then spilled into the lobby, where the man stabbed two more victims, authorities said. One of those stabbings was unprovoked, they said. The suspect, who is not being identified by authorities, was shot outside the building by an officer responding to the scene, police said. The officer also used a stun gun to subdue the suspect. In a news conference, Gammill praised the quick police response. ""Officers were on scene, confronted the chaotic scene, confronted the suspect and were able to stop him before he can injure anybody else,"" he said. Three knives were recovered from the scene, one inside the admissions office and two on the street where the suspect was shot, authorities said. Police do not know the motive in the attack, and continue to interview witnesses. ""This doesn't happen all the time, especially here in Columbus,"" Weiner said. ""We've called in some additional detectives to assist with the homicide unit."" Chuck Vella, spokesperson for Miami-Jacobs Career College, said he had no additional information on the incident or the victims. The campus is closed Wednesday night and Thursday, he said.","The suspect was shot by a police officer and is in critical condition, police say .

"Nearly all of the staff at the oldest two-year college in Texas was furloughed Wednesday morning because of ""financial and liquidity difficulties,"" according to a letter sent by the college to its staff and obtained by CNN. Lon Morris College, a faith-based private school in Jacksonville, Texas, with an enrollment of slightly more than 1,000 students, notified its employees that -- with the exception of a core group of 11 -- all staff would be furloughed indefinitely. About 100 employees are on the school's payroll, according to local news affiliates. ""Given insufficient cash flow, the college cannot continue to employ personnel and further cannot allow employees to continue to work even on a 'volunteer' or unpaid basis,"" a letter sent to the Lon Morris staff by Director of Human Resources Carolyn Nanni said. CNN affiliate KETK: Lon Morris College employees terminated by email . Before the announcement Wednesday, the staff had not been paid for three payroll periods, according to staff members . ""For this to happen...it's really hurtful. About three months we haven't gotten paid,"" Lon Morris defensive line football coach Eric Morris told CNN in a phone interview. ""As the coaching staff, we do this because we love it. We do it for the kids. We did it for no money. The kids are going to lose out more than anything,"" he added. The letter to the staff also said health care benefits for employees ""will be canceled in the near term due to non-payment of premiums."" As for those employees who are living on campus, they have ""10 days to vacate,"" the letter added. The president of Lon Morris, Miles McCall has submitted his formal resignation via e-mail, effective Thursday, according to local affiliate KLTV. ""It's simply a furlough, no one has been terminated,"" college spokesman Dave Hubbard said in an interview with KLTV. ""It's simply a down time for the re-organization efforts to be done so we can be fruitful and begin to go forward in a positive manner next fall."" For now, summer sessions have been canceled, but there is a possibility courses may be offered online instead, Hubbard added. ""I don't know what I'm going to do now,"" Morris, who has coached at the college for a year, said. ""You just have to keep moving forward."" ""Those of us that are here now are those that really believe in the college,"" employee David Gehrels told KLTV. ""We've been able to work with students one-on-one and really be a positive influence in their lives, and to us that's worth the risk."" Lon Morris, located about 30 miles south of Tyler, Texas, is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, according to the school's website. Founded in 1854, the school celebrated its 100 commencement in 2011, the website said.

"Heavy rains threatened to inundate sections of the central and southern Plains Tuesday -- a day after a suspected tornado from the same slow-moving system touched down in south-central Texas. The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for sections of Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas.   Severe thunderstorms are forecast across much of the same area. By Wednesday morning, accumulations up to 10 inches of rain are expected in northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma, up to 8 inches in southwest Arkansas, with 4 to 5 inches being common across the rest of the watch area, forecasters said. Severe weather raked the heart of Texas Monday evening, with a suspected tornado touching down near Natalia, a town of about 1,400 residents. The Medina County, Texas, Sheriff's Office said it received more than 300 calls about damages or injuries. Charlie's Ice House, a bar in Devine, was in shambles after winds barreled through, ripping off its roof. ""It happened so fast and everyone was getting away from the doors ... and then it was over,"" said co-owner Marilyn Banks, adding that none of the 20 to 25 people inside suffered much more than a few scratches. Authorities, though, are ""in rescue mode"" searching for a motorcycle rider who is unaccounted for since the system came through, said Lawrence Trevino, San Antonio's emergency manager who is assisting neighboring counties in the response. He said that some injuries have been reported, but there are no known deaths after the strong winds damaged about six homes. Joanne Ortiz said she saw what appeared to be three funnel clouds from her home in Devine. ""At first we were fascinated by it. But once we saw two of them, we thought, where do we go?"" said Ortiz, who lives in a one-story manufactured home on a 3-acre lot. In Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, Fire Marshall's Office spokeswoman Laura Jesse said there ""are reports of damage to one home in southwest Bexar County"" but otherwise the impact appears to be limited. ""This is a rural area, so it's not that populated,"" Jesse said. In Hurst, located in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, high winds ripped the awning off a strip mall, CNN affiliate KTVT-TV reported. The unsettled weather pattern brought snow to the western United States over the weekend and more was forecast for Tuesday. The city of Flagstaff was still digging out of 10 to 14 inches of snow, which prompted school closings in the city. The city of Prescott received 8 to 12 inches. iReport: Are you there?

"John Brennan says he did not go to the Portland International Airport intending to get naked.

""I just took off my clothes and said 'See, I don't have any explosives,'"" Brennan said. ""The individuals at TSA are just doing their job and the whole organization needs to find a balance between safety and privacy. They use fear and intimidation and it's got to stop somewhere.""

"Those who have been following the recent soap opera at the University of Virginia may think that it has to do with the blundering dismissal of the president, Teresa Sullivan, and her subsequent re-engagement by the Board of Visitors under instruction by the governor of the state to put their house in order or resign. In fact, the heart of the drama is not about the president. Nor is it about the board. Rather, it is about the principle stakeholders of the University of Virginia and American higher education in general. Those who recall the campus disruptions protesting the Vietnam War will remember a slogan of the time, ""power to the people."" It was meant to be a challenge of the ""rulers"" by the ""masses."" In 2012 in Charlottesville, Virginia, we see a similar confrontation. But in place of chanting ""Close the university,"" on this occasion the students, faculty and others assembled on the quad claimed the right to open the university as their own and called for the right to select their own leader -- their own president. In the Vietnam era, the students and faculty saw the university as an alien complicit in ""the war,"" something to be overthrown. In today's story, the students and faculty are saying that they are the university, an entity to be protected from a seemingly intrusive force: the Board of Visitors. These campus constituents who are sometimes called ""members of the academy"" or ""the university community"" had the benefit of Sullivan's leadership for only two years, a period traditionally considered far too brief for any group to develop strong feelings of loyalty and attachment. It was not Sullivan personally they were invested in but rather what she represented. They were offended at being neither consulted nor appropriately informed when she was dispatched without due process or even a persuasive bill of particulars. It was the crime of insult. By ignoring the faculty and students, the board showed a disregard for their standing, and that is perceived as a critical act of rudeness. The issue comes down to participatory democracy. Sullivan is the icon of the encounter. When the president was furtively fired without a legitimate process, we witnessed a back-of-the-hand slap by Marie Antoinette. The rehiring of the president after a special emergency meeting of the board is a victory for the president, of course, but more significant, it is a victory for the concept of a governance system in which all parties who have a genuine interest in the maintenance of the university are given an opportunity to play their part, to express their thinking and have it inform the future of their institution. What we see here is the reaffirmation of a social contract that has been in place at a great university devised and established by Thomas Jefferson in 1819. In life, substance matters, and it does so equally on campus, in business or in government. But process is also important. How things are done reflect our values. Process becomes substance. In the case at the University of Virginia, the leader of the board, Helen Dragas, was exposed as having disregarded ""the way we do things."" This is no small matter at an institution like the University of Virginia, with its defining student Honor Code. The action of the board was a gaffe and a blunder. Dragas miscalculated how a slight can inspire a protest movement. I cannot help to think how ironic it is that this battle has two women in opposition, Sullivan and Dragas. Would this have been possible before the passage of Title IX in 1972, a major contributor in articulating the women's movement? Many lessons will be drawn, articles written, perhaps even a book worth reading about one of the most consequential academic battles of 2012. Gender equity is far from complete on college campuses, but it has made a good start. In this case, the fact that the media have not made much about the women in the showdown demonstrates how far we have come in contemporary America. Twenty-five years ago, this would have been called a catfight. Today, it is merely a political battle.","University of Virginia reinstated its president, Teresa Sullivan, after she was fired .

"Swarms of agents closed in on Puerto Rico's main airport, arresting workers who allegedly crammed cocaine-filled luggage onto commercial planes as part of a far-reaching smuggling scheme. A special strike force intercepted an unmarked fiberglass boat near a beach town, confiscating bales of cocaine and heroin with a street value of $8 million. Both raids this week were significant blows in the battle against drug trafficking, authorities said. Drug raid targets baggage handlers, airline workers in Puerto Rico . But they were also reminders that Puerto Rico faces a grisly reality. Inside the Caribbean island territory known by many Americans as a scenic tourist destination, U.S. citizens are gunned down and stabbed daily in drug-fueled attacks as rival traffickers feud over turf and addicts fight for another fix. Last year, a record 1,136 people were slain within the island's borders. Officials say Puerto Rico's murder rate is five times the U.S. national average. Photos: Violence in Juarez not going away . Drugs are behind more than 70% of the homicides, local officials have said, arguing that the staggering number should be a wake-up call for Washington. In February, a statement from Puerto Rico's government described the island as ""the under-protected front in the nation's war on drugs."" After this week's airport raid, officials in the commonwealth renewed their rallying cries. ""We have been asking the federal government to help us patrol...the Puerto Rican coasts, which we are unable to cover entirely by ourselves,"" Gov. Luis Fortuno said Wednesday. ""We want them to help us protect it in the same way they protect the borders with Mexico and Canada."" On a national level, some lawmakers have taken note. A congressional hearing to discuss the situation is scheduled for later this month. ""The disturbing increase in drug trafficking and drug-related violence in this region...is alarming and unacceptable,"" Michael McCaul, a Republican congressman from Texas who will chair the June 21 hearing, said in a statement. ""If this kind of violence were happening anywhere else where 4 million American citizens resided, it would make daily headlines. This problem is no less serious than drug cartels operating across the Mexican border."" Facing 'widespread fear' A group of gunmen burst into a bar on its opening night, spraying bullets at a crowd of revelers. Their target was a rival drug trafficker, authorities said, but eight bystanders were killed, including a 9-year-old girl caught in the crossfire. The official death toll included a pregnant woman's 8-month-old unborn child, who was shot in the head, CNN affilate WAPA-TV reported. The October 2009 massacre in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, marked a turning point. It was the first high-profile example of criminals opening fire on a crowd with little regard for collateral damage, according to a report from the National Drug Intelligence Center. ""Violence by drug traffickers in the region has become indiscriminate, endangering the lives of public housing residents and innocent bystanders,"" the 2011 report said, describing ""widespread fear among the general population."" It's a feeling that makes people dread going out in the street, says Luis Romero. ""You could be walking, and all of a sudden -- dah da dah da dah da dah -- you hear these machine guns going off, and you get hit. And you were an innocent bystander,"" he says. ""And all of a sudden, you are a statistic."" The 59-year-old telecommunications company CEO didn't used to dwell on such details. That changed last year, after his 20-year-old son, Julian, was stabbed to death on a San Juan street. Now Romero is president of Basta Ya PR, a nonprofit that has created a smartphone application to help the island's residents report crimes to police. In English, the group's name means ""enough already,"" representing its efforts to promote community action and stop the surge in violence. But there's one thing that Romero says there isn't enough of in Puerto Rico: funding from the U.S. government for the fight against drug trafficking. Federal agencies on the ground, he argues, don't have the tools they need to combat the growing problem. ""It's shameful, the neglect of Puerto Rico,"" he says. A new avenue? Drug trafficking is not a new problem for the island. Puerto Rico's strategic geographic location between South America and the continental United States has long made the commonwealth a central drug transit hub, says Laila Rico, a spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. Up to 80% of the drugs that pass through Puerto Rico end up in cities across the eastern seaboard of the United States, officials say. And nearly a third of drugs destined for the continental United States pass through the Caribbean. Puerto Rico's Luis Munoz Marin International Airport -- the site of Wednesday's raid -- is ""a major gateway for cocaine and heroin transported"" to the continental United States, according to a 2011 report from the National Drug Intelligence Center. Because Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, passengers from there don't have to go through customs upon arriving on the mainland. But some analysts say a new trend may be pushing even more cargo containers, fishing boats and yachts with hidden compartments toward Puerto Rico's shores from South America (often by way of the Dominican Republic). Faced with increased security at the Mexico-U.S. border, cartels may be searching for other trafficking routes, some analysts and officials speculate. ""If you attack one front, if you put your resources there, they search for other avenues, and the Caribbean is one of those avenues,"" says Pedro A. Velez Baerga, an attorney and former deputy U.S. Marshal in Puerto Rico. That's a case that Pedro Pierliusi, Puerto Rico's resident commissioner in Washington, has made for months as he's pushed for a ""Caribbean Border Initiative,"" similar to efforts to fight drug trafficking along U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, calling for a boost in resources and personnel to match ""the scope and severity of the drug-related violence."" Since 2008, the United States has pledged $1.6 billion in aid to Mexico as part of the Merida Initiative, aimed at helping Mexico combat cartels and organized crime. In that same period, Puerto Rico has received roughly $260 million to fund various addiction recovery, police and judicial programs, according to a recent estimate using government figures. But some have cautioned against placing too much emphasis on law enforcement, who are often accused of corruption and abuse in Puerto Rico. In 2010, an FBI investigation into whether police provided protection for drug dealers led to the arrest of 89 law enforcement officers in Puerto Rico. And a September U.S. Justice Department report said that the Puerto Rico Police Department had a long pattern of violating citizens' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches. Low public trust in Puerto Rico's police, fueled by a troubling history of abuses by law enforcement, makes it harder to stem the violence, said Jennifer Turner, a human rights researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union. ""They are confronting a serious public safety crisis, but the problem is that, instead of limiting the violence, they're contributing to the violence. ... The police department uses the public safety crisis as an excuse for the abuses they're committing,"" she said. Puerto Rico's governor has said he is working with officials to reform the police department. He appointed a new police superintendent in March. ""The problem can't be controlled only with policing measures,"" says Jorge Rodriguez Beruff, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico who has researched drug trafficking in the region. More economic and social programs are just as important to solving Puerto Rico's drug problems, he says, which also include a significant population of drug addicts and far-reaching criminal networks. Analysts once calculated that there were nearly 100 criminal organizations that were connected with drug trafficking in Puerto Rico, he says. ""It is an enormous business. We are talking about a business that possibly is bigger than the amount of tourism coming in to Puerto Rico,"" he says. A flourishing underground economy . Drug traffickers have a fertile recruiting ground in Puerto Rico, where unemployment has been hovering around 15%, and labor participation is around 40% (meaning 4 out of 10 people work), according to the Department of Labor. ""Having lost their direct employment, many people turn to working in the informal economy,"" says economist Gustavo Velez, who describes drug-trafficking as a ""significant component"" of Puerto Rico's underground economy. ""It's a public policy challenge that is impacting the country's security,"" he said. Little research has been done to study the underground economy's impact on the residents of Puerto Rico's more than 330 public housing projects, says Lilian Bobea, a sociologist and professor at the Latin America School of Social Sciences in the Dominican Republic. ""We are talking about communities that are basically living from informal work,"" says Bobea, who has studied similar neighborhoods in the Dominican Republic and will begin a fellowship researching Puerto Rico's public housing projects in the fall. Leaders at drug distribution points inside the projects often pay children to move drugs, according to the National Drug Intelligence Center's 2011 report on Puerto Rico. Romero, the president of Basta Ya PR, says that reality is painfully clear when he speaks with children as part of his advocacy work. ""If you're a drug runner you get paid $500 a day. Why would that guy want to go to school? ... They know that they're gonna die young, but they're gonna take care of their mom with a lot of money. That's what happens when you allow this sort of problem,"" he says. A 10-year-old boy told Romero he wanted to grow up to be a drug lord's triggerman.","Officials blame drug trafficking for more than 70% of Puerto Rico's homicides .

"People of the Yazidi faith in northern Iraq face an impossible choice: Stay and risk being killed by Islamist insurgents, or flee across the barren desert, facing starvation and thirst. Its hard to imagine the suffering that minority Yazidis have endured in recent weeks as they've fled from ISIS militants into remote, rugged, sparse mountains. ""With my own eyes, I saw dogs feeding off dead bodies,"" one of those Yazidis, a man named Tariq, told CNN. ""It's not a crisis. It's a catastrophe."" Descendants of Kurds and followers of an ancient pre-Islamic religion, Yazidis are small in number with a big sense of community. Now some of them are under siege or under fire, targeted by ISIS for not succumbing to demands to convert to Islam or else. Others, like Tariq, have managed to find some refuge in recent days, though worries remain about finding the resources they need to survive. Wherever they are, whatever they are doing, Yazidis don't feel safe or secure or free. They certainly aren't home. Yazidis trapped, hiding from ISIS in the mountains . 'We had nothing' The 33-year-old Tariq's nightmare began in his home village of Tal Benat-Sinjar at 9 a.m. on August 3. That's when he and others started receiving calls from neighboring villages, telling them ""Daish,"" the Arabic term for ISIS, was on their doorsteps. The choices were simple: Stay, convert to Islam, and become one with ISIS. Stay and risk death or imprisonment, as Tariq said he knew happened to a family of one man, three women and four children. Or run away, in hopes of finding some place they could live safely or, at least, freely away from ISIS' grasp. More than 300 Yazidi families -- Tariq among them -- picked the third option. Their first refuge was the abandoned ruins of a tiny, old village that had been previously used for herding cattle and sheep and was next to a cement factory. An ISIS messenger caught up with them there to deliver an ultimatum: Convert by noon the next day or die. Tariq and his neighbors fled again, this time up Mount Sinjar. They followed a zig-zagging road five kilometers (three miles) up to the mountain's desolate top. The hundreds of Yazidis, including many elderly and children, had each other. But not much else, having escaped with little more than the clothes on their backs and the bread in their hands. ISIS militants choked off any chance of restocking by surrounding the roads leading up to the mountain. ""At one point, 15 people shared 1.5 gallons of water,"" Tariq recalled. ""We had nothing."" People drop to ground of hunger . If ISIS fighters didn't kill the Yazidis, their siege did. Tariq's 80-year-old father was among the dead, dying two days after being stranded on the mountaintop in the extreme heat without anything to eat or drink. He wasn't alone. Tariq said he counted between 500 and 1,000 bodies, some of which went from cherished loved ones one moment to food for hungry dogs the next. ""I saw people dropping on the ground from being so tired on their empty stomachs,"" he told CNN. Tariq, at least, is alive. Fighters with the Kurdistan Workers Party -- or PKK, which the U.S. State Department labels a terrorist group though they now share a common enemy in ISIS -- were able to break the siege so that he and other Yazidis could safely escape. The subsequent journey took them through parts of northern Iraq, across the border into Syria, then eventually back to Iraq. Their last stop -- for now -- is a village in Dhok province that Tariq characterized as being ""in the middle of nowhere."" Still, even if he's safe for now, the danger hasn't gone away. First off, ISIS hasn't  backed off. The U.S. military noted Saturday that the militants ""indiscriminately attacked"" Yazidis near the SInjar Mountains, prompting American airstrikes. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS . Attacks aren't the only reasons Yazidis' lives are at risk. Thousands of them don't have the food or water they need, especially in Iraq's scorching summer. ""There are more than 20,000 families still stranded on the mountain in more remote areas,"" Tariq said. ""If no one gets them food or water in time, they will face death.""","Thousands of minority Yazidis have fled from ISIS into remote Iraqi mountains .

"Egypt's jailed ex-strongman Hosni Mubarak clung to life Tuesday despite slipping in and out of consciousness, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The spokesman, Gen. Marwan Mustapha, said Mubarak's condition had stabilized ""and a number of doctors from the prison authority are monitoring him,"" along with physicians from the armed forces. ""He does go in and out of this state of unconsciousness, but new equipment has been installed in the ICU room of the hospital on Saturday to accommodate his fragile situation,"" Mustapha said. ""His two sons are beside him, and his wife visited him today."" Mubarak, 84, was sentenced to life in prison on June 2 for the killing of pro-democracy demonstrators during the 2011 revolt that toppled him. He was already suffering from health problems and attended court on a gurney -- but Mustapha said rumors that Mubarak had died were false. ""The state of weakness and unconsciousness may have been mistaken for a coma by officials who are not fully aware, but indeed his situation is delicate,"" he said. ""His high blood pressure is being treated, while heart doctors are managing his irregular heartbeat issues."" More than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that brought an end to Mubarak's 29-year rule. The ex-president and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and could have been sentenced to death. But both were given life terms instead, and other top aides -- as well as Mubarak's two sons, who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted. The sentences and acquittals provoked howls of outrage both inside and outside the courtroom. Mubarak became president after the in October 1981 assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. He ruled Egypt with an iron hand as a staunch ally of the United States, which provides about $1.3 billion a year in military aid.","Mubarak slips in and out of consciousness but is still alive, a government spokesman says .

"Syria's conflict erupted in March 2011 when President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite minority-dominated government launched a crackdown against a predominantly Sunni protest movement that grew into an uprising with an armed resistance. One year later, what is the situation, and what may happen next? How did the unrest start? The spark began in the southern Syrian city of Daraa with the arrests of at least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti. Outrage over the arrests and the government's humiliating and violent reactions to their complaints emboldened the opposition and helped it spread. By mid-March protests were occurring across Syria. How Syria's unrest unfolded . The government launched a full-scale siege on Daraa April 25, with other towns, including Homs -- the country's third-largest city --  following. Mass arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country. The protest movement grew and solidified. Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, believes ""it's conceivable that if the events didn't happen in Daraa,"" the uprising ""might not have occurred."" But the deep-seated political and economic reasons underlining Syrian discontent was an omen. Protest in Syria was ""going to happen"" at some point, Salem said. Initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law. The regime introduced some reforms, but they were too little, too late. Protesters now want the al-Assad regime out and true democratic elections. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000; his father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades. Read Bashar al-Assad: President defined by violence . What is happening now? The 12-month-old conflict shows no sign of abating. More than 8,000 people have now been killed, including many women and children, the U.N. said this month. Opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000. Thousands more have been arrested or have disappeared, while about 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. Al-Assad's regime routinely insists ""armed terrorist groups"" are behind the bloodshed in Syria. And the rebels' tactics seem to be changing too. Videos show that jihad appears to have come to Syria with attacks on government forces that closely resemble jihadist tactics that are the hallmark of al Qaeda. How has al-Assad survived? Many analysts admit they under-estimated the Syrian leader's powers of survival. ""Al-Assad proved us wrong on multiple grounds and is far more durable than we thought,"" Fawaz Gerges, professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. ""He's not only weathered the offensive and absorbed the shocks, but he's gone on the attack to try to crush the armed wing of the uprising."" Unlike former Egyptian and Libyan leaders, Hosni Mubarak and Moammar Gadhafi, who were both deposed after uprisings in their countries, Al-Assad has adapted to the situation in his, Gerges said, and is in no immediate danger. ""His security apparatus has held its ground, and there have been few defections from the top elite in the military and security services."" So the momentum the Syrian rebels had during the Arab Spring has slowed. One reason was because of the assumption that the regime would not use the level of force it has, said Chris Phillips, lecturer in international relations at Queen Mary, University of London. ""Initially al-Assad had to fabricate the existence of an armed opposition in Syria, but the emergence of such groups gave the regime pretext to crack down so heavily."" What external factors are in play? The Syrian regime has come under international pressure to stop the crackdown -- the U.N., the United States, the European Union and some members of the Arab League have called for President al-Assad to step down -- but so far there has been little action. Many Western countries have imposed sanctions, but the U.N. Security Council has failed to agree on a resolution calling for al-Assad to go. Arab and Western diplomats voiced their support for a draft resolution calling for a halt to the crackdown, but representatives from Russia and China vetoed it in October. Russia -- which, like China, is one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the Security Council -- has said it is concerned about a Syrian civil war and does not want al-Assad ousted. It has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition. Syria's neighbors are concerned about an influx of refugees. Jordan's King Abdullah called for al-Assad to step down, the Arab League suspended Syria's membership, and Turkey, one of Syria's largest trading partners, imposed sanctions and threatened to cut off Syria's electricity. But crucially Iran's Shiite leadership remains loyal to al-Assad, who is an Alawite, an offshoot of Shia Islam that is in a minority in Syria. ""Syria is caught in the middle of a regional crisis,"" said Gerges. ""On the one hand there's Iran and on the other, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries. One must also never under-estimate the lengths that Russia will go to in standing behind the regime."" With videos posted on social media providing much impetus for the uprising, Tehran's help is vital, analysts say. ""Iran is now supplying crucial intelligence on rebels who are posting YouTube videos as well as finance,"" said Phillips. ""Russia and China are also providing diplomatic cover -- so we can see how al-Assad has deftly repositioned his international alliances to stay in power."" Is there any prospect of military intervention? Last year, the U.N. Security Council voted to impose a no-fly zone in Libya and use ""all necessary measures"" to protect its people from Moammar Gadhafi. But there is no such appetite for similar action against Syria. ""The Chinese and Russians are dead set against (intervention),"" said CNN's Fareed Zakaria in a recent blog post. ""So it couldn't happen through the United Nations. There would be effectively a kind of unilateral or NATO operation with no international legitimacy."" And while there are calls for robust military intervention, that could be the worst possible thing to do, according to Rami Khouri, who runs the international affairs program at the American University in Beirut. ""I think foreign military intervention would probably be catastrophic, and to hear Americans suggest this is to think back what they did in Iraq and what an extraordinary catastrophe that has been,"" Khouri said on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" Experts point out that while the opposition groups in Libya were relatively united and organized, the same cannot be said for rebels in Syria. Al-Assad also continues to hold  a vice-like grip on the country's security apparatus, and has the support of the army, one that is much stronger, better equipped and more unified than the one in Libya. Geography must also be taken into account when considering intervention in Syria. Libya was relatively easy last year: most targets were near the Mediterranean coast and NATO air bases in Italy. But Syria has a much smaller coastline than Libya (roughly 119 miles vs. 1,110 miles), and neighboring countries probably won't be so accommodating for supplies, troops or anything else needed in a possible mission. Is the opposition united? Weapons are flowing in, refugees are fleeing, but there seems little in the way of an organized Syrian opposition with which to work. And while Sunni Muslim neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar want al-Assad's removal, this seems more of an opportunistic anti-Iran strategy. Among the resistance forces are apparently some radical Sunni fighters, perhaps al Qaeda itself, and others whose ascension to power would likely cause a further crisis, with millions of Christians and other religious minorities fleeing from the region. The failure of opposition groups to unite is the main reason the uprising has stalled, analysts say. ""If I was the opposition, I'd look to the longer term,"" said Gerges. ""They've presented a narrative to the outside world that al-Assad's days are numbered. They've spent time trying to get military intervention but not enough on unifying themselves into a cohesive group. They believe they're going to win in the end but at the moment they're divided both in and outside Syria."" The opposition has failed so far to win the support of wider sections of Syrian society, most observers believe. ""The rebels haven't proved a credible force either politically or militarily,"" said Phillips. ""The regime is easily a match for them on the battlefield, but crucially the Sunni merchant classes in cities like Aleppo have remained neutral."" What might happen next? The conflict is likely to continue with neither side able to deliver a knockout blow. Analysts believe al-Assad is secure in the short-term with regional backing from Iran and wider diplomatic cover from Russia and China. But even if it defeats the opposition, Phillips said it is unclear how the regime can repackage itself. ""It's very difficult to see how the opposition is going to topple al-Assad, but one must ask if he has alienated his core constituents so much that he cannot rule by consent?"" he asked. And the longer the conflict continues, the more fundamentalist Islamist elements will get involved, analysts say. ""If it goes on some Syrians will turn to jihadi-style tactics,"" said Gerges. ""I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually goes the way of Iraq although it's important to stress that the bulk of the armed response now is local Syrian, not al Qaeda."" In a recent blog posting, Fareed Zakaria pointed out that al-Assad drew an unfortunate lesson from the Arab Spring: ""Don't waiver; don't make concessions; don't show weakness. In al-Assad's eyes, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak vacillated in his response to protests and ended up in prison. Libya's Moammar Gadhafi wasn't ruthless enough and ended up dead. Al-Assad has chosen to be brutal."" However he said in the longer term al-Assad's position is weak. For this reason, Zakaria said: ""The government will not be able to fully suppress this revolt. The opposition will prove unable to completely overturn the government. The stalemate could go on for a long, long time.""","Protests across Syria began on March 15, 2011 after children's arrest for graffiti .

"Ibrahim Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Azeem is one of the last traditional craftsmen in Egypt making the oud, the guitar-like instrument heard in so much Arabic music. He is one of only six or seven oud makers still working in the historic Mohamed Ali Street in Cairo. It takes him a week to make one oud for sale, molding it from thin layers of wood that are joined together without using nails. ""We bring big chunks of wood and then we cut it into thin layers,"" said Abdel-Azeem. ""First we put those layers on the hot iron. Later we bend it. When it comes out we glue it together because the Oud doesn't not have any nails."" Abdel-Azeem, 62, inherited his art from his father and started out in his workshop while he was still at school. ""The profession is originally Egyptian and moved to Syria and Turkey, but my father brought it back to Egypt,"" said Abdel-Azeem. Abdel-Azeem was only 14 when his father died and he took over his workshop. It is not just a job to him, but a way of life. ""Oud is the Sultan of music and songs,"" said Abdel-Azeem. ""Without oud there's no music. It's the base to any other instrument. ""Making an oud requires artistic talent. It's not only a trade because when the oud is not made properly or the sound coming out of it is not right we become emotionally depressed."" See also: Egyptian student sends spiders in to space . But he worries that the trade will die out. ""The only people left making ouds are only six or seven people in the country. No one is interested in learning it anymore. ""If it continues this way this profession will die. Other instruments took over. We used to take oud classes in school. They don't teach oud anymore except in colleges of music."" Another man working hard to keep the tradition of the oud alive is Naseer Shamma, one of the most famous musicians in the Middle East. Shamma, 47, is a composer, performer, poet and now a teacher. He left his native Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule and moved to Cairo where he now runs a ""House of Oud"" music school with branches in Egypt, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. ""I think if anybody needs to change the life around him he needs to do something really in education,"" said Shamma. ""For example, not just composition or just concerts; we need another line to continue with the new generation for that this is my project for all my life."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Gaza music students find smart ways around travel ban . Among his students is Ahmed Al-Sheikh, an 11-year-old Syrian boy who has just passed his final exams at Shamma's House of Oud school in Abu Dhabi. ""My dream is to be a big artist,"" said Ahmed. ""When I close my eyes, I dream of being on stage and hearing people applaud for my music."" It is teaching children like Ahmed that keeps Shamma believing in his work. ""I need to change the life in Arab world, but if we need to change we need to start with the boys, with the small girls, with the culture in the beginning,"" he said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Thousands of demonstrators bracing for the possibility of a police crackdown stood their ground in the heart of Hong Kong on Tuesday. Protesters had masks, protective goggles and plastic raincoats on hand as they camped out on the main thoroughfare leading into the city's central business district. ""They're all ready just in case there is any sort of move by the Hong Kong police,"" CNN's Andrew Stevens reported. It's been more than a day since officers fired tear gas and pepper spray at the crowd. At least 56 people have been injured so far in the largely student-led protests, which flared into violence starting Sunday, a Hong Kong government spokeswoman said. The head of the Hong Kong government urged protesters to clear roads Tuesday, saying they are impeding any emergency vehicles that may need to pass. ""The main roads are used by fire trucks and ambulances. They now have to take a detour, so we urge the society to think about this,"" Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung told reporters. Demonstrations began in response to China's decision to allow only Beijing-vetted candidates to stand in the city's 2017 election for the top civil position of chief executive. Protesters say Beijing has gone back on its pledge to allow universal suffrage in Hong Kong, which was promised ""a high degree of autonomy"" when it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997. Leung said Tuesday that China will not back down from its position on Hong Kong. ""China will not compromise to the illegal threats of some people,"" he said. ""Based on the basic law, we will be able to have one person, one vote universal suffrage. China's decision is based on and using what the basic law allows them to do."" ""I understand this universal suffrage is somewhat different to what the public thinks it would be,"" he added. ""But this is based on the basic law. We still want to remain peaceful, calm and think what the best is for Hong Kong."" But the protesters, rallying against what many see as the growing influence of the Chinese Communist Party on the way Hong Kong is run, are so far refusing to budge. Both protesters and police have been calling for calm, Stevens said. And at the moment, the situation is peaceful. Chanting protesters are calling for the resignation of Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung. A large orange banner hanging over them, Stevens reported, says ""freedom in the midst of a storm."" Demonstrators say they're not going anywhere. Authorities also don't seem to show any sign of backing down; officials in Hong Kong and China say it's an illegal gathering. ""The next step really at this stage is very difficult to predict,"" Stevens said. Leung said the organizer of Occupy Central said demonstrators would be asked to stop the protest if it gets out of control. ""I now urge them to call a stop to this,"" Leung said. ""I respect how the public voice their political opinions, but I would like you to take care of the safety of the public."" Hong Kong protests: In the thick of it . What you need to know . Police action shocks residents . The protests have brought widespread disruption to the heart of one of Asia's biggest financial centers, blocking traffic on multi-lane roads and prompting the suspension of school classes. On Tuesday, 37 branches or offices of 21 banks were closed, the Hong Kong Information Services Department said. It said ATM services were also disrupted in some areas. Police say they've arrested 89 people since protests began, accusing them of forcible entry into government premises, disorderly conduct in public, assaulting police officers and obstructing police. The large-scale demonstrations now taking place grew out of student-led boycotts and protests that began last week. The demonstrations increased in size over the weekend after gaining the support of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a protest group that was already planning to lead a campaign of civil disobedience later this week against the Chinese government's decision. Images of heavy-handed treatment of protesters by police shocked many residents of Hong Kong, where large-scale, peaceful protests are common, but police crackdowns are not. CNN's Ivan Watson -- who himself was enveloped in a cloud of stinging tear gas Sunday -- said protesters and police appeared unused to the method of crowd control. ""Both sides were appealing for calm, and then the tear gas just exploded in the midst of everybody,"" he said. ""People here have never been hit by tear gas before, and it comes as quite a shock to them -- even the use of pepper spray. ... This is a big shock for a city that is famed for its law and order."" The strong police response appeared to stir thousands more people into joining the demonstrations, swelling the ranks of protesters around the government headquarters and starting new rallies in other key areas of the city, including the densely populated district of Kowloon, which sits on the opposite side of Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island. ""They shouldn't have used tear gas,"" said Brian Lo, 37, who works in human resources and wasn't protesting. ""This made people angry."" As the sun rose over Hong Kong on Tuesday, Watson reported that groups of pro-democracy demonstrators were sleeping in the street after occupying the main highway in downtown Hong Kong for the second night in a row. At the main protest site near the government headquarters, a young woman named Nikki told CNN she has no plans to leave. ""As long as there's one person that's still out here on this highway,"" she said, ""I'm going to be here."" 'Umbrella revolution' Despite the government's announcement that it had pulled riot police back from the protest sites, smaller numbers of officers remained on guard on the sidelines of the main protest area. Aside from the clashes with police, the protesters have remained overwhelmingly peaceful. People have been picking up trash left at the protest sites, handing out bottles of water and encouraging police officers to put down their weapons and join the demonstrations. In the face of tear gas and pepper spray, demonstrators have used goggles, homemade masks and umbrellas to protect themselves. How Hong Kong remains distinct from China . The abundance of umbrellas among the crowds, shielding people from tear gas and the fierce glare of the sun, has prompted many social media users to dub the movement the ""umbrella revolution."" Chan Kin-man, a leader of Occupy Central, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that demanding the chief executive's resignation is a realistic goal that could give Hong Kong a window to restart constitutional reform efforts . ""We shouldn't look at the democracy movement as a battle. It is a war,"" he said. ""As long as the spirit of democracy is alive, we are not and we will not be defeated."" 'We had to use force' Fears nonetheless remain about the possibility of a heavier crackdown from authorities. Both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments have said they consider the protests to be unlawful. Leung has said police have acted with the greatest possible restraint in dealing with the protesters. At least 12 police officers were among the injured, authorities said. Hong Kong chief executive: Raw emotion 'will get us nowhere' ""We gave them enough of a chance to leave, and this included warnings,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Cheung Tak-keung said of protesters at a news conference Monday. ""But when they failed, we had to use force."" Police fired a total of 87 tear gas canisters on Sunday night, he said. In an indication authorities don't expect the demonstrations to end soon, the Hong Kong government said it was canceling the city's annual fireworks display on Wednesday, China's National Day, because of the protests. ""Everybody is in completely unknown territory. ... How these things end, we just don't know,' said Roderic White, an associate fellow at London-based Chatham House. ""A lot will depend on the attitude of the authorities, and whether at some time there will be room for somebody to talk to somebody."" What will Beijing do? Some analysts say they see little hope of compromise between the committed protesters and the Chinese Communist Party, which remains notorious for its ruthless suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. ""I see no way the Chinese government can tolerate what is happening in HK. Greatly fear this will end badly,"" tweeted Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, who covered the Tiananmen crackdown for CNN. Pro-democracy activist and former legislator Martin Lee told CNN's Watson that China had troops stationed in Hong Kong who could clear the streets if ordered to. ""But Hong Kong people, I think, many of them would not be scared. I certainly would not be scared. And I've said it before and I say it again, if I see a tank from the Chinese troops in Hong Kong, I would get myself a bicycle and stand right in front of it,"" Lee said. Chinese authorities appeared to be taking steps to restrict the flow of information into the mainland about what was happening in Hong Kong. State media gave little coverage to the story, and it appeared censors had blocked access to Instagram after images of the protests flooded the photo-sharing app. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Monday that Beijing fully believes in and firmly supports the Hong Kong government's ""ability to handle the situation in accordance with the law.""

"France's far right-leaning National Front party is threatening to sue after singer Madonna showed a video of party leader Marine Le Pen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead during a concert in Paris. ""The images that were projected draw a terrible link between the party and an ideology that we reject,"" party Vice President Florian Philippot said Monday. The party took issue after the video was projected during a show at the Stade de France national stadium Saturday night. ""Just because she is rich and well-known does not mean we should accept such atrocities. It's an insult against Marine Le Pen and an insult to all the National Front party members,"" Philippot added. Madonna's publicist, Barbara Charone, said the star's show ""has been the same since it started in Tel Aviv"" at the end of May, but declined to comment further. The image is part of a video montage of several current and deposed world leaders that is projected onto a giant screen during the song ""Nobody Knows Me"" during Madonna's current world tour. After the image of Le Pen appears, it fades into one of Adolf Hitler. The party had warned that it would seek legal action if Madonna showed the image at her concerts in France. The National Front said the photo was altered for Madonna's concert. Le Pen made a strong showing in the first round of France's presidential election. The daughter of party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, she pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and called for France to leave the eurozone and restore its currency, the franc. She also criticized France's political integration into the European Union. The National Front is the third-largest political party in France. In June, it won its first seats in parliament in 15 years, with two lawmakers elected.","Madonna representative declines comment on swastika controversy .

"Government and politics teacher Dawn Quarles' voice goes tight with frustration when she thinks back to how trying to register her students to vote thrust her into the center of Florida's high profile and deeply partisan voting rights controversy. ""I never felt like the voting process was on my side... That's not the way it's supposed to be,"" said Quarles, a registered Republican who was slapped with a $1,000 fine when she ran afoul of a state law requiring a 48-hour deadline for third parties to turn in voter registration forms. ""I felt like I was taking on my own party,"" she said. Though a federal judge recently struck down the 48-hour deadline requirement, Quarles and other Floridians have been stunned by the state's standoff with the federal government over voter registration laws. For some Florida voters, 2012 is starting to feel eerily like 2000. Twelve years ago, the fate of the presidency hung in the balance as Florida elections officials scurried to recount ballots to determine whether Republican candidate George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, would emerge as victor from the close contest. In the electoral chaos that followed, a number of minority voters said they were turned away from the polls or not provided language assistance, a matter that leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of the state's civil rights activists to this day. The matter of who won the 2000 presidential election was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. And Florida, a battleground state with a history of voting irregularities, cemented its reputation as a place where electorally things sometimes go awry. On Tuesday the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to keep Florida from potentially purging thousands of voters from its registration rolls. Florida Gov. Rick Scott has said the purge — which comes months before the general election — was both legal and necessary to keep non-U.S. citizens from voting illegally. Florida is suing the Department of Homeland Security to gain access to a citizenship database and blames the agency for the election year timing of the purge. ""Had they not stonewalled us, we could have easily identified non-citizens, removed them from the voter rolls, and the issue wouldn't be what it is today,"" said Lane Wright, a Scott spokesman. So far, the state has identified ""almost 100 individuals"" who aren't citizens but are registered to vote. State officials also say they ""are not aware of any eligible voter who has been removed through this process; we are only aware of ineligible voters on the list,"" said Chris Cate, spokesman for the Florida Department of State. However voters on those lists tell a different tale. Linda Tibbetts, who is originally from the Philippines, became a citizen a few years ago. Getting her citizenship and registering as a Republican was a big day for her and her family. So they were shocked to find her name on the list of voters who could potentially be purged from Florida's rolls. ""We did everything that we were supposed to do properly... She aced her exam on questions of U.S. law and history and everything,"" said her husband, Roger Tibbetts. Linda Tibbetts declined to speak with CNN. ""If she's already a citizen, why does she have to go out and then reprove that she's a citizen to bureaucrats that are not researching properly,"" her husband asked. The state also has tussled with voting rights groups including the League of Women Voters, the NAACP, La Raza and Rock the Vote over the controversial 48-hour deadline requirement to turn in registration forms. ""It just seems as if the train has gone off the tracks,"" said Deirdre Macnab, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. ""The lack of justification of these laws. It's an extraordinary movement toward disenfranchisement of these voters. It's shocking in a state that has had a history of voter suppression."" Florida's efforts to crack down on illegal voting through strict new laws are part of a national trend. Thirty-two states have put in place varying degrees of voter identification laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the states that have the most stringent requirements are also states that have seen an increase in their minority population. Florida has the nation's third largest Hispanic population. It is also a deeply partisan state where ""the Republicans have made a concerted effort to try and limit turnout by Democratic-leaning voters,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin . ""After the midterm elections in 2010, lots of Republican-leaning states passed efforts to limit voting,"" Toobin said. ""What's particularly noticeable is the effort in Florida because the state has such a history in this area."" State officials say they welcome the spotlight and stand by the purge. ""There is naturally going to be more scrutiny of a state the size of Florida which has such a significant influence on national politics,"" Cate said. ""But we hold ourselves to a high standard and expect Floridians to hold us to a high standard, as well, because we recognize how important it is to have fair elections."" In the meantime, voters like Quarles are waiting to see if the 2012 elections are a déjà vu. ""I agree with folks wanting to clean up the voter rosters,"" Quarles said. ""But being skeptical the way I am, I want to see who is picking and choosing whose getting kicked off.""","2000 cemented Florida's reputation as a place where elections sometimes go awry .

"The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia threw out one count of genocide against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic on Thursday, the court said. He still faces another count of genocide over the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, and nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He had filed a motion seeking acquittal on all 11 counts, but was successful on only one. Judges heard evidence that forces loyal to Karadzic systematically discriminated against Bosnian Muslims and Croats, but ruled the level of abuse did not amount to genocide. Srebrenica became an emblem for the dissolution of Yugoslavia -- once a multiethnic state of Serbs, Croats, Muslims and others -- into six countries during a bloody and brutal conflict in the early 1990s. The 1992-95 Bosnian conflict was the longest of the wars spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia. Backed by the government of then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations. Karadzic was removed from power in 1995, when the Dayton Accord that ended the Bosnian war barred anyone accused of war crimes from holding office. He was captured in 2008 after more than 13 years of hiding in plain sight in Belgrade. He had adopted an elaborate disguise that included long hair and a full beard, and was practicing alternative medicine in the Serbian capital. The trial began more than a year after Karadzic was captured. His former military commander, Ratko Mladic, was captured last year and is also on trial for charges including genocide. Both men would face life in prison if convicted. The court cannot impose the death penalty. Milosevic died in 2006 while on trial at The Hague.","Radovan Karadzic still faces a charge of genocide over the Srebrenica massacre .

"The family of Mary Richardson Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., blasted news accounts of her death Thursday for what they called ""inaccuracies and misrepresentations"" of her life. Mary Kennedy: 'Green' designer, wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy was found dead Wednesday in Bedford, New York, north of New York City. She died of asphyxiation due to hanging, the Westchester County medical examiner said Thursday. ""While we would naturally prefer to remain private at this very upsetting time, we feel compelled to make this statement because the description of Mary carried by certain news organizations since her passing yesterday is wholly inconsistent with the sister we knew and the life she, in fact, lived,"" her family said in a written statement. ""We loved Mary and knew her to be an exceptional mother, sibling and friend to many,"" they said. ""Countless people have described her as an extraordinary mother, selfless in her desire to help others, and one of the finest people in the world. We know her as all those things, and more."" Mary Kennedy's funeral set for Saturday . The statement did not single out any particular reports. But several accounts of her death noted her troubled marriage to the son of the onetime New York senator, who was assassinated in 1968, and the details of their private lives that were exposed when he filed for divorce in May 2010. Despite the filing, the couple were still married at the time of Mary Kennedy's death, her family attorney, Kerry A. Lawrence, told CNN. The evening after the divorce filing, Bedford police were called to the couple's home and found them arguing over taking their four children to a carnival. According to a ""domestic incident"" report filed by the officer on the scene, ""Mr. Kennedy stated that his wife was intoxicated and was acting irrational so he took the children to the carnival to remove them from the situation."" No one was injured, the report said. Two days later, Mary Kennedy was arrested for driving while intoxicated, but the charge was later reduced to a violation, the criminal charge was dismissed and her driver's license was suspended for 90 days, Lawrence said. A second arrest occurred in August of the same year in the town of Pleasant Valley, in which she was charged with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, Lawrence said. Those charges were dismissed completely in July 2011 because all the drugs were prescribed and taken as her physician advised, the attorney said. Mary Kennedy's death was a blow not only to her own family, but a fresh wound for a political dynasty long shadowed by tragedy. ""We know from a history of this family, it's very hard being a Kennedy, either being a blood Kennedy or being married to one,"" Laurence Leamer, a Kennedy biographer, said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""  ""The overwhelming celebrity, the attention, the obligations, the expectations that you're supposed to do something with your life. It's very, very hard."" Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent environmental lawyer who is a professor at Pace Law School in White Plains, New York, is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. His father was gunned down in California while making a run for the White House, nearly five years after his brother, President John F. Kennedy, also died at the hands of an assassin. More than three decades later, in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died when a plane he was piloting crashed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. David Kennedy died of a drug overdose and Michael Kennedy was killed in a skiing accident. Mary Kennedy was ""a tremendously gifted architect and a pioneer and relentless advocate of green design who enhanced her cutting edge, energy efficient creations with exquisite taste and style,"" Robert F. Kennedy's family said in a statement. ""Mary inspired our family with her kindness, her love, her gentle soul and generous spirit,"" a statement by the husband's family said. She advocated finding a cure for food allergies and asthma and was a co-founder of the Food Allergy Initiative, which is the world's largest private source of funding for food allergy research, they said. As a designer, Mary Kennedy specialized in green architecture. In a book titled ""Kennedy Green House,"" co-author Robert F.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two men from the minority Sikh community in Pakistan's tribal northwest were kidnapped and beheaded on Sunday, authorities said this week. Two others remain in custody. The men were kidnapped by the Pakistan Taliban for ransom from Khyber Agency two weeks ago, said Shafirullah Wazir, the area's administrative chief. They were killed when their family members were unable to pay their ransom, officials said. In the case of one of the abducted men, Jaspal Singh, the kidnappers had demanded 20 million rupees, the semiofficial Associated Press of Pakistan said. Khyber Agency is one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border. Sikhs have lived in the area for centuries, running businesses and operating farms. As the area has come increasingly under the influence of Islamic militants, so has pressure on the Sikhs. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report.","Two Sikhs in Pakistan's tribal northwest kidnapped and beheaded .

"Steve Garban resigned Thursday from the Penn State Board of Trustees, becoming the first board member to step down following the release of a scathing report that found it was part of the failure that allowed a longtime sexual predator to prey on boys at the school. Garban's resignation follows last week's release of an internal review conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh that found Penn State's most powerful leader showed ""total and consistent disregard"" for child sex abuse victims and covered up attacks by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. ""After absorbing the findings of the Freeh Report last week, the Board of Trustees accepted responsibility for the failures of governance that took place on our watch. Following the release of the report, you also asked each member of the Board to evaluate our individual paths forward,"" Garban wrote in his resignation letter to board chairwoman Karen Peetz. ""It is clear to me that my presence on the Board has become a distraction and an impediment to your efforts to move forward and continue the Board's most important work."" Garban served as chairman of the Board of Trustees when the scandal broke and stepped down following Sandusky's arrest. In a letter posted on the university's website, Peetz said she accepted the resignation. Garban worked at the university for 33 years. He was re-elected to his fifth term on the board in 2010, according to a biography posted online. Freeh's report cast a wide net of blame, from the late famed football coach Joe Paterno to the university trustees, in the scandal. Garban's resignation is the latest fallout for the university, which is still under scrutiny by the Department of Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), inquiries that could further tarnish its reputation and that of its storied football program. Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal, and more charges are possible as the state's Attorney General's Office investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky's behavior. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 sexual abuse counts he faced, involving 10 victims. He will be sentenced in September. Sandusky's legal team has said it will appeal the convictions.","Steve Garban was serving as chairman of the Board of Trustees when the scandal broke .

"Thailand has pardoned a Thai-born American who was sentenced last year to 2 1/2 years in prison for insulting the monarchy, his lawyer said Wednesday. Joe W. Gordon, whose Thai name is Lerpong Wichaicommart, was released Tuesday after receiving a royal pardon from the king, his lawyer said. Gordon's case is one of several that provoked criticism from human rights advocates over Thailand's controversial laws that punish defaming, insulting or threatening the royal family. U.S. authorities had also expressed concern about his imprisonment. The charge of writing and posting articles insulting the monarchy under the Southeast Asian country's lese majeste laws can yield a sentence as high as 20 years in prison in the Buddhist country, where the king is highly revered. Gordon, 54, returned to Thailand in 2010 after 30 years in the United States. He was arrested in May 2011 for posting a link on his blog to an unauthorized biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission. Gordon, who was received by U.S. Embassy officials after his release, wishes to leave Thailand immediately, his lawyer Anon Rumpa said. ""The case is over, he has no more pending court case or obligatory things to do,"" Anon said.","Thailand has strict laws that punish insults of the royal family .

"It is like many of the images of aftermath in Syria's chaotic war -- a man being pulled from the rubble of the building. But this one is different. The panic is muted, the men dig not slowly, but leisurely. This is because they know he is a regime fighter. ""Where are your friends?"" they ask, perhaps taunting him. ""Are you from Yemen?"" But no, this is something different. As they pull his terrified, tired frame from the dust, the blood seeping from a head wound and pitted against the white coat of silt from the rubble, it becomes clear this regime fighter is Afghan. Video obtained by CNN from Syrian rebels, which we cannot verify, shows this scene and the attempts by the rebels, who are engaged in a pitched battle to prevent the regime encircling the main Syrian city of Aleppo, to interrogate their new prisoner. That's the first indication there's something new here: he doesn't speak Arabic, but mutters in Dari. Facially, he appears Uzbek or Hazara, and is terrified. Their video shows him bandaged up, and on an IV drip. He is locked in a basement and fed, then questioned further. A comparatively generous fate for a regime prisoner in this savage war. It is unclear what happened to him, but he told his interrogators: ""My name is Sayed Ahmad Hussaini. The Iranians pay people like me to come here and fight. I am from Afghanistan and I am an immigrant in Iran. The Iranians brought us to Syria to fight to defend the Zainab shrine. I don't want to fight anymore."" He says he wants to go home, and that he was paid about $500 a month to fight. There are many Afghan immigrants in Iran, trying to find some shelter from the decades of war that have torn apart their land. He says he was trained and then sent to assist the regime. It is potentially a serious development in the Syrian war, and explains in some ways how the Syrian regime has gained ground in some areas after months of appearing exhausted. In the fight for Aleppo, they are fiercely contesting a hill settlement called Handarat, which is itself tiny, but vitally overlooks the main supply road into rebel held areas of Aleppo. If the regime hold Handarat, they can cut off rebel Aleppo from resupply, effectively besieging it. Seasoned Afghan fighters could assist the regime - so far letting the Coalition and moderate Syrian rebels take on ISIS -- in other battles too. CNN sent a photojournalist to eastern Afghanistan to follow up reports of recruitment by Iranian agents of mercenaries to fight for the regime. Inside Afghanistan . In one village, four men who did not want their identity or location revealed, said they had just returned from training in Iran. There, they were taken to a police station, blindfolded, and taken to a training camp where they were shown tactics and light to medium weapons. The men spoke in great detail about their experiences and were able to show the Iranian bank cards through which they will be paid their $500 to $1000 salaries a month. Other villagers ratified their stories. Their motivations were complicated. Most said they sought money - a likely motivation as the NATO drawdown in Afghanistan is changing the Taliban's dynamics and reducing the amount of money sloshing around in the country. They also wanted to fight America -- saying that fighting the moderate Syrian rebels the regime is targeting most heavily and who receive U.S. assistance - was one way of continuing this fight from Afghanistan. ""We want to go there for two reasons one is to fight against those who are being assisted by Americans in Syria and secondly Iran pays us to fight in Syria,"" said one man. ""Those who fight against Assad regime are America's slaves. That is why we want to fight them and kill them."" They said they were former Taliban who had left for Iran after disagreements in the militant group, known for its fractious and sprawling membership. ""Before this we used to be part of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but after our disagreements caused tensions among us, we left the Taliban and went to Iran. We are going there to fight. Either we will be killed or will be back with the monthly salary that the Iranian have promised to give us."" ISIS . Yet their limited knowledge of the Syrian conflict exposed a complex issue over which their loyalties to their paymasters, Iran, may be tested. Asked about ISIS, a predominantly Sunni group like the Taliban, the men said they knew little about them, but ""if we see them in Syria, we will definitely sit with them, talk to them and if our thoughts were similar, we would become friends with them."" That would be one unexpected outcome for the Iranian agents accused of assisting these men. Syria's war has local regime militia, joined by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Iraqi Shia militia, on one side. ISIS and its array of global radicals on another. And Syrian rebels, spanning the width of al Qaeda, to moderates with foreign backing. Syria's chaotic, intractable, and hopelessly unnegotiable war, just got another complex and battle-hardened actor.","Unverified video from Syrian rebels shows them pulling an Assad regime fighter from rubble .

"Forty years ago this Sunday, the Watergate break-in began the downward spiral of the Richard M. Nixon administration, ending with the disgraced president's resignation a little more than two years later. On the night of June 17, 1972, the Washington hotel served as a base for an illegal break-in by operatives of the Nixon re-election campaign at the offices of the Democratic National Committee, located in the Watergate office building next door. Five burglars were arrested. Rookie Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein used leaked information from a source they dubbed ""Deep Throat"" in hundreds of articles about the ensuing scandal. On Thursday, personnel files of W. Mark Felt, who identified himself as ""Deep Throat,"" were posted on the FBI's online records site called The Vault. ""Deep Throat"" became a part of the American lexicon. The film ""All the President's Men"" made famous the late-night parking garage conversations Woodward had with the mystery man. Woodward, Bernstein and Felt kept the identity of ""Deep Throat"" a secret until 2005, when Felt told Vanity Fair he was the source. Felt died in 2008 at age 95. On Monday, Woodward and Bernstein spoke of Felt's contribution to their coverage. ""We had uncovered the story,"" Bernstein said at a program put on by the Post. ""He did contribute key details at various points."" ""He gave us this assurance that we knew we were right,"" Bernstein added. ""He confirmed these things and it eliminated a lot of doubt that I think we might have had."" But Woodward said Bernstein's discovery of the bookkeeper for Nixon's re-election campaign was ""the real turning point in the coverage of Watergate."" The bookkeeper, Woodward said, had details of who controlled and received money. Felt, who joined the FBI in the early 1940s, was its associate director at the time of the burglary. Felt said he was unhappy with the way the administration meddled with the investigation into the break-in, which led him to divulge information to the newspaper. ""I'm proud of everything that Deep Throat did,"" Felt, then 92, told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in 2006, his first public interview on the subject. When King asked Felt whether he felt he had done anything wrong in going outside approved channels to get information out, Felt was unequivocal. ""I thought I was doing the right thing,"" he said . Felt, who retired from the FBI in 1973, had his own legal problems. He was convicted in 1980 on conspiracy charges for authorizing government agents to break into homes without search warrants in a hunt for bombing suspects in 1972 and 1973. When the case went to trial, former President Nixon testified on Felt's behalf. Felt was eventually pardoned in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan. When asked how he would like to be remembered, Felt said, ""I'd like to be remembered as a government employee who did his best to help everybody."" The FBI Vault file covers Felt's personnel file from 1941 to 1978 and a 1956 investigation into an extortion threat made against Felt.","FBI posts personnel records of former associate director W.

"Compounding the American military's difficulties on the Japanese island of Okinawa, a U.S. airman is under investigation over allegations he broke into a local family's home early Friday and assaulted a teenage boy before jumping off a third-floor balcony. The incident is likely to further deepen resentment among Okinawan residents about the significant U.S. military presence on the island. The situation was already extremely delicate following the arrest last month of two U.S. sailors accused of raping a local woman. That case prompted angry protests from Japanese officials and local residents. The U.S. military responded by imposing a nighttime curfew on its thousands of troops in the country -- a restriction the airman appears to have disobeyed Friday. According to Okinawa police, the suspect is alleged to have broken into the family's apartment in the village of Yomitan around 1 a.m. Friday, hit a 13-year-old boy who was in bed and damaged a television set. The boy was left with an injury to his cheek. The airman suffered ""possible broken bones and internal injuries"" after jumping from the apartment's balcony and has been admitted to a military hospital on the nearby U.S. Air Force base of Kadena, U.S. military officials said. Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba called the incident ""outrageous,"" noting that it took place despite the U.S. military curfew. He said the Japanese authorities would lodge a complaint with the United States. The U.S. ambassador to Japan, John Roos, said he was also appalled by reports of the incident. ""Let me be absolutely clear: I am very upset -- it's an understatement to say I'm very upset,"" he told reporters in Tokyo on Friday, expressing concern about the well-being of the Japanese boy who was allegedly attacked. He stressed that the U.S. military forces in Japan are ""undergoing a complete review of the liberty policies and other policies that will minimize, if not eliminate, any such incident in the future."" ""It is incredibly unfortunate that the purported actions of a few reflect badly on thousands of young men and women here in Japan, away from their homes, that are here for the defense of Japan,"" he said. American military officials on Okinawa, which lies south of the main Japanese islands, were trying to deal with the fallout from the situation. ""It is extremely regrettable when an alleged incident like this occurs,"" said Col. Brian McDaniel, vice commander of the 18th Wing of the U.S. Air Force, which occupies the Kadena base, the largest American military installation in the Asia-Pacific region. ""We are fully cooperating with Okinawan authorities on this investigation to ensure justice is served."" Maj. Christopher Anderson, the head of public affairs for the 18th Wing, said he had met with the mayor of Yomitan on Friday. ""This isn't how we want our people to conduct themselves,"" he said of the airman's alleged behavior. Japanese and U.S  authorities declined to disclose details of the airman's identity Friday, other than that he was assigned to Kadena. The issue of violent crimes by U.S. troops in Japan has divided the two countries for decades. It came to a peak in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island. Relations between the U.S. military and the people of Okinawa have also been strained in recent months over the U.S. Marine Corps' deployment of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft to a base on the island. Some Okinawa residents are concerned because the Osprey has had a reputation for crashing. The Okinawan community has long been against the presence of the U.S. military, which recently announced that thousands of Marines will be moved to a base in Guam.","""It's an understatement to say I'm very upset,"" U.S. ambassador says .

"The United States believes one of its armed helicopters was shot down over Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing both crew members on board, a U.S. military official said.

Operational reporting indicates there were no civilian casualties or damage to civilian property, ISAF said.

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)A tense Ferguson is waiting to hear whether a St. Louis County grand jury believes Officer Darren Wilson should stand trial in the fatal shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown. The grand jury hearing evidence plans to meet Friday for what might be its final session. A decision on whether to charge Wilson could come the same day, law enforcement officials briefed on the plans said. Jurors have until January, but the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come this month. For weeks, lawyers, analysts and journalists have speculated on when it will be announced. Ferguson became a flashpoint for racial tension after the teen's shooting; Brown, 18, was black, the officer is white. Street demonstrations and violence erupted, and heavily armed police came face to face with angry protesters demanding justice. Some predict that will be the case again when the grand jury's decision is announced. Along West Florissant Avenue, the ground zero of violent protests, businesses put back the plywood boards they had taken down from their windows and doors. What happens next? If a decision comes Friday, prosecutors are expected to provide law enforcement with 48 hours notice before making a public announcement, possibly on Sunday. The current plans could still change and prosecutors could shift the planned grand jury session, the law enforcement officials said. Prosecutor Robert McCulloch has said he plans to make public all evidence and testimony presented to the grand jury, but there is growing concern on how to deal with identities of people who have testified, the sources say. There are concerns some witnesses could be put at risk once their testimony and identities become public, law enforcement officials said. In some cases, witnesses might have testified differently under oath, providing different accounts than the ones they gave in media interviews, the official explained. Others may have provided testimony that may be interpreted as helpful to the officer's account of the August 9 shooting. The prosecutor's office said it hasn't decided whether to redact names of witnesses. 'Three months to prepare' St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has said his officers are ready for whatever happens. ""We've had three months to prepare. ... Acts of violence will not be tolerated,"" he said. ""Our intelligence is good. Our tactics are good. We can protect lawful people and at the same time arrest criminals."" St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay wrote the city's aldermen to explain that 400 National Guard troops would be requested for the city. They will be placed with police officers at 45 locations around the city to prevent violence and property destruction. The city's police will wear normal uniforms, as ""we do not want to appear to militarize our response to the demonstrations and want to do everything we can to de-escalate,"" the mayor wrote, adding that police may don riot gear if public safety demands it. ""If our officers put on their personal protective gear, it is not to intimidate peaceful protesters. It is for the sole purpose of keeping everyone safe,"" he wrote. Area school superintendents wrote a letter to city officials and authorities requesting that they announce the grand jury's decision on an evening or weeknight so it doesn't affect about 20,000 students traveling back and forth to schools. Many parents received notice to fetch their children from school if the decision comes out earlier in the day. A group of community member has asked for 48 hours' notice before the ruling is made public. It also released 19 ""Rules of Engagement"" that touch on major points of contention between protesters and police. The group wants assurances that neither police nor the government will interfere with the flow of information, as well as a guarantee that police won't use rubber bullets, armored vehicles, rifles or tear gas. The group also requested that officers wear attire ""minimally required for their safety"" and that ""specialized riot gear be avoided except as a last resort."" Nationwide response . Brown's shooting on August 9 also touched a national nerve, with protests decrying racism and police brutality taking place around the country since his death. The Ferguson National Response Network expects that reaction to the grand jury ruling will not be limited to the St. Louis area. It has set up a Tumblr account advertising almost 100 ""planned responses"" to the ruling. They will take place from West Palm Beach, Florida, to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Brown's supporters have turned out in force, but Wilson's supporters have demonstrated on occasion as well. CNN's Jake Tapper contributed to this report.","St. Louis police chief says his officers are ready for all scenarios .

"British lawmakers launched a furious, multipronged barrage of questions Wednesday at Bob Diamond, who resigned as the head of Barclays a day earlier, but Diamond steadfastly defended himself and the bank. Diamond refused to be drawn into whether he would give up millions of dollars' worth of bonuses, and he insisted the scandal that forced him to quit was due to a small number of ""reprehensible"" traders at Barclays. The banker said he became ""physically ill"" when he found out about the scandal -- something he said he learned only last month. ""The behavior was wrong. It's been eradicated. It's been dealt with,"" he insisted. Diamond stepped down Tuesday as chief executive of Barclays amid the scandal that also claimed two other executives at the bank this week. Barclays chairman resigns amid rate-fixing scandal . He insisted Wednesday at a parliamentary hearing that history would judge the bank as ""an incredible institution."" But lawmaker Andrea Leadsom, herself a former Barclays banker, accused Diamond of living in a parallel universe, saying the culture of Barclays was the problem, not the solution. And Teresa Pearce, another member of the Treasury Select Committee, attacked his line of defense. ""You just keep saying, 'I didn't know, I didn't know,' "" about wrongdoing at his bank, she said. She pressed him on an infamous comment he made to lawmakers last year to the effect that it was time for bankers to stop apologizing for their actions. ""It did not come across in a way that was positive or the way I meant it,"" Diamond said after quibbling with her about when he made the remark. He also brushed aside angry questions from lawmaker John Mann about whether he would give up bonuses or donate them to charity, saying decisions had not yet been made. British and American regulators fined Barclays more than $450 million last week for rate-fixing during the height of the global financial crisis. The scandal centers on the rates at which banks lend each other money. The rate is hammered out based on input from big banks in London each morning and is known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. It affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. The fine came after Barclays admitted some of its trading desks purposely underreported its interest rates. Former investment banker Ralph Silva said the scandal has caused such fury because of its impact on the public. ""If they're manipulating Libor, what they're basically doing is taking money out of the public's pocket,"" he said. Diamond said Wednesday he was ""sorry, I'm disappointed and I'm angry"" about the rate-fixing. ""This was wrong and I'm not happy about it, but we put all the resources we could to make sure it was dealt with. ... This doesn't represent the Barclays that I know and I love."" He blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of ""a couple thousand."" Diamond was pressed hard about communications between his bank, politicians and the Bank of England regarding his bank's views on what the rate should be. Barclays published internal e-mails ahead of Wednesday's hearing suggesting that politicians were asking the Bank of England to put pressure on banks to keep interest rates low. Lawmakers demanded to know who Diamond meant when he said ""Whitehall"" was concerned about Barclays' views on Libor, which is set each day by a group of banks. Whitehall is a catch-all term for the British government. He refused to name names and gave inconsistent answers about whether he thought the pressure was coming from elected politicians or career civil servants. The answer, if it ever emerges, could have political implications for the Labour Party, which was in power at the time. Before the hearing, one of the lawmakers on the Treasury Select Committee said Diamond was making a serious accusation. ""He has made allegations about the behavior of a very highly respected and trustworthy deputy governor of the Bank of England, Paul Tucker, and many of us will want to get to the truth of that,"" David Ruffley said. The allegation ""goes to the very heart of the integrity and probity of regulators in the City of London. One of those is the Bank of England,"" he said. Tucker asked the committee Wednesday for a chance to testify, the panel said in a statement. Why Libor scandal will change banking culture . Diamond has long been a controversial figure and has been a vocal backer of huge bonuses for bankers. ""It's about pay for performance,"" he told CNN earlier this year, calling bonuses ""rewards for success."" His own pay package remains ""under discussion,"" Barclays told CNN on Wednesday. Diamond's total compensation package for 2011 was worth £6.3 million ($9.8 million), including salary, bonuses and share options, the bank said. The annual bonus consisted of £2.7 million ($4.2 million) in shares and was deferred over three years, the bank said. The chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Britain's banking regulator, last month blasted the ""cynical greed of traders asking their colleagues to falsify their Libor submissions so that they could make bigger profits."" Chairman Adair Turner said the scandal ""has caused a huge blow to the reputation of the banking industry"" and ""has justifiably shocked and angered people."" At least seven other banks are under investigation on suspicion of rate-fixing, leading to speculation that Diamond could be the first of many executives to resign. Libor e-mails: 'For you...anything' Financial regulators in London have not named the banks, but Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse and UBS have acknowledged that they are under investigation. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have also confirmed that they are under investigation. Bank of America has refused to comment on reports that it is being probed. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that a full parliamentary inquiry would be held into the Libor rate-fixing scandal and standards in the banking industry, with witnesses called to give evidence under oath. Barclay's is the 15th-largest bank in the world, according to an annual list of the world's top 1,000 banks released Monday by The Banker magazine. It is Britain's second-most profitable bank, and the 18th-most profitable in the world, the trade magazine said. Cameron unveils probe into bank standards . Explaining the Libor interest rate mess .

"The Dalai Lama bows in deference to the great man. He's joined by 20 other Dalai Lamas, assorted superheroes and a young woman dressed as a fish tank. They lend their voices along with thousands more in a resonating chorus of ""Jonah, Jonah!"" As the giant former New Zealand rugby star ambles around the perimeter of the stadium, the final of the Wellington Sevens tournament is being fought out between the host team and South Africa. But the game is almost won and the action on the field is momentarily forgotten as 30,000 spectators, bedecked in an array of outlandish and inventive fancy dress costumes, welcome back one of their own. In their eyes there's no such thing as a former All Black. Once an All Black always an All Black. But there are All Blacks and then there's Jonah Lomu. He became a global sporting phenomenon after his heroics at the 1995 World Cup, scoring four tries in a bulldozing semifinal performance against England that caught the attention of NFL talent scouts and made him a hero in his homeland. As well as presenting February's edition of CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide, Lomu was also presenting the Wellington Cup to the winners of the tournament.  It's one of the goals which eluded him as a player in a sevens career which encompassed victory at the Commonwealth Games, World Cup and Sevens World Series. Born in Auckland, where he made his name as a rugby player, Lomu moved south to the capital for the final years of his domestic career before a kidney transplant halted his playing days -- though he would later recover health and continue with overseas clubs. During the final moments of the game at the Westpac Stadium, he stands at the touchline bellowing advice: ""Numbers boys. Numbers!"" His mind is on the pitch. The call of ""numbers"" means wherever you are on the pitch, you look up and count the opposition players from the outside in -- 1, 2, 3 -- to help you determine which player to line up to tackle. In a fast-flowing game such as sevens, it's a simple way of ensuring the New Zealand defense is solid. The swirling wind and rain which accompanied much of this tournament are far from unfamiliar to Wellingtonians. But the South Africans, who beat New Zealand in the previous final in Las Vegas, fail to cope with the conditions and a Kiwi side which has bounced back from a first-round defeat by Fiji. The increasingly frenzied home support gives the New Zealanders another edge. When the All Blacks walk onto the pitch for their warmup, the crowd roars. When they return to the dressing room it's as a human phalanx, each man's arms upon the shoulders of the man in front, the sublime leading the sublime in a display of togetherness behind their inspirational captain D.J. Forbes, whose shaved head gleams beneath the floodlights. The crowd roars louder. When the players run out onto the pitch for the game itself, the noise levels step up several more decibels. And when the foghorn sounds for the end of the final game, it's the signal for cheering, dancing and fist-pumping as diverse groups of peacocks, cavemen and women,  bunches of human bananas and assorted other fruit share the joy of victory. The winners' podium is hastily assembled. Brooms are required to sweep water off the platform.

"(CNN)A Czech archeology team in Egypt has uncovered an intriguing find: the tomb of a previously unknown queen. The discovery was made in an Old Kingdom necropolis southwest of Cairo in Abusir, home to the pyramid of Pharaoh Neferefre, who ruled 4,500 years ago. The tomb was found in Neferefre's funeral complex, and it's believed that the queen was Neferefre's wife. In a statement to the Agence France-Presse, Egypt's Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty called the queen Khentakawess III, noting that this is the ""first time we have discovered the name of this queen who had been unknown before the discovery of her tomb."" The tomb, which one official said dated back to the middle of the 5th Dynasty (2994-2345 BC), had an inscription that indicates its owner was the ""king's wife."" Archaeologists also found roughly 30 utensils made from limestone and copper. ""This discovery will help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids,"" el-Damaty told the AFP. The expedition was led by the Czech Institute of Egyptology, which is affiliated with Charles University in Prague. The team's leader, Miroslav Barta, said in a statement that their newest find is just more proof of how ripe the Abusir site is for further research. ""This is another significant discovery in the last few years (that) have repeatedly confirmed that the Abusir necropolis provides a number of unique sources for the reconstruction of major epochs of ancient Egyptian history,"" Barta said.","A team of archaeologists uncovered the tomb of a previously unknown queen .

"MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- A 44-year-old Bolivian drug addict and alcoholic who describes himself as a church minister was the sole person responsible for the brief hijacking Wednesday of a commercial jetliner, a Mexican official said. Military personnel surround a hijacked Aeromexico jet after it landed Wednesday in Mexico City. The suspect, Josmar Flores Pereira, told authorities he hijacked the Boeing 737 jet because the date -- September 9, 2009, or 9/9/9, and 666 reversed -- held some significance for him, said Genaro Garcia Luna, the secretary for public safety. ""He said that because of that divine reference, he wanted to alert Mexico City of an earthquake,"" Garcia told reporters. Flanked by two police officers, the suspect -- wearing a white shirt and blue jeans -- was then paraded in front of the news media. Chewing gum, he smiled. ""Christ is coming soon,"" he told reporters before being escorted off. He said that he had attached colored lights to a can and that there had been no bomb. The hijacker took control of Aeromexico Flight 576 as the jet flew from the resort town of Cancun, telling a flight attendant he was one of three hijackers, Garcia said.  Watch CNN's Rick Sanchez report on the hijacking as it unfolded » . He said a cardboard box he had contained a bomb, and threatened to blow it up if his demand to speak to President Felipe Calderon was not met, Garcia said. Calderon was in the presidential hangar in the airport preparing to depart when the incident began, leading him to cancel his planned flight, CNN affiliate TV Azteca reported. The hijacking apparently went unnoticed by many of those aboard the plane, which landed five minutes ahead of scheduled and was moved to a remote area of the airport. Passengers, clutching their hand luggage, walked from the plane and down a moveable stairway onto the tarmac, where they got into buses. Pamela Cheatham, who said she was on the flight en route to Colorado, told CNN that nothing appeared amiss until the plane did not go directly to the terminal. Instead, the pilot announced that, for security purposes, the plane was gong to have to sit on the tarmac for a few minutes, she said. ""But when we saw the SWAT team and guys with the guns on both sides of the airline, we knew something was up,"" she said. Moments later, the suspect and several other people were taken into custody, TV Azteca said. The package turned out not to contain explosives, the station said. Garcia said the other people who were detained turned out not to be involved.  Watch Aeromexico passengers being released » . A U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the situation said preliminary information indicated there were 112 passengers aboard the plane, all from Mexico, the United States or France. ""The flight was very tranquil,"" said Marisa Lopez, a passenger who was seated in Row 24 with her baby. She said the only thing that caught her attention was the large number of emergency vehicles that were lined up along the tarmac when they arrived, five minutes ahead of schedule. ""Really, it was all very peaceful,"" she said. ""We saw nothing."" Others were more aware of what was going on. ""It was very difficult, but the pilot told us to remain calm,"" said another passenger, who added that many of the passengers were families returning from vacation in Cancun.  Read timeline of events » . The woman said the hijacker never spoke to them during the 45 minutes they were held. ""We were scared,"" said another woman. ""But it seemed like things got under control when we came down. We were immediately surrounded, when we landed, by federal police."" Flores' wife, speaking with CNN by telephone from their home in the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca, said her husband had been looking for a way to get his message about God to the news media. ""He never wanted to hurt anyone,"" said Elisa Melgar, 38, the mother of their three sons and his wife of 18 years. ""As his wife, I support him,"" she said, adding her husband had not touched alcohol or drugs for the past 17 years. ""He's a man who was transformed by the power of God.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's controversial president defended his government's relationship with the country's supreme leader on Friday, disputing charges of a political rift. Iranian government said Ahmadinejad won two-thirds of the vote in the June 12 vote. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking to a gathering in Mashad in northern Iran, rejected claims by people who have attempted to cast the relationship between his government and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""as tainted,"" according to Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. ""They are ignorant of the fact that our relationship with the respected leader is far above the framework of politics and administration and is based on love and faith, and resembles the relationship between father and son,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""The efforts of ill wishers to insinuate such doubts is fruitless, and they will surely take such wishes to their graves. This road is blocked to the devils."" Differences between high-ranking Iranian officials over the controversial June presidential elections have stoked talk of a rift in the government and the Shiite religious hierarchy that rules the country. In addition, Ahmadinejad has been criticized lately by conservatives and opposition politicians for appointing a controversial politician, Esfandyar Rahim Mashaie, to the post of first vice president. Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered Ahmadinejad to nullify Mashaie's appointment, and Mashaie announced he would resign from the position. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaie presidential adviser and head of his bureau. Mashaie made enemies among Iran's fundamentalists when he reportedly said last year that the Iranian people are friends with all people, including Israelis. He was also criticized for attending a ceremony in Turkey where women danced on stage. In Iran, women are forbidden to dance in public and Iranian officials are expected to leave when such entertainment is provided for them while they are visiting abroad. Mashaie's daughter is married to Ahmadinejad's son. He is among the president's closest confidants and Ahmadinejad has defended Mashaie despite the criticism. The latest criticism of Ahmadinejad came during Friday prayers. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, the head of Iran's Guardian Council, criticized the move to make Mashaie a vice president and Ahmadinejad's firing of Cabinet members. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to be officially approved on Monday by the supreme leader and inaugurated Wednesday before the nation's parliament. Many Iranians believe Ahmadinejad's victory in the June elections was rigged, and the result prompted angry protests. People took to the streets Thursday to mourn the death during street demonstrations last month of Neda Agha-Soltan, who has emerged as a symbol of the post-election ferment. Agha-Soltan, 26, was shot during protests on June 20. Her last moments were captured on a shaky video, probably shot with a cell phone, that was seen around the world. More than 3,000 people came to a Tehran cemetery to mourn on the 40th day after her death -- a custom in Shiite Islam. Clashes broke out there and at other locations between police and demonstrators or mourners. One clash occurred at the Grand Mosalla -- a mosque under construction in Tehran. Press TV said that at least 50 Iranians were arrested when thousands of people gathered in Tehran, but most were released a short time later, a senior police official said. Mir Hossein Moussavi, the main opposition leader during the election, attempted to go to the gravesite but was turned away by security forces. On Friday, a Moussavi video surfaced on a Facebook site. In it, he defended the opposition movement and stressed the message that Iranians must return to the principles and ideals of the Islamic revolution in 1979. And he also made similar points in remarks published by the Iranian Labour News Agency on July 27.","Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad denies rift with supreme leader .

"(CNN)Michael Brown's gunshot wounds included a shot in the hand at close range, his official autopsy shows, according to an analysis reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. A county official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the autopsy document that the Post used to do its report is authentic. The detail could lend credence to Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's account that he and the unarmed black teenager scuffled at his patrol car before Brown was shot and killed. Wilson told investigators that during a struggle for his pistol inside a police SUV, Brown pressed the barrel of Wilson's gun against the officer's hip, the Post-Dispatch reported, citing a source with knowledge of his statements. The officer tried to prevent Brown from reaching the trigger, the source told the newspaper, and when he thought he had control he fired. But Brown's hand was blocking the mechanism, the Post-Dispatch reported. Wilson said he fired two shots, and Brown was hit in the hand and ran. He told investigators that he fired again when Brown turned back and charged at him, according to the paper. Earlier, a private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed the teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The official autopsy, as published by the Post-Dispatch, said Brown sustained six gunshot entrance wounds. New details leak, stoke protests . Friend gives different story . Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown on the street when the shooting occurred, told CNN that the officer pulled up and told them to get on a sidewalk. They told him they were almost home and would be off the street shortly. Still in his car, the officer grabbed Brown by his neck, but he tried to pull away as the officer pulled him toward him, Johnson said. The officer drew his weapon and fired, hitting Brown, Johnson said. A bloodied Brown took off running, but the officer followed him and fired, according to Johnson. Brown turned around with his hands up and told the officer he was unarmed, but the officer fired and the teen hit the ground, Johnson said. Complete coverage of the events in Ferguson . More details revealed . Brown's blood was found on the officer's uniform and inside his police car, law enforcement sources told CNN earlier this week. Those sources corroborated details first reported by The New York Times. At least one of the wounds Brown suffered is consistent with a struggle and appeared to be fired at close range, according to a different source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. ""That tends to support any testimony that there was some kind of scuffle in the police car,"" CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. ""And if so, that tends to support Officer Wilson's testimony and his justification for using deadly force."" But Cevallos said the details about Brown's blood on the officer's gun and on his uniform might only go so far in helping the officer's case. ""Ultimately, that officer will have to come up with justification not for firing his gun the first time, but for each and every bullet that came out of his firearm -- whether at the car or away from the car,"" he said. Brown's death is the subject of two inquiries: one by a St. Louis County grand jury considering whether Wilson should be charged, and the other by federal investigators looking into whether any civil rights violations occurred. Day of protests . Under the name Ferguson October, activists demanding justice for Brown will host a protest in the Missouri town Wednesday. Numerous other protests are also expected in cities across the country -- in Sacramento, California; San Francisco; New York City; Philadelphia; Athens, Ohio; and Greensboro, North Carolina, among others. CNN's Evan Perez, Sara Sidner and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.","Official autopsy: Brown sustained 6 gunshot entrance wounds .

"Nigerian security forces routinely torture people -- including women and children -- taken in as suspects or for interrogation, Amnesty International has claimed in a graphic new report. In the study, released Thursday, the rights group alleges systemic use of torture by the police, based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over the course of 10 years. People are often detained in dragnet operations and tortured as punishment, to extort money or to extract ""confessions"" as a shortcut to ""solve"" cases, it claims. The report, titled "" 'Welcome to hell fire': Torture and other ill-treatment in Nigeria"" alleges that abuse is so widespread that many police stations have an informal ""officer in charge of torture"" and that some police sections have special rooms, or ""torture chambers"" where it is carried out. Methods commonly used include nail or tooth extractions, choking, electric shocks, rape and other sexual violence, it claims. A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force refuted the allegations, however, saying the report contained ""some blatant falsehoods and innuendos."" ""Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police,"" said Emmanuel Ojukwu, force public relations officer and acting commissioner of police, in a statement. Amnesty says its researchers interviewed victims, their families, rights defenders and current and former police officers to compile the report. Boko Haram crackdown . The number of reported abuses has increased in northern Nigeria as Nigeria's security forces have stepped up their fight against Boko Haram, the report said. Since 2009, between 5,000 and 10,000 people have been detained as suspects in the crackdown on the militant Islamist group, which is designated as a terror organization by the United States. One man, identified only as Ahmed, said he was among a group of men who were stopped by soldiers outside a mosque after prayers in Yobe state in February 2013. He said the soldiers ""told all of us to lie down on the ground in the street."" ""The soldiers shot and killed some of them on the spot, some were shot on the legs, and the soldiers began to beat some of us on the head with iron rods, others were beaten with wood."" The men were taken by vehicles to prison, Ahmed said, and some of the wounded men died on the way. Once there, they were ""kept tied for three days,"" fed only ""handfuls"" of food per day, and forced to share a half-liter of water per two men per day. The report goes on to quote Ahmed: . The beating, the torture was just too much for us. They do all types of things to you, the soldiers. They will tie your hands behind your back, with the elbows touching and then one of them will walk on your tied hands with their boots. Your hands will remain tied and then they'll pour salt water on your wounds. You can't rub it, even if it goes into your eyes. My eyes got swollen as a result of that. I thought I was going to be blind. I have never experienced such brutality in my life."" 'I was bleeding' ""This goes far beyond the appalling torture and killing of suspected Boko Haram members,"" said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International's research and advocacy director for Africa. ""Across the country, the scope and severity of torture inflicted on Nigeria's women, men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer."" Belay called for Nigeria's Parliament to take the ""long overdue step"" of passing a law to criminalize torture, which is banned under the country's constitution and international treaties. The report also cited examples of abuse against women and children. Mahmood, a 15-year-old boy from Yobe state in northern Nigeria, ""was arrested by soldiers with around 50 other people, mainly boys between 13 and 19 years old,"" the report stated. Amnesty International said the military ""held him for three weeks, beat him repeatedly with their gun butts, batons and machetes, poured melting plastic on his back, made him walk and roll over broken bottles and forced him to watch other detainees being executed (without trial). Mahmood was freed in April 2013, according to the report. Military in Yobe state even arrested and beat a 12-year-old boy, poured alcohol on him, forced him to clean vomit with his bare hands and stepped on him. One 24-year-old woman named Abosede told Amnesty International she was abused using tear gas and still suffers as a result. ""A policewoman took me to a small room, told me to remove everything I was wearing,"" she is quoted as saying. ""She spread my legs wide and fired tear gas into my vagina... I was asked to confess that I was an armed robber... I was bleeding... up till now I still feel pain in my womb."" 'Not systemic or endemic' Ojukwu said the Nigerian Police Force has been ""undergoing systematic reforms, and aligning themselves with the demands of democracy"" but that it has significantly improved its human rights record since 1999. ""The police do not routinely torture suspects,"" he said. ""It is not systemic or endemic. Whenever instances of human rights abuses are brought to the notice of superintending officers, the offending personnel are promptly sanctioned in line with the laws and regulations."" The Amnesty International reporters did not speak to the police authorities, he said, which denied them the opportunity to have a fair hearing. He called on Amnesty International to provide specific details of the allegations and said they would be investigated. Belay dismissed the Nigerian police response to the Amnesty International report. ""The police decision to deny the findings before careful reading of the report or examining the accusations made in it echoes their attitude to criminal investigations -- apportioning blame before ascertaining the facts. ""Their pledge to investigate abuses rings hollow so long as they continue to refute our evidence of systemic torture, gathered from more than 500 cases and including testimony from current and former police officers.""","Amnesty International alleges the systemic use of torture by the police in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- It's been one week since the streets of Ferguson boiled over after protesters learned the officer who shot teenager Michael Brown won't face criminal charges. And tensions are still simmering. Pockets of protests continue to erupt across the country, including a demonstration that interrupted a speech Attorney General Eric Holder gave in Atlanta Monday night. Here's what to know to get up to speed on the Ferguson fallout: . THE POLITICS . Attorney general responds to protesters: . A group of chanting protesters interrupted a speech by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church on Monday, but Holder said the group shouldn't be criticized. ""There will be a tendency on the part of some to condemn what we just saw, but we should not,"" Holder said. ""What we saw there was a genuine expression of concern and involvement. And it is through that level of involvement, that level of concern and I hope a level of perseverance and commitment, that change ultimately will come. And so let me be clear, let me be clear, I ain't mad atcha, all right?"" Demonstrators were escorted out of the church after about 30 seconds and continued to protest outside. They pumped their fists in the air, chanting, ""No justice, no peace"" and ""We have nothing to lose but our chains."" Holder's response drew a standing ovation from many in the crowd. In the speech, Holder also said he plans to announce ""rigorous new standards"" for federal law enforcement ""to help end racial profiling, once and for all."" The new guidance will be released in the coming days, Holder said. Holder is in Atlanta as he launches a series of nationwide conversations following the upheaval in Ferguson, Missouri. Details of Holder's next stops have not been released. ""This presents this nation with, I think, a unique opportunity,"" Holder said. ""And I think it's incumbent on all of us to seize this opportunity to deal with issues that for too long have been ignored."" Holder has opened two civil rights investigations in Missouri -- one into whether Wilson violated Brown's civil rights, the other into the police department's overall track record with minorities. Audience members applauded and cheered as he told the crowd Monday night that those investigations were ongoing. ""These twin investigations have been rigorous and they have been independent from the beginning. Now, while federal civil rights law imposes an extremely high legal bar in these types of cases, we have resisted prejudging the evidence or forming premature conclusions,"" Holder said. ""And as these investigations proceed, I want to assure the American people that they will continue to be conducted thoroughly and in a timely manner, following the facts and the law wherever they may lead."" Obama vows 'this time will be different': . President Barack Obama held a series of meetings Monday stemming from the Ferguson unrest, calling for a ""sustained conversation"" surrounding the relationship between police and the communities they serve after a series of meetings with Cabinet members, law enforcement officials, young activists and others on Monday. ""In the two years I have remaining as President, I'm going to make sure that we follow through,"" Obama said. During his remarks Monday afternoon, Obama admitted that past task forces have fallen short, but said that ""this time will be different because the President of the United States is deeply vested in making it different."" THE PROTESTS . Demonstrations across the country: . The looting and arson that marred last week's protests are over. But the demonstrations continued in Missouri and across the country. After activists called for students to walk out of school and employees to walk off the job nationwide Monday, pockets of protesters nationwide spoke out against police violence. James Villalobos, a student at the University of Massachusetts- Amherst, shared a photo with CNN's iReport showing a large crowd at the school protesting the Ferguson decision. At Yale University, student demonstrators raised their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters in Ferguson have been using for months. At least two protesters were arrested at a New York City demonstration Monday, police said. Protesters snarled traffic throughout Washington Monday by blocking main roadways across the city, police said. St. Louis Rams players speak out: . Several St. Louis Rams players sent a silent but strong message before they took the field Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. The players raised their palms in the air, repeating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters in Ferguson have been using for months. But the move infuriated the St. Louis Police Officers Association, which issued a statement saying it was ""profoundly disappointed"" with the group of Rams ""who chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week."" ""The gesture has become synonymous with assertions that Michael Brown was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when Wilson, according to some now-discredited witnesses, gunned him down in cold blood,"" the police association wrote. Jeff Fisher, the Rams' coach, told reporters Monday that the players would not be disciplined. ""They are exercising their right to free speech,"" he said. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar sent an e-mail to his staff saying Rams Chief Operating Officer Kevin Demoff called Monday to apologize. ""I received a very nice call this morning from Mr. Kevin Demoff of the St. Louis Rams who wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to our department on behalf of the Rams for the ""Hands Up"" gesture that some players took the field with yesterday,"" Belmar wrote in the e-mail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But the Rams characterized the conversation differently. ""We did not apologize,"" Rams spokesman Artis Twyman told CNN. The team issued a statement saying the organization had ""positive discussions"" Monday with Belmar and other police officials ""during which we expressed our respect for their concerns surrounding yesterday's game."" ""The Rams will continue to build on what have always been strong and valued relationships with local law enforcement and the greater St. Louis community as we come together to help heal our region,"" the statement added. THE OFFICER . What's next for Wilson? He's been in hiding for most of the 3 1/2 months since the shooting. And now Darren Wilson is no longer a Ferguson police officer. But what's next? ""That's a million dollar question,"" said Greg Kloeppel, one of Wilson's attorneys. ""He's probably going to go back to school. He's probably going to have to pursue other areas of employment, because I think it's quite obvious a job in law enforcement is highly unlikely at this point in time,"" Kloeepel told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. Wilson is considering possibly studying business, finance or accounting, attorney Danielle Thompson said. He made the decision to resign, his attorneys said, to put a stop to threats targeting other police officers in Ferguson. ""I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow,"" Wilson, 28, wrote in his resignation letter. ""For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal."" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said there will be no severance pay for Wilson's resignation. THE CITY . New initiatives: . Ferguson's mayor outlined new initiatives in an attempt to forge a better relationship between the city's police department and the community. Knowles announced a new civilian review board to provide input on police efforts as well as a scholarship program to try to recruit more African-American officers. Even though the majority of Ferguson is black, only about four of the 50-some officers on Ferguson's police force are black. THE BRIGHT SPOT . A touching sight: . After all the images of screaming, burning and anguish over the past week, one poignant image has been shared more than 150,000 times: a picture of a young black boy and a white police officer hugging. The photo, taken in Portland, Oregon, came after 12-year-old Devonte Hart was holding a sign offering ""Free Hugs"" at a protest against a grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson. The boy had tears streaming down his face. Portland police Sgt. Bret Barnum said he approached Devonte ""not as a police officer, but just a human being"" when he saw him crying. Devonte seemed hesitant to talk at first, but Barnum said he broke the ice by talking about life, travel and summer vacations before asking for a hug. ""The situation itself is something police officers do every day when they go out on the street and make citizen contacts,"" Barnum told CNN. The Oregonian newspaper was the first media outlet to publish the photo by 20-year-old freelance photographer Johnny Nguyen. Nguyen told CNN he attended the rally just to take pictures for himself. Then he saw the exchange between the officer and the boy. ""I thought, what a great scene,"" Nguyen said. ""A powerful scene. A scene with a message that needed to be communicated. A scene of coming together."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .

"Pope Francis called Friday for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the Middle East as he met with Turkey's leaders on the first day of a rare papal visit to the predominantly Muslim country. Speaking in Ankara alongside Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Pope called on people of all faiths to show respect for human life, dignity and religious freedom. ""Fanaticism and fundamentalism, as well as irrational fears which foster misunderstanding and discrimination, need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers,"" he said. Terrorist violence shows no sign of abating in Iraq and Syria, with grave persecution against Christians and the Yazidi minority in particular, Francis said. ""Hundreds of thousands of persons have been forced to abandon their homes and countries in order to survive and remain faithful to their religious beliefs,"" he said. ""Turkey, which has generously welcomed a great number of refugees, is directly affected by this tragic situation on its borders; the international community has the moral obligation to assist Turkey in taking care of these refugees."" At the same time, Francis said, Turkey has a ""great responsibility,"" because of its history and location bridging East and West, to help bring different communities together and promote the path to peace. Erdogan criticizes Islamophobia . In his address, Erdogan highlighted what he said was a disturbing trend of increased racism and Islamophobia in the West, at the same time as Islamist extremism wracks parts of the Middle East. The world must come together if it wants to combat terrorism, he said. The Turkish leader also suggested the West should not turn a blind eye to abuses committed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while it pursues ISIS. The timing of the Pope's visit, in this period of unrest, is extremely significant, Erdogan added, voicing hope that it would lead to an ""auspicious era"" of improved relations in the world. Francis also met with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and will hold talks with the head of the country's religious affairs directorate, Mehmet Gormez. On his first trip to Turkey as pontiff, Francis will also spend time with the head of the Orthodox Church. The three-day visit, which may be one of the most challenging of his papacy, is intended to strengthen bridges, not only between sister churches but also across religious divides. It comes at a time when Christians -- as well as other minorities and many Muslims -- are coming under increasing pressure amid worsening conflict in the Middle East, the birthplace of Christianity. Positive relations . The Pope's first stop in Ankara was at the Ataturk Mausoleum, tomb of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of Turkish republic and its first president, where he laid a wreath. He will spend Saturday and Sunday in Istanbul at the invitation of Patriarch Bartholomew I, spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians. Bartholomew has asked the Pope to take part in celebrations marking the feast of St. Andrew, founder of the Eastern Church and the older brother of St. Peter. The invitation was first extended at the time of Francis' papal inauguration in March 2013, according to Vatican Radio. ""We are eagerly awaiting the visit of our brother, Pope Francis,"" Bartholomew is quoted as saying. ""It will be yet another significant step in our positive relations as sister churches."" Before meeting privately with Bartholomew on Saturday, Francis will celebrate Mass at the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul. He will also attend the Divine Liturgy at the Patriarchal Cathedral on Sunday. Forced to flee . Over the past decade, first al Qaeda and then ISIS have forced the majority of Christians to flee Iraq and Syria. Only a fraction of their former number remain in areas under ISIS control, deciding to place their faith in God or pay the terrorists a protection tax. Growing numbers, especially from Syria, have ended up in Turkey. The nation already is reeling from the influx of around 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the vast majority Muslim, and it's politically uneasy, with a controversial and conservative government that its opponents fear will challenge the secular identity of the post-Ottoman Empire. Turkey also faces an atmosphere of increased insecurity, with ISIS at its border and the extremist group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announcing its intention to conquer Rome and the world. Kenan Gurdal, deputy director of the Virgin Mary Ancient Assyrian Church Foundation in Istanbul, told CNN that the Pope's visit means a great deal. ""In a time of chaos in the Middle East, in a time where there is Muslim-Christian fighting, it is a beautiful thing to have a pope visit a Muslim country,"" he said. ""It is a very positive thing, and hopefully this can be a lesson to the world and that it contributes to peace.""

"Newt Gingrich is a political opportunist.  His job is to pack as much powerfully charged meaning into every sentence as he can, which makes him a working poet.  So he knows full well that calling someone a ""food stamp president"" brings up the working person's fear, looming reality, and in some cases the actual experience, of unemployment -- while making a shout-out to racism and affixing a stigma to poverty. All the while hiding behind the symbol of a flag. It is the bane of America and Americans that too often, those who best grasp the language of hatred and fear are those who are most likely to lead.  This is simply because tacticians like Gingrich are well-versed in the traditional battle-cry and have no fear of the outcome of political civil war.  Why should they be afraid ? They will never be down in the streets suffering with the people. Gingrich says his words were misinterpreted, that anybody who criticizes his characterization of President Obama is attacking the very fiber of American democracy. He sounds like a lawyer explaining away a crime by influencing the point of view of the jury with doubletalk.  ""It is not that my client isn't guilty but that you cannot prove that he is."" Woe be it to America when our lawyers become our poets. It is the job of the lawyer, poet and politician to stir the emotions of their audience.  But where literary poets speak of love and loss, the lawyer vindicates and the politician aims to take the reins of power.  Characters are assassinated and whole groups of people are vilified in order that new blood ascend the throne. What is most revealing about Gingrich's statement is the nature of the comment, rather than who said it or even what it means.  We see, at the beginning of the race for president, that our contestants for the greatest power in the world are limited in their choice of tactics, that they must destroy their opponents and, later, those that stood against their campaign. How do I know  this is true?  Because Mr. Gingrich is a political poet and good political poets always have their finger on the jugular vein of the nation.  Mr. Gingrich has told me in three words that the battle line will be drawn by fear-stoked hatred. Hatred and fear have deep roots in the American heart.  The original colonists came here to escape religious, cultural and political oppression.  Sadly, these idealistic refugees brought those social banes along with them. There was once a time when only white male property owners participated in the democratic process of America.  There was a time when we slaughtered the original inhabitants of these shores.  But it was not the landed gentry that made up the rank and file.  Our senators and congresspersons, our millionaires and gentlemen farmers did not have to bleed for the crimes we've committed and the freedoms we've attained.  All our leaders had to do was to locate our fear and greed and hatred.  These feelings were exhorted in speech and song and catchy phrases.  Once this was accomplished we, the people, standing on sodden streets and dressed in rough cloth, marched off to die for another man's dream. That was then and this is now.  We -- Americans of every stripe, gender and race -- are brothers and sisters in that great and ever-changing experiment of democracy.  We are not enemies.  If someone has a better plan he or she should ascend to our presidency.  If they have lied we should know it.  If they are corrupt it must come out.  But we cannot allow our emotions to be ignited by hidden messages of fear and hatred.  This election is about us working together to implement our brightest potentials, not our basest natures.

"As Russian President Vladimir Putin opens the Winter Olympics in Sochi on February 7, there will be relief hidden behind his characteristically guarded smile. For Putin, the past two years have witnessed a remarkable recovery. Two years ago, Putin seemed to be on the ropes. Tens of thousands of Muscovites were flooding central squares to protest a parliamentary election they said had been tarnished by massive fraud. His approval ratings were in free fall, having dropped 15 points since December 2010, according to polls from Moscow's Levada Center. Internationally, Putin was also on the defensive. He appeared to have isolated himself by backing the wrong horse in Syria's civil war. As rebels closed in on the Damascus suburbs, many observers thought Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Putin supported, would soon be swept from power. If so, Russia stood to lose its only Mediterranean military outpost, the naval station it leased at Tartus. The European Union, alarmed at the continent's dependence on Russian gas, had raided offices of the Russian company Gazprom in Germany and the Czech Republic and was planning further investigations. When built, a projected EU- and U.S.-supported Nabucco pipeline threatened to pump gas from Azerbaijan to Vienna, undercutting Russian supplies. Not since the height of the global financial crisis had Putin seemed so embattled. Today, things look quite different. Over the following year, the Moscow protests died away. Putin's ratings stabilized in the low 60s, a level many Western leaders would envy. With a mixture of new repressive laws, prosecutions and co-optation tactics, the Kremlin managed to box in and divide its domestic critics. So confident did Putin feel by mid-2013 that he could, without losing sleep, allow the opposition activist Alexei Navalny to run for mayor of Moscow (he lost, though with an impressive 27%) and pardon his nemesis, the imprisoned former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, allowing him to leave for Switzerland. Putin's star has also risen on the international stage. In September, he persuaded al-Assad to pledge to give up his chemical weapons, saving President Barack Obama from a military intervention the U.S. leader clearly dreaded. Al-Assad looks more secure today than he has since protests against his rule began. By granting asylum to the NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Putin managed -- ironically, given Russia's own record of secrecy and spying -- to place himself on the side of a global movement for greater transparency and respect for citizens' privacy. One example:  The New York Times, in a recent editorial, called Snowden's revelations ""a great service"" and urged Obama to end Snowden's vilification and offer him ""a plea bargain or some form of clemency."" In a showdown with the EU over the future of Ukraine in November, Putin again came out on top, persuading Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to reject a trade deal with Europe to which Brussels had committed its prestige. Instead, Yanukovych pledged to deepen his country's trade ties with Russia, prompting furious protests from pro-Europe Ukrainians.  As for Gazprom, its sales of gas to Europe rose by 16% in 2013 to a record high. The Nabucco pipeline failed to line up committed gas supplies. According to one of the consortium's partners, as of June the project was ""over."" Most of these successes are temporary, and time is not on the Kremlin's side. Fighting continues to rage in Syria, and the destruction of al-Assad's chemical weapons has been painfully slow. Ukraine will sooner or later integrate with Europe. Yanukovych is struggling to stay in power as violence flares nightly in central Kiev. Gazprom's buoyant sales reflected an unusually cold winter in Europe. At home, the frustrations that fueled the demonstrations two years ago have not gone away, just lost a focus. A major economic deterioration could prompt a new, potentially more consequential wave of protests. Russia's growth rate has been falling steadily, reaching just 1.4% by the end of 2013, the lowest rate of Putin's years as President. And the Kremlin has no serious strategy to restart the economic engines. For now, Putin still has reason to feel confident. Even Sochi, which could have turned into a political disaster, might well pass off positively for the Kremlin. The advance bad press has lowered expectations so much that the Games will seem something of a success if they merely take place without the stadium collapsing or terrorists exploding bombs in Sochi itself. The de facto boycott by Western leaders over Russian intolerance toward gays will probably buy Putin a little support at home since most Russians share his discomfort with ""nontraditional lifestyles"" and do not like outsiders telling them what to do. In a recent poll, 73% agreed the state should ban public displays of homosexuality. What explains this turnaround? Putin has benefited more from luck than skill. Even without new repressive measures, the wave of demonstrations was bound to subside, following the natural ebb and flow of protest movements. Those that climax without producing leader turnover tend to lose momentum, though some might reignite months or years later. In international affairs, Putin profited from the mistakes of the West. Obama, having backed himself into a corner with talk of ""red lines"" and facing a humiliating veto in Congress, had to smile and accept help on Syria from the leader he had recently taunted for his ""slouch."" The European Union overplayed its hand in Ukraine, insisting on terms that Yanukovich thought would damage him politically. Putin, offering a bailout with fewer visible strings attached, walked away with the Ukrainian leader's agreement. One may debate whether the real mistake in the Snowden case was the extent of U.S. spying or the lax security that allowed Snowden to expose it. Either way, it was a U.S. blunder, which landed unexpectedly in Putin's lap. At some point, Putin's luck is bound to run out. Both at home and abroad, political challenges loom in 2014. Still, as he prepares to greet and congratulate the Olympic athletes, Russia's President is on a roll.","Two years ago, Vladimir Putin was in trouble, with widespread protests and falling ratings .

"A bipartisan congressional report has found a widespread problem with counterfeit electronic parts installed or purchased for use in American military systems around the world.  Two U.S. senators said most of the bogus parts originate in China, according to an investigation by their staff. ""There's a flood of counterfeit parts entering the defense supply chain,"" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, told reporters at a news conference Monday, ""it is endangering our troops and it is costing us a fortune."" Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said the investigation documents the alarming ""threat counterfeit parts pose to the safety of our men and women in uniform, to national security and to our economy."" ""We can't tolerate the risk of a ballistic missile interceptor failing to hit its target, a helicopter pilot unable to fire his missiles, or any other mission failure because of a counterfeit part,"" McCain said. A study by congressional staff found and examined about 1800 cases of suspected counterfeit electronic parts dating from 2009 to last year, totaling about a million individual components. Tracing the supply chain, 70% of the components came through China, where a variety of methods were used to misrepresent the parts as new and genuine. Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Tuesday holds a hearing on the matter and says he will propose holding contractors accountable for the cost of flushing out bogus components. Both senators said the problem is partly the result of efforts in recent years to increase competition and lower the cost of supplying the military with spare parts to keep systems running. ""We have found in the past the $500 toilet seat, all of these things, when you rely on sole contractors."" McCain said. But they said leaders in China are another part of the problem.  China blocked Senate investigators from a proposed trip to explore the production and sale of electronics coming from China, saying it was a sensitive matter that could hurt relations with the U.S., the lawmakers told reporters. ""They have it backwards,"" Levin said. ""They have the ability to stop this counterfeiting. It is being done in the open. We'll show pictures tomorrow of where it's being done."" ""They're gonna have to stop it, or they're gonna pay a heavy price if we start inspecting all of their parts that are coming into this country."" The two men cited several examples where taxpayers had to cover the cost of replacing questionable parts with genuine components. Levin said the military should make sure its suppliers would have to pay, instead. In one instance, counterfeit transistors were found in a Raytheon night vision system used on an anti-submarine helicopter, the failure of which could block the crew from seeing a target and aiming a missile. It would not affect flight capability. A more serious risk to flight involves the Air Force C-27J, which has a cockpit video display from the contractor L-3. The company found suspected bogus memory chips, traced to China that could cause the display to fail and cause erroneous instrument readings. Boeing was the third company cited by the senators in the report they discussed ahead of Tuesday's hearing. The contractor said its P-8A, a military version of a 737, was found to have counterfeit ice detectors. One of them fell out and was rattling around inside the module on the airplane, according to documents from 2009. Levin said ""If you put the onus on all of our contractors, which we should do, to make sure that the parts that are being supplied are legitimate parts, they will get that message back to their suppliers as well."" In addition to ranking executives from at least three U.S. defense contractors who will testify about the problem of bogus components installed in their systems, Tuesday's hearing will include first-hand witness accounts of production, processing and packaging in China of questionable and counterfeit parts.","""Shocking"" amount of counterfeit electronic parts in U.S. military gear .

"(CNN)Class is in session at schools across Nigeria, where students are learning to shape eyebrows, smooth foundation, apply eye-shadow, and -- perhaps -- defy economic gloom to grasp a glamorous future. Informed by the remarkable rise of their own ""head teacher"" to the summit of Nigeria's cosmetics industry, the students -- for the most part young women in their 20s and 30s -- are being taught that makeup artistry can be their passport to self-confidence, independence, and a business of their own. Making a difference to young lives is all part of the mission for 37-year-old cosmetics queen Tara Fela-Durotoye. ""There are certain things telling you that you cannot make it; that you will not make it; that Nigeria is not a place where people make it,"" says Fela-Durotoye. ""I beg to differ."" Tara's story . Fela-Durotoye is the CEO of House of Tara International, a household name in her native Lagos, where the company develops makeup, perfume and accessories that eschew the Western-centered tastes of the big cosmetic firms in favor of products designed specifically for Nigeria's women. In 1998, aged 21, Fela-Durotoye was already on her way to becoming a qualified lawyer when she launched House of Tara as a makeup studio, at first specializing in makeup designs for brides and their wedding parties. Her artistry proved a hit with Nigeria's booming middle class and, today, the company employs over 3,000 beauty reps across West Africa. She says she was drawn to cosmetics by her inspirational step-mother, by seeing ""what makeup actually does to a woman in terms of self-esteem and confidence."" The Tara beauty range was born out of her frustration at the lack of suitable cosmetics available in Nigeria -- ""Importers didn't know exactly what was right for Nigerian women,"" she says -- and sense that her products could fill the gap while encouraging pride in home-grown glamor. ""A lot of the Tara products are named after either beauty icons or beauty philosophies in Africa,"" says Fela-Durotoye. ""For us it's about sharing the world and sharing our culture to the world."" The past few years have seen the company expand into catwalk and film makeup design as Lagos fashion and cinema scenes have flourished. When French pharmaceutical giants L'Oreal came to Nigeria looking for a partner to help introduce their Maybelline range to the West African country, they signed up with Tara, earning Fela-Durotoye a spot on Forbes' list of ""20 Young Power Women In Africa"" in the process. Playing teacher . As a child, Fela-Durotoye remembers visiting her grandmother, and gathering with the children from the local village to pass on lessons she'd learned at school. ""She always teased about how she expected me to be a teacher,"" recalls Fela-Durotoye. ""And I would say that she was correct. Grandma was correct,"" she continues. ""I am still a teacher, the only thing is this time I'm not teaching maths or English. I'm teaching enterprise: I'm teaching makeup artistry as a platform for enterprise."" Fela-Durotoye's 14 schools teach a range of courses, from short personal makeup courses to professional diplomas in makeup artistry. When she founded the schools a decade ago, she says few considered makeup to be a serious career prospect, with parents pushing children toward professions like law, medicine and accountancy. But with Nigeria's economy growing, the market for ""little luxuries"" such as cosmetics -- and demand for trained makeup artists for weddings, film and everyday life -- has seen a rise. Today, Fela-Durotoye makes the lofty estimate that 80% of Nigeria's makeup artists were trained by House of Tara. Fela-Durotoye says she sees each student as a potential small business owner and her courses teach knowledge of the beauty industry, plus customer service and business ethics skills, in addition to practical beauty essentials. The aim is to equip graduates with everything they need to launch their own beauty store, and past graduates have gone on to start small firms that employ a handful of other makeup artists. If it seems strange for makeup artist Fela-Durotoye to be training thousands of competitors, she says you'd be missing the point. ""What drives me is living purpose. I think my business is a vehicle to change lives.""","House of Tara is Nigerian beauty brand that teaches makeup styling and business skills to budding cosmetics entrepreneurs .

"In an unexpected move, Pope Benedict XVI -- born Joseph Ratzinger -- has announced that he is to resign. Benedict was elected pope in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II. We explore what the surprise announcement means for the Catholic Church. Why has Pope Benedict XVI resigned? In his statement, Pope Benedict -- who turns 86 in April -- said he had come to the certainty ""that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry."" Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Pope Benedict had the right and potentially the duty to resign. But he stressed that the pope's decision was not because of any external pressure. Read more: Pope Benedict to resign at the end of the month . Is the pope in poor health? Lombardi told reporters the pope was not unwell. ""There isn't any disease specifically -- it's all to do with deterioration and weakness in his body, as the holy pontiff has said in his statement,"" he said. Lombardi said the battery in the pope's pacemaker -- which he has had since he was a cardinal -- had been replaced in the last few months, but he stressed that it was a routine procedure. When will he step down? The pope said that he would step down at 8:00 p.m. on February 28, Rome time. Lombardi said as far has he knew, the day was ""just an ordinary day"" without particular significance but that Pope Benedict might have chosen it to ensure a new pope was in place for Easter. He said he understood the pope usually finished his working day at 8:00 p.m. which was why he had chosen that specific hour to step down. Could the next pope be from Africa or Latin America? Is it normal for popes to resign? It is the first time a pope has resigned in nearly 600 years. The last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII in 1415. He stepped down to end the ""Great Western Schism"" -- during which there were rival claims to the papal throne. In 1294, Pope Celestine V resigned after only five months, preferring the simple life of a monk to the majesty of being pope. According to the National Catholic Weekly, modern popes have felt that resignation is unacceptable and could encourage factions within the church to pressure pontiffs to step down. Canon law states that a resignation must be made freely and properly manifested and that the pope resigning must be of sound mind. Read more: Who is Pope Benedict XVI? When will the next pope be elected? A meeting of the College of Cardinals to elect the next pope will be held. The gathering is known as a ""conclave."" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said there would be elections some time in March and he anticipated that there would be a new pope before Easter. Lombardi said Vatican scholars were studying the constitution to determine exactly when the conclave would begin. What is the election process? By law, the conclave begins in the Sistine Chapel. On that morning, the cardinals will celebrate the Votive Mass, ""Pro Eligendo Papa."" That afternoon, the cardinals begin the election process. The cardinals draw lots to select three members to collect ballots from the infirm, three ""tellers"" to count the votes and three others to review the results. Blank ballots are then prepared and distributed. The ballots are rectangular in shape and must bear in the upper half, in print if possible, the words ""Eligo in Summum Pontificem,"" meaning ""I elect as supreme pontiff."" The electors write the name of the candidate on the lower half and fold it in two. After writing the name of one man on his ballot, each of the active cardinals -- those under 80 years of age -- walks to an altar in order of seniority and pledges to perform his duty with integrity. Each cardinal then places a folded ballot containing his choice onto a small disc made of precious metal and drop it inside a chalice. After all votes are cast, the tellers tally the ballots and the result is read to the cardinals. If a cardinal receives two-thirds plus one of the votes, he is the new pontiff. If there is no winner, another vote is taken. If there is still no winner, two more votes are scheduled for the afternoon. How is the result of the vote broadcast? After the votes are counted each time, the ballots are burned. If there has been no winner, a chemical is mixed with the ballots to produce black smoke when they are burned. Sight of the black smoke emerging from the roof of the Vatican Palace tells those waiting in St. Peter's Square that a pope has not yet been selected. When a winner has been selected, the ballots are burned alone, and the white smoke indicates there is a new pope. What do you think of the Pope's decision? What will the pope do until he officially steps down? Lombardi said the pope's appointments up until the end of February -- including audiences with the presidents of Romania and Guatemala -- had been confirmed. On February 27, the pope's last general audience will take place. Lombardi said the Vatican was trying to arrange for it to be held in St Peter's square so that more people could attend and ""to make it a sort of tribute to the holy pontiff."" What will Pope Benedict do after his resignation? Lombardi said it was expected that Pope Benedict would devote his time to reflection and prayer. In his statement, Benedict said he wished ""to also devotedly serve the Holy Church of God in the future through a life dedicated to prayer."" Lombardi said he didn't expect the pope to be given any other duty, given his age, and he said Benedict would no longer be involved in decision making or administrative duties. Pope Benedict was ""very discreet"" and was ""not someone who will interfere"" or create issues in terms of his successor, he said. Where will the former pope live? After he steps down, Benedict will move to the pope's summer residence, Castel Gandolfo. At a later date he will move into in a monastery at the Vatican. The monastery has recently been renovated and extended to include a small chapel. What will Pope Benedict be known as once he has stepped down as pope? According to the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, Pope Benedict will return to being known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. It said he would be addressed as his eminence or Cardinal Ratzinger. However, Lombardi later told reporters it was hard to imagine that the pope would be called a cardinal.

"(CNN)It turns out there's a pesky little gremlin lurking around in the Patriots equipment room deflating footballs. Mystery solved. We should have known all along there was a logical explanation for the ""Deflategate"" scandal gripping the Sport Nation. That's pretty much what New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his coach Bill Belichick, would have us believe after their less-than illuminating press conferences yesterday. Both men claimed they were just as stumped as us over how exactly 11 out of 12 of the team's footballs used AFC Championship game against Indianapolis had been illegally deflated below regulation specs. ""When I came in Monday morning, I was shocked to learn of the news reports about the footballs. I had no knowledge whatsoever of the situation,"" said a famously crotchety Belichick. ""I was completely totally unaware of anything."" His quarterback, appearing equally puzzled, wanted everyone to know that he's no cheater: ""I would never do anything to break the rules. I believe in fair play. I have no knowledge of anything ... no knowledge of any wrongdoing ... I don't know what happened."" Really Tom? It's hard to believe -- almost laughable, really -- that Brady, who is in his 15th NFL season with six trips to the Super Bowl and three Super Bowl wins, noticed nothing wrong. This is a guy who's known to micromanage every aspect of the game, including the ball. And he's on record saying he prefers a soft football. How could a pro like this notice nothing wrong? The NFL, which according to ESPN reports, had been put on notice by the Colts going into the AFC Championship game that the Patriots may have used ""soft balls"" earlier in the season, said it is conducting a full investigation But with the Super Bowl less than two weeks away, we've heard nothing from them, nor apparently, has Brady, he said yesterday. So it's easy to understand why fans and even pro athletes are not buying Brady's story: . ""It's obvious that Tom Brady had something to do with this,"" said Hall of Fame QB Troy Aikman on his Dallas radio program, even before the Brady-Belichick press conferences. ""So for the balls to be deflated, that doesn't happen unless the quarterback wants that to happen, I can assure you of that. Now the question becomes: Did Bill Belichick know about it."" The evidence is clear: Eleven of the team's balls were illegally deflated and they didn't get there by themselves. All the talk about cold weather being the culprit? Forget it. Not only was the temperature in the 50s on game day, but if weather was a factor then the Colts' game balls would have also deflated. That didn't happen. Brady, always the polished pitchman, is playing the innocent victim role perfectly. Perhaps this is all just a conspiracy put out there by Patriots haters, Brady suggested yesterday. Good try but most reasonable people do not believe in conspiracy theories. And hopefully, even fewer people believe in invisible gremlins. So there must be another explanation. That leaves the Deflategate spectacle in the hands of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The scandal has provided plenty of jokes for late-night television and Twitter. But cheating in the NFL, a $9.5 billion a year industry with an overall market value of $46 billion for its 32 teams, is no laughing matter. It's been a rough year for the integrity of the game. Goodell has admittedly made botched calls over several cases involving domestic abuse, with the Ray Rice scandal being the most egregious. And this season has been littered with debatable play-calling in crucial game situations. This is no time for stalled investigations. A ruling on Deflategate after the Super Bowl would be a huge letdown, and signal that cheating, no matter how blatant, is no big deal in the NFL. Goodell should act swiftly and announce sanctions against New England before the Super Bowl takes place in Phoenix on Feburary 1. Fans are not the only ones calling for the commissioner to clean this mess up. Earlier this week, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller called on Goodell to restore the credibility of the game. ""I am seeking decisive actions ensuring all teams are playing according to the rules,"" Heller said in a statement. He recommended the league work with the NFL Players Association to resolve the issue ahead before the Super Bowl. Let's be clear: The Patriots are second-time offenders when it comes to cheating. Back in 2007, Belichick was fined the NFL maximum of $500,000 and the Patriots were ordered to pay $250,000 for spying on an opponent's (The New York Jets) defensive signals. In the end, the team's assistant video guy took the fall and was the only person fired in the incident. The Pats also lost a draft pick in 2008. ""This episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long-standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field,"" Goodell said at the time in a letter to the Patriots. Goodell got it right back then: He handed out the biggest fine ever for an NFL coach and he sent a clear message that cheating would not be tolerated, or excused away. This time around, despite the billions of dollars attached to the Super Bowl, Goodell needs to go further. At a minimum, the commissioner should: . -- Disqualify the Patriots from the Super Bowl . -- Strip the team's AFC Championship title . -- Fine, or suspend Belichick, who despite his claims to the contrary should have known about the deflated balls -- and even if he didn't, he's ultimately responsible for everything that happens on the field. And if it can reasonably be argued that Brady knew or should have known based on his NFL expertise that the football has been tampered with, then he too should face tough sanctions. Since there's no precedent for disqualifying a Super Bowl team, Goodell would have to put a plan in place. It makes sense to me that the next best AFC team would go instead of the Pats, which means the Colts would play. And no, it doesn't matter that New England beat Indy, 45-7. The score is not the point when a team cheats. And if winning -- by any means necessary -- is really all that matters these days in the NFL, then we might as well throw out the rule books and stop preaching about the ""sanctity of the game."" It's 2015 and it seems the Patriots still think the rules don't apply to them. They haven't learned their lesson. This time around the commissioner must send an even stronger message so there's no confusion. The Patriots should be benched for Super Bowl XLIX.

"The first witness in the trial of Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, testified Monday that the army slaughtered Bosnian Muslims from his village in 1992. Elvedin Pasic said that he was 13 when his family, anticipating the arrival of the army, decided to split up. Though the family members had signed a truce with their Serbian neighbors, they feared that the village's men and boys would be killed anyway, he said. So, Pasic and his father fled with about 200 other villagers, including the village imam, he said. But a combined force of Bosnian Serb army soldiers and Serbian civilians ambushed them, he said. ""It was around midnight,"" he said. ""Suddenly we stopped. And everyone said, 'Hush-hush. We are very close to the Serbs. Don't move, don't make any sounds.' That's when the bullets started firing."" Fleeing the gunfire, the group ran straight into a minefield, where one of the men's legs was blown off, Pasic said. ""He was crying and saying, 'Do something, kill me.' My dad grabbed me and said, 'Don't look.' "" After the villagers surrendered, a Bosnian Serb soldier separated the youngest children and a handful of women from the men, said Pasic, who was with his father at the time. ""They ordered all the women and children to get up; I didn't want to get up. I said, 'I don't want to get up.'  I didn't want to leave him. 'Get up,' he whispered to me.  My uncle said, 'Get up; you will survive.' "" He said his father denied to the Serbs that any of his relatives were among the group in order to save him. The women and children from the group were then led through a gantlet of Serbian civilians who beat them with sticks, after which the prisoners were put on a bus and taken to the village Grabovica, Pasic said. During Pasic's testimony, Mladic wiped his eyes. Mladic is accused of masterminding the army campaign to ""cleanse"" Bosnia of Croats and Bosnian Muslims. Those atrocities included the Srebrenica massacre in which 8,000 people were executed and the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted more than three years and killed 10,000. Pasic is the first of hundreds of witnesses expected to testify against Mladic, who is 70. Pasic, now 34, said he was reunited with his mother but he never saw his father again. At the end of his testimony, he said that of the more than 100 men he left behind, ""There is no doubt in my mind, they were all killed."" Mladic's trial began in May, but was suspended after a single day over the prosecution's failure to disclose evidence against Mladic. Mladic is accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. He has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. His trial is taking place in The Hague at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. In May, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He said he would show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, which were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight and was extradited to the Netherlands. In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia's battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo's ill-prepared residents in the valley below. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial was completed.","Elvedin Pasic was 13 when his family fled the advancing Bosnian Serb Army .

"Repeal and replace -- or at least resist -- is the Republican mantra in the wake of last week's Supreme Court ruling upholding President Barack Obama's signature health care reform law. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney promises to get rid of Obamacare if elected, and at least four Republican governors say their states will hold off implementing main provisions of the 2010 law to see what happens in November. However, analysts and industry experts contend the reality is that health care reform will happen out of necessity, whether through the Affordable Care Act or the momentum it already has created since being passed over two years ago. According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers' Health Research Institute, 14 states and the District of Columbia have made ""significant progress"" toward implementing reforms, while another 19 states have made ""moderate progress,"" leaving 17 states -- or about a third -- that have yet to change their laws or take other steps toward implementation. The report, titled ""Implications of the U.S. Supreme Court Ruling on Healthcare,"" says all players in the health care industry -- state governments, hospitals, insurance companies, employers and drug companies -- need to participate in the emerging reform process or risk getting left behind. ""Despite the political uncertainty, private-sector initiatives -- accentuated and accelerated by the law -- are moving forward,"" the report says. ""The crucial question now is: Will health reform define your organization, or will your organization define the post-reform landscape?"" Republicans launch blitz against health care law . A repeated recommendation in the report advises industry leaders to ""stop putting off  key decisions,"" and it specifically calls on states to ""stop taking a wait-and-see approach to health reform implementation."" Some popular provisions of the health care law already have taken effect. Insurers no longer can deny coverage for children due to pre-existing conditions, and parents can keep offspring on their family coverage up to age 26. The main parts of the comprehensive law intended to reshape the U.S. health care industry take effect in 2014, with insurance exchanges set up to help individuals and small businesses buy affordable health coverage while Medicaid is expanded to include more low-income Americans. Republican governors already opposed to the health care law pledge full resistance to any changes for now. ""In Louisiana, we're not doing either. ... I don't think it makes sense to do those,"" Gov. Bobby Jindal said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""I think it makes more sense to do everything we can to elect Mitt Romney, to repeal Obamacare."" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said the state ""ceded nothing"" by refusing to implement the exchanges and could prevent them from getting set up. Opponents of Obamacare ""should not freely give up the leverage we now have to repeal and replace this bad law,"" she wrote in a letter Monday to congressional opponents of the law. Other GOP governors who say they will delay any implementation include Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Scott of Florida. The Republican goal is to galvanize the conservative base around the issue in seeking the landslide victory needed to take the White House and both chambers of Congress in November, a result necessary for any chance of repealing the health care law. At the same time, Jindal and other opponents generally refrain from speculating on what they'll do if Obama wins re-election, which would kill the repeal possibility. Republican leaders also have failed to offer any details for how they would replace the health care law, especially popular provisions such as preventing denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. Ceci Connolly, the managing director of the Health Research Institute, told CNN that some health care providers already are taking steps toward the goals of health care reform -- such as shifting from the current fee-for-service system to an outcomes-oriented managed care system. Your health care is covered, but who's going to treat you? Asked about the continuing Republican pledges of non-compliance, she remarked: ""It is not unheard of for the rhetoric to be somewhat different from the reality on the ground."" That was the case with Obama's stimulus package in 2009, when some Republican governors and state legislators vowed to reject funding it provided. In the end, some turned down funding for specific programs -- such as a high-speed rail line in Florida -- but others eventually accepted the money. For example, former GOP Govs. Mark Sanford in South Carolina and Sarah Palin in Alaska lost battles with their respective state legislatures over whether to reject some stimulus funding. ""Even some states that have some political objection to (the Affordable Care Act) are thinking about what kind of insurance exchange they would like to have,"" noted Connolly, a former Washington Post reporter who covered the health care law's tortuous journey through Congress. The issue is whether the nation is ""getting our money's worth,"" Connolly said, noting that currently ""we spend $2.7 trillion and we're not getting $2.7 trillion worth of health care."" So far, grants totaling more than $1 billion have been allocated to help states prepare to set up exchanges, Connolly said. She added that the federal government will offer its own exchange, likely to be similar to the health care coverage choices provided to federal employees, for residents of any state that fails to set up its own. ""I think that we will see a patchwork over the next couple of years, and that's not surprising,"" Connolly said. Haley, however, said the federal grants are intended to lure states into setting up exchanges ""to insulate federal officials from implementing what is sure to be an expensive, inefficient and wildly unpopular new federal entitlement program."" The Medicaid expansion presents a different question. In its ruling, the Supreme Court provided states with an opt-out option by striking down a provision that would have allowed the federal government to withhold all Medicaid funding from non-participating state governments. For now, the federal government pays an average of 57% of the cost of the Medicaid health program for the poor, according to Connolly. The expansion under Obamacare would make more people eligible but includes 100% federal payment of the additional cost for the first three years, then 95% for the next three years and 90% beginning in 2020, she said. Opponents such as Jindal contend strapped state governments need to cut back on spending, rather than continuing to fund Medicaid at current levels and eventually picking up a share of the expanded cost. However, analysts and industry experts say the health care bill's deal is too good for states to resist. ""States will take the federal money, especially in light of longer-term fiscal strains like rising health care and retirement costs,"" wrote Tracy Gordon, a Brookings Institution economic studies fellow who specializes in state and local public finances, in an online posting Monday. Romney calls health care mandate a 'tax,' contradicts top aide . ""Some governors and lawmakers have already said their states will decline to participate in the Medicaid expansion,"" she wrote. ""But eight states have already gotten started on extending eligibility through waivers programs and another three are in the queue. Notwithstanding the highest court in the land, the whole Medicaid package is still an offer states can't refuse."" Connolly noted that health insurance companies and health care providers would push strongly for the Medicaid expansion, which would increase the customer base and reduce the number of uninsured showing up for treatment in emergency rooms. ""I think we need a period to kind of catch our breath and see what kind of conversations take place in the coming months with the governors and the state legislatures and the providers in the states and see what they come up with,"" she said. ""I think that many states will reassess."" Another option is negotiating a fix to the Medicaid provision in light of the Supreme Court ruling. Some Republican governors indicated they would prefer block grants that allow states to decide how to spend their Medicaid dollars. Obama expressed a willingness to tinker last week in responding to the Supreme Court decision, saying ""it's time for us to move forward, to implement and where necessary improve on this law.""

"(CNN)Taiwan, are you getting a new sex theme park or just teasing us? The word on the street -- or on the Internet at least -- is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island's Southwest Coast National Scenic Area. After interest was aroused by details posted on the region's official website, however, the page was quickly taken down. The park's administration director, Cheng Rong-fong, confirmed with CNN that the proposal is real, but he insists it's just a concept at this point. ""The ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government,"" said Cheng. Details of the plan, circulated by a user on Taiwan's popular PTT online bulletin board, outlined a ""Taiwan Romantic Boulevard"" sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties. Each stage has a different theme: ""dating paradise,"" ""scenic spot for wedding gowns,"" ""silk road of love"" and a proposed 10,000-meter-square ""sex theme park."" The sex theme park -- or ""Garden of Eden"" as it's called in the proposal -- will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including Jeju's Loveland in South Korea and Vigeland Park in Oslo, Norway. Claiming to be educational, the park will serve as the final stop of the four-stage journey of love. It'll be divided into different sections, covering topics including sex positions, unusual sex lives and sex toys. ""The dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but aren't officially a couple yet,"" the proposal said. Cheng said that the proposal shouldn't have been made public before being finalized, but insisted, if realized, that it will help regenerate a neglected area. ""The southwestern coast of Taiwan has been an important salt farm since the Qing Dynasty,"" he says. ""It has a unique background, culture and ecological value. Yet, a decade after it was declared a national scenic area, it still hasn't received much attention from tourists. So we thought to ourselves, is it time to try a new mode of thinking? ""The white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area,"" said Cheng. ""That's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating/wedding-themed park in Taiwan."" The proposal generated heated debate online. ""This is the first time I find a government proposal interesting,"" said one online critic, according to Taiwan's Now News. Another said: ""We surpass Japan. The pride of Taiwan."" ""This is too out of line,"" posted another. ""And soon the government will start promoting sex tourism."" Chang Huang-chen, the deputy commissioner for Yunlin County, the sex park's proposed home, told the Taipei Times that the idea may not be suitable for traditional-minded locals. Cheng said he'd received mostly supportive comments, but he welcomed different opinions. ""Sex has always been a taboo in Chinese society,"" he added. ""But it's a part of our lives and a very natural thing -- why can't we discuss it openly and generously?"" Aside from the sex park, the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions. ""We're planning to add around 100 landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience,"" said Cheng. The proposed route starts at the scenic six-story-high salt hill in Cigu County. It then leads to Beimen, a place famous for its vibrant pre-wedding photo-shooting industry, where ""churches"" and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose. The third destination, Budai, is a fishing town in Chiayi. The proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park.","Proposal to build the first sex park in Taiwan posted online .

"Pro-democracy demonstrators seized back part of Hong Kong's bustling Mong Kok district Saturday after a night of scuffles. Spurred on by police attempts to reopen part of the district to traffic, the protesters' numbers increased overnight, swelling to around 9,000, according to Hong Kong police. By Saturday morning, the demonstrators had reclaimed the territory that they had ceded less than a day earlier. Amid the tussling, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, the government negotiator, announced Saturday that talks with pro-democracy protesters will take place Tuesday, with Lingnan University President Leonard Cheng as moderator. ""The meeting is expected to take place for about two hours,"" she said, adding that it will be broadcast live but not open to the public. The reaction from Yvonne Leung, spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Federation of Students, was lukewarm at best. She said in statement that the protest group didn't ""have much opinion"" about the details of the meeting. On the streets, meanwhile, the situation remains highly volatile, with the protests continuing through the weekend. Protesters crossed police lines, authorities said, clashing with officers as the situation turned violent. Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok Saturday called protesters in Mong Kok overnight ""radical,"" saying they were not protesting peacefully but instead carrying out violent acts and violating the public order. ""This caused chaos and dangers and had caused serious threats to public safety,"" he said. At least 240 people were injured over the past 24 hours, according to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, which manages all public hospitals in the city. Eighteen police officers were injured, Hong Kong police said. At least 33 people were arrested and faced various charges, including property damage, disorderly conduct, weapons possession and resisting arrest, police said. Violence erupted after police conducted a dawn raid Friday on a student protest camp in the commercial and residential area of Kowloon. Authorities moved to clear a major intersection occupied by the pro-democracy protesters for almost three weeks, tearing down tents and dismantling barricades. Around 500 to 600 police carrying wire cutters and riot shields stormed the Mong Kok site, a smaller offshoot of the main downtown protest area, catching the 100 to 200 protesters by surprise. Police also used a crane to tear down makeshift structures. University student Adrian Lui, who had been at the protest camp for three days, said he was sleeping when the police moved in. ""They were running towards us with shields and at that moment we were nervous,"" he said. ""Lots of people got spooked and ran down side streets."" Government offers talks . Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said Thursday that the government was eager to resume talks with the main student group as early as next week. However, he said the city's tolerance of mass sit-ins was limited and the standoff could not carry on. One of the main student groups, the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said late Thursday it was willing to have dialogue. Street blockades cannot continue . Protesters continue to occupy a major thoroughfare in Admiralty, close to the city's financial district and government headquarters, but police have chipped away at the area held by protesters this week by removing barricades and opening roads to traffic. Smaller numbers . At the peak of the protest in early October, tens of thousands of people came onto the streets at three locations in Hong Kong -- Admiralty, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok -- to call for universal suffrage. But numbers have dwindled as the protests stretched into a third week. Protesters want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress  has said they'll be able to vote from a shortlist approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Leung said Bejing would not retract its decision. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially-appointed 1,200 member election committee. Hong Kong sees police force in new light .

"(CNN)The election of a new anti-austerity government in Greece is raising questions about how the debt-laden state will satisfy its creditors and citizens weary of cost-cutting measures. The leader of the left-wing Syriza party, Alexis Tsipras, was sworn in as Greece's new Prime Minister on Monday after forming a coalition with the right-wing Independent Greeks party. Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout. Since 2010, Greece has received bailouts totaling 240 billion euros. In return, the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank demanded tax hikes, a freeze on state pensions, bans on early retirement and deep cuts in government salaries. Syriza's pledges to try to get some of Greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize Greece's place in the eurozone. The party's victory could lead to a dramatic showdown with the debt-laden nation's lenders. Syriza's message is one that has also resonated in other southern European countries under the restrictions of international bailouts. Its victory could boost other populist parties, such as Beppe Grillo's anti-euro Five Star Movement in Italy and the Podemos Movement in Spain. Declaring victory for Syriza on Sunday after polls showed it winning at least 149 seats in the 300-seat parliament, Tsipras, 40, appeared to brace for a bigger battle. ""We are regaining our lost dignity. ... Now that we are heard by all of Europe, we will fight with the same passion, the same confidence,"" he told cheering supporters. ""So let's go and let's all continue this beautiful and tough fight,"" he said. ""Greece leaves behind the austerity that ruined it, leaves behind the fear, leaves behind five years of humiliation, and Greece moves forward with optimism and hope and dignity,"" he told the crowd. New anti-austerity government worries markets . European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt. ""They have to pay; those are the European rules of the game. There is no room for unilateral action in Europe, that doesn't exclude a discussion, for example, on the rescheduling of this debt. But I would like to underline that it's not the ECB's money -- it's the governments' money; it's a discussion between Mr. Tsipras and the European governments."" Chief EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said it respected the ""sovereign choice of the Greek people."" ""We are ready to engage with the new government once it is formed. Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges,"" he said. The austerity imposed by Greece's international creditors has cut deep. Unemployment has soared to 28%, and many people who still have jobs have seen drastic decreases in wages, pensions frozen and the retirement age pushed back. The governing New Democracy party had pointed to recent improvements in economic indicators as signs that things were getting better. After conceding defeat Sunday, outgoing Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said his conscience was clear. ""I got a country on the verge of ruin.  I was asked to try and save it, and I did it,"" he said. ""Most people did not believe we could stand strong, but we did."" Now, he said, Greece is secure and ""slowly walking away from the crisis."" ""And more than anything,"" he said, ""I give back a country that is a member of the European Parliament and the euro."" On Monday, the CEO of one of Greece's largest banks, Piraeus, said Syriza was coming to power at a ""fortunate time."" ""The tide is changing in Europe, the macro is improving in Greece, the European Central Bank is launching an unprecedented easing, and that will have a significant bearing on the fortunes of Greece going forward,"" Anthimos Thomopoulos said. Opinion: Syriza shows the failure of 'cartel politics' ""Greece has already gone through massive adjustment, much of the hard work has already been completed, the green shoots of recovery are already there, so this is a great opportunity for Greece, a great opportunity for a new government."" In his victory speech Sunday, Tsipras noted that Greece's election could have an impact far beyond his country's borders. ""Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future,"" he said. But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out. Is Alexis Tsipras man of the moment?","Alexis Tsipras has been sworn in as Greece's new Prime Minister .

"Bobak Ferdowsi launched into Internet superstardom last week for helping guide the rover Curiosity in its journey to the surface of Mars. Well, that and his red-and-black Mohawk. President Obama even acknowledged Ferdowsi, now commonly referred to as the ""Mohawk Guy,"" in a congratulatory call to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Monday. ""It does sound like NASA has come a long way from the white-shirt, black dark-rimmed glasses and the pocket protectors,"" Obama told the Mars Curiosity team. ""You guys are a little cooler than you used to be."" ""I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself -- but my team keeps on discouraging me,"" Obama joked. Stylish despite medical setbacks . When it comes to personal style in the workplace, there are no hard and fast rules. What is suitable changes with where you work and what you do. Fortunately, some sartorial adventurers are able to reconcile their need to express themselves with their need for a paycheck. ""Dress codes have most certainly relaxed over time, particularly since the introduction of 'jeans Fridays' and dot-com era casual attire,"" said Judah Kurtz, of BPI group, a human resources consulting firm in Chicago, Illinois. ""What is considered 'appropriate' varies by company and culture, as well as what parts of the house are strictly internal versus client/public facing,"" ""Dress code policies walk a fine line between portraying a professional image to clients and customers while allowing employees to be comfortable, engaged, and expressive,"" said Kevin Sheridan, senior vice president of HR optimization at Avatar HR Solutions, also in Chicago. Jillian Venters, a 43-year-old technical writer from Seattle, Washington, says it's crucial to have some personal branding around -- whether it's funky jewelry, photos of loved ones or favorite movie and music memorabilia -- to keep you sane at work. ""No matter how great your job and co-workers may be, the corporate world can be very stressful and draining. It's all too easy to become devoured by your job and to forget that there are things outside of the cubicle and status reports,"" she said. ""Maintaining your own sense of identity helps you stay grounded, and reminds you that you are more than your job."" Known as the ""Goth at the office,"" Venters might sport a top hat, knee-length lace coat and a full petticoat skirt on an average workday. She attempts to document each day's ensemble on her Tumblr account. While she has endured her fair share of funny looks and moments when she needed to tone down her appearance, Venters says ultimately her sense of style benefits her career. ""I've walked into interviews and had the hiring manager say, 'Oh right, you're the goth girl. I've heard good things about you and you know all our tools. Can you start on Monday?'"" Venters said. ""Once I've started on a job and met my co-workers, everyone remembers who I am, which is great for gathering information."" Dying careers and thriving careers: The jobs of tomorrow . Like Venters, Kristi Blicharski, a Los Angeles-based empowerment coach and business strategist, thinks it's important to encourage the uniqueness of others without judgment because it emboldens both confidence and creativity. ""Studies have shown that when we look good on the outside, we feel good on the inside, and what's important to recognize is that everyone has their own unique feelings about what makes them look and feel their best,"" she said. ""Why try to inhibit that?"" With blue streaks running through her hair, Blicharski said ""expressing yourself in a way that makes you feel like your best self is the new power suit."" Mars rover mission's 'Mohawk Guy' inspires Obama . Of course, some people believe corporate dress code policy should remain sacred. Six Flags theme parks came under fire last month after job applicant MarKeese Warner, an engineering student at Pennsylvania State University, claimed she was denied a summer job because of her dreadlocks hairstyle. Warner started a Change.org petition to protest what she claimed were Six Flags' discriminatory policies against people with dreadlocks. A Six Flags spokeswoman confirmed that the company does not permit employees to wear dreadlocks. ""We maintain a grooming code for employees that includes standard uniforms and no visible tattoos, beards, dreadlocks or extreme hairstyles (such as drastic variations in color or partially shaven heads),"" said Nancy Krejsa, senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications. Many companies have formal dress code policies, including UBS which has a 44-page document with specific stipulations that disallow women from wearing more than seven pieces of jewelry and men from wearing cufflinks. Franki Brandt-Pethtel, the Director of Operations for Bond Jewelers in the Tampa Bay Area, thinks maintaining a proper dress code shows respect for your employer, clients and yourself. ""Would you purchase an expensive piece of fine jewelry from a woman with a green Mohawk and sleeve full of tats? That's why I wear a suit to work every day. My personal expression can wait until my day off,"" she said. While it's ultimately up to each organization's culture to deem what is fit, human resource professionals, like Sheridan and Kurtz, say general dress guidelines are useful as they create some parameters and expectations around what is considered appropriate. At the same time, allowing some freedom of individual expression can have positive impacts on company culture and employee satisfaction. ""You may be memorable, but make sure you are memorable for the right reasons,"" said Kurtz. ""Be yourself, but don't let your appearance or behaviors detract from your selling points: your intelligence, accomplishments, strengths and experience.""

"(CNN)Three likely presidential candidates shared the stage Sunday night before a roomful of wealthy donors, engaging in a rapid-fire policy discussion that underscored sharp disagreement within the GOP over global affairs and national security. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul took part in a largely friendly, but occasionally fiery, panel at the Palm Springs event sponsored by mega GOP donors David and Charles Koch, better known as the Koch Brothers. The event, moderated by ABC's Jonathan Karl, marked the first time potential GOP contenders gathered on the same stage at the same time to talk about policy in 2015, a year that's expected to see a hoard of candidates compete for the Republican nomination in forums and debates. RELATED: 2016 race kicks off with auditions in Iowa . It also offered a window into the unofficial campaign that's largely playing out behind the scenes, with White House hopefuls traveling the country and meeting privately with donors — in settings much like the California desert Sunday — to gauge the kind of the financial commitments they could secure for a 2016 endeavor. The first-term senators were keenly aware of their immediate audience — at one point Cruz blatantly said, ""I admire Charles and David Koch"" — but knowing their remarks would be public, they also sought to show off their command of the issues in a high-pressure scenario. The senators revealed little disparity on domestic and economic policies, but roughly half way into the event, the discussion shifted toward President Barack Obama's new Cuba policy — and Paul instantly found himself on defense. ""I'm kind of surrounded on this,"" Paul joked. Rubio and Cruz both have parents who emigrated from Cuba, and Paul is also the odd-man-out on substance, being the only one on stage who's backed the President's call for relaxing the Cuba embargo. The Kentucky Republican explained that in hindsight, President Richard Nixon ""made the right decision"" by opening relations with China, saying it prevented war and opened up trade. ""China not a good example,"" Rubio disagreed, saying the country may be ""more prosperous...but it is not a free country."" That launched the two into a deeper debate over whether the U.S. should place sanctions against all countries with a record of human rights violations. ""I'm not a big fan of a lot of these regimes but I don't want to isolate ourselves and not trade with people who aren't perfect,"" Paul said. His answer was also a masked response to critics who label him an isolationist due to his push for less intervention abroad. Rubio, answering Paul, stressed that Cuba stands out because of its close proximity to the U.S. ""The difference is that Cuba's 90 miles from our shores,"" Rubio said. ""What happens there we will feel immediately."" The negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program also became a major flash point on the panel. Paul is supporting Obama's push to avoid imposing sanctions against Iran while the negotiations are still ongoing. ""Diplomacy is a good thing, not a bad thing,"" Paul said. His argument, however, failed to generate much excitement in the room. That's when Rubio swooped in to warn that the U.S. is dealing with a country that's run by someone whose mission is ""to bring the whole world under the flag of Islam."" ""So I am a little cautious...about negotiating with someone who has openly said he wants to force all of us to either be like him or die,"" he said, generating a strong response from the audience. Cruz also won heavy applause when he underlined the threat of Islamic extremism, declaring that a nuclear Iran would be the single biggest threat to the U.S. and argued Ayatollah Khomeini and the country's leaders are ""radical religious Islamic nutcases"" who ""glorify death or suicide."" Combating Islamic extremism was a common theme Saturday when potential candidates, including Cruz, took turns speaking at a marathon event in Iowa, where attacks on Obama's foreign policy, in particular with regard to ISIS, stirred some of the loudest responses from the audience. Each of the senators delivered an impressive grasp of the issues, firing off statistics on a wide range of topics and punctuating their positions with personal stories that touched on their own background. But it was Rubio who commanded the most time, delivering fast-paced but forceful answers. He jumped first at questions and frequently sat on the edge of his seat as he would crescendo into some of his more impassioned arguments, like on Cuba or Iran. Style-wise, Rubio sported a suit and looked the part of his day job, while Paul donned a navy sport coat with blue jeans, and Cruz wore the same tan colored coat he wore to a conservative event in Iowa the day prior. Rubio, who has already said he won't run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016 if he runs for president, held the middle seat of three seats and drew frequent laugh lines in addition to applause. When Karl asked if the super wealthy have too much influence on elections, Rubio made the audience roar when he quickly rattled off a snarky response that both validated his audience and took a shot at the left. ""As opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean?"" While all three men praised Mitt Romney on a personal level, none expressed any faith that the 2012 GOP nominee would be successful in another bid at the White House. Paul said Romney would have been a better president than Obama, but when asked if a revised Romney campaign would fare better in 2016, the Kentucky Republican joked: ""I'm kind of with Ann Romney on this one 'No. No. No. No. Never'.""

For his part, Cruz used Romney's infamous comments about nearly half the country being dependent on government to illustrate his case against the 2012 nominee. ""The reason Republicans lost can be summed up in two words: Forty-seven percent,"" the Texas Republican said. ""I don't just mean Mitt Romney's comments that were caught on tape... the central narrative of the last election, what the voters heard, was we don't have to worry about the 47%."" ""I think Republicans are and should be the party of the 47%,"" he added, seeking to drive home a message about the GOP needing improve its standing with middle class voters. Things certainly grew tense when the discussion focused on foreign policy, but the men didn't deliver any blows or direct attacks against each other on stage. In fact, Cruz tried to round out the event with a glowing tribute to his soon-to-be rivals. The senator, who was elected in 2012, pointed out that both Rubio and Paul mounted long-shot Senate bids in 2010 and won despite facing establishment money and resources. ""All of the money in their state was against them, and they ran campaigns that inspired me, inspired me to run,"" said Cruz, who also won an underdog campaign. Instead, knowing it's never a bad idea for Republicans to attack the media, they directed any confrontational tones towards Karl for trying to get the men to give ""yes or no"" answers. ""When and if any of these people run for president, there should be an absolute rule: no 'yes or no' questions,"" Paul said to the moderator, drawing applause from the audience and getting a ""here, here"" from one of his colleagues on stage.","Sens.

"(CNN)The Japanese government is grappling with an unpredictable hostage crisis whose terms are being dictated by the Islamic extremist group ISIS. The militants appear to have killed one of the two Japanese hostages they have been holding. And they're apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in Jordan to spare the life of the other. Here's where things stand at the moment: . A video file posted online Saturday by a known ISIS supporter shows an image of one hostage, Kenji Goto, holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive, Haruna Yukawa. The voice of a person claiming to be Goto speaks over the image, saying in English that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to blame for Yukawa's death. ""You were given a deadline,"" he says, referring to ISIS' earlier demand that Japan pay $200 million by Friday to save the lives of the two hostages. The voice then announces a new ultimatum: the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, an Iraqi woman facing the death penalty in Jordan for her role in a series of bombings in 2005 that killed dozens of people at hotels in the Arab kingdom. Abe said Sunday that experts were analyzing the video but that it seemed ""highly credible."" U.S. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity. An ISIS-affiliated online radio station, Al-Bayan, reported that the recording was released by the extremist group. It also reported the killing of Yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for Goto in its newscast Sunday. It didn't identify Goto by name. But Goto's stepfather, Yukio Ishido, raised doubts about whether it was his stepson's voice in the video. ""I get the sense it's not his voice,"" he told reporters. ""I've heard his English a couple times. I felt it was a bit different."" Abe condemned the apparent killing of Yukawa and called for Goto to be released immediately. ""Such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible, which causes me nothing but strong indignation,"" he said. But the Japanese prime minister declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand, which doesn't appear to have a clear deadline. After ISIS released the first video of the hostages Tuesday, Japan set up a crisis center in Jordan and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties, such as governments in the region and tribal leaders. Japanese officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they wouldn't yield to terrorism. They stressed that an aid package Abe had pledged to countries affected by ISIS, cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand, was only for humanitarian purposes. Observers are skeptical. ""I would be surprised if the Jordanian government or Japan really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as ISIS has requested,"" said CNN global affairs analyst David Rohde, referring to al-Rishawi, whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes called the swap ""a nonstarter,"" noting that ISIS is already holding a Jordanian pilot whose plane crashed in Syria. Jordan is part of the U.S.-led coalition that's conducting airstrikes against ISIS targets. ""If there is any bargain going to be struck between Jordan and ISIS, it's going to include their pilot,"" said Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. Foria Younis, the chief executive of South Asia Middle East Consultants, highlighted the high profile of al-Rishawi in Jordan. ""This Jordanian prisoner is probably the biggest terrorist prisoner that Jordan has,"" Younis told CNN. ""To release her, it's just going to require, I think, a lot more than just this one Japanese hostage,"" she said. Yukawa, 42, comes across as a lost soul who went to Syria last year in search of purpose after suffering a series of setbacks in his life. Over the past decade, Yukawa had attempted suicide, lost his wife to cancer, and then lost his home and business. After changing his first name to its feminine form, he said he believed he was the reincarnation of a Manchu princess who spied on the Japanese in World War II. On a blog, Yukawa once wrote, ""I look normal outside, but inside I'm mentally ill."" But his travels to Syria appeared to have been an attempt to rebuild his life. He had dreams of setting up private security company. It was there that he met Goto, 47, an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones. Goto has a wife and two young daughters in Japan. Despite their contrasting backgrounds, the two apparently became friends in Syria, with Goto helping show Yukawa how to get by in a risky environment. After Yukawa was reported to have been captured in August, Goto is believed to have decided to go into ISIS-controlled territory, with finding his friend among his goals. Yukawa's father has expressed grief over his son's apparent killing. ""I have been praying such a thing would not happen but, unfortunately, it has finally come to pass and my heart aches,"" Shoichi Yukawa said in an interview with Japanese media. ""I feel so guilty that Mr. Goto has been detained and threatened death after he had entered there to rescue my son at the risk of his life,"" he added. ""I wish him to be released and return to Japan immediately and continue his activity."" Goto's mother made a plea to her son's captors to release him on Friday, saying he wasn't an ""enemy"" of ISIS. ""Words fail to describe how I feel,"" Junko Ishido said. ""Kenji always has been a kind person ever since he was little. He was always saying, 'I want to save the lives of children in war zones.' "" U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Abe by phone Sunday from New Delhi, the White House said. Obama offered ""condolences for the murder"" of Yukawa by ISIS and conveyed ""solidarity with the Japanese people,"" according to a statement. The U.N. Security Council said in a statement that it strongly condemns the apparent killing of Yukawa, describing it as ""a heinous and cowardly act."" It demanded the immediate release of Goto. British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested Japan was right not to bow to the terrorists' demand for ransom, saying that ""Britain strongly supports the firm stance Prime Minister Abe and his Government have taken."" The United States and Britain both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists. But other countries, notably France, have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by Islamic militants in recent years, despite denying it publicly. Japan has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past, according to The New York Times. In 1999, Tokyo handed over $3 million for the release of four mining experts held in Kyrgyzstan, the newspaper reported. Opinion: What hostage crisis means for Japan .

"(CNN)A small drone crashed onto the White House grounds on Monday. Described as a 2-foot-long quadcopter -- a drone with four propellers -- the event raises some troubling questions about the possibility that terrorists using armed drones could one day attack the White House or other tightly guarded U.S. government locations. The White House incident occurred the same day a CIA drone strike was launched in Yemen, the first such strike in almost two months, following the Yemeni government being forced out of office last week. This indicates that the CIA drone program is still moving forward despite the instability in Yemen. Not so long ago, launching a U.S. strike on the other side of the world with an armed drone would have been something from science fiction. Before 9/11, the United States had only a handful of experimental drones that had never been used to kill anyone. Today, there are at least 7,000 drones in the U.S. arsenal, more than 200 of which are armed drones that have killed thousands of people. This large American fleet of drones is a harbinger of an important trend. Armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during World War II. We can, of course, expect to see them used not only by the United States, but also by other countries such as China and Russia that are jumping into the production of armed drones. But we will also see them being used by terrorist groups. A harbinger of this was Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group based in Lebanon, that in September reportedly used drones to bomb a building in neighboring Syria used by the al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front. The drone attack killed a number of militants. Iran is the key sponsor for Hezbollah and has plausibly claimed for the past several years to have manufactured armed drones. Hezbollah's use of drones marked a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide: It would be the first time a terrorist group used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack. That said, it will likely be many years before other countries or terrorist groups are able to build up the capacity that the United States has to carry out lethal drone strikes. After all, the United States has had drone bases in countries such as Afghanistan, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia. And it isn't as easy as some might think to arm a drone. Such weapons systems require specific electrical engineering: The wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile; the drone must be equipped with fire control systems and built-in mounting brackets are needed to attach munitions to the vehicle. Still, even with these inherent limitations, the drone industry thrives, and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the drone bandwagon. According to a count by New America, some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability, but few of them have succeeded in arming their drones. The United States' aggressive and secretive drone campaign against al Qaeda and its affiliates in countries such as Yemen appears to be setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed drones. Despite this fact, there has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such drone attacks should be among policymakers at the international level. It's long past due for that conversation to happen. Perhaps a drone landing inside the White House perimeter will help precipitate a wider discussion about how we might prevent a future drone flying into the White House grounds, one that might actually be armed.","A drone crashed Monday on White House grounds .

"More than three years after Air France Flight 447 plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 people aboard, authorities are preparing to release their final report on the fatal crash. France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) said the data indicated that the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed because the aircraft's speed sensors gave invalid readings, but there are other theories on why the plane went down. When did Flight 447 go down? Flight 447 -- which was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro -- made its last contact with Brazil's Atlantic Control Center (ACC) at around 01:33 GMT on June 1, 2009, informing the center of the plane's position as it crossed the Atlantic. Soon after, Brazil's air control contacted Dakar's control center in North Africa and reported that AF 447 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said. There was no further contact with the plane. History's deadliest plane crashes . Do we know why Flight 447 crashed? Last year's BEA report said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when ""the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled."" It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational, said the report. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA said in a 2009 report. Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed. Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich. The lack of speed, wind or direction information also prevented the Autopilot system from functioning, said air accident investigator Alain Bouillard said at the time of the crash. ""This tells us that the plane has to be, in this case, directed by the pilot,"" he said. Who's really flying the plane? What about the weather? Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), when it went down. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet. Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ. However Learmount pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the ITCZ every day without incident. ""There was another Air France flight 30 minutes behind Flight 447 that night and it encountered no problems,"" he said. 153 bodies identified from 2009 Air France crash . Any other theories? According to Learmount, many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor. ""The crash happened at around 2:00 a.m. on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out."" He said the crew, possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point, suddenly have this problem and they ""fixate"" on it. ""This is a syndrome,"" he said. ""There have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem. Now we don't know that, but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully. ""Whether it was out of control -- and I doubt this -- it was not being controlled. Imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem. They don't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem. They fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped. ""The airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots don't notice as it is all very gentle. And when they look up they don't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and can't recover."" He highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 to crash in the Red Sea shortly after take off from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh. Though Egyptian authorities disputed the claim, aviation safety officials in France and the U.S. cited ""spatial disorientation"" as the likely cause based on evidence available, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). How long did it take to find the wreckage? It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the plane's flight recorder and the bulk of the wreckage, still containing many bodies, in a mountain range deep under the ocean. The area where the Airbus A330 went down is in the mid-Atlantic -- two to four days for ships to reach from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters (about 9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,562 to 9,842 feet). The search that turned up the bulk of the wreckage in 2011 covered a 46-mile (75-kilometer) radius around the last known position of Flight 447, investigators said, in an area rough with underwater mountains and valleys. ""It is a mountain range as big as the Alps,"" David Learmount of Flight International told CNN. ""There was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse. This is not a flat-bottom environment like the North Sea is.""

"(CNN)Nigerian forces fought off Boko Haram militants in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, military officials said Monday, but the extremists seized another town in the same state. Hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen launched a predawn attack Sunday on Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Soldiers repelled the attacks, and officials have since eased a curfew imposed as a result, said Col. Sani Usman, a military spokesman. But a simultaneous attack on nearby Monguno town  was a different story. The Islamist militants captured the town, together with its military barracks, a Nigerian military officer said. It's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities. ""Our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force. They overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat,"" the military officer said.  He asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media. Monguno is about 135 kilometers (85 miles) from Maiduguri.  The former has a population of 100,000 while  Maiduguri has about 600,000. Both cities are near the Chad and Cameroon borders, which would give the militants an entry point into those countries. Monguno and its military post served as a buffer  to keep the militants away from Maiduguri. Its fall leaves Maiduguri vulnerable and puts the extremists in a better position to seize the city. Boko Haram had been confined to the fishing town of Baga since its fighters seized it on January 3. Thousands were feared killed in that attack, which lasted days. Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants. ""So long as we have the resources, we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our No. 1 area of commitments,"" he said. "" I want to reassure the good people of Borno State that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership."" The attack came a day after President Goodluck Jonathan made a campaign stop in Maiduguri ahead of the February 14 presidential election. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was also in the nation Sunday to call for peaceful elections. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.","Soldiers repelled the attacks in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state .

"The Transportation Security Administration said Friday it has started the process of firing 25 of its agents and suspending 19 others for not following screening procedures. The 44 employees all worked in a checked-baggage screening room in Terminal B of Newark's Liberty International Airport, TSA spokesman David Castelveter told CNN in a written statement. In November and December of 2011, they were caught on surveillance cameras not following proper screening protocols, an agency internal investigation revealed. After passengers check their bags, TSA screeners are supposed to search the luggage with electronic scanners and open some bags by hand. In this case, the employees allegedly didn't follow procedures on about 250 bags during the two months, the agency said. All bags did receive some screening, however. The punishment marks the largest removal and suspension of TSA officers in the agency's history, and part of a larger internal crackdown on improper behavior by TSA agents. ""Accountability is an important aspect of our work and we take appropriate action with any employee who does not follow our procedures or engages in misconduct,"" Castelveter said. In June, the same investigation prompted the agency to fire eight checked-baggage screeners at Newark for violating TSA procedures, including some of them for sleeping on the job. That same month, 43 TSA workers in Fort Myers, Florida, were disciplined for not performing additional screening on random passengers and carry-on bags. At Boston's Logan Airport, 20 checked-baggage screeners were punished in August for reading newspapers or talking on the phone when they were supposed to be screening bags, or for not reporting the misconduct, a spokesperson told CNN at the time. And last year, 36 checked-bag screeners in Hawaii were fired after they were caught on a security camera in 2010 ignoring procedures, including putting bag inspection notices in bags without actually inspecting them, an inspector general's report said.

"When Alexis Tsipras charged onto the stage, palms clasped high and a broad grin greeting his supporters, he could have been mistaken for the election winner. In fact Tsipras, leader of the Syriza party, had conceded defeat to New Democracy just half an hour earlier. His radical left party will not support the center-right election winner, but remain in opposition. The outcome sent a shudder of relief through the markets and Europe, whose leaders applauded New Democracy's win as a showing of courage and resilience from the Greek people. But Sunday's result -- delivering nearly 27% support for Syriza -- has upended the Greek political landscape, splintering the duopoly which has controlled the country for almost four decades. As negotiations over a new government continue, questions are being raised around which party -- or parties -- will emerge as the country's dominant center-left force. Pasok, under the Papandreou dynasty, has long staked that claim. But now, with its vote collapsed to just over 12% from almost 44% in 2009, it faces a fight for survival. For many Syriza supporters, Sunday's results were a triumph. Beyond its six-fold increase in support in three years, the party is now set up to be an active agitator on the opposition benches. Read about the human cost of Greece's recession . And Syriza does not have to run a country in deep recession, with unemployment over 20% and that faces a real risk of toppling out of the euro  -- a challenge for the most experienced political hands. Sunday's results were an ""enormous success,"" said Eliana Voutsadakis, a 36-year old architect and Syriza supporter. ""I think Tsipras will become prime minister in the next couple of years."" Tsipras is 37, born the year Greece's military dictatorship fell, and as such represents a political future unfettered by history, according to Voutsadakis. ""He hasn't been brought up in this corrupt political system,"" she said. ""This is what we hope for."" As for New Democracy and Pasok: ""No one wants them."" Instead Tsipras, who had sworn to tear up the austerity plans because he believed it was sending the country to ""hell,"" will likely be a strident voice against the country's leaders. He has said the party, from its position as opposition, will continue to demand the bailouts be scrapped and believes it will be ""vindicated"" for that position. ""Even if it didn't manage to take the first place, Syriza is now the most basic body representing the average individual, the progressive and the anti-memorandum [anti-bailout] portion of our population,"" Tsipras said. Greece's economic orphans . According to Pavlos Tsimas, a Greek journalist and political commentator, Syriza has corralled not only those angry at austerity, but the youth who may be voting for the first time. That age group remembers Syriza's backing of their protests during the riots of 2008, which followed the fatal shooting of a teenage boy by police, Tsimas said. But much of the party's recent success is down to Tsipras, who Tsimas describes as ""very bright, and very ambitious, and a little bit ruthless too."" A trained civil engineer, who joined the Communist Youth of Greece as a high school student, Tsipras shot to prominence in 2006. After being put forward as a candidate for the mayor of Athens, he swept 10% of the vote to come third -- far more than previous left-wing candidates had managed. At that point, he became a ""media darling,"" Tsimas said. He has since built a young guard around him, who are of ""another generation ... new, fresh and different,"" Tsimas added. Syriza can now try to establish themselves as a ""true, center-left"" party which is ""young, radical and clean ... with no skeletons,"" Tsimas said. But it could face competition from a Pasok and Democratic Left coalition, should they choose to work together. Tsipras faces an entrenched political system and a Europe desperate to dampen instability as it continues with its austerity plan -- even one which may be diluted. Former prime minister George Papandreou, who negotiated the country's first bailout after revealing the country's 2009 budget deficit would be most than four times higher than the EU limit, told CNN Monday he believed Pasok's moves to cut the deficit had enjoyed wide support. ""I don't consider Mr. Tsipras a progressive,"" the former Pasok leader said. ""I think our agenda was actually a progressive agenda, in reforming the country and changing the country and making the necessary changes in order to be a viable economy and a very transparent and just state,"" he said. Papandreou said lessons could be learnt, such as pushing stimulus packages alongside austerity. But a key destabilizing factor, he said, is ""the deep sense of uncertainty. For the last two ... two and a half years, what [has been] most corrosive in the Greek society but also in the Greek economy is the sense of this lack of certainty ... that we may be in, or out of the euro.""","Syriza increases its support six-fold in Greek elections .

"The eurozone is emerging from its devastating debt crisis but life in Greece -- where the bloc's financial meltdown began -- remains a struggle for many. CNN has tracked a group of Greek citizens since 2012, and revisited them* for an update on life in the country after years of austerity. They told CNN wages continue to be cut, healthcare is suffering and that leaving the country can seem the only option. George Pentafronimos, an IT consultant who left Greece to live in Luxembourg, says leaving the country was one of the most difficult decisions he's made, but one he doesn't regret. Others, like Manos Kallimikrakis, have stayed but lost their jobs as cutbacks kicked in. Kallimikrakis has struggled to survive on savings and family support, and says the country needs a new economic model. Greece, bailed out in 2010 then again in 2012 at a combined cost of 240 billion euros, returned to the bond markets in April, raising three billion euros on robust demand. Economic indicators suggest it is slowly emerging from six years of recession, with unemployment figures released Friday showing a slight dip from 27.2% in December, to 26.7%. Greek unemployment remains the highest in the eurozone, above Spain at 25.3%. Youth unemployment across the euro area has also dropped slightly, but remains highest in Greece, at 56.8%. The figures come after demonstrators across the world took to the streets for May Day, or International Workers Day. Those spoken to by CNN say life on the ground in Greece is frustrating and tough, and the economic figures do not capture the hardship of the austerity-hit economy.

"(CNN)Snow is falling at a faster rate. Wind gusts are getting stronger. And temperatures are frigid. It may not look bad yet, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday night, but it will be soon. ""This is literally the calm before the storm. It's about to start in earnest,"" de Blasio said. ""And when it does, it's going to come in very fast and very hard, and people have to be very, very careful. People have to stay off the streets and stay off the sidewalks."" The National Weather Service, which isn't prone to exaggeration, is using terms like ""life-threatening"" and ""historic"" to describe the weather system taking aim at the Northeast, with the worst expected to hit Monday night into Tuesday. The first big storm of the year may drop up to 3 feet of snow on Boston and New York before it ends Tuesday, with freezing rain and strong wind gusts possibly reaching 70 mph. Blizzard and winter storm warnings have been issued from Maryland through Maine and into Canada. Up to 58 million people could be put into the deep freeze. And the storm could have a far-reaching economic and political impact, even beyond the region directly hit. The snowfall will be dramatic, but that might not be what causes the most damage, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. A possible source of major problems, he said, will be large wind gusts that send tree limbs crashing down into power lines. That could leave people in some area without electricity for days, he said. Another area of concern: roads. ""It is no joke to have people stranded on a highway. We've gone through that before,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters.

Public transportation will shut down and only emergency vehicles will be allowed on the roads in 13 counties -- and on the streets of New York City -- as of 11 p.m., he said. Connecticut and Massachusetts also put travel bans in place. In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter declared a snow emergency starting at 6 p.m. ET Monday. Cars left parked on snow emergency routes will be towed and owners ticketed, he said. ""It's going to be the kind of night where the best thing anybody can do is stay inside,"" Massachusetts Gov.

United Airlines has already canceled all Tuesday flights at Newark, LaGuardia and JFK, as well as Boston and Philadelphia, company spokeswoman Mary Ryan said. Delta has canceled more than 1,600 flights on Monday and Tuesday. There are no operations planned at Boston's Logan International Airport on Tuesday and ""very limited flying at LaGuardia and JFK,"" spokesman Morgan Durrant said. Some cancellations may also be necessary Wednesday morning, he said. The major U.S. airlines are offering fee-free rebooking of flights to and from the Northeast on Monday and Tuesday. Amtrak said it was operating a normal Monday schedule but suspended Northeast Regional and Acela Express service between New York and Boston for Tuesday because of severe weather. Other Amtrak train routes in the region will operate at reduced frequencies, the rail line said. Heavier snow will hit Monday night and continue through Tuesday, forecasters said. Some areas will still be getting snow Wednesday. Officials across the Northeast warned residents to stock up for the storm. Government officials warned residents to fill up vehicle gas tanks, stock up on food, make sure they have enough heating fuel and to take other steps to prepare for the possibility of being stranded, possibly without power, for days. Here are more tips from the Federal Emergency Management Agency: . • Make a family communications plan in case you are separated from your loved ones during the height of the storm. • Make sure to keep ventilation to the outdoors clear when using kerosene heaters. • Put off travel. But if you have to go out, keep a disaster supplies kit in your car. It should include a shovel, windshield scraper, small broom, flashlight, battery-powered radio, extra batteries, food and water, matches, a change of clothes, a pocketknife, a first aid kit and blankets. • Check antifreeze levels, battery condition, exhaust and other vehicle systems before venturing out. • Stay inside as much as possible, stay dry when you do have to go outside, and watch for signs of frostbite and hypothermia, including loss of feeling, uncontrollable shivering and disorientation. And they did. While shoppers lined up in supermarkets, Dorot, a nonprofit in New York, collected hundreds of bags of food and water supplies for homebound seniors, WCBS reported. ""I think I'll use some of this, especially the soup,"" said Norma Amigo, 93, of the Upper West Side. ""I will not go out if I think it's slippery out, because I fell two weeks ago."" Christine Carew, a sales associate at Charles Street Supply in Boston, said customers have been coming into the hardware store since it opened Sunday to grab sleds, shovels, ice melt and snow brushes. When it comes to getting ready for a massive snowfall, she said, Boston residents know what to do. ""We're more prepared for it,"" she said. ""We know it's going to happen."" In Boston's North End, cigar bar manager David Riccio was sweeping the sidewalk Monday night, preparing for the storm to hit. ""They're making it sound really bad, so we'll see,"" he said. New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said his force was well-prepared with a fleet of vehicles equipped with tire chains and more large SUVs capable of traversing snowy streets. ""I want everyone to understand that we are facing -- most likely -- one of the largest snowstorms in the history of this city,"" de Blasio said. That's saying something. In 2006,  26.9 inches of snow fell, topping the 25.8-inches of snow that fell in December 1947. New York state has at least 1,806 plows and more than 126,000 tons of salt to spray onto roads across the region. The National Guard also was positioning six dozen personnel and 20 vehicles throughout the state Monday morning. In Boston, New England Patriots fans saw their beloved football team off to the Super Bowl at a Monday morning celebration that wrapped up before the storm worsened. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said there was no doubt the city would be slammed, so a major effort now is making sure people are safe. That includes checking on elderly residents and working to get homeless people off the streets and into shelters, he said. The city has 700 pieces of snow-moving equipment and 35,000 tons of salt ready, he said. ""You can't fight Mother Nature, and whatever happens throughout the course of the storm, we just have to do our best to be prepared going into it, which I think we are,"" Walsh said. On Plum Island, Massachusetts, Bob Connors said he'll try to ride out the storm but will move to higher ground if things get dicey, according to CNN affiliate WHDH. A 2013 storm destroyed homes on the island. ""When you're living on the edge of paradise like we are now, you give Mother Nature a lot of respect when we need to,"" said Connors. Visibility will be a major problem, said CNN meteorologist Judson Jones. ""This is not one of those storms you want to go out in while it's happening,"" Jones said. ""You want to wait for the winds to die down ... before you go to the store."" Tuesday is shaping up to be a day when the reality of the weather sets in. One of the inevitable aftereffects of snow -- flooding -- will quickly become a problem. There could be coastal flooding in Massachusetts starting early Tuesday, with pockets of major flooding on east-facing coastlines, the state emergency agency said. ""Plan to work from home is the best advice for Tuesday,"" Jones said. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Ashley Fantz, Sara Ganim, Joe Sutton, Dana Ford, Aaron Cooper, Joshua Gaynor, Taylor Ward, Teri Genova and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Amtrak shuts down Tuesday service between New York and Boston .

"(CNN)A man identified as Terence Walker is seen in a police body-camera video bolting from a Muskogee, Oklahoma, officer who felt a weapon after a pat down. Officer Chansey McMillin gave chase, his body-cam capturing his shadow as he trailed the suspect in the afternoon light of January 17. Walker, 21, is seen stopping suddenly and bending down to pick up something he dropped on the road. A white car approaches. The graphic video shows McMillin pulling his pistol, taking aim and unloading five shots. Walker turned around, then started running. He was struck three times, police said. In the video, Walker is seen as he tumbles to the ground, then rolls into a ditch. He died at the scene. Later, the video shows an emotional McMillin leaning against a police car. ""Why did (Walker) have to do that?"" he asked as other officers comforted him. Since Ferguson, Missouri, teen Michael Brown's death prompted a national move to put body cameras on all America's police officers, scenes like the one captured in the body-cam video from Muskogee will likely become more common. President Barack Obama recently announced a $263 million package to help local police departments buy 50,000 cameras. The New York Police Department, the nation's largest, launched a pilot body-camera program in December. In Muskogee, about 50 of its 88 police officers started wearing body cameras in November, according to department spokesman Sgt. Michael Mahan. The January 17 incident  outside Old Agency Baptist Church is the first officer-involved shooting captured by a body camera. The video was released Friday after the department showed it to Walker's family and local leaders in an attempt to quell tensions in the community, Mahan said. ""We've seen a lot of departments have a bunker mentality and sort of enclose themselves and not be real open with the public,"" he said. ""We're trying to set a precedent. We think this doesn't allow any speculation to foster within the community and lets all the facts come out."" The encounter began with McMillin approaching Walker outside the church and patting him down. ""Relax,"" the officer is heard saying in the video moments before Walker takes off running. ""What are you shaking for?"" Mahan said witnesses told police that on the day of the shooting, Walker had threatened his ex-girlfriend, who was attending a wedding at the church that day. Mahan said Walker allegedly told his ex that he ""had a bullet with her name on it."" Moments after the shooting, a man who identified himself as the church's pastor is seen in the video approaching the officer and saying: ""Don't shoot no more."" McMillin ordered the pastor to stand back. The officer can be heard on his radio calling for an ambulance. Another officer checked on Walker and picked up something off the ground and tossed it away from the suspect. McMillin is heard saying it's a handgun; another officer said the weapon was loaded. One officer checked Walker's pulse. The pastor is seen in the video telling other officers that McMillin ""did everything right."" The investigation is being handled by the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation. McMillin is on paid administrative leave, Mahan said. It was his second officer-involved shooting in six months. The officer was cleared in the July shooting of a suspect who attacked a man with a knife, according to Mahan. The officer opened fire after the knife-wielding man moved toward him. The suspect survived. Mahan defended the video's release. ""What we're trying to do is to set a standard for the nation and say that we believe that openness and transparency is the best policy,"" he said.","Police officer's body camera captures fatal shooting in Oklahoma .

"(CNN)A Canadian couple has reached out to the Internet to help save their twin 3-year-olds. Binh and Phuoc Wagner both require a liver transplant to survive. The problem is that their father, Michael Wagner, can donate to only one of the pair. Wagner and his wife, Johanne, have taken their search for a second donor to social media, establishing a Facebook page, Liver Transplants for our Vietnamese Twin Girls, which has garnered more than 5,000 likes as of Monday afternoon. The Kingston, Ontario, couple also has a blog, One More Potato in the Pot, about their lives with nine children, four of whom are adopted. ""We need people to come forward, people who are willing to be assessed to be live liver donors,"" Johanne Wagner told CBC News on Sunday. ""Things could turn around very quickly on us, and their condition could get worse."" The twins were adopted from Vietnam in November 2012, when they were 18 months old. The pair are afflicted with Alagille syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes liver damage because of bile duct abnormalities, according to the National Institutes of Health's Genetics Home Reference. Among other issues, the ailment causes the twins to itch severely -- enough that they scratch while they sleep, creating sores. The Wagners ask interested parties to contact the following: . Toronto General Hospital (UHN) Living Donor Assessment Office . 416-340-4800 ext. 6581 . and specify that you are willing to be assessed to donate to either Thi Binh La or Thi Phuoc La (date of birth May 14, 2011). You can also go to this website . or print the Donor Health History and fax it to 416-340-4317. ""When we went to Vietnam, before we went, we knew that they were very ill, and we knew it was liver-related,"" Michael Wagner told CBC News. ""We said, 'All right, we're committed, and we're going to move forward with the hope that everything is going to be OK.' "" The Wagners have been updating their Facebook page since establishing it December 26. What's needed, they say, is someone who meets the following qualifications: . 1) be older than 18 and younger than 60. 2) be in good overall health and physical condition. 3) have a compatible blood type: A or O (rhesus factor positive or negative does not matter). 4) have a BMI of less than 35 to be worked up for consideration and no greater than 32 at the time of surgery (transplant). Livers do regrow, but a donor would have to be in a hospital for several days and take another few weeks to recover. In the meantime, the Wagners and the girls' doctors are monitoring the situation. If things take a turn for the worse, the twins' doctor Dr. Binita Kamath told CBC News, the girl who will receive Michael Wagner's liver will be chosen based on immediate need. ""I think we will make the decision based on facts and keep it as dispassionate as possible,"" she said. ""We feel comfortable making this decision.""","The twins need liver transplants, or they'll die .

"Twenty-nine patients at the Veterans Administration hospital in Pittsburgh have been diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease since January 2011, raising questions about the institution's safety practices. Five of the cases ""are known to have acquired the disease from the hospital,"" the VA said. Another eight were infected elsewhere, and the source of the infection in 16 cases cannot been determined. The spate of illnesses has led relatives of two veterans who died after contracting the disease, a type of pneumonia, to blame the hospital. CNN has learned that hospital officials knew they had a problem with the water system as far back as last December,  but chose not to reveal that until a month ago. That's when the hospital began turning off the water in parts of the hospital, staff and patients told CNN. ""They should have the best and utmost care than anybody else, even better than a normal civilian,"" said Dave Nicklas, whose father, Bill, died last month at age 87. According to his death certificate, he died of heart failure and Legionnaires' disease. Nicklas entered the hospital last month for treatment of dehydration; the World War II Navy veteran initially appeared to be improving, but his condition reversed, his son said. The man's doctors told the family shortly before he died that he had contracted Legionnaires'. ""I mean, they fought for their country, you know,"" Dave Nicklas said. Legionnaires' disease kills 10 in Quebec . ""They go to battle, they love their country and where do they go? They go to a hospital and they basically die in there."" Another Navy veteran -- John Ciarolla, 83, -- died July 18, 2011, after being diagnosed with Legionnaires' at the hospital, his daughter Maureen Ciarolla said. Though the Korean War veteran had been living in the hospital for several months after he became unable to live on his own, the hospital said he could not have contracted the bacteria in the hospital. When she questioned how that conclusion had been reached, she said she was told, ""If he had gotten it here there would have been other cases."" ""I felt guilty, very guilty, thinking he got it when I took him out the Sunday before Father's Day 2011,"" Maureen Ciarolla said. The VA's problem extends beyond Pittsburgh. This week, it turned off the water in a building at its campus in Butler, Pennsylvania, 30 miles from the facility in Pittsburgh, said Amanda Kurtz, a spokeswoman for the facility. The action was taken after Legionella bacteria were identified in a preliminary sample on Tuesday, she said in a statement. No cases of Legionnaires' have been identified in the Butler facility ""as a result of this preliminary finding,"" she added. The Veterans Administration would not say if any of the patients known to have been sick with Legionnaires' disease at the hospital in Pittsburgh had died, but it told the Allegheny County Health Department that one of them did, a health department spokesman said. Legionnaires' disease, which is spread through water, is preventable and treatable. ""Being a veteran myself, I'm shocked and appalled that the VA would put their veterans in that type of situation,"" said Dave Nicklas. According to data collected by the hospital and obtained by CNN, hospital water over the past year did not contain enough disinfectant to prevent Legionnella bacteria from reaching dangerous levels. Records from the company that manufactured the water systems show that, in December 2011, a site visit noted, ""They have legionella"" and ""Systems are not being properly maintained."" Five months later, the same company -- LiquiTech -- concluded that the problems were continuing: ""Obvious evidence that the systems had not been properly regularly maintained,"" the records say. ""They were not doing the monitoring; they were not doing the things critical to the efficacy of the system,"" said LiquiTech Chief Operating Officer Tory Schira. He said his staff alerted hospital officials twice to the deficiency in their maintenance practices. But he said there is no evidence that hospital officials fixed the problem and that the deaths ""absolutely"" could have been prevented had the system been maintained. Schira's view was shared by Janet Stout, an authority on  Legionnaires' disease who worked as a microbiologist at the hospital for 23 years. ""This outbreak was absolutely preventable,"" she said. Stout and her colleague, Dr. Victor Yu, pioneered the research on the ionization filtration system now used in hospitals nationwide. But six years ago, the scientists' laboratory was closed by the hospital, which described it as ""not productive"" and ""a drain on clinical resources."" The researchers, who left the hospital after their lab was shut, dispute that characterization. They said that, during the decade before their departure, hospital water had not been linked to a single case of Legionnaires'. Had the laboratory remained at the hospital, the deaths of Bill Nicklas and others could have been prevented with the turn of a knob, Stout said. ""This is not, as they say, rocket science,"" she said. ""This is straightforward."" A source told CNN that, about six months ago, the hospital did bring in a consultant who made recommendations about how to fix the water, but the VA apparently did not tell that consultant that the hospital had had any Legionnaires' cases. Had the consultant been told, the source said, the consultant's recommendations to the hospital would have been different. The source said it was not clear whether the hospital had followed any of the consultant's recommendations. Chicago hotel shuts fountain, spa after fatal Legionnaires' outbreak . Last month, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a team to the Pittsburgh VA to investigate and make recommendations. Their findings are to be issued to the VA in the coming weeks. VA spokesman David Cowgill would not agree to an interview. Instead, he released media advisories, one of which concluded: ""VA is committed to providing safe facilities and quality care for veterans."" It added that an investigation was under way and tests had shown that remediation efforts had proven successful. Outside his suburban Pittsburgh home, Bill Nicklas' flag still flies over his front lawn. He would have turned 88 last weekend, but instead of celebrating his birthday, his family held a memorial service. He leaves three sons, five grandchildren and a wife of 59 years. The family has retained a lawyer and begun the process of filing a claim against the VA. In the meantime, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, and other members of Congress are calling for a full accounting of the outbreak. The disease has long existed, but got its name in 1976, when an outbreak occurred among people attending an American Legion convention. Some 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires' each year in the United States, according to the CDC. Though it proves fatal in 5% to 30% of cases, most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics, the disease agency says. People contract the disease when they breathe in droplets of water contaminated with the bacteria, it says. Hospitals are vulnerable because of their complex water systems, and because many of their patients already have illnesses that could put them at increased risk of infection. Older people, smokers, people with impaired immune systems or chronic lung disease also tend to be at higher risk,the CDC said.","29 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been diagnosed at Pittsburgh VA since January 2011 .

"It's a sad day for local news fans. NBC News has shuttered EveryBlock, a hyperlocal news site that pulled in and mapped useful information from a variety of rich sources, including Craigslist posts, police reports, restaurant inspections and Yelp reviews. NBC announced the shutdown in a blog post on Thursday and it is effective immediately. The post has already racked up more than 630 comments, mostly by surprised loyal users who made up the active commenting community. Launched in 2008 in Chicago by Adrian Holovaty, EveryBlock started as an exciting experiment with a two-year $1.1 million grant from the Knight Foundation. The company was acquired by MSNBC.com a year later, and in 2012 NBC News bought MSNBC.com. The maps plotted a mix of commercial, government and nonprofit feeds. You could see Flickr photos, recent muggings, local news stories and home foreclosures on your street, viewed as a map, list or RSS feed. Over the years the site expanded beyond Chicago to deliver local news for 19 cities, including San Francisco, Atlanta, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago always remained the most popular EveryBlock city, accounting for more than half  the site's traffic, according to Alexa rankings. Unfortunately for the committed users and 10 employees working on the project, the model wasn't profitable enough for NBC News to keep it open. ""We looked at various options to keep this going, but none of them were viable. It was a tough call to make,"" NBC News' chief digital officer Vivian Schiller told Poynter. Schiller said EveryBlock wasn't a good fit with the company's growth strategy. ""EveryBlock was among the more innovative and ambitious journalism projects at a time when journalism desperately needed innovation and ambition. RIP,"" wrote a shocked Holovaty, who was no longer with the company, in a post on the closure. ""Within the world of neighborhood news there's an exciting pace of innovation yet increasing challenges to building a profitable business,"" said the EveryBlock team in a blog post. ""Though EveryBlock has been able to build an engaged community over the years, we're faced with the decision to wrap things up.""","EveryBlock plotted a mix of commercial, government and nonprofit feeds .

"As hundreds of volunteers and police scoured parks and waterways in an area of New Orleans Tuesday, there were many questions but few answers about the disappearance 11 days ago of a 26-year-old teacher. Terrilynn Monette had been out celebrating a recent nomination for a ""Teacher of the Year"" award in her district the night she vanished, her friends told CNN affiliate WWL. New Orleans police said Monette was last seen on March 2 at Parlay's, a bar in the Lakeview area of New Orleans. One of the bartenders working that night had to ""cut off"" Monette, indicating the bartender felt she had too much to drink and that she should no longer be served, the nightclub's general manager, Anna Boudousque, said. According to police, Monette told her acquaintances she was going to sleep in her car before driving home ""due to having consumed alcoholic beverages."" She was seen talking to an unidentified man in the parking lot around 4 a.m. police said, adding that the man has been interviewed and is not now considered a suspect in the disappearance. Since then, both Monette and her 2012 black Honda Accord have vanished. Police say they have no suspects in the case and are reviewing surveillance tape from local businesses to try to track down any clues. ""We have received tips, and we are following up,"" New Orleans police officer Hilal Williams said. On Sunday, Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies used magnets and grappling hooks to search a local bayou that would be on the way from the bar to Monette's home but found no sign of the missing woman or her car. ""During that time (since the disappearance), we didn't have much wet rain, so it would be kind of hard to see signs that she drove her car off the road,"" Williams said. Monette's mother, Toni Enclade, said she and her daughter speak every day, and it's extremely uncharacteristic for Monette to drop out of sight. ""She walks in the room, she lights it up with her beautiful smile. I can't imagine anyone who would take her away from us,"" Enclade said. Monette, originally from California, teaches second grade at Woodland West Elementary School. Principal Amy Hoyle said Monette came to the school last October and turned one of the lowest-performing classes into one that became the highest-achieving. ""She is wonderful; she is vibrant. She is determined. She holds her students to the highest of expectations,"" Hoyle said. ""She is very loving with her students. They are a family."" Enclade said her daughter's disappearance has caused a gaping void in her life. ""No one can understand how I feel right now,"" Enclade said. ""I just want my baby back. I want her home.

"The terrorist attack on a natural gas installation at In Amenas in eastern Algeria may be an isolated act of revenge for the French intervention in Mali -- or an ominous portent of things to come in North Africa, where Islamist militancy is gaining traction fast. The man claiming responsibility for the operation is a veteran jihadist who is also renowned for hostage-taking and smuggling anything from cigarettes to refugees. Read more: Islamists take foreign hostages in attack on Algerian oil field . His name is Moktar Belmoktar, an Algerian who lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan in his teens and has long been a target of French counter-terrorism forces. Today, he leads a group called Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones), which is associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM.)  In the last few years, he has cultivated allies and established cells far and wide across the region. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Assault on In Amenas . The gas complex where Belmoktar's followers struck at dawn Wednesday is in a region that has seen plenty of jihadist activity in recent years, in part because of the collapse of government authority across the Libyan border, just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from In Amenas. Counter-terrorism experts differ as to how the attackers - in several pickup trucks - may have reached In Amenas, but there are several roads and tracks across uninhabited desert from Libya. On the other side of the border, a patchwork of militia prevails rather than any government presence. A spokesman for Al-Mulathameen told Mauritanian news websites that the attack was in retaliation for Algeria permitting French overflights as part of the intervention in Mali. But regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in days. Robert Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat who was abducted by Belmoktar's followers in Niger in 2008 -- and met the man himself --  told CNN, ""I suspect they have an intelligence wing and they are constantly looking for ways to grab westerners and embarrass the West and confuse our options. And that's exactly what they are doing."" Read more: Fallout from Mali battle goes global after militants seize Westerners in Algeria . In a 28-minute video that appeared on jihadist forums last month, Belmoktar warned that Al-Mulathameen would soon act against Western interests in the region. ""This is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries and we will attack your interests,"" he said. Announcing the formation of an elite commando unit called ""Those Who Sign With Blood,"" Belmoktar said it would be the shield against the ""invading enemy."" Wednesday's attack in Algeria was claimed in the name of that unit, which Belmoktar said would include ""the best of our youth and mujahideen, foreign and local supporters."" Counter-terrorism analysts tell CNN the language suggests this group was dispatched to carry out an act of jihad rather than abduct foreigners for ransom. Watch: Islamist militants attack oil field, two dead . ""This feels much more like attacks staged in the past by other al Qaeda affiliates, rather than another attempt to exchange hostages for ransom, as has often been AQIM's practice,"" said Andrew Lebovich, a long-time observer of AQIM currently in Senegal. ""Belmokhtar likely wants to show he is still engaged in active operations and he is not moving away from the fighting - especially at a time when other Jihadists are in active combat against French troops in Mali,"" he said. But it is also possible that Belmoktar may try to bargain for the release of al Qaeda operatives held in Algerian jails. In his December message, he said, ""To our captive people...it is our promise and our debt as long as we live that we will liberate you, and we sacrifice our lives for you and everything we own to free you."" Three al Qaeda operatives were detained last July by Algerian security services, but it's not known whether they were close to Belmoktar. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . Marlboro Man . Born in 1972, Belmoktar grew up on the edge of the desert in southern Algeria. He traveled to Afghanistan in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then Communist government. He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname ""Belaouar"" -- the ""one-eyed"" -- after a battlefield injury, and joined forces with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters. Belmoktar later claimed he met al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in the Sudan in the mid 1990s. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar who has extensively studied AQIM, Belmoktar rose steadily through the ranks to become the GIA commander for the Sahara. After a popular backlash against the terrorist group in Algeria, Belmoktar switched allegiance to a spin-off group -- the GSPC -- in 2000, and continued to operate in the sub-Saharan region. The GIA was the forerunner of AQIM, which still counts many Algerians in its leadership. Belmoktar remains associated with this fissiparous group -- but is very much his own man. Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, is said to have demoted Belmoktar late last year from his position as 'Emir of the Sahel.' Belmoktar also feuded with a rival commander - Abou Zeid - one of the most violent and radical figures in AQIM. More than most al Qaeda affiliates, AQIM is divided into often competing groups. Citing regional security officials,  Agence France Presse reported Belmoktar had been dismissed for ""continued divisive activities, despite several warnings."" Libyan sources tell CNN that Belmokhtar spent several months in Libya in 2011, exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups, and securing weapons supplies. One Arab media report - cited in a US Federal Research Division report last year - said Belmoktar had attended an event organized by Wissam ben Hamid, an Islamist commander, in the town of Sirte. There is no way to verify that. More recently, his center of operations was the dusty town of Gao in northern Mali. Another offshoot of AQIM known as the Movement for Unity and Jihad has taken over Gao and introduced Sharia law, including public amputations and floggings. To make money, ""Belmoktar increasingly engaged in smuggling, earning the popular nickname 'Mr. Marlboro' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,"" Jean-Pierre Filiu in a 2010 Carnegie Paper. A wide theater . Criminality helped fund jihad. In December 2007, Belmoktar's followers murdered four French tourists in MaurItania.  Two months later, they carried out a drive-by shooting on the Israeli Embassy in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. ""We set an ambush to kill the ambassador of the Zionist entity in Mauritania before attacking the compound that housed the embassy and the nightclub that the ambassador was present in minutes before the attack,"" Belmoktar told a Mauritanian journalist in November 2011. Despite US satellite surveillance and the deployment of Algerian and MaurItanian troops to vulnerable areas, al Qaeda affiliates in the Sahel have grown in strength. The vast distances and empty landscapes - as well as a complex relationship with local tribes - play to their advantage. Borders are difficult to seal: the rugged Algerian-Malian frontier is as long as the distance from New York to Chicago. In February 2012, a cache of SAM missiles - looted from Libyan armories - was discovered buried in the desert not far from In Amenas. Andrew Lebovich says the weapons - SA-7 nd SA-24 ""seem to have been at a midway point in the delivery process,"" their destination and customer unknown. Many AQIM figures - Belmoktar and Abou Zeid included - know the region minutely. Indeed, Lebovich says some suspect that it was relatives of Abou Zeid who kidnapped a local Algerian official a year ago - bundling him across the border into Libya. In the view of one Libyan source with close contacts among the region's jihadists, Belmoktar has often been a thorn in the side of AQIM's leadership. ""He was seen as a loose canon, running things in his own way,"" the source told CNN recently. ""and the last thing the leadership wanted was to antagonize the United States just when it was trying to build up strength by stealth, below the radar."" However the hostage stand-off is resolved, that strategy has now been blown to pieces.","Belmoktar has long been a target of French counter-terrorism forces .

"Russia recalled its ambassador to NATO for consultations Thursday, two days after NATO member countries suspended cooperation with Russia over the Ukraine crisis, Russian state media reported. Col. Gen. Valery Yevnevich will return to Moscow in light of NATO's actions, official news agency ITAR-Tass said, citing Russian Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov's remarks to journalists. ""The policy of (deliberately) whipping up tensions is not our choice. Nonetheless, we see no possibility to continue military cooperation with NATO in a routine regime,"" Antonov is quoted as saying. He accused NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen of making ""confrontational statements"" at the meeting of NATO foreign ministers early this week and questioned NATO steps to bolster its presence in Eastern Europe. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said Moscow wanted answers from NATO regarding activities in Eastern Europe after the Western military alliance said it would step up defenses for its eastern members. Russia's move to annex the Crimea region from Ukraine last month has sparked the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War and raised fears among its Eastern European neighbors. At their meeting, NATO foreign ministers decided the alliance would draw up plans for reinforcing NATO's defenses following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region -- which the West deems illegal. These would possibly include measures such as sending NATO soldiers and equipment to allies in Eastern Europe, holding more exercises and ensuring NATO's rapid-reaction force could deploy more quickly, a NATO official said. It could also include a possible review of NATO's military plans. ""We have posed these questions to the North Atlantic Alliance. We are expecting not just any answer but an answer fully respectful of the rules we have coordinated,"" Lavrov told a joint news briefing with his Kazakh counterpart. Responding to criticism from Kiev and the West over the presence of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine, Lavrov said Russia had the right to move forces on its territory and said they would return to their permanent bases after completing military exercises. ""Russian troops in the Rostov region will return to their bases after completing military exercises,"" he said, referring to an area near the Ukrainian border. NATO's military chief warned Wednesday that Russian troops could begin moving on Ukraine within 12 hours of being given an order. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, also said that with 40,000 troops massed near the border, Russia has all the components necessary to move on Ukraine. Report: Yanukovych implicated in killings . In Ukraine, a newly released report said the killings of protesters in the Ukrainian capital during anti-government demonstrations in February took place under the order of ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The preliminary report by the Ukrainian government implicated pro-Moscow Yanukovych in the covert planning of a series of sniper attacks in Kiev, backed by Russia, during the rallies that eventually led him to flee across the border. Presenting the findings at a news conference, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said evidence showed Yanukovych had directly ordered snipers to open fire on protesters. Yanukovych, now in Russia, has denied personal responsibility for the bloodshed. Twelve members of the feared Berkut special security forces have been detained as part of the investigation, Prosecutor General Oleh Makhnytsky announced. The inquiry looked into the shootings on Instytutska Street in Kiev, where dozens were killed on February 18-20. Around 100 people are now known to have died in Ukraine since the unrest began in November following Yanukovych's last-minute U-turn over a deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia. The new government in Kiev has since signed the political part of the association agreement with the EU. The report also said Russian Federal Security Service operatives had been involved in planning operations against the protesters. Ukrainian Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaychenko said the Russian agency had sent ""tons"" of explosives and weapons by plane to Ukraine. Moscow has claimed far-right protesters were behind the shootings in an effort to stir up anger against Yanukovych. Gas price hike . Meanwhile, the head of Russia's top natural gas producer, Gazprom, said it would further increase the gas price for Ukraine to $485 per 1,000 cubic meters as of April, ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying. Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller said the price would increase during a meeting with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who urged Ukraine to pay off its gas debts. The increase came two days after Gazprom announced a 44% hike in the gas price for Ukraine, starting April 1, to $385.50 per 1,000 cubic meters due to the unpaid bills. Ukraine also owes $2.2 billion in unpaid natural gas bills, Miller said during his meeting with Medvedev, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's office. ""Hopefully, in the near future, Ukraine will start repaying its debts and will finance its ongoing supplies; however, we see that the situation is not improving, and is only getting worse,"" Miller is quoted as saying. Europe and the United States are working together to reduce Ukraine's reliance on Russian energy by developing alternative sources of natural gas, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said this week.

"Citizens can legally carry firearms in post office parking lots, a federal judge has ruled. The case stems from a lawsuit filed by Tab Bonidy, a resident of rural Avon, Colorado, who was prohibited by U.S. Postal Service regulations from carrying his gun on postal service property. In the town of Avon, the post office doesn't deliver mail to residents but does provide free post office boxes. Bonidy, who is legally permitted to carry a concealed firearm, was unable to carry the weapon on post office property without violating the law. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Matsch ruled that the USPS must permit Bonidy to carry his gun in his car in the public parking lot at the post office. ""Mr. Bonidy's liberty can be accommodated by modifying the regulation to permit Mr. Bonidy to ""have ready access to essential postal services... while also exercising his right to self-defense,"" Mitsch wrote in the ruling. Because of the firearms restrictions, Bonidy had to have an employee pick up and deliver his mail at the Avon Post Office, the court said. While ackowledging that post offices are ""sensitive"" places and the ban imposed by the USPS regulations is a presumptively valid restriction of that liberty, the parking lot was not a sensitive place. The court said USPS attorneys had failed to present evidence to support enforcement of the regulation on post office parking lots. In 1972, the Postal Service enacted regulations that prevented open and concealed-carry weapons and explosives on postal property. A number of high-profile gun violence incidents at post offices across the country has increased the scrutiny on post office safety in recent years. Despite the ruling, it is still illegal to carry a firearm inside a post office.","U.S. District Court judge ruled in the case of a Colorado gun owner .
