"We are a nation of television addicts and now spend more than four hours in a day glued to the screen. The average viewing figure is the third highest in the world behind the United States and Italy. According to the Ofcom figures, Britons watch 242 minutes of television daily. Telly addicts: The average Briton spends 242 minutes a day glued to the screen, new figures show . This is an increase of 17 minutes on 2010 figures – then Britons spent three hours and 45 minutes in front of the box. Now only audiences in America, who spend almost five hours watching television, and Italy, where residents watch programmes for four hours and 13 minutes daily, are worse. James Thickett, Ofcom’s Director of Research, said: ‘We have always been a nation of TV lovers, and our research shows that UK consumers are world leaders in using the latest TV technology. ‘By catching up on programmes online or using smart TVs, the UK public is finding new ways to enhance their viewing experience.’ Rise: Only audiences in the U.S. and Italy watch more TV than Britons . He added rapid improvements in technology such as HDTV and improved screen size and quality had created a 'rush back to the living room'. Where once parents and children watched shows on different sets in different rooms – technology was bringing people back to watch on the main TV. The boom in smartphones – 60 per cent of the UK and two thirds of 16-34- year-olds own them – meant people were increasingly watching TV together in one room and simultaneously engaging with people on social networks. He said: ‘We are finding that people are using their smart phones to engage with other people when they are watching their favourite TV programmes. Mr Thickett explained there was evidence that people were returning to watching programmes as a family in the living room but young people would also be 'using the laptop or their smartphone' while watching TV with their parents. In 2002, 35 per cent of homes had only a single set, but by 2011 this figure had increased to 40 per cent. The switch to analogue has seen fewer people replacing sets in the kitchen or bedrooms, but instead investing in a bigger, technologically advanced main set in the living room. UK consumers are also the most likely in the world to access TV content over the internet. Almost a quarter of viewers claim they access services such as the iPlayer, 4OD and Sky Go, every week, compared to 17 per cent of Americans.","The average viewing figure in Britain is now the third highest in the world behind only the U.S. and Italy .

"A man who spent almost $35,000 trying to learn some of Donald Trump's real estate secrets claimed he left the sessions with little more than a photo of him next to a life-sized cardboard cut out of Trump to show for his investment. Bob Guillo, of Long Island, said: 'They . told everybody to get their credit card limits raised to buy real . estate, but the true purpose was to pay $35,000 for the next bunch of . seminars.' Another entrepreneur hoping to learn the secrets of the trade was Nora Hanna, who said she paid $17,000 for the Trump University program, before concluding 'what I learned there, I could read on the internet'. Disappointed: Bob Guillo with a cardboard cut out of Trump, taken at one of the seminars . It took the Brooklyn woman two months to get her money back, as promised to those who changed their mind within three days. 'They wouldn't answer my calls or emails,' she said, adding that eventually the money was returned. Trump's former students have been coming forward to tell their stories in the wake of a $40 million lawsuit against The Apprentice star and his real estate school by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Mr Schneiderman claims Trump helped run a phony university that promised to make students rich but instead steered them into expensive and largely useless seminars. The billionaire developer said Schneiderman's lawsuit was false and that his school had done a 'fantastic job', with a 98 per cent approval rating among students from around the country. He called the attorney general 'a political hack looking to get publicity'. Mr Guillo said during group seminars he attended in New York hotel conference rooms in 2009 and early 2010, an instructor 'was flashing his Rolex watch and wearing a very expensive suit and fancy cufflinks as he told us his rags-to-riches story'. 'We followed PowerPoint presentations, and they gave us loose-leaf manuals and websites you could pull up on your home computer. We were all scammed,' Mr Guillo claimed. Beleaguered: Donald Trump, pictured with his university emblem in May 2005, has been sued for $40 million after a lawsuit claims the classes were mostly useless and failed to live up to their promises . However, not everyone feels that way, with another former student calling her experience 'extremely positive'. 'It was an education that opened the door for us in real estate,' Marla Rains-Colic said. Ms . Rains-Colic and her husband paid $25,000 for a private three-day . mentorship progam in St Louis with a real estate expert chosen by . Trump's organization. Michael . Greco is another student who has called the lawsuit baseless. After a . free introductory presentation, the New Jersey resident spent $500 for . an online tutorial offered by Trump. 'I . got my value, and it was real value,' Mr Greco said, adding that he . never felt pressured to pay or do any more than that. 'I got my money's . worth,' he added. Complaint: New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman brought the suit against Trump . According . to the lawsuit, some students in the initial three-day group seminar . costing $1,495 were upset that they were pressured to take more . expensive Trump 'Elite' programs. When . Associated Press asked for names of students who testified for the . lawsuit, Mr Schneiderman's office provided only two - Mr Guillo's and Mr . Hanna's. Another student claiming the program failed to fulfill its promise of insider expertise is Sema Tekinay. She . said she paid $10,000 in 2009 and was supposed to get three . instructor-led courses in New York or New Jersey, with access to . advisers to guide her to private lenders and foreclosed properties. Instead, she said, she was told the courses would be offered in Texas and California - and then, only online. She tried to cancel but was told she could not because three days had already passed. 'I felt fooled,' she said. Another . student, Gregory Ryan, has sued Trump University separately in state . court on Long Island, saying he was the victim of a $25,000 'rip-off'. A . class-action lawsuit was also filed against Trump University in a San . Diego court by Tarla Makaeff, on behalf of students nationwide, claiming . she was scammed out of nearly $40,000 while attending seminars in 2008. Mr Scheiderman filed the suit on Saturday, and Trump immediately shot back that it was false and politically motivated. Mr Schneiderman . claimed many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $35,000 thought they . would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture . taken in front of a life-size picture of him. 'Trump . University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,' Schneiderman said. 'Trump . University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on . Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of . consumers who believed in the Trump brand.' State Education Department officials told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it . lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university. In 2011 it was renamed the 'Trump Entrepreneur Institute', but it has since been . dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil . lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims. Mr Schneiderman's . lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid . between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn from the mogul. He said the . three-day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they . needed to know about real estate, as the 'university' had promised. The Trump University manual tells . instructors not to let consumers 'think three days will be enough to . make them successful', Mr Schneiderman said. Angered: Trump accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for Schneiderman to try to extort campaign contributions from him . At the seminars, . consumers were told about 'Trump Elite' mentorships that cost $10,000 to . $35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made . their first deal. Mr Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend . the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the . credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs. The attorney general said . the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised. The lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far . worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt. But . Trump's attorney accused Mr Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign . contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation. Attorney . Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that . Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Mr Cohen insisted . that Trump and his university never defrauded anyone. 'The attorney general has been angry . because he felt that Mr Trump and his various companies should have . done much more for him in terms of fundraising,' Mr Cohen said. 'This . entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous . waste of taxpayers' money.' State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than $136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010. He contributed $12,500 to Mr Schneiderman in October 2010, when Mr Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show. An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year. 'Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,' Mr Cohen said. Mr Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The $40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers. He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive. 'The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr Schneiderman's character,' Mr Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.","Many students believed they would meet The Apprentice star .

"Evidence of planets supporting alien life beyond the solar system will be found within the next 50 years, renowned astronomer Sir Patrick Moore has predicted. But those fearing unwelcome visits can rest easy – he says Earth is too 'boring' for extra-terrestrials to bother with. The 89-year-old added he expected people, who could afford it, to become space tourists to the Moon, Mars and perhaps the outer reaches of the solar system by the end of the century. Planets supporting alien life could be found within the next 50 years - but it's likely that any Extra Terrestrials will find Earth boring, renowned astronomer Sir Patrick Moore, pictured right, claims . 'Life is out there': The Sky At Night presenter thinks it is only a matter of time before other planets are found that can support life . Speaking the launch of his new book The Cosmic Tourist, he said: ‘I am sure there is life out there. We cannot be the only ones. ‘I don’t think we would be on any [aliens] tourist list. We are a pretty boring planet, orbiting a boring star.’ Asked if recent discoveries of new planets beyond our solar system meant we were closer to discovering evidence of alien life in the next 50 years, he said: ‘Yes. We are not far off. He added: 'We have found other planets. The next stage is to detect the atmosphere. You can [then] work out if it has oxygen. We would know that supports life so we can look for it.’ But he complained that a lack of funding could prevent British discoveries, warning that the amount the Government had spent on the war in Afghanistan - an estimated £20 billion - could have funded a comprehensive UK space programme. Sir Patrick wrote The Cosmic Tourist, with his Sky at Night colleague, Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, and Queen star Brian May, who has a PHD in Astrophysics, and is a close friend. Holiday destination: Sir Patrick said space tourism will hopefully become possible in the next 100 years . Cost: But Sir Patrick said it was unlikely that Britain would be the country making new space discoveries because of a lack of funding - pointing out that the estimated £20million spent on the war in Afghanistan could have paid for a UK space programme . Dr Lintott said Virgin Galactic’s venture into space tourism would take off and people would pay to travel beyond earth. He said: ‘I can certainly imagine people paying to go to the Moon or Mars. Further than the solar system and you will have to wait a while. To get to the nearest stars would take tens of thousands of years.’ Sir Patrick agreed: ‘In the next one hundred years. I hope cosmic tourism will be possible. I hope we could go to the [outer] part of the solar system. Distances in space are too vast to go further.’ The Cosmic Tourist: The new book by Sir Patrick Moore, Brian May and Chris Lintott . This week Dr Lintott announced the discovery of a new planet, PH1, which is around 5,000 light years away. It is believed to be six times the size of Earth, and has four suns in its sky – it orbits two, and is in turn circled by a pair. It was discovered by two “armchair astronomers” using data from the Planet Hunters website run by Dr Lintott and colleagues, and later verified by experts. The website allows visitors to identify dips in the output of stars caused by their light being blocked by 'transits' of orbiting stars. Earlier this year, two viewers of the BBC’s Stargazing Live – Chris Holmes and Lee Threapleton – used information from the Planet Hunters website to discover evidence of a new world 3,000 light years away. It is believed to be only the third time British amateurs have found a new planet. Last month, the Queen’s astronomer Lord Rees explained developments in astronomy mean that astrophysicists could be able to view images of distant planets outside of our solar system as soon as 2025, and potentially discover whether there is some form of life on them. He said: ‘We know now that stars are orbited by retinues of planets just as our sun is. We have learned this in just the last decade, essentially. ‘Within 10 or 20 years we will be able to image other planets like the earth, orbiting other stars. ‘That will be a really exciting subject to see if there is evidence for [extra-terrestrial] life or not.’","But he claims Britain could miss out on making new discoveries because of a lack of funding .

"The woman who created the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress has been named Designer of the Year by an influential style magazine. The Harper's Bazaar award for Sarah Burton comes after the Duchess  herself was named 'Britain's queen of style' as she topped the magazine's Best Dressed list. Miss Burton, 37, creative director of fashion brand Alexander McQueen, clinched the coveted award at the fashion magazine's Women of the Year Awards at Claridge's Hotel in London last night. Year to remember: Designer Sarah Burton's award came seven months after the dress she created for the Duchess of Cambridge was seen across the globe at the Royal Wedding . Designer Sarah Burton managed to keep her involvement with the creation of Kate's ivory lace and silk dress a secret from her closest friends and family . The dress which Kate Middleton wore for her wedding to Prince William in April cemented her place as a fashion icon, while also making Miss Burton the most in-demand designer of the moment. The wedding and bridesmaid dress designs have both since been replicated by high street stores, with Debenhams launching its own 'Pippa Middleton-style' gown last week. Miss Burton revealed last week that the Duchess's wedding dress was such a closely guarded secret even her parents were unaware she was working on it. The Alexander McQueen creative director was so keen to disguise her involvement with the creation of the dress that she informed no one but a small group of colleagues who would work with her on the design. At the awards ceremony, Dame Judi Dench received a Lifetime Achievement award while fashion designer and Oscar-nominated film director Tom Ford received the award for a Man in a Woman's World. Winners: Jessie J, who turned heads at the awards in a purple jumpsuit, won Breakthrough of the Year, while Dame Judi Dench was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement award . The International Woman of the Year title went to Arianna Huffington, co-founder of the news website The Huffington Post. Jessie J received the award for Breakthrough of the Year, Tracey Emin was named Visionary of the Year and Helena Bonham-Carter took the Role Model of the Year prize. Other winners included supermodels Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen, Eva Herzigova, Yasmin Le Bon and Cindy Crawford who were collectively named Fashion Icons of the Year.",Alexander McQueen creative director Sarah Burton collects the prize at Harper's Bazaar's Women of the Year Awards .
"Get set to press record. Two of our favourite TV shows could be battling it out on Christmas Day. At 8pm, Call the Midwife fans will settle down to watch a 75-minute festive special on BBC1. Downton Abbey viewers will be switching on to ITV at 9pm. And if you want to watch both? There will be a 15-minute clash in which you won’t know which way to turn – unless you have a recorder. Head-to-head: BBC's Call the Midwife, featuring Jessica Raine, as midwife Jenny Lee, right, will battle it out with ITV's Downton Abbey, starring Michelle Dockery as Lady Mary, left, on Christmas Day . Both dramas have pulled in some of the highest ratings of the year. EastEnders and Coronation Street, which usually broadcast specials on Christmas Day, have suffered dwindling audiences in the past 12 months. Instead, viewers have fallen for the charm of Call the Midwife, which features Vanessa Redgrave, Miranda Hart, and Jenny Agutter, and was a surprise success for the BBC when the first series aired in January. Downton Abbey, which has just completed its third series, remains a firm favourite with fans both here and in the US. Call the Midwife is based on the late . Jennifer Worth’s memoirs about midwifery in London’s East End in the . 1950s, and pulled in more than 8.5million viewers a week. Christmas special: Lord and Lady Grantham, second and third from left, will go on holiday to Scotland in the festive episiode . Ratings winner: Call the Midwife - based on Jennifer Worth's memoirs about midwifery in London's East End in the 1950s - was a surprise hit . In the festive special, viewers will see a heart-wrenching story tackling teen pregnancy, the horrors of the workhouse, and child mortality. In contrast, Downton Abbey will be in summer holiday mode for its Christmas special. Lord and Lady Grantham will be enjoying a summer break with their Scottish cousins at Duneagle Castle, accompanied by servants Bates, Anna, and O’Brien. This is the home of Lady Rose, played by newcomer Lily James, who was sent home in the last episode of series three after her dalliance with a married man. There is a suggestion of new romance for Lady Edith and even cook Mrs Patmore, and more  arguments for Matthew and Mary. A BBC insider said the final touches were still being made to the Christmas schedule, adding: ‘We are still finalising schedules and will avoid any overlap if we can.’ Other festive season highlights on the BBC include a Doctor Who special and an episode of the comedy Miranda. That means viewers will have a double helping of Miss Hart at Christmas. Heart-breaking: Viewers of Call the Midwife, featuring Jenny Agutter as Sister Julienne, will see difficult stories about teen pregnancies and child mortality . Newcomer: The Christmas special will also continue the story of Lady Rose, played by Lily James, pictured, who was sent home in the last episode .","The two shows are due to overlap for 15 minutes on Christmas Day .

"A fugitive former mayor and his wife, whom the government has blamed for ordering the disappearance of 43 student teachers, have been captured by Mexican police. Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were found in Mexico City, Jose Ramon Salinas, spokesman for federal police, said on his Twitter account. The student teachers vanished after being taken into custody by police and allegedly handed over to a drug gang in the southwestern city of Iguala after clashes on the night of September 26. Scroll down for video . Jose Luis Abarca (right), who was previously mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda (left) were found in Mexico City after going on the run over the disappearance of 43 students . Caught: A police car remains outside the house where the couple were allegedly found in Mexico City . The government is still searching for the students, whose disappearance has shocked the country and undermined President Enrique Pena Nieto's claims that Mexico has become safer under his watch. Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel. The students went missing on September 26 and it's Pineda who has blood on her hands, The Daily Beast reported. She ordered the police to arrest 43 students she thought were about to ruin a party she had organised for herself and hand them over to the murderous gang, according to the website. Massive search: Police raided several homes (including the one center) in their search for the fugitive mayor . Found: Jose Luis Abarca and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were both found in the neighborhood . Discovery: A view through the front gate of one of several homes that police raided in the search on Monday . It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings. To stop this happening, the site said, she ordered the police to deal with them. Police then allegedly opened fire on the students after they stopped the buses they were travelling in, killing several, and driving others away on the orders of Guerreros Unidos' chief hitman, 'Chucky'. She was able to issue these instructions because she is apparently at the top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala. According to Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes her as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'. Forensic experts have combed through 11 clandestine graves discovered in the area during the hunt for the students. Candles are arranged into the number 43 to represent the missing students at an altar assembled by local residents to mark the Day of the Dead, outside the Municipal Palace in Iguala . A woman places a candle on photos of the missing missing students during a protest against the disappearance of 43 students from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college, in Mexico City . The sites contained 38 bodies, but there has been no confirmation that any of them belong to the missing students. It appears that the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968. Mr Karam said this week that it was in fact the mayor who ordered the police to confront the students, citing testimony from several officers that have been arrested during the investigation into the case. Meanwhile, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto yesterday met with parents of the 43 missing students for the first time since they disappeared. The mothers and fathers of the missing have grown increasingly frustrated at the pace of the investigation. The case has shaken the image of improving security that the government has sought to project since Pena Nieto took office in 2012. Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa (right), wife of Jose Luis Abarca (left) is said to be the 'key operator' of criminal activity in the Mexican town of Iguala . After meeting for about six hours inside the Los Pinos presidential residence, parents said they told Pena Nieto they did not have confidence in the investigation, and the government agreed to measures including the creation of a commission to monitor the case. 'We are not going to trust the words of the president nor the commitments that were made public ... until they present the 43 students to us alive,' Felipe de la Cruz, one of the parents, said at a news conference late Wednesday. At one point earlier in the day, human rights officials had said the meeting was over but the family members were refusing to leave until Pena Nieto signed a document that would satisfy everyone. Pena Nieto said in televised remarks that in addition to the commission, made up of both government officials and parents to provide daily updates on the investigation, the government agreed to provide greater support for both rural teachers colleges and the families of those who were killed or wounded in the attack, and to redouble efforts to determine the students' whereabouts. Forensic examiners stand atop a garbage-strewn hillside in the densely forested mountains outside Cocula, in Guerrero state, Mexico, where authorities are searching for remains of the missing students . Soldiers of the Mexican Navy stand guard along a road near where a mass grave has been discovered in a trash dump outside the mountain town of Cocula during the probe into the missing students . 'There will be a renewed search plan,' Pena Nieto said. The relatives came to Mexico City from the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa in Guerrero state, where the missing students were enrolled. 'We are asking them to not just look for them in the graves, not just look for them in the dumps, because we are sure they are alive,' de la Cruz told reporters at a human rights center in the Mexican capital. Another father of a missing student, Rafael Lopez also expressed frustration at authorities' inability to determine what happened. 'If they can't do it, they should ask for help from the United States,' Lopez said from the school, where he and some of the parents remained Wednesday. A woman marches with leaflets with the images of the missing students  during a protest against their disappearance from the Isidro Burgos rural teachers college . People attend a protest at the Zocalo, Mexico City's main square, against the disappearance of the students . Iguala's former mayor and his wife are fugitives, and 56 people have been detained, including police from Iguala and the nearby town of Cocula as well as the alleged leader of Guerreros Unidos. Pena Nieto said the rule of law will apply regardless of 'wherever (the investigation) leads.' The case has spurred anger across the country, and large protest marches demanding action by the government have been held in Mexico City, Acapulco and the capital of Guerrero, Chilpancingo. Several protests have erupted in violence. On Wednesday, protesters aligned with the teachers college attended by the missing attacked the Guerrero governor's residence Chilpancingo, damaging the front gate and burning an official vehicle outside.","Jose Luis Abarca, previously mayor of Iguala, and wife found in Mexico City .

"Stretching out into the still blue lagoon waters, set against a backdrop of rugged mountains, these are the spectacular first images of how Rio de Janeiro's Olympic park will look in 2016. Designs for the complex in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood of the city have been revealed by the architects that won the contract to mastermind the project in London. The waterfront park will be built on the former Brazilian grand prix track in a striking triangular layout spread over 300 acres. Scroll down for video tour of designs .

The park will be built on the . former Brazilian grand prix track in a striking triangular layout . spread over 300 acres . Stunning site: The Olympic Park will host 15 Olympic sports and a 11 Paralympic competitions at 34 venues. Notable venues shown here are: 4. The Aquatics centre (top centre), 6. The hockey fields (centre of the plan) 7. The  Velodrome (blue centre field), 14. Gymnatics (top right), 8,9,10. Main tennis arenas (bottom centre) It will play host to 15 Olympic sports including swimming and hockey and a further 11 Paralympic competitions in 34 venues on the site, 18 of which are already operating. It will also house a media centre to accommodate 20,000 journalists and the Olympic and Paralympic villages are also located in the Barra zone. Unlike the London Games, the main Olympic stadium is not at the park - athletes will use the famous Brazil football stadium, the Maracana, which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies as well as the Joco Havelange Stadium - home to the club side Botafogo. Building work is well underway with the project said to be more straightforward than London because several venues are already on the site due to its former role in hosting the Pan American Games.

Explaining . how it will differ from the London park, Hanway added: 'London was very . complex because of the old industry and network of canals. Rio is more . straightforward in that it is flat and already partially developed. 'But . our approach has been very similar, especially with regards to leaving a . legacy and in using Brazilian architects in the same way . All smiles: Hanway stands over the model.

London and Eduardo (Eduardo Paes, the Mayor of Rio) was keen to do the . same. 'We are already . talking about some interesting ideas of converting some of the temporary . venues into public buildings, like schools after the games. That is . really exciting.' Hanway said one of the main challenges facing Rio was public transport. The city of six million people has just two metro lines. 'The . authorities are working on the transport and are extending the lines . out to the park. The good thing for us, is a lot of the upgrades will be . done in time for the World Cup in 2014,' he said.

But it is understood that Mr Davie ‘suggested’ the course of action to Miss Boaden and both she and Mr Mitchell reportedly believed they were able to continue their jobs while the Pollard Review is carried out. Robert Peston, the BBC's business editor, revealed in his blog yesterday that 'lawyers acting for Ms Boaden and Mr Mitchell have informed Mr Davie that they are quite capable of running BBC News, even with the uncertainty created by the Pollard inquiry'. It has also emerged that Miss Boaden may be on the brink of leaving the broadcaster after she was forced to ‘step aside’ yesterday. If she does leave the BBC, she is . likely to demand a huge compensation payment. She had already engaged . lawyers to help answer Mr Pollard’s questions. Insiders have accused senior . executives of trying to ‘stitch up’ Miss Boaden and force her out of the . corporation after the departure of director general George Entwistle. One insider told the Telegraph that the truth about the two executives was 'not how the BBC have made it appear', adding: 'They are not happy to be going at all'. The timing of yesterday’s announcement . suggested that Miss Boaden and Mr Mitchell were being blamed for the . appalling failures of Newsnight, which wrongly claimed on November 2 . that a senior Tory was complicit in child abuse. In fact, both . executives had played no part in the decision to screen the film, . because they had been told to steer clear of any ‘Savile-related’ stories. Developments: BBC News director Helen Boaden (l) and her deputy Stephen Mitchell (r) have 'stepped aside' Together: Jimmy Savile and Helen Boaden are pictured at the Savoy Hotel in London in December 2006 . Sources say this resulted in a power . vacuum at the top of BBC news, which may have contributed to the . decision to broadcast the Newsnight report without even asking the Tory . in question, Lord McAlpine, about the story. The BBC claims that removing Miss . Boaden and Mr Mitchell will solve this problem – but was forced to make . it ‘absolutely clear’ that the pair had nothing to do with the McAlpine . story. Although it did not name the Tory peer, the report provided . enough clues to prompt a wave of wholly untrue allegations about Lord . McAlpine on social networking sites. Under fire: Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, speaks to the media in central London on Sunday . The BBC said the executives were . moving aside to resolve the ‘lack of clarity’ about who is in charge of . BBC news while Mr Pollard’s review continues. The corporation added that . ‘they expect then to return to their positions’ when the investigation . concludes. However, one source said: ‘You have to . assume the decision has been taken to get them out and they will try . and find a way of getting them out.' Fran Unsworth, BBC newsgathering head since 2005, is temporarily taking over from Helen Boaden as the Corporation's news chief. The 54-year-old started in BBC local radio before going to Radio 1’s Newsbeat and later working for BBC Radio 4’s The World at One. A former radio producer in Washington D.C. and a 25-year BBC veteran, she also worked as head of BBC political programming. In her job as head of newsgathering she is responsible for around 800 staff working in the UK and abroad, on a salary of £166,650. The Manchester University drama graduate, who has a flat in Marylebone, west London, is from North Staffordshire and is president of the media group Society of Editors. The statement said: ‘The BBC wants . to make it absolutely clear that neither Helen Boaden nor Stephen . Mitchell had anything at all to do with the failed Newsnight . investigation into Lord McAlpine.’ However, it added there was a ‘a lack . of clarity in the lines of command and control’ at BBC News due to the . executives ‘caught up in the Pollard Review’. It continued: ‘In the . circumstances Helen and Stephen will be stepping aside from their normal . roles until the Pollard Review reports and they expect then to return . to their positions.’ The BBC’s head of newsgathering, Fran . Unsworth, and Ceri Thomas, the editor of Radio 4’s Today programme, are . to fill in for Miss Boaden and Mr Mitchell respectively. Karen O’Connor, a former deputy editor of Panorama and Newsnight, has been drafted in as acting editor of the latter programme. As director of news, Miss Boaden was . responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the . broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, . Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight. Her position had been in . question for weeks, following the eruption of the Savile scandal. Will he be next? Lord Patten, right, with George Entwistle as he announces his resignation on Saturday night . Out and in: Acting director general of the BBC Tim Davie (right) arrives at New Broadcasting house in central London on Monday morning, after George Entwistle's (left) dramatic resignation on Saturday night . Ceri Thomas, a former editor of Radio 5 Live's breakfast programme, took over from Kevin Marsh as editor of Radio 4's flagship Today programme in 2006. The 49-year-old started his broadcasting career in 1989 at LBC Radio and joined Today as a junior producer two years later. He was listed by MediaGuardian this year as the 70th most influential person in the media and has previously been praised by Ms Boaden for his 'flair and passion for radio'. The newspaper praised Today for remaining 'required listening' but said Mr Thomas was 'dogged by criticism that the show is too male'. It is known that she told Mr Entwistle . – then running BBC TV – at an awards lunch last year that Newsnight was . planning to run a report about claims that Savile abused young girls, . which could affect Mr Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying . tribute to the presenter. Sources at Newsnight have also suggested that . she warned the programme’s then editor, Peter Rippon – who has also . since stepped aside – that he needed to be sure of his facts before . screening any claims that Savile was a criminal. Miss Boaden’s removal will be a bitter blow to a woman who months ago was hailed as a contender to run the BBC. She began at the corporation almost 30 . years ago, working as a news producer at BBC Radio Leeds before going . on to work as a reporter and then editor of Radio 4’s File on 4, and as a . presenter on Woman’s Hour. She took responsibility for business programmes on the station in 1997 and was made station controller three years later. Fiercely defensive of the station’s . ‘intelligent’ programming that ‘feeds the mind’ she helped it to reach . audiences of 10million for the first time. Despite running Radio 4 during another . BBC crisis – when an infamous Today programme  report sparked the . Hutton Inquiry – she escaped censure because the show is governed by the . BBC News division. In the wake of the scandal Miss Boaden was promoted to become said division’s first female director in 2004. This year she applied to become . director general but was beaten by Mr Entwistle. It is understood she . was offered a senior role in radio instead, but turned it down. Crisis: The BBC needs a radical overhaul following the resignation of its chief executive in wake of a scandal over a botched report on child sex-abuse allegations, Lord Patten said . John Simpson said over-management had been a 'serious blight' on the BBC . Senior BBC broadcasters turned on their masters in spectacular fashion yesterday. They joined Jeremy Paxman in a growing mutiny against a ‘bonkers’ BBC which undervalues staff and swells the ranks of managers. Radio 4 host Libby Purves waded into the fracas to call for more bloodletting in the ‘bloated, ineffectual’ upper layers of management. The fightback was spearheaded by Newsnight veteran Paxman when he said George Entwistle had been ‘brought low by cowards and incompetents,’ and branded BBC managers ‘biddable time-servers’. John Simpson, the BBC’s world affairs editor, said over-management had been ‘a serious blight on the BBC since the Eighties’. He said ‘savage cuts’ imposed on the BBC had mainly fallen on programme-makers and broadcasters. Mr Simpson added: ‘The proliferation of middle managers in the BBC was something that Lord Patten wanted to deal with; but the decisions about who should be sacked were all too often made by middle managers.’ Executives in the BBC news department  have included Helen Boaden, who earns £354,000 a year to take ‘overall editorial responsibility’; Stephen Mitchell, on £203,000 to take ‘managerial and editorial responsibility’; David Jordan, paid £174,000 to ‘produce editorial guidelines’; Sue Inglish, earning £141,000 to take ‘managerial responsibility for political news’ and Mary Hockaday, the Head of Newsroom in charge of ‘editorial leadership’. Midweek presenter Miss Purves said some of these managers should be sacked, adding: ‘I do not know which of the above bear responsibility for which disaster. But some of them have to go, and possibly their job titles with them.’ She wrote in The Times: ‘Tell the smug mandarins of the news departments to shape up, pay attention, and do their jobs with decision, perceptiveness, openness and generosity – or go away. ‘We need some pretty senior firings in the executive and legal layers. In both recent scandals the evidence of sly, uncommunicative, nervously arrogant incompetence is simply too strong to ignore.’ Within hours, the new man leading the BBC, Tim Davie, issued a jargon-infested statement promising to be ‘visible and available’. He described a process by which he ‘will transition’ to his new job of boss of BBC Worldwide after the corporation appoints a new DG.","BBC News director and deputy were not involved in Newsnight's decision to make false claims linking former senior Tory figure to child abuse .

"In the not-so-distant future, we could be implanted with devices that seek out infection before dissolving naturally into our bloodstream. Researchers in Illinois have created biodegradable batteries that travel through the body capable of wirelessly transmitting data to doctors. They are made from a combination of metals and cathodes which gradually melt over the course of three weeks, without releasing any harmful chemicals.

Rogers continued the power will last for around a day, and further research will be carried out to extend this time period by increasing the surface area of the magnesium foil. The breakthrough builds on the work Rogers and this team carried out in 2012. Two years ago they designed a biodegradable silicon chip that monitors temperature and can be used to prevent infection. These chips, however, used coils and power from an external source.

"Cosmetic surgery is soaring in China as women over thirty compete with younger talent in the workplace . There has been a surge in cosmetic surgery among Chinese working women due to employers placing undue emphasis on youth, according to a new report. Daily Beast contributor Joanna Chiu has reported a boom in cosmetic procedures in the country, in particular among working women on the cusp of turning thirty who fear they may be overlooked in favour of 20-something colleagues. Women feel job insecurity and anxiety more acutely than men, according to anthropologist Wen Hua. And it appears their fears may well be grounded in reality: ageism and sexism appear to be endemic in the job market. In 2003, a . review of the country's job adverts revealed that over 90 per cent of . job postings were only open to applicants under 30, while unmarried . females over the age of 27 are labelled as 'leftover' women by the . government. Hua, the author of Buyings Beauty: Cosmetic Surgery in China, says that beauty is often viewed as the key to success in the workplace. She said: 'The dramatic economic, cultural and political changes in China have produced immense anxiety experienced by women, which stimulates the belief that beauty is capital. 'Cosmetic surgery has become a form of consumer choice; it reflects in microcosm the transition of China from communism to consumerism with its own Chinese characteristics.' One author says that beauty is often viewed as the key to success in the workplace, causing rates of cosmetic surgery to rise . But Hua goes on to explain that discrimination against older women doesn't discourage them from aiming high. The results of a 2011 study by the Centre for World-Life Policy showed that 76 per cent of women aspire to top jobs, whereas only 52 per cent of women in the United States do the same. And Xinhua News Agency found that these Chinese women fund a $2.5 billion a year industry, which is growing at a staggering 20 per cent per year. After the U.S. and Brazil, China is ranked the third largest market for cosmetic surgery in the world.","Cosmetic procedures booming in China among women nearing age of 30 .

"Plea: Israeli television actress Orly Weinerman has called on Tony Blair to save the life of her former lover, Saif Gaddafi . The last-known girlfriend of Colonel Gaddafi’s playboy son Saif al-Islam has called on his ‘old friend’ Tony Blair to save his life. Saif Gaddafi is facing the death penalty in Libya where he is on trial for his role in the killing of protesters during last year’s uprising against his father. Human rights groups are concerned that he will not face a fair trial and efforts to extradite him to the International Criminal Court in the Hague have failed. Now Orly Weinerman, a 41-year-old Israeli model and actress who dated Saif for six years after meeting him in London in 2005, has called on Mr Blair to make Saif’s accusers ‘see reason’. She said: ‘Saif worked closely with Mr Blair before he was captured. 'The two are old friends – it is time that Mr Blair returned some loyalty. 'Mr Blair is a man of God – as a Christian he has a moral duty to help a friend in need.’ Saif’s close links with Mr Blair were illustrated in documents found during the uprising. A letter written by Mr Blair in 2007 gave suggestions to help with Saif’s PhD, which he was taking at the London School of Economics. Miss Weinerman added: ‘You should just ask Mr Blair what a serious, honourable person he is. The ICC has let him down, and so has the international community. ‘Killing him will achieve absolutely nothing, beyond punishing him for who his father was. Absolutely everything must be done to save him.’ The Israeli actress said her ‘discreet relationship’ with Saif al-Islam - whose name means ‘Sword of Islam’ - began in April 2005 when they were introduced by mutual friends. It was strained from the start because she is Jewish - a fact that caused complications in an Islamic country such as Libya. Her parents - her father is a green energy consultant and her mother a pianist - were also opposed to her converting to Islam, she said, and her relationship with Saif came in for much criticism in the Israeli press. ‘It was something we had to deal with,’ said Miss Weinerman, who is now based in her home city of Tel Aviv. ‘The fact that Saif was prepared to involve himself in a loving relationship with a Jew is a measure of how open and civilised he is. ‘He judged people for what they are - . not what people perceive them to be. Saif never made an issue of my . religion, or the country I came from.’ She . had previously denied having any contact with Saif, after publications . including Germany’s Der Spiegel reported their romance in 2006. Saif’s reputation is as a notorious womaniser, and he has been photographed surrounded by gorgeous women. On trial: Saif Gaddafi, pictured in 2004 (left) and 2008 (right)  is facing the death penalty in Libya . Fall from power: How Saif Gaddafi looked after he was captured by revolutionary fighters last November . When his father ruled Libya, Saif played a key role in dealings with the West, and in particular with Mr Blair who met the tyrant in the infamous ‘Deal in the Desert’ in 2004 to bring Libya in from the cold. It was around then that a grubby backroom deal is suspected of being done to free the Lockerbie bomber, although Mr Blair denies any part in this. When Mr Blair stepped down as premier, he pursued business interests in the North African country, assisting international companies to make profits from its oil and gas reserves. Miss Weinerman did not meet Mr Blair or any of Saif’s other high-profile Western contacts, but says she was dating him during the period when he was meeting them. She was also busy with modelling assignments and soap opera parts in mainly Israeli TV shows at the time. At one stage the couple talked of marriage, she said, but were finally separated last year when the Libyan uprising toppled the dictator after 42 years in power, and Saif went on the run. The trial of Saif Gaddafi, being held in the mountain town of Zintan, will be one of the biggest events the country has seen. Previous attempts to bring him to trial had been plagued with arguments over whether the case should be heard in the capital. Links: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair (left) and the late Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi pictured in Tripoli in 2004. When Mr Blair stepped down as premier, he pursued business interests in the North African country, assisting international companies to make profits from its oil and gas reserves . The Zintan brigade fighters - who captured him - insisted he be tried in their home town amid fears he might escape with the help of sympathisers if he was put in the dock in Tripoli, or that he would be treated leniently. The decision was also complicated by a demand from the International Criminal Court that Saif be tried at The Hague. One official from the Libyan prosecutor’s office said recently: ‘We are sure that the evidence we have gathered is solid and it will shock and surprise the world. We believe we are capable of holding a fair trial.’ Three Libyan judges will hear the case, which is expected to last for up to six months, with two prosecutors. Saif has so far refused to appoint a lawyer to defend him, and one will be appointed for him if he continues to refuse. Human rights groups have argued that the Libyan justice system is not capable of dealing with such a high-profile case. Amnesty International said an unfair trial in Libya would go against ‘justice and accountability’. Yesterday a spokesman for Tony Blair declined to comment.

"The Department of Transport is said to be taking steps to try and make using Google Glass while driving illegal in the UK - a year before the head-mounted device is expected to officially launch. Stuff magazine exclusively revealed that the government is concerned about how the device, which is worn on a person's head and shows images on an built-in display, will distract drivers. It is said to be taking 'pre-emptive' steps to get legislation in place before the gadget arrives in the UK next year, by working with police to extend the scope of existing offences. Google launched its Glass, pictured, device in 2012 and only select customers, known as Explorers, have been able to get their hands on the technology. Rumours suggest the glasses will go on general sale later this year . Apple recently added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software. Named iOS in the Car, Apple plans to integrate phones with iOS 7 into the dashboards of cars. If a car is equipped with this technology, a user can connect their handset to the system and use their car's built-in display and controls. The Siri Eyes-Free tool also lets users control this system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road. Samsung added eye tracking to its Galaxy S3 handset with the Smart Stay feature that can tell when a user is looking at the display. Its Samsung Galaxy S4 then continued this trend by adding Smart Pause, which pauses video when the user's eyes wander from the screen. A spokesman from the DfT told Stuff: 'We are aware of the impending rollout of Google Glass and are in discussion with the Police to ensure that individuals do not use this technology while driving.' Using a hand-held mobile phone while driving was banned in the UK in December 2003. It is already an offence to make phone calls and send text messages while driving, but hands-free devices are allowed. Under the plans being discussed by the Government, the ban could see drivers incurring a £60 fine as well as three points on their licence if they use Google Glass while driving. This is the same penalty given to people who use a mobile phone while driving, and the ban is likely to equally come under the 1988 Road Traffic Act. According to Stuff, if the plans are approved it would mean developers would not be allowed to make apps for the device that can be used in cars either. A Google spokesperson told Stuff: 'We are . thinking very carefully about how we design Glass because new . technology always raises new issues.' Commenting on the news, David Bizley, Technical Director at the RAC, said: 'Usually, common sense is the best benchmark for making a decision about whether technology can make driving safer and easier and it seems the Government has taken the right course by being cautious when it comes to the use of Google Glass. 'Existing technology already provides distraction enough. 'Ultimately, however, we must not forget the most common distractions in this modern age are talking to passengers, adjusting basic car controls and eating or drinking and this is unlikely to change for some time.' The news also comes as Google begins extending the rollout of the gadgets to the friends and family of people already on its Glass Explorers program. According to reports from technology site Marketing Land, Google has started emailing owners invitations with a form that lets them share Google Glass with a friend. The email states that anyone using the device must be at least 18 years old and be able to collect the device from San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. Google's Glass Explorer programme was launched in February. Applicants had to post a message on Google+ or Twitter with the hashtag '#ifihadglass' and, if successful, were given the option to buy Explorer Editions of the headwear for $1,500 (£990). These editions can be connected to Wi-Fi or tethered to Android and iOS devices. The device is activated using the voice command 'OK Glass', or it can be activated by running a finger across the side of the glasses.","Department of Transport said to be taking steps to make using Google Glass while driving illegal in the UK .

"A couple's casual hill walk near Mount Snowdon in Wales took an exciting turn when they were given a free air show by a passing RAF Tornado. Instead of a swooping bird of prey, Craig Sluman and his wife Paula saw the 'awesome' power of the craft used by the British military in bombing raids. And nature enthusiast Craig captured the scene in a brilliant series of images from just 500 feet away. In one of the pictures it appears the navigator in the plane even glances at the hikers as they zoom by. Scroll down for video . Craig Sluman's incredible view of an RAF Tornado, as seen during what was supposed to be a quiet walk in the country in Wales . The Tornado GR4 seen from Mount Snowdon is believed to have be on a training flight from RAF Marham, Norfolk . Mr Sluman, 47, and Paula were enjoying a peaceful and scenic walk on a mountain called Cadair Idris in North Wales, just south of Mount Snowdon, when they saw as a speck the aircraft approaching. It shot over them, about 300 feet above the ground on a low-flying training mission. As it did so the sheer power and air pressure created a vapour cloud as high and low pressure air mixed, a phenomena called 'fluffing.' Mr Sluman, from Doncaster, Yorks, who was on holiday in North Wales, said: 'It was amazing to watch. We saw the aircraft approaching from some distance away and I had my camera and lens with me as we like taking pictures of landscapes. 'There was a lot of noise as it came past of course but my shutter speed froze the action. 'I'd say the aircraft was flying about 300 feet above the ground at 500mph and about 500 feet away from us. The sight of one of our RAF Bombers on a low level flying mission was just awesome to watch. 'The bomber came past us and disappeared down the valley over the lake Tal Y Llyn just amazing to watch and capture as a picture.' The fighter jet flew only 300 feet above Craig Sluman and his wife Paula on the Cadair Idris mountain in North Wales . Craig Sluman said: 'The sight of sight of one of our RAF Bombers on a low level flying mission was just awesome to watch' An aviation source said the aircraft was a Tornado GR4, probably from RAF Marham in Norfolk. It is probably on the low-level route known as the MACH Loop covering areas in north-west England and Wales. The Tornado GR4 is a two-seat, all-weather, day or night attack and reconnaissance aircraft. It has been in service with the RAF for more than 30 years, but a combination of major upgrade programmes and numerous continual enhancements has kept the aircraft amongst the forefront of all attack aircraft. Still one of the very few aircraft in the world that is able to operate at low level, day or night and in poor weather, the Tornado is now equipped with a modern precision-guided weapons suite. It can fly at a maximum altitude of 50,000 feet.","Craig Sluman was on a scenic walk near Mount Snowdon with his wife when the jet flew past, just 500 feet away .

The city, which residents joke is like a Six Flags amusement park because it's so bumpy, also has a sinkhole problem. According to ABC, people and even a car have fallen into them in the past. 'It's hard to have a good city without good infrastructure,' Chane told ABC. 'And our city simply does not have the budget.'

'This is all still under investigation. We're just trying to get more information,' Officer Colendula Greene told ABC News. But Chane is proud of his work. 'I'm probably stealing from the city, but there's not a sign saying ""Don't take this and put it in potholes."" So I'm putting (the asphalt) back where it belongs,' he told MSN Now.

"Leather grown in a lab could be on sale within five years, according to a firm backed by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel. Modern Meadow is also developing lab grown meat - but says that its first product could change the clothing industry. The firm says the firm lab grow leather could be on sale within five years. The breakthrough could see 'lab grown' leather on sale within five years, leading to a new range of ethical leather clothing. Cells are sourced from a biopsy of a cow.Million of extracted cells are placed in a bioreactor . or other growth apparatus. Cells are put together in layers to fuse them together. Cells are placed back in a bioreactor to mature. After several weeks, no more food . is provided to the cells. Skin tissue turns to hide, and muscle and fat . tissue is harvested for food. 'Our emphasis first is not on meat, it’s on leather,' company cofounder and CEO Andras Forgacsays told Txchnologist. 'The main reason is that, technically, skin is a simpler structure than meat, making it easier to produce.' The firm said part of its decision to focus on leather was the public reaction to its plans for . 'Anecdotally, we’ve found that around 40 percent of people would be willing to try cultured meat,' he says. 'There’s much less controversy around using leather that doesn’t involve killing animals.' The firm says its biggest problem is how to mass produce the cells needed for leather and meat. Modern Meadow’s meat and leather would be competing for a share of a combined $2.5 trillion market, Forgacs says. The firm hopes the project, which recently received a grant of £220,000 from Peter Thiel, could ease environmental concerns over meat production. The firm admits that persuading the public to eat lab grown meat could be a struggle . 'If you look at the resource intensity of everything that goes into a hamburger, it is an environmental train wreck,' said Forgacs. However, Modern Meadow admits that the road ahead is not going to be easy. 'The consumer acceptance of such products may not be without challenges,' it revealed in a submission to the United States Department of Agriculture. 'We expect it will first appeal to culinary early-adopter consumers and the segment of the vegetarian community that rejects meat for ethical reasons. 'With reduction in price, it can reach the masses with religious restrictions on meat consumption (people restricted to Hindu, Kosher, Halal diets) and finally populations with limited access to safe meat production.'",Modern Meadow also plans to grow meat in the lab - but says public perceptions mean it will grow leather first .
"Free: Eric Joyce will not face charges over his arrest in the Houses of Parliament earlier this week . MP Eric Joyce will not face charges over an alleged fight in the Houses of Parliament which saw him wrestled to the ground, it was announced today. The former Labour MP, who serves as an independent after being kicked out of the party, was arrested on suspicion of assault earlier this month, and then re-arrested at the police station on suspicion of actual bodily harm. But Scotland Yard today said that Mr Joyce will face no further action in relation to the incident. 'A man aged in his fifties, arrested . on Thursday 14 March on suspicion of assault and ABH in connection with a . disturbance in a bar within the House of Commons, and bailed to a . central London police station has been released with no further action . today,' the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. A dozen police officers were called to a . fracas at the Sports and Social bar in the Houses of Parliament on March 14, where Mr Joyce was at a karaoke night. The MP . was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers . and loaded into a police van, and was subsequently banned from buying . alcohol within the premises. The Crown Prosecution Service said: 'The CPS received a complete file on 26 March in relation to events at the Sports and Social Club within the Palace of Westminster on 14 March 2013, following which Eric Joyce MP was arrested. 'The file related to allegations of assault and after careful consideration we have concluded there is insufficient evidence to charge Mr Joyce with any offences in connection with this incident. 'Although there appears to have been an incident on the evening in question, evidence obtained from witnesses contained multiple inconsistencies and there is insufficient evidence that Mr Joyce committed any offence.' Arrest: Joyce is restrained and handcuffed before being taken away by police on March 14 . Scene: Inside the Sports and Social Bar at the Houses of Parliament, where Joyce was arrested . The 52-year-old former soldier was . arrested last February over a brawl at the nearby Strangers’ bar in . Parliament where he headbutted Tory MP Stuart Andrew.

"Wine time: Brits are most likely to crack open a bottle of wine at 6.55pm on a Wednesday to break up the week, a new study has revealed . It is the hump day that marks the end of three full days of work - but heralds another two to endure. It is no wonder that Wednesday is often cited as our least favourite day of the week - and even less surprising that it is the day most of us take to the bottle. It has been revealed that Wednesday - in fact, Wednesday evening at 6.55pm, to be precise - is the moment when our resolve weakens and we pour ourselves a restorative glass of wine (or three). Red wine drinkers have the edge on white, just, as it is revealed that 37 per cent will pop the cork on a bottle of red, while 36 per cent will choose white. Meanwhile one in five (20 per cent) prefer to indulge in a glass of rose, leaving the remaining six per cent to opt for sparkling win - despite the growing popularity of prosecco. It appears that men are the first to break the dry spell during their working week, as it is reported that on average males are having their first sip of Wednesday wine at 6.40pm, while ladies do so almost half an hour later, at 7.07pm. Most drink their wine with a meal (52 per cent), although more than a third (37 per cent) indulge in a tipple with no accompaniment whatsoever. The study also reveals that three quarters (76 per cent) of us prefer to drink the wine at home. Less than one in ten (8 per cent) actually venture out of their homes and head to their local pub to enjoy a cheeky midweek drink. Laura Phillips, an admin assistant from Basingstoke, Hants, feels Wednesday is the perfect time to have a relaxing midweek drink with her boyfriend. The 27-year-old said: 'Wednesday is the perfect time to sit on the sofa and share a nice bottle of red. 'It breaks the working week up and I always get into my pyjamas and enjoy a few glasses at around 7pm with my dinner. 'We don't necessarily polish the bottle off but it really takes the edge off and helps me relax in the middle of a hectic working week.' Thirsty: On average males are having their first sip of Wednesday wine at 6.40pm, while ladies do so almost half an hour later, at 7.07pm and both sexes prefer red wine . Gillian Walters, sales and marketing director at Cobevco, who carried out the study, said: 'These results give us a great insight into the nation's drinking habits. As our working week becomes longer and stress takes its toll, people are turning to wine as a midweek treat and a bit of an escape - whether from office life or their family. 'More are forgoing an evening trip to the pub for a beverage or two in the house, as increased alcohol duty takes its effect on affordability, especially in the on trade.'","More than a third of Brits prefer red wine .

"It has been confirmed that Iranian jets opened fire on an unmanned U.S.drone last week raising fresh concerns within the Obama administration about Iranian military aggression. A Predator drone operating off the coast of Kuwait, in international waters, was fired upon by two Su-25 Iranian fighter planes said George Little, the Pentagon press secretary. The incident occurred on November 1st at 4.15 a.m. eastern time and wasn't revealed publicly because the drone was on a classified mission. Scroll Down for Video . A MQ-1 Predator - which was attacked last week over the Persian Gulf by two Iranian jet fighters . The Predator drone was intercepted by the Iranian jets 16 miles off of the coast of Kuwait . The fighter jets unleashed rocket fire at the drone according to Mr. Little but the Predator was not hit - although the Pentagon's believes the volley was not meant as warning shots. 'Our working assumption is they fired to take it down,' said Mr. Little to the Wall Street Journal. Two U.S. officials speaking to CNN explained the jets were part of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps force, which has been more confrontational than regular Iranian military forces. The MQ-1 Predator drone which was flying . 16 miles off the coast captured the incident on its still and . video cameras which according to officials show the two SU-25s flying . towards the Predator firing their on-board guns. Initially, U.S. military intelligence . analysts were not sure if the Iranian pilots were unable to hit the . drone out of lack of skill or whether they missed on purpose. Talking earlier, one unnamed source said, 'It doesn't matter, they fired on us.' Speaking . to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Little said that after being fired . upon, the drone flew out to sea and then made back to its base in . Kuwait. He added that this was the first time . that the Iranians had fired at a U.S. drone and that the United States . has protested the incident but has not heard back from Iran. The . Obama administration did not disclose the incident immediately, which . occurred five days before the election, but the attack has been . confirmed today. Defence officials said politics played no part in keeping the incident quiet. During . the presidential debates, the two candidates went to great lengths to . explain their differing postures regarding their Iranian policy. Mitt Romney frequently frequently accused President Obama of taking a soft line towards Iran. 'Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability,' said Romney during the campaign. 'And it has never acted less deterred by America.' The . President however has preferred to stick with sanctions against Iran, . but in a speech to the United Nations on Sept. 25, he repeated his . position that the United States would work to prevent Iran from gaining . nuclear weapons. The Iranians have previous with American military spy drones. In December last year, the Islamic Republic claimed to have shot down one of the United States most sophisticated spy planes - the stealth RQ-170 Sentinel drone. The Iranian military paraded the craft in a public gym as the American's denied the unammned plane had indeed been shot down.

Drone: Iran claims to have shot down a USAF RQ-170 Sentinel which was on a . surveillance mission last December . According to Little, the U.S. drone was conducting 'routine surveillance' and that the Iranian jets tried twice to shoot down the craft. Asked about how the U.S. could respond, he said: 'We have a wide range of options from diplomatic to military.' He would not be draw on whether they were actually plans for a military response and refused to be drawn into speculation around the attack being considered an act of war. The Pentagon announced the brazen attack as the Obama administration imposed another round of sanctions on Iranian officials and entities. They are the first sanctions since President Obama's re-lection on Tuesday and according to the Treasury Department are 'related to the Iranian government's human rights abuses, its support of terrorism and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.' 'This is the first time a UAV has been fired upon by an Iranian aircraft,' Little said, using the abbreviation for unmanned aerial vehicle. 'The United States has communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to do surveillance flights over international waters over the Arabian Gulf.' The United States conveyed the message through Swiss diplomats, who have represented U.S. interests in Tehran since Washington broke off diplomatic relations.

"Champions Bayern Munich made a winning start in the Bundesliga on Friday, beating ambitious VfL Wolfsburg 2-1 with Dutchman Arjen Robben scoring one goal and setting up the other for World Cup winner Thomas Muller. With Germany coach Joachim Low in the stands, Muller flicked in a Robben cutback in the 37th minute after the winger spectacularly shook off two defenders.

ATTENDANCE: 71,000. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola stuck to his new-look three-man defence despite a string of big name absentees and with defender Holger Badstuber making his league comeback after two cruciate ligament tears and an absence of 20 months. With the hosts pressing high up the pitch, Wolfsburg had trouble carrying the ball forward and after 20 minutes Bayern increased the tempo, twice coming close to scoring through Poland forward Robert Lewandowski. Last season's Bundesliga top scorer, who joined from Bayern's rivals Borussia Dortmund in the close season, was denied by substitute goalkeeper Max Gruen on both occasions before Muller tapped in to give the hosts the lead. It only took two minutes of the second half for Bayern to add another goal, with Robben stealing the ball from France international Josuha Guilavogui in midfield and completing the swift move himself after a one-two with Lewandowski. However, former Bayern forward Olic then silenced the 71,000 crowd with a stunning left-foot shot from 18 metres to give the 2009 champions fresh hope. Junior Malanda should have grabbed the equaliser 10 minutes from time when he raced into the box but saw his first effort deflected by keeper Manuel Neuer on to the bar before the ball then bounced off the Belgian's foot and rolled wide.

"Astronomers have found an unusual carbon-based molecule 27,000 light-years from Earth that could hint at the origins of life. The observations indicate molecules of isopropyl cyanide, a common feature in life-essential molecules like amino acids, are produced early in a star’s formation. If true it would suggest some of the building blocks of life on Earth may have originated elsewhere in space before being carried here. Researchers led by Cornell University in New York have found evidence for the origins of life in a star-forming region of interstellar space called Sagittarius B2 (shown). They found molecules of isopropyl cyanide near the centre of the Milky Way. This complex molecule is a common feature in other life-essential molecules . The discovery was made by astronomers from Cornell University, the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and the University of Cologne in Germany. They found hints of the molecule in the form of emitted radio waves in a giant gas cloud known as Sagittarius B2 in interstellar space using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma) in Chile’s Atacama Desert. Sagittarius B2 is a star forming region about 390 light-years from the centre of the Milky Way. The search for molecules in interstellar space began in the 1960's, and around 180 different molecular species have been discovered so far. Each type of molecule emits light at particular wavelengths, in its own characteristic pattern, or spectrum, acting like a fingerprint that allows it to be detected in space using radio telescopes. Until now, the organic molecules discovered in star-forming regions have shared one major structural characteristic: they each consist of a 'backbone' of carbon atoms that are arranged in a single and more or less straight chain. The new molecule discovered by the team, isopropyl cyanide, is unique in that its underlying carbon structure branches off in a separate strand. 'This is the first ever interstellar detection of a molecule with a branched carbon backbone,' says Dr Holger Müller, a spectroscopist at the University of Cologne. Source: phys.org . Organic molecules usually found in these star-forming regions consist of a single ‘backbone’ of carbon atoms arranged in a straight chain. But the carbon structure of isopropyl cyanide is more complex, making it the first interstellar detection of such a complex organic molecule, says Dr Rob Garrod, Cornell senior research associate at the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research. This detection opens a new frontier in the complexity of molecules that can be formed in interstellar space and that might ultimately find their way to the surfaces of planets. It lends weight to the idea that biologically crucial molecules like amino acids that are commonly found in meteorites are produced early in the process of star formation - even before planets such as Earth are formed. The scientists sought to examine the chemical makeup of Sagittarius B2, a region close to the Milky Way’s galactic center and an area rich in complex interstellar organic molecules. With Alma, the group conducted a full spectral survey - looking for fingerprints of new interstellar molecules - with sensitivity and resolution ten times greater than previous surveys. And in so doing they stumbled across this complex molecule that may hint at the origins of life. The discovery was made by astronomers from Cornell University, the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and the University of Cologne in Germany.They found hints of the molecule in the form of emitted radio waves in a giant gas cloud known as Sagittarius B2 in interstellar space using Alma (shown) in Chile’s Atacama Desert . Its discovery suggests that some of the building blocks of life may form in such star-forming regions. This would mean the molecules are brought to Earth through some process, perhaps by meteorites, and formed even before our planet started to take shape . The purpose of the Alma Observatory is to search for cosmic origins through an array of 66 sensitive radio antennas from the high elevation and dry air of northern Chile’s Atacama Desert. The array of radio telescopes works together to form a gigantic 'eye' peering into the cosmos. 'Understanding the production of organic material at the early stages of star formation is critical to piecing together the gradual progression from simple molecules to potentially life-bearing chemistry,' said Dr Belloche of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, the lead author of the latest research. About 50 individual features for isopropyl cyanide  were identified in the Alma spectrum of the Sagittarius B2 region. Isopropyl cyanide along with another molecule found called normal-propyl cyanide are also the largest molecules yet detected in any star-forming region.","Researchers led by Cornell University in New York have found evidence for the origins of life in a star-forming region of interstellar space .

"The graffiti artist, who will net $200 million in the Facebook IPO, says he was offered oral sex every day for the rest of his life, in exchange for a $2 million slice of his new wealth. David Choe gambled on stock, turning down cash, when he painted the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto back in 2005, a decision that will make him an overnight millionaire when the company makes their initial public offering later this spring. The 35-year-old took a considerable risk when he turned down $60,000 cash for a social networking website that he regarded as a pale imitation of MySpace. Scroll down for video . Risk taker: David Choe gambled on stock, turning down cash, when he painted the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto back in 2005 . But while most of us would be ecstatic to find ourselves a millionaire 200 times over, the art school drop out says he hates his new found fame and fortune, as it means that ‘more people will bother him’, Good Morning America reported. Choe said he was at home in bed when he first realised he'd been outed alongside around 1,000 Facebook employees who will become millionaires after the blockbuster $5 billion flotation. He said: ‘ I got a text from a woman I hadn’t spoken to in five years and she offered me oral sex every day for the rest of my life for $2 million.' 'Just out of the blue. It was out of nowhere and I was like 'What the hell is happening?’' The anguished artist places more value on his privacy than the money. He explained: 'I cannot buy my privacy back. Every news organisation in the world is beating down the door trying to get an interview and I'm like 'Oh my God'. Graffiti artist: David Choe was asked to paint the Facebook offices in Palo Alto, California, in 2005, and was offered the choice of being paid a few thousand cash or the equivalent in shares . Geniuses: Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Sean Parker are pictured in front of the graffiti by Mr Choe at Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, in May 2005 . Many of Facebook's employees have made bucket . lists with elaborate plans for going into outer space or buying property. But Choe, who served time in jail in Japan, for passing forged cheques and stealing,  says the money . won’t give him any more opportunities than he has already had. He said: 'It's going to sound horrible for me to . say money is meaningless. But everyone’s like 'What are you going to do . now that you have all this money and freedom? '' 'I did everything I wanted to do when I . had nothing. I'm still going to do whatever I want, except more people . are just going to bother me now.' Asked why he took stock he told GMA: ‘I like to party. I like to gamble' Choe, who was born in America to Korean immigrants, paints city scapes, abstract forms and lots of woman calling his art, ‘my therapy’. The self-declared misfit’s art is now in Facebook offices all over the world, he says. But it wasn't always so warmly received. Sean Parker at first called it 'schizophrenically distracting' and asked him: 'There's nothing more for you to add to it?' Outstanding graffiti: Mr Choe's work is seen here on a lift, left, and stairwell, right, of the Facebook offices . Cartoon graphics: Mr Choe's work is also on the stairs, left, and bathroom, right, of the Palo Alto headquarters . Around the building: This amazing collage, left, is accompanied by this explosive artwork in the cafeteria, right . Other work: Mr Choe also did the cover art for Jay-Z and Linkin Park's hit 2004 music album Collision Course, left, and even created a poster of President Barack Obama that reportedly hangs in the White House, right . In 2003 Choe served three months . in a Japanese prison for hitting a security guard. While inside he continued to paint, using . whatever was to hand, including his own urine and blood, he told GMA . 'I would use the soy sauce,' he said. 'And I don't want to be gross, but I would use urine and blood and all . these things, and anything that would create any kind of pigment. ... It . was the only thing that let me keep my sanity.' Now success has come his way- a portrait he painted of Obama even hangs in the White House. Choe sold some of his . stock a while ago, but will still have an estimated couple hundred million dollars after the exchange, he said. 'Don't feel sorry for me,' he told . Walters. 'This is like a godlike amount of money, where I could actually . change the world and do things to help humanity and do good things. 'As an artist, I often wonder what my purpose is or why I do what I do,"" he said. ""So those things will hopefully come into more clarity, or . maybe not. I don't know.' Choe reportedly considered the idea . of Facebook ‘ridiculous and pointless’ at the time of his painting, . reported the New York Times. Thanks: Facebook released a picture of some staff thanking users for their support ahead of its $5billion initial public offering. But some users don't think that is enough thanks and they want a cut of the money . Big money: Facebook's earliest employees and early venture capital investors will see the biggest paydays. The website's founder Mark Zuckerberg, pictured, reportedly owns a little over a fifth of the company . Many ‘advisers’ to the . company in its formative years were paid between 0.1 to 0.25 per cent of . the company, according to a former employee. This now translates into . tens and hundreds of millions. Choe, of Los Angeles, California, . recently went to the new Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park to spray . paint a wall, and can be seen in a video getting the help of founder . Mark Zuckerberg, 27. He also did the cover art for Jay-Z and Linkin Park's hit 2004 music album Collision Course and even created a poster of President Barack . Obama for the White House, the New York Times reported. Left-handed Mr Choe told Ion magazine . that he developed a 'dirty style' because his left hand would always . smudge his work as a child. The site has 845million active users, and half of them typically visit the site on any given day. While it may seem that everyone in . the English-speaking world has a Facebook account, in fact the site has . only penetrated 60 per cent of the market in the U.S. and the UK, and is . most popular in Chile, Turkey and Venezuela. Office: Facebook's headcount has swelled from 700 employees in late 2008 to more than 3,000 today. There will be more than a thousand people looking at million-dollar-plus paydays after it goes public .

"A man told yesterday how he was molested as an 11-year-old by Cyril Smith in a bedroom at the National Liberal Club. The paedophile MP took the schoolboy from his Rochdale constituency to London and introduced him to Liberal Party leader David Steel at Westminster. Hours later, 29stone Smith sexually assaulted the boy at the club which housed the party’s headquarters. Abuser: Cyril Smith with ex-Liberal leaders Jeremy Thorpe (left) and David Steel. A man has alleged he was introduced to Mr Steel by Smith after he was taken to London by the paedophile MP . Simon Danczuk, the MP who helped expose the serial abuser, said the Lib Dems can no longer resist the call for an inquiry into the scandal. He said the latest shocking revelations took it right to the heart of the Liberal Party and proved Smith was abusing boys ‘right under their noses’. The schoolboy’s sordid encounter with Smith took place in 1978 after his mother spotted a story in the Rochdale Observer newspaper. It said the MP had been invited to nominate a Rochdale boy from a one-parent family for a free place at public school. She contacted Smith and was told it was Reed’s School in Cobham, Surrey, founded in 1813 as a boarding school for children who had lost one or both parents. After visiting the family, Smith took the 11-year-old by train to the capital. Smith’s victim, who is now 47 and doesn’t want to be identified, said: ‘He sat next to me on the train. I remember he ate a massive breakfast of fried eggs and bacon.’ The victim, now 49, was taken to the National Liberal club where, upstairs, he claims he was sexually assaulted . The MP first took the schoolboy to the Houses of Parliament where he met Mr – now Lord – Steel. The victim recalls little of the meeting save for a brief introduction but said: ‘I remember telling all my friends at the time that I had met the leader of the Liberal Party – it was something to brag about.’ In the afternoon he travelled to Surrey to tour the school whose former pupils include Tim Henman and where current boarding fees range from £22,000 to £27,000 a year. On returning to London he and Smith arrived at the National Liberal Club near Parliament. The Liberal Party HQ was based in offices in the building and it also provided accommodation for members. Smith had arranged for himself and the boy to share a bedroom that night. His victim said: ‘I was sitting on the side of the bed. I had the sense at that point that I wanted to keep my vest and pants on. ‘He was kneeling down in front of me and asking me to take them off. I was slightly uneasy. Then he insisted I take my underpants off and he attempted to fondle me. I then went sort of “whoa” and raised my hands. He backed away and that was it. He stood up and moved away and I went to sleep. Nothing else happened. I think we slept in the same bed but I am not sure. I was an 11-year-old child. It felt a bit weird and then it felt like it was really wrong.’ Now a father of two, living and working in London, he added: ‘I think I was very, very lucky. It was a very close escape, I know.’ Returning home he didn’t tell his mother what had happened but says now the incident had a profound impact. He said: ‘I was a happy 11-year-old doing well at school but from the age of 11 to 25, 14 years, it was just a wasteland. I was suicidal.’ Smith was ‘disappointed’ when told the boy had decided not to take up the Reed’s School offer. The victim finally told his mother what had happened some ten years later. ‘She was mortified,’ he said. His mother added: ‘I was terribly anguished and have been since. But Smith was extraordinarily plausible.’ Her son said: ‘If my small story can encourage other people to get in touch and flesh out the real truth here and prompt a public inquiry, then so be it.’ He said he had decided against contacting the police, but added: ‘I would not be against talking to the police if necessary.’ Smith, knighted in 1988, was the MP for Rochdale for two decades from 1972 for the Liberal Party and then the Lib Dems. He died, aged 82, in 2010. 'Shocking': Simon Danczuk, who helped expose the serial abuser, said the Lib Dems cannot resist an inquiry . Mr Danczuk, Labour MP for Rochdale whose book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith was serialised in the Daily Mail, said: ‘Revelation after shocking revelation has emerged about the abuse meted out to young boys by one of their most senior MPs and yet the Lib Dems are doing absolutely nothing to inquire into it. ‘Just how long does Nick Clegg think he can resist the public demand for answers from his party? Here we have David Steel, who is in denial over Smith, being introduced to a potential victim just hours before Smith attempts to sexually molest him in the National Liberal Club – right at the heart of the party. ‘Surely senior figures at the club that night must have wondered why a young boy was sleeping in the same room as Smith.’ Lord Steel has threatened to sue the Mail over criticism of the Liberal leadership’s handling of the Smith affair. A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Cyril Smith’s acts were vile and repugnant and we have nothing but sympathy for those whose lives he ruined. His actions were not known to or condoned by the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democrats. David Steel has no recollection of this.’ If you or someone you know is trying to come to terms with the distress caused by physical, sexual or emotional abuse, or neglect in childhood, please contact The National Association for People Abused in Childhood for free support on 0800 085 3330 or visit the website: www.napac.org.uk .","29stone paedophile MP took schoolboy from Rochdale to London .

"A research team at Disney in Zurich has developed a computer program that can create 3D models from ordinary photographs. Using a specially-designed algorithm, the program analyses the light and shade areas of an image to work out the depth of certain objects. It then creates a 3D reconstruction of the scene, which can be used to create lifelike scenes for Disney films and video games, and eventually be used to make, or print, accurate models of family portraits, days out or wedding shots. Scroll down for video . A research team at Disney in Zurich has developed a computer program that can create 3D models from photographs. It uses a specially-designed algorithm to analyse the light and shade within an image, highlighted in the red boxes, to determine the depth of objects. The program can then reconstruct the scene . Multiple, high-resolution photos are taken from different viewpoints of the same scene. The Disney program scans the image and analyses the different light rays around objects to work out their respective depths within a scene. An algorithm assess this light ray data to build a 3D reconstruction. Once a photo has been scanned and reconstructed it is then rendered, bottom right. These rendered images could be used to create lifelike scenes for Disney films and video games . However, the program needs multiple photos taken from different angles, of the same scene, to create a full reconstruction. The research is published in a paper called Scene Reconstruction from High Spatio-Angular Resolution Light Fields. Its authors Changil Kim, Henning Zimmer, Yael Pritch, Alexander Sorkine-Hornung and Markus Gross explain that the software uses 'a method for scene reconstruction of complex, detailed environments from 3D light fields' using light rays to capture the 'real world in unparalleled detail'. Previous research and software has been able to capture similar details but has not been able to accurately use the data to reconstruct an accurate image. Multiple, high-resolution photos are taken from different viewpoints of the same object. The Disney program scans each individual pixel of an image to highlight specific details, such as the nuts and bolts on this truck . Others, including laser scanning techniques, traditionally produce a less accurate model and the laser-scanned scenes need to be touched up in post production. Kim and his team claim that their algorithm solves this problem because it makes 'reliable depth' predictions around the outline of objects, rather than the object itself. It does this using individual rays of light. Objects that don't have a strong contrast between light and shaded areas are processed using 'fine-to-coarse' processes that looks at each object, pixel-by-pixel, in closer detail to highlight slight light fluctuations. The authors said: 'This allows our algorithm to retain precise object contours while still ensuring smooth reconstructions in less detailed areas.' Once a photo has been scanned and reconstructed it is then rendered, bottom right. These rendered images could be used to create lifelike scenes for Disney films and video games . The algorithm can then process the light fields information on a standard computer. This method makes the reconstructions 'highly detailed' and the higher quality the images, the more accurate reconstruction. Disney Research could use the technology to build and create accurate reconstructions of scenes for its films and video games, or the models could be printed. The paper adds: 'Scene reconstruction in the form of depth maps, 3D point clouds or meshes has become increasingly important for digitizing, visualizing, and archiving the real world, in the movie and game industry as well as in architecture, archaeology, arts, and many other areas.'","Algorithm analyses the depth of objects in an image using light rays .

"Glenn Beck says he was crippled by excrutiating pain from a mystery ailment he has battled for years . Conservative TV and radio host Glenn Beck has revealed he has been battling a serious illness for years. Beck, 50, says he was crippled by excruciating pain from a mystery ailment that he has been battling for years. Speaking on TheBlaze, a media network he set up, he said: 'While I was at Fox, the pain would get so bad that my camera crew, our executive producer Tiffany and I, had worked out hand signals so they would know when to take the camera off of me. 'We didn’t know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands and feet, or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them, set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them.' On top of this, he had memory problems, vocal paralysis and eyesight trouble. He went from medical expert to medical expert but his symptoms confounded them all. 'Most afternoons my hands would start to shake, or my hands and feet began to curl and eventually - if I didn't stop and rest, I began to curl into a foetal position,' Beck said. 'This has baffled some of the best doctors in the world. 'It has frightened me and my family, and I didn't know what was happening.' He described how his wife Tania had to tie his shoes and button his shirts because the seizures became so bad. Medics told him he had just a decade before he would become unable to function. His health issues were among the reasons he decided to move to Dallas from New York for its warmer climate.

"Film shows three men tying up blood-spattered man before whipping him with cables and . touching him on his skin with electric wires . A terrified Libyan man is beaten and tortured with electric shocks by youths who appear to be former revolutionary fighters. The images, taken from a video handed to The Mail on Sunday in a Tripoli refugee camp, will be seen as fresh evidence that those who deposed Colonel Gaddafi with the help of the West are adopting methods as brutal as the dead tyrant’s. The film shows three men tying up the blood-spattered man before whipping him repeatedly with cables, touching him on his skin with electric wires and taunting him as he pleads for mercy. The man being whipped with cables on the video was Saleh Barhoun Gersh,  who had run a general store in Towerga - which was loyal to Gaddafi during the conflict until the town was ransacked by fighters from nearby Misrata. When the rebels arrived, Mr Gersh was so frightened he wore women's clothes to disguise himself . The film shows three men tying up the blood-spattered man before whipping him repeatedly with cables, touching him on his skin with electric wires and taunting him as he pleads for mercy . The men, one of whom is wearing combat trousers and is armed with a knife, tell the man that 'blood will come from your eyes and nose until you admit what you have done' The men, one of whom is wearing combat trousers and is armed with a knife, tell the man that ‘blood will come from your eyes and nose until you admit what you have done’. The new video images  follow growing protests about abuse and torture in parts of the country. Doctors from the aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) have pulled out after refusing to deal with the results of such  brutality in their clinics. According to sources, the youths in the video were former rebels who refused to surrender their weapons at the end of the civil war in October – and are intent on revenge on those they suspect of having supported Gaddafi. They are said to have driven in armed trucks into the al-Fellah ‘internally displaced persons’ (IDP) camp in a suburb of Tripoli, firing at crowds and searching homes until they found men on their list of ‘suspects’. Fury: Women in the refugee camp, in a suburb of Tripoli, scream at the militia . Their victim, seen on the video, was Saleh Barhoun Gersh,  who had run a general store in Towerga – which was loyal to Gaddafi during the conflict until the town was ransacked by fighters from nearby Misrata city. Before Gaddafi was killed, the rebels had been under siege from his forces for weeks in Misrata  – a port 150 miles east of Tripoli. Commander Mohamed al-Deaka said of the men carrying out the abuse: 'Yes, it happens here, but it's everywhere in Libya. We have to use force to make prisoners give answers. Our city was destroyed in the fighting. Now we want to know who carried out the destruction, who raped our women and stole our property' When some of the Misrata rebels arrived at the camp, Mr Gersh was so frightened he wore women’s clothes to disguise himself. In the film he cries out as he is whipped and is told: ‘You are from Towerga, you dog. You say you did nothing in Misrata, so why are you in disguise? We found weapons in every house in Towerga. Your hand is bleeding and we hope it is paralysed.’ The men chant as they reach for live electric wires: ‘Everyone we catch is innocent, they say. ‘Well, blood will come from your  eyes and nose until you admit what you have done. We’ve caught 60  of you so far and none of you did anything.’ It is not clear when the footage was taken or what happened to Mr Gersh. Camp manager Mohamed al-Mabruk, who handed over the  footage, said: ‘The fighters from Misrata have kept their weapons and vowed to capture everyone who supported Gaddafi. ‘They come on regular raids to our three camps in Tripoli and take anyone they want. They beat them and torture them to get them to confess to rape and murder.’ Locals said Towerga residents were known supporters of Gaddafi and are among 8,500 people believed to be held in secret camps all over the country. Mr al-Mabruk is helpless to stop the raids. He said: ‘You can do nothing against the Misrata  militias. 'We are all terrified of them. The government, the police and the army cannot stop them.’ Attacks are often filmed by the fighters for amusement to post  on YouTube. The abuse of Mr Gersh was  captured on a mobile phone left behind in the chaos of a raid.  Libya’s interim government has admitted it is largely powerless to prevent this collapse of law and order. It comes at a time when doubts are being raised about Nato’s support for the uprising. Britain spent about £300million on bombing raids to help secure the victory that ousted the Gaddafi regime four months ago. But local militias are hell-bent  on revenge against their former enemies. They also frequently clash with rival militias. Rebel fighters in Towerga, south of Misrata, which has been systematically looted and destroyed since Gaddafi's downfall . Thousands of fighters have  commandeered schools, halls  and sports centres as detention facilities for ‘suspects’ they capture from their homes or the street. The Misrata brigades are considered the most hostile, with thousands of untrained youths carrying out the aggressive interrogation. In other footage collected by the camp manager,  more than 30 armed trucks are shown on an early morning raid into the camp. Women scream that they are being attacked in their beds and that some family members are sick. ‘Is this the new revolution. Is this the justice we all fought for?’ they shout. Last month, 14 badly injured detainees were sent to Medecins Sans Frontieres doctors, three of them needing hospitalisation. Claudia Evers, Misrata co-ordinator for MSF, said: ‘The militia refused to let us take them to hospital. We’ve reported two deaths. No action has been taken and our doctors refuse to continue.’ Amnesty International has  documented thousands of cases of abuse and torture, and handed  photographs to The Mail on Sunday. Senior crisis response adviser Donatella Rovera has protested to the National Transitional Council (NTC) without success. ‘I have seen people who have been beaten with iron bars and rubber pipes, some hardly able to walk,’ she said. ‘Men are hung  by handcuffs from a door frame and attacked with electric wires.  Tasers are applied to their ears and genitals, and finger and toenails are torn out.’ She has evidence of 12 deaths. No investigations have been carried out by the authorities. ‘There is not a single case where anyone has been brought to justice,’ she said. ‘There is a total lack of accountability.’ End of a tyrant... but not the end of the bloodshed: A grab from a video taken from the mobile phone of a National Transitional Council fighter showing the demise of Gaddafi last October . At al-Huda prison centre in Misrata, Sheikh Fathy Daraz heads an Islamic charity for inmates’ welfare. But he is at the mercy  of the militia, who regularly take men away for questioning. ‘We see their bruises and their broken limbs when they return but we can do nothing,’ he said. ‘There is no effective police force or national army yet.’ Nearby at the city’s al-Head sports centre, the tennis courts and gym were deserted. A group of 25 brigades have taken over. Commander Mohamed al-Deaka is a former construction engineer. He was defensive about abuse  by his men. ‘Yes it happens here, but it’s everywhere in Libya,’ he said. ‘We have to use force to make prisoners give answers. Our city was destroyed in the fighting. Now we want to know who carried out the destruction, who raped our women and stole our property.’ Khaled Ben Ali, head of LibAid, an umbrella organisation for humanitarian agencies, said that NTC ministers told him they were powerless: ‘The Prime Minister told me he had issued written orders for the surrender of weapons and the militias tore them up. ‘They fought for freedom and now they think they are free to do what they like. What they like is revenge. There is no effective judicial system. Maybe we need the UN Security Council to find new ways of protecting our civilians.’ A government source said: ‘This is the result of our legacy from Gaddafi – brutalised people enacting revenge. But it must stop.’","Film shows three men tying up blood-spattered man before whipping him with cables and .

"She's fashion's most famous editor with 25 years at style bible Vogue under her belt so it's hardly surprising that Anna Wintour OBE will receive the Outstanding Achievement Award at the 2014 British Fashion Awards. The iconic editor-in-chief of American Vogue and artistic director of Condé Nast will be honoured during the ceremony at the London Coliseum, on December 1, for her tremendous contribution to the fashion industry. So who is the woman behind the black sunglasses, pageboy bob and frosty demeanour? A stellar businesswoman, that's who. Scroll down for video . Honour: Anna Wintour will be honoured during the ceremony at the London Coliseum, on December 1, for her tremendous contribution to the fashion industry . Anna, now 65, is the daughter of Charles Wintour, the famed then-editor of the London Evening Standard newspaper nicknamed 'Chilly Charlie', and philanthropist Elinor Wintour. Clearly keen for independence, Anna dropped out of her pretentious finishing school and moved to London where her  career began at Harpers & Queen magazine in London in 1970. In 1983 she joined Condé Nast as creative director of American Vogue and in 1986 returned to England to become editor in chief of British Vogue. In July 1988 she rejoined American Vogue in her current position. In March 2013, Ms. Wintour was named the artistic director of Condé Nast. Speaking about her hopes for the glossy fashion bible she's made her own, Anna told the Telegraph at the time: 'I want Vogue to be pacy, sharp, and sexy, I'm not interested in the super-rich or infinitely leisured. 'I want our readers to be energetic, executive women, with money of their own and a wide range of interests. 'There is a new kind of woman out there. She's interested in business and money. She doesn't have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.' Mother and mentor: Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Magazine Anna Wintour and her daughter Bee Shaffer attend The Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit: A Tribute to Tilda Swinton reception . Friends in high places: Anna sat front row at Victoria Beckham's show with David and Brooklyn, left, and, right, with the designer she has long supported . She did just that. Garnering enough financial backing to revitalise the magazine (which was losing out in the figures to Elle), she restored it to glory. She spearheaded using celebrities on her covers and mixing up designer and high street fashion. The September 2004 edition, under her editorship, had 832 pages, which is the most ever for a monthly magazine. She is also responsible for founding the careers of esteemed designers such as Marc Jacobs and Alexander McQueen. She is also hugely charitable and uses her name for the good. She has been actively involved in fundraising, particularly for AIDS research and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Fashion friends: Anna mingles regularly with the likes of Chanel maestro Karl Lagerfeld, left, and Rolling Stones heartthrob Mick Jagger, right . In 1990, she played a strategic role in developing the fashion industry’s AIDS charity, the CFDA/Vogue initiative through which she helped raise over $20m (£12.6m). From 1995 to the present, Ms. Wintour has co-chaired sixteen fund-raising galas which together have raised nearly $130m (£82m) for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. In 2003, Ms. Wintour directed the establishment of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, an unprecedented initiative and award designed to aid emerging American fashion designers struggling to build successful businesses in the wake of 9/11. Pride of place: We are most accustomed to seeing Anna on the front row of the best fashion shows with her sunglasses on and a straight face . Vintage: Anna dropped out of her pretentious finishing school and moved to London where her career began at Harpers & Queen magazine in London in 1970 . TV star: In 2000 she starred in Boss Women - a documentary profile which offered compelling portraits of Britain's most powerful women . In September 2009, in response to the devastating consequences of the economic downturn, she developed Fashion’s Night Out, a global initiative designed to promote the retail industry, restore consumer confidence and celebrate fashion. In 2014, she spearheaded the fashion industry’s involvement in Born Free Africa, an organisation aiming to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV by the end of 2015, using funds from a dedicated clothing line comprised of pieces by world-renowned fashion designers who are also mothers. She has since involved Victoria Beckham in the charity. Wintour, who is famously good pals with Roger Federer and starts each day with a game of tennis, has also thrown herself into politics. In February 2012, she co-hosted a fundraising event for President Barack Obama with actress Scarlett Johansson. As for her personal life, she divorced David Shaffer, with whom she has two children with, and now resides in New York with long-time boyfriend, investor Shelby Bryan. The fashion world have come together to hail her success after the news was announced. Here's what they have to say... Christopher Bailey MBE, Burberry Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, said: 'Anna gives an extraordinary amount of her time nurturing and supporting creative talent around the world whether they are emerging or established names, part of fashion, literature, theatre, film, politics, sport or philanthropy. 'Her contribution to all of our global industries is a testament to both her passion, and her innate generosity. On a personal level it has also been a tremendous honour to have had her support, guidance and friendship throughout the many years that I have known her and I'm delighted that we are celebrating her at the British Fashion Awards in London.' Christopher Kane: 'Anna Wintour is awe-inspiring; her dedication and passion to the fashion industry, her work ethic, and her unwavering support of young talent are truly unique. I owe so much to Anna for believing in me since the very beginning; without her loyal support and friendship over the past 10 years I would not be where I am today.' Sarah Burton OBE, Creative Director of Alexander McQueen: 'Anna has such an influential hand in fashion, she cares about, and pioneers creativity. Her love and contribution to British fashion is truly outstanding and I am ever grateful for all the support she has given me.'

"Being placed in a position of abject fear is an unlikely choice to de-stress. But one Indonesian centre is now offering snake massages, which they claim help alleviate stress by taking your mind off other day-to-day worries. While clearly not for everyone, the staff at Jakarta's Bali Heritage Reflexology and Spa may have a point. Scroll down for video . Feeling relaxed? People feeling stressed in Jakarta, Indonesia, may be tempted to try this new treatment - snake massages in a Balinese-style spa . The unique form of massage involves pythons being placed on the customer's bare back . The Jakarta spa claims that the fear of feeling moving snakes is said to help alleviate stress by releasing adrenaline . Lying rigid and motionless as several pythons of all shapes, colours and sizes are writhe across your bare back, is quite likely to divert your mind from any concerns to the present moment. But the science behind the 'relaxation' theory goes against their claims. The centre says the movement of the snakes and the adrenaline triggered by fear is said to have a positive impact on the customer's metabolism. However, adrenaline is released when someone is stressed and it has several effects on the body which relaxing spa treatments aim to counter. The snake spa says the movement of the reptiles and the adrenaline triggered by fear is said to have a 'positive impact' on the customer's metabolism . While being rigid with fear is likely to take your mind off daily woes, clients may need a traditional massage afterwards to recover . The novel treatment may appeal to snake lovers however, who genuinely enjoy the reptiles' writhing feeling . When faced with a stressful situation, such as being covered in snakes, the body releases the hormone adrenaline, among other chemicals, which increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. So a 'therapy' that aims to have this effect will only serve to make you feel more wired and on edge as opposed to less relaxed - assuming clients are not accustomed to touching snakes. There is a chance that after being frozen in fear with muscles tensed for up to an hour, that customers may need a full body massage afterwards, to need out some new knots. Bizarre: Releasing adrenaline makes people feel on edge as opposed to relaxed, and for most people, touching snakes is likely to have this effect . The spa offers numerous treatments including the snake massage with three pythons . The new treatment has caused quite a stir in the spa . But for those who have a love of snakes, and feel comfortable in their company, perhaps feeling them slither across your bare body might be genuinely relaxing. Either way, it's an interesting, if not slightly bizarre, idea and appears to be attracting some inquisitive clients.","Jakarta spa offering a 'massage' with slithering pythons placed on your back .

"With Christmas around the corner, many chefs might be wondering how to add the wow-factor to their roasts. They might want to consider an elaborate recipe made by Tudor chefs, who crafted monstrous roasts by stitching pigs and chickens together to make a truly memorable meal. Tudor chefs came up with the idea of the ‘cockenthrice,’ which can take the form a pig’s upper body sewn onto the lower body of a turkey – including the bird’s long legs. Scroll down for recipe . Tudor chefs came up with the idea of the 'cockenthrice,' which can be a pig's upper body sewn onto the lower body of a turkey - including the bird's long legs, as is pictured here. The dish has been recreated by an experimental historian . Originally created in the 15th Century, the recipe was revived in later years with a mixture of animals and has been recently recreated by one experimental historian, The Atlantic reported. Richard Fitch, the project coordinator for the historic kitchens at Hampton Court Palace, Greater London, which regularly served extravagant meals to king Henry VIII, recreates meals described in historic cookery books and writes about them for his blog. He made the cockenthrice based upon an old recipe that instructs a cook to boil and drain the animals before slicing them in half at the waist and sewing them together so that the pig’s upper body is on the chicken’s lower body and vice versa. How to make cockenthrice based on a 15th century recipe . The recipe then demands that the chef stuff the creature as he would a pig and then ‘putte hem on a spete, and Roste hym’ which means roasting the meat on a spit over an open fire. Just before the creation is ready, the recipe says to brush egg yolk mixed with a little saffron, ginger and the juice of parsley over the meat so that it goes golden. The recipe suggests the chef should ‘erue it forth for a ryal mete’ or serve it quickly for a royal meat option. While the dishes were designed to be culinary show-stoppers, they were by no means the most complex Tudor dishes for raucous dinner parties. Some were designed to be the entertainment as well as the main course and one, called Rôti Sans Pareil was an intricate version of Turducken, which is a a duck stuffed inside a chicken stuffed inside a turkey. Richard Fitch made the cockenthrice based upon an old recipe that instructs a cook to boil and drain the animals before slicing them in half at the waist and sew them together so that the pig's upper body is on the chicken's lower body and vice versa, as seen in this picture . It was created by stuffing 17 birds into one another like Russian dolls, ranging from the smallest at the centre of the dish – the Warbler – to the largest – a Giant Bustard. Historians believe the cockenthrice might have been inspired by explorers’ trips to the Americas and the tales of strange animals which lived there. They also suggested that the Tudors’ love of classical civilisations with their many hybrid animals and monsters, might have provided inspiration. For anyone contemplating cooking up a feast fit for a Tudor king this Christmas, historical chefs at Hampton Court Palace are offering live cookery demonstrations in the palace's vast old kitchen. Heston Blumenthal has also recreated the dish as part of his television series, Heston's Feasts .","Originally cooked in the 15th Century, .

"Lost artworks by a British soldier have revealed the lighter side of life in a notoriously grim Japanese Prisoner of War camp. Lance bombardier Des Bettany, from Burnley, Lancashire, was trapped at Changi Prison in Singapore for three years, where he painted comrades working, bickering and singing in the bath to keep up morale. He  fashioned a paintbrush out of human hair and bamboo cane, used coloured soil mixed with rice water for paint and scraps of toilet paper were turned into a canvas. But he hid his experiences from his family and they only discovered them after he died, when his son Keith unearthed dozens of paintings hidden in a wardrobe. Keeping up morale: Lance bombardier Des Bettany is thought to have painted hundreds of scenes from Changi Prison in Singapore, where he spent three years - including realistic scenes which irked soldiers day-to-day. In this painting, fellow inmates are infuriated as the stinking feet of a soldier attract some unwanted attention . Light-hearted: Senior officers were regular figures of fun, from Captain Ronald Horner who organised the camp's theatre productions rehearsing in the bath to camp policeman Lt Alec Dann acting as 'genie of the lamp'. His son Keith issued an appeal after finding dozens of his works hidden in the back of a wardrobe . Serious: One painting showed the famous Selarang Square incident, where thousands of PoWs stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape . The 62-year-old issued an appeal to former inmates of the prison, which held 3,000 PoWs - more than 800 of whom died - and was close to the Selarang Barracks which held another 50,000. Through the website he established in honour of his father's legacy, he recovered 58 of the paintings which had survived years of detention and seven more decades in the free world. He believes there are hundreds more of the images which Bettany gave for free to fellow inmates, ranging from poignant depictions of actual scenes to rib-tickling fantasies. His satirical work poked fun at his Japanese captors and made light of the grim existence the men faced at the notorious jail. One painting shows a sleeping prisoner whose stinking feet attract mosquitoes to the consternation of his fellow inmates. Everyday life: Camp policeman Lt Alec Dann confiscates a fellow PoW's saucepan (left) and Sgt Wilfred Sowter queues for the toilet with leaves as loo roll (right) Realistic: The images including Cptn Ronald Horner with a camp dog (above) were remarkable considering the brush was fashioned out of an old toothbrush and cane . Hoard: The images ranged from funny to serious, with Lt Dann confiscating an avalanche of watches (left) and Sgt Wilfred Sowter pulling a work trailer by hand (right) In another, the granddaughter of Sergeant Wilf Sowter uncovered a caricature painting of him waiting for a lavatory to become available while holding two tree leaves as toilet roll. Another image shows camp policeman Lieutenant Alec Dann confiscating a PoW's frying pan, as rules stated that any cooking had to be shared to stop individuals cooking just for themselves. The work was found by his granddaughter Sabrina Smith. Serious scenes are depicted too. One painting showed the famous Selarang Square incident, where thousands of PoWs stood for five days after refusing to sign a pledge not to escape. His works also showed soldiers mining and processing laterite, a soil rich in iron which took back-breaking labour. The artist's son said: 'We have been incredibly moved to find that so much of dad's work has been kept by the men he served alongside and their families. 'Every time I look at my emails I get excited because often it is news of another one of dad's missing images. Optimistic: The back-breaking task of mining and hand-grinding laterite was depicted in an almost cartoonish fashion to keep up morale. Hundreds died in the prison .

A hapless Pow mixes up repairing spectacles and manufacturing corks for hospitals (left) while two PoWs struggle to repair shoes (right) 'It is very heartwarming that his work is still being discovered. I guess this is his legacy that is coming to light all these years later.' Bettany was a Dunkirk veteran who then fought in Singapore, which was captured by the Japanese in 1942. After the war he married his wife Irene and they had three children, Graham, Keith and Ruth. The family emigrated to Australia in 1958 and Des worked at the South Australian School of Art in Adelaide. He died aged 81 in 2000 and Irene died in 2003 aged 88. Keith, who now lives in Adelaide, Australia, said: 'We don't know how many paintings he gave away. His political cartoons of the Japanese were seized and he gave away complete sketch books as well as single paintings. 'I would estimate that he would have done at least a further 300 paintings if not more.

Interestingly, the only time after the war that he drew cartoons were on his home made birthday cards, anniversary cards, Christmas cards to us children and grandchildren. 'When he passed away we found a stack of completed canvases, unframed about one foot to two feet high. 'Since the website has been going we have had 58 images returned.

"One 5-year-old girl from Dickisnson, Texas who has a rare form of terminal cancer got her dream come true on Wednesday when friends and family organized a princess parade. Claire Lankford has always wanted to be a princess but unfortunately she's been fighting an incurable cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma since she was 3-years-old. On Wednesday, the girl's family dressed her in a pale yellow dress like Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast' and they organized for her to ride in a horse drawn carriage around the neighborhood. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 5-year-old Claire Lankford dressed as her favorite princess Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast' Hundreds of Claire's neighbors came to support her during the princess parade . The girl's mother, Patricia Lankford is the principal at Hughes Road Elementary School in Dickinson, Texas. She told station KHSB about the difficulties her young daughter has had to face. 'She went through 42 weeks of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiation on her chest and six weeks of radiation on her spine,' said Claire's mother. 'Throughout her treatments she did not have her hair, her eyebrows or eyelashes but she was a source of joy for the doctors and nurses. She would walk around the hospital saying, ""Good evening, good afternoon.""' 'She walked the hallways receiving chemo and at the same time spreading joy,' said Patricia. Last month, Claire's cancer jumped to the final stages as doctors found five tumors on her lungs and on her lymph nodes. Young and old came out to support Princess Claire on Wednesday . Claire's cancer became more serious last month when doctors discovered five tumors on her lungs and lymph nodes . Now, Claire's family's main concern is that their daughter feel loved. Hundreds gathered for the princess parade on Wednesday and neighbors carried signs and tossed flowers. 'We just want her to know she is loved. I think that's what anyone would want to know in their lifetime,' said Claire's father Kevin Lankford. 'You take one day at a time and you remain thankful for each day you have. That's my message to everyone be thankful for your family members because life can change in a heartbeat,' said Claire's dad, Kevin Lankford to My Fox Houston. Even though Claire doesn't have much time left, she is making the most of the time that she does have. A local bridal shop helped to transform Claire into the beautiful princess she is on the inside.

"British and American forces landed Wednesday on Iraq's Mount Sinjar, but plans to airlift as many as 30,000 starving and dying Yazidi refugees thought to be stranded there are not likely moving forward. That's because most of the people are no longer there. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement that 'there are far fewer Yazidis on Mt. Sinjar than previously feared, in part because of humanitarian air drops [and] air strikes on [ISIS] targets.' Also helpful, he said, were 'the efforts of the Peshmerga and the ability of thousands of Yazidis to evacuate from the mountain.'

He insisted, though, that the deployment of . troops to aid in the rescue of refugees would be 'different than . reintroducing U.S. forces in a combat role.'

"Humans may recognise it as the spooky soundtrack of many a classic horror film. But to its fellow creatures, a wolf’s howl is a more distinctive sound.

The findings will give conservationists an accurate way of tracking the creatures which play an essential role in the food chain but can be a pest to farmers. Current techniques either cannot be used year-round or are expensive or labour-intensive – one involves producing imitation howls at night and estimating the number of animals in a pack based on the number of responses. Not surprisingly, this can lead to mis-counts. But now Nottingham Trent University scientists have created a computer programme that analyses the volume and pitch of a howl to identify its owner. Tested on 67 recordings of ten wild wolves, it was correct 100 per cent of the time. It also accurately recognised individual calls from a chorus. Previous programmes were wrong one time in four.

"Dr Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St. Paul's, said it is 'ridiculous' that George Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, used his Easter message to continue a 'peculiar obsession with gay sex' From my parish next to the Elephant and Castle in South London, you can just about make out the top of the Palace of Westminster over the Sixties council flats. As the crow flies, it is just a couple of miles away. But the people who live round here do not feel close to the sources of power or have much trust that it works on their behalf. Likewise, from here you can see the skyscrapers of the City of London. But again, it is another world. Commuters know my parish as a route to somewhere else. Every day, many thousands drive around the notorious roundabout or rumble through on the Underground’s Northern line, which goes directly under the vicarage. They often don’t give much thought to those stuck in bedsits or struggling to bring up children with no work. To be poor is to feel desperately ignored. As if your voice cannot ever be heard. Easter, of course, is a time of hope. But hope is not exactly the same as optimism – at least not the sort of cheap optimism we get from our politicians, who are inevitably slaves to the electoral cycle and want to talk up every policy intervention as if it were going to change the world. The Church, however, is not looking to get elected. And when we speak of hope it is not because we believe things are going to get better in the next six months. Hope is simply the belief that there is no darkness that cannot be overcome. That at the heart of the universe there is something so fundamentally good and kind that it can absorb all disasters – even crucifixion. Hope, then, is the defiance of love, . defiance against what can feel like a bleak reality. It is built on the . promise that love is stronger than death. And because of this, there is . nothing of which we need to be afraid. Not fundamentally. This . is the good news of Easter – which is why it’s so ridiculous that . former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey has used his own Easter . message to continue his peculiar obsession with gay sex. It . is hardly earth-shattering good news if we reduce the Resurrection of . Jesus Christ to some narrow moralism that seeks to police how people . love each other. Referring to Dr George Carey's comments as 'narrow moralism', Dr Fraser said we should not 'seek to police how people love each other' In his attack on David Cameron, Lord Carey accused the Prime Minister of doing more than any recent political leader to feed the anxieties of those Christians who feel part of ‘a persecuted minority’. To speak of Christians being persecuted in this country is an insult to those people in places such as Iran and Pakistan who really are. But if the Resurrection that Christians celebrate on this day is all about some ultimate promise that all will be well, it is not an easy promise to live by. The new Pope has recently insisted that the Church has to make itself poor. This is not simply out of solidarity with those on the margins. Still less is it political, though it may have political consequences. Over the centuries, the Church has done too much  to glamorise poverty when it is right and proper that we ought to be helping people find a route out of it. Nevertheless, there is a wisdom that comes with being poor. Or rather, there is something the poor just cannot avoid that the wealthy find it easier to hide from – that we are all vulnerable, dependent creatures. In his attack on David Cameron, Lord Carey accused the Prime Minister of doing more than any recent political leader to feed the anxieties of those Christians who feel part of 'a persecuted minority' The problem with having lots  of money is that it can fool us into believing we are ultimately self-sufficient. Money can become life’s artificial protection mechanism against the fact that we are all going to die. It doesn’t matter what designer clothes we wear. Or what fancy restaurants we eat in. Or whether we live in a penthouse and earn squillions in the City. We are all subject to the same basic logic that human existence is limited. From the perspective of eternity, the short-term optimism of politicians is a trifle, and matters relatively little. The Church has in mind a bigger picture when is speaks of hope. So, for instance, when Julian of Norwich famously insisted that ‘all will be well, all manner of things will be well’ she was surrounded by people struck down by the Black Death. It wasn’t any sort of optimism that made her say this. It was something so much more basic, so much more elemental. The poor get this. They have no illusion of self-sufficiency and so have a natural empathy with the idea that ultimate security comes from outside of ourselves. Over this bitter winter, we opened up our church as a night shelter for the homeless, something that is dramatically on the rise again. Makeshift beds were set up between the pews and around the font. The people who came to the church were a mixture and there was no obvious common feature. But they were all desperate, one way or another. And they all knew they needed help. That’s the thing the poor know that the rich sometimes don’t –that we all need help. Early this morning, just before dawn, I will bring into church a lighted candle, symbolising the new light of the Resurrection and its ability to triumph over the darkness. One of the fears I always have is that a random gust of wind will blow the candle out and that the whole symbolism of light defeating darkness will be lost. But there is symbolism in this fear, too. The flame of the candle seems such a fragile thing when set against the problems of the world. Can the faith that I have in the ultimate goodness of things really take on the challenges of our society? What is this little flame against the drug needles that I have to clear up outside the church most weeks? What is this little flame against the stabbings and the gangs and the loneliness? But from this flame, we light all the candles in the church. And suddenly the place is full of light. And then we will sing about thanksgiving and hope. There is nothing naive about all of this. It is not a belief that we can magic away the social problems that exist in this part  of London. I have little doubt the same problems will be just as much in evidence next Easter. I am not really much of an optimist. But I know for sure that the needles will not have the last word. The Resurrection is not something you believe as some simple intellectual proposition. That’s pretty difficult, for obvious reasons. But it is something you live your life by. It is the compass that always points towards the rising of the new dawn. And those of us who set our course by this compass will not be deterred by the depressing state of the economy or its consequences. Our hope is given from elsewhere. Yes, this can be scary and precarious. The source of our hope is not in our power to direct or even fully to understand. But if this is a form of foolishness, the deeper foolishness is to believe that we can escape from the dependency on things that are outside of our control. In reality, none of us can do this.","Dr Giles Fraser said George Carey's attack on Prime Minister was 'ridiculous'

"A police inquiry has been launched into the deaths of a number of patients who were treated by colorectal surgeon Sudip Sarker (pictured) Police are investigating the deaths of at least three NHS patients operated on by a cancer surgeon. Sudip Sarker, 44, had double the death rate of other doctors while working as a consultant general surgeon at Worcester Royal Hospital and the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch. One in five of his patients had to be readmitted after procedures he carried out, according to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). He was referred to the RCS in July 2012 after colleagues raised concerns about his work as  a colon and bowel keyhole  surgery specialist. But while he was being investigated he was still allowed to continue operating for several months on patients – all unaware of concerns over his performance – until he was eventually suspended in October the same year. He remains excluded from his post in Worcestershire, which he had held since August 2011, while the General Medical Council has placed restrictions on his licence to practise surgery. But a hotline for patients and families was opened only last June by Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. A coroner was due to hold a joint inquest in the deaths of three of his patients, William Jones, 84, Daphne Taylor, 81, and Jean Thomas, 80, who died in 2012 after being operated on by Mr Sarker. The inquest has now been adjourned pending the investigation by West Mercia Police. Mr Sarker worked at Alexandra Hospital in Redditch as well as the Worcester Royal Hospital (pictured) Superintendent Kevin Purcell said the West Mercia force was liaising with key partner agencies after receiving a letter raising concerns in December 2013 . It is also feared it may be widened to . look at ‘a small number’ of other patient deaths. Superintendent Kevin . Purcell said the investigation began after police received a letter in . December last year. He . said: ‘We were made aware that there were a number of concerns in . relation to the deaths of patients in 2012 who had been under Mr . Sarker’s care. We are in the early stages of obtaining the relevant . information. ‘We cannot be . specific about numbers at this time but can confirm the deaths of three . patients whose joint inquest was adjourned in December 2013 form part of . this inquiry. ‘The families of those people have been informed.’ The .

"More than a million people watched a video of a couple 'having sex' on Charlton Athletic's football pitch before it was revealed as a publicity stunt. The footage was uploaded to a Vine account yesterday afternoon and appeared to show a mystery couple in the middle of the club's grounds - The Valley - in south east London. The clip was captioned by user Showboat Vines as 'Someone broke into The Valley (home of Charlton) and did this in the centre circle! #SextraTime'. Scroll down for video . The video of the couple allegedly 'having sex' at the home ground of Charlton Athletic in south east London has gone viral - but it turned out to be a publicity stunt for the club . Stunt: A full version of the video has been released - and it was not shot on Tuesday after all . But after initially denying knowledge of the video, Charlton Athletic has now confessed it was a publicity stunt for a scheme allowing grassroots footballers to score - for real - at the club's ground. The vine clip was taken from a longer video which has now been uploaded to YouTube and purports to show several CCTV angles of the excited couple sneaking into the ground. The video had already prompted debate after fans of Silent Witness claimed it may have been from a deleted scene from the BBC crime drama. An episode of the crime series filmed at the stadium in January last year features a storyline about a footballer who was linked to a brutal murder of a young woman after a sex tape of him was leaked. Bleacher Report UK posted on Twitter: 'Could the ""Charlton Athletic sex tape"" actually be a scene from the TV show Silent Witness?' While Steve Harrison wrote: 'Did the BBC break a story that Charlton are investigating a couple having sex on the centre spot? Wasn't it filmed for one of their shows?' But a PR firm for Charlton - whose officials initially announced they would carry out an investigation - now admit the video was a promotional tool. Promotion: The video was all to grab attention for a scheme involving grassroots footballers . Not everyone saw the funny side. One fan of the club nicknamed the Addicks fumed: 'We are the Addicks - not the sex addicts!' It is not the first time a couple have sneaked onto a football pitch to share a moment of passion. In 2013, after a Danish Superliga match between Brondby and Randers, which ended goalless, an unknown couple sneaked onto the pitch and started having sex by the centre circle. Brøndby press officer Mikkel Davidsen reported the incident on his Twitter feed, and an image of the canoodling couple was then posted online. Further reports have also indicated that the pair's love making failed to last long as the couple were interrupted by the club's security chief, James Mickel Lauritsen, who threw them out of the stadium. Croatia international Dino Drpic and his wife Nives Celsius also had sex on the centre spot of his club's Zagreb stadium. His national team later beat England 2-0 there in a Euro 2008 qualifier. In an interview on a Serbian TV chatshow to promote her book 'The Naked Truth', Miss Celsius revealed that the couple had even arranged for friends to leave the floodlights on at the Maksimir Stadium so they could see what they were doing. Sneaking around: It also featured so-called CCTV of the couple wandering around the ground at night .

"A daredevil sailor has had his name written into the record books - after karate chopping a dozen wooden boards while skydiving from 16,000ft. Ernie Torres, a skydiving instructor who serves in the US Navy, combined his love of jumping from planes with his other hobby - he is a black belt in karate - to smash his way through 12 blocks on his descent back down to earth. Ernie jumped from such a height that he had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the free fall just so that his brain was engaged enough to pull his parachute chord. Scroll down for video: . Daredevil: Ernie Torres smashed his way into the record books by karate chopping a dozen wooden blocks during a skydive . Team effort: Fellow skydivers from Team Arizona jumped with Ernie and held up the wooden blocks for him to chop . Charitable: Ernie Torres decided to break the record to raise awareness of a US charity which helps wounded servicemen and women . He completed his unusual feat in a 70 second free fall which saw him plummet 12,000 feet. He said: 'It really was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of my life. 'As if throwing myself from an airplane and falling towards the earth at terminal velocity wasn't exciting enough, I thought I'd throw a little karate in the mix and try to smash a world record while I was at it. 'We jumped from an altitude of 16,000 feet and I would deploy my parachute at 4,000 feet, which gave me approximately 70 seconds of free fall. Nerves of steel: Even a delay due to a technical fault with the team's plane couldn't deter Ernie, who leapt from a staggering 16,000 ft to perform his stunt . Down to earth: The intrepid blackbelt, who serves in the US Navy, had to wear an oxygen mask for the initial part of the freefall to avoid developing hypoxia which could have stopped him pulling his parachute chord . 'That may seem like forever to some but it's not very long when you're trying to break a world record.' Ernie had to wear an oxygen mask because falling from such a height can cause hypoxia - a condition caused by lack of oxygen to the brain which can cause a person to become giddy and lack the sensible reasoning needed to pull the parachute chord. As well as remembering to pull the chord, Ernie had to focus long enough on a team of fellow jumpers from Skydive Arizona holding the wooden boards for him to chop. Tough task: Ernie had to fight against the force of his fall to chop the 12 wooden boards . Flying high: He is seen here smashing his way through one of the wooden boards during a 70 second freefall high above the Arizona skyline . Challenge: Ernie decided to tackle the task after watching a video of the previous record holder carrying out his stunt . Ernie added: 'The team of guys that held the board for me were amazing. 'It's the equivalent of having a team of flying Michael Jordans on the basketball court with you asking you what you want them to do.' Virginia based Ernie decided to complete the jump after watching a video of the previous record holder, actor and mixed martial artist Jason David Frank. Even a nerve-wracking hour long wait thanks to technical difficulties with the team's aircraft didn't deter Ernie and he completed the jump to raise awareness The Wounded Warrior Project, a charity which helps wounded US servicemen and women. Adventure: The intrepid servicemen said that completing the jump was one of the greatest adrenaline rushes of his life . Mission complete: He finally deployed his parachute 4,000 ft above the ground and safely completed the rest of the descent . He said: 'After watching the video of the current record holder, one thought came to mind, I can do better and use the publicity of something like this to raise awareness of what I thought was a well deserving cause - one that had personal meaning to me and many of the people I've served with in the Armed Forces over the years - The Wounded Warrior Project.' Due to technical difficulties, Ernie and his team had to switch aircraft at the last minute which resulted in Ernie having to wait a long and agonising hour before take-off.

"A South Korean soldier who killed five members of his own unit was humiliated by comrades who drew pictures of him as SpongeBob SquarePants, according to military officials . A South Korean soldier who allegedly killed five members of his own unit was humiliated by comrades who drew pictures of him as SpongeBob SquarePants, according to military officials. The soldier, surnamed Yim, was detained last month after the incident at an army unit near the border with North Korea. He fled into the forest after the rampage, but was captured following a failed suicide attempt. Brig. Gen. Seon Jong-chul, from the army police, told reporters that Yim testified that he went on the killing spree after finding drawings on the back of his unit's border patrol log depicting him as the children's cartoon and another cartoon character. According to Seon, Yim said the drawings caused him to recall previous mockery and ignoring by fellow unit members. Yim told investigators he suffered lots of stress because of the drawings, Seon said. Defense Ministry officials said military prosecutors were planning to indict Yim. A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after the shooting. When he was tracked down troops  surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father. Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender. Yim shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself and was taken to a nearby hospital . He shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself and was taken to a nearby hospital. Yim was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service in September, according to defence officials. Initial personality tests last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official said. But tests last November concluded that he had improved and could serve in the frontline area. Shooting rampages against fellow soldiers occasionally happen in South Korea, which requires all able-bodied men to serve about two years because of a persistent threat from North Korea. In 2005, a soldier tossed a grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others. He later told investigators that he was enraged at superiors who had verbally abused him. A massive manhunt was launched for Yim after the shooting in June .

"An Iraq War veteran who was one of the first to critique the conflict has died some 10 years after he was left paralyzed from the neck down while serving in the Army. Tomas Young, 34, of Seattle, Washington died Monday, the day before Veteran's Day, and the cause of death has still not been revealed. The Army veteran previously vowed to commit suicide in 2013, but later changed his mind to spend more time with family. Iraq War Army veteran Tomas Young (pictured) died Monday after an injury sustained in the conflict left him quadriplegic . Young became a outspoken critic of the Iraq War after getting severely injured just five days after arriving in the Middle Eastern nation in 2004 . On his return from Iraq, Young became the subject of 2008 documentary 'Body of War' Young enlisted in the Army two days after September 11, 2001, wanting to take vengeance against the terrorist cells in Afghanistan that helped organize the attacks. But instead he was deployed to Iraq in 2004, and just five days after arriving in the Middle Eastern country, was shot in the chest during an insurgent attack in Sadr City. That severe injury left Young paralyzed from the neck down, a quadripeligic. After his return home, Young became one of the first critics of the Iraq War and gained notoriety in 2008 as the subject of the documentary film 'Body of War' by  Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue. On Monday, Donahue told BillMoyers.com that Young was a 'bright light' and 'talented young man'. 'He was a political animal and he had a political statement that he wanted to make,' Donahue said. 'Tomas wanted people to know that this is the drama being played out in houses across the country occupied by thousands of young men and women who fought in the war.' Last year, to mark the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, Young sent a letter to former President George W Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, criticizing their motives motives behind the Iraq War. 'I write this letter, my last letter, to you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney. I write not because I think you grasp the terrible human moral consequences of your life lies, manipulation and thirst for wealth and power,' the letter read. 'I write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have done. The cause of Young's death was not immediately known. He previously planned to commit suicide by stopping his feeding tube, but later changed his mind to spend more time with his wife Claudia Cuellar (pictured together in March 2013 above) 'You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans – my fellow veterans – who’s future you stole.' That letter was supposed to be Young's last, as he vowed to stop taking his medication or feeding tube in an attempt to commit suicide. But Young later changed his mind, telling Democracy Now that he wanted to spend more time with his family. 'I want to spend as much time as possible with my wife, and no decent son wants his obituary to read that he was survived by his mother,' he said at the time. Young is survived by his wife Claudia Cuellar. Tuesday marks Veteran's Day in the U.S. Above, an American flag flies over  war veterans tombstones at Golden Gate National Cemetery on Monday .

"Emirates has suspended flights to Guinea over fears of spreading the Ebola virus. The Dubai-based carrier is the first major international airline to cancel flights due to the epidemic which has taken hold in West Africa. However, British Airways continues to operate its flight from Liberia to London Heathrow, which also stops at Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone. Emirates has suspended flights to Conakry after there was an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea . Emirates confirmed the decision to suspend flights Conakry came after there was an outbreak of the virus in Guinea. The suspension of the route follows a similar decision by Pan-African airlines Arik and ASKY, which have stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone. A spokesperson for Emirates said: 'Emirates will be suspending its service to Conakry from (Saturday) 2 August, 2014 until further notice, due to the outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea. 'We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. However the safety of our passengers and crew is of the highest priority and will not be compromised.' Liberian soldiers walk through streets to prevent panic over fears the virus could spread to city of Monrovia . British Airways also released a statement, saying: 'The safety and security of our customers and crew is always our top priority. 'We fully comply with the guidance provided by local health authorities and continue to monitor the situation closely.' The current Ebola outbreak is the largest ever recorded since the virus was first detected in 1976, with more than 1,200 cases so far. It far exceeds the next largest outbreak, involving 425 cases. Around 60 per cent of cases so far have been fatal and more than 700 people have died since the start of February. The outbreak began in Sierra Leone and has spread to Liberia, with a Liberian also dying in Lagos, Nigeria last week, after a flight from his home country. Following his death, both Arik and ASKY halted all flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Guinea's capital Conakry will not be serviced by Emirates flights until further notice . Despite fears over flights still operating into and out of West Africa - often with direct routes to London - the Foreign Office claims Border Staff have been trained to recognise symptoms. A statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) read: 'Border Force has been working closely with Public Health England and other agencies to ensure staff are prepared to deal with the threat of the Ebola virus. 'As part of this planning, guidance has been issued to front line staff on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola that makes clear what steps need to be taken should a passenger arrive at the border unwell. 'If a person is identified at the border as being a potential carrier of Ebola they will be immediately referred by a Border Force officer to a specialist medical care provider and reported to the Public Health England.' Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas is considered very low as long as they take the correct precautions. The highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes. It is recommended that travellers: . The FCO has also stopped short of restricting travel to the crisis-hit nations, simply referring travellers to the National Travel Health Network and Centre, which offers advice on how to reduce the risk of infection. For its part, the World Health Organization does not recommend any travel restrictions to Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone and confirmed there has never been a case of Ebola imported into the UK. The leader of Guinea's Ebola task force has said that moves by neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone to contain the disease that has killed 729 people this year may have the opposite effect. Liberia has put in place measures including closing all schools and some government departments as well as possibly quarantining affected communities. Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency and called in troops to isolate Ebola victims. The virus, which has gripped both Sierra Leone and Liberia (pictured) has also spread to neighbouring Guinea . 'Currently, some measures taken by our neighbours could make the fight against Ebola even harder,' said Aboubacar Sidiki Diakita . 'When children are not supervised, they can go anywhere and make the problem worse. It is part of what we will be talking about,' he said. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 57 new Ebola deaths on Thursday in the four days to July 27 in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and said the number of cases had topped 1,300. WHO director general Margaret Chan will also attend the meeting in Guinea's capital Conakry today. British Airways has confirmed it will continue to run its route to Liberia and Sierra Leone . The outbreak of the virus, for which there is no known cure, began in the forests of eastern Guinea in February, but Sierra Leone now has the highest number of cases. The haemorrhagic virus can kill up to 90 percent of those infected, though the fatality rate in this epidemic is about 60 percent. In the final stages, its symptoms include external bleeding, internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea - at which point Ebola becomes highly contagious. The jump in the number of cases and the death toll has raised international concern and placed under-resourced health facilities in the region under strain. WHO said on Thursday it would launch a $100 million response plan. The United States said it was providing material and technical support to the three countries and further assistance will be discussed at a summit meeting in Washington next week. The head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also announced plans to send an extra 50 health experts to help efforts to control the epidemic.","Emirates first major airline to suspend flights to Ebola-hit countries .

"He was the man who saved the world by single-handedly averting World War Three five decades ago, yet he died humiliated, outcast and an unknown. Only now has his story has come to light. A documentary shown tonight told how for 13 days during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the world held its breath as the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. stood on the brink of nuclear war. At the height of the Cold War, when paranoia on both sides meant the slightest provocation could spark nuclear war, four submarines secretly set sail from Russia to communist Cuba. Averted war: Vasili Arkhipoy (pictured left, and right aboard a submarine), saved the world by single-handedly averting World War Three with one decision 50 years ago, yet he died humiliated, outcast and an unknown . Only a handful of the submariners on . board knew that their ships carried nuclear weapons, each with the . strength of the bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945. Vasili Arkhipov, aboard the sub B59, . was one of them. As his craft neared Cuba, U.S. helicopters, aeroplanes . and battleships were scouring the ocean for Russian subs. 'At that period of time it was called . ""special weapon"", not ""nuclear torpedo"",’ said Viktor Mikhailov, junior . navigator on Sub B-59. ‘At that time we couldn't even imagine a nuclear . torpedo.’ In a game of high stakes cat and mouse . it wasn't long before the Russians were spotted. Arkhipov's sub was . forced to make an emergency dive. Remembered: Arkhipov is pictured left with his wife Olga in 1957, and right with his daughter Yelena, three years before he died in 1998 . Tense:  For 13 days during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the world held its breath as the USSR and the U.S. stood on the brink of nuclear war . As the submariners tried to stay . hidden from their US hunters, conditions in the sub deteriorated. For a . week they stayed underwater, in sweltering 60C heat, rationed to just . one glass of water a day. 'Basically what we were trying to do was apply passive torture. Frankly I don't think we felt any sympathy for them at all. They were the enemy' Gary Slaughter, USS Cony signalman . Above them, the U.S. navy were . 'hunting by exhaustion' - trying to force the Soviet sub to come to the . surface to recharge its batteries. They had no idea that on board the submarines were weapons capable of destroying the entire American fleet. Gary Slaughter, a signalman on board . the USS Cony battleship, said: 'We knew they were probably having . trouble breathing. It was hot as hell in there, they were miserable. Mr President: John F. Kennedy was in office in the U.S. between 1961 and 1963, at the height of the crisis . Tense: The documentary recreated the dramatic moment when Soviet sailors decided not to fire the weapon . 'They were cramped together and they . had been under great stress for a long time. Basically what we were . trying to do was apply passive torture. 'They said that the person who prevented a nuclear war was the Russian submariner Vasili Arkhipov. I was proud and I am proud of my husband always' Olga Arkipov, widow of Vasili Arkhipov . 'Frankly I don't think we felt . any sympathy for them at all. They were the enemy.' The Americans decided to ratchet up . the pressure, and dropped warning grenades into the sea. Inside the sub, . the Soviet submariners thought they were under attack. Valentin Savitsky, the captain of B59, . was convinced the nuclear war had already started. He demanded that the . submariners launch their torpedo to save some of Russia's pride. The programme on Channel 5 revealed how in . any normal circumstances Savitsky's orders would have been followed, . and World War Three would have been unleashed. 'Close friend': Ryurik Ketov, commander of Sub B-4, said Arkhipov was 'cool-headed' and 'in control' Memories: Viktor Mikhailov, junior navigator on Sub B-59, said they had a 'special weapon' on board, which was not even referred to as a 'nuclear weapon' Ryurik Ketov, commander of another sub, Sub B-4, . said: ‘Vasili Arkhipov was a submariner and a close friend of mine. He . was a family friend. He stood out for being cool-headed. He was in . control.’ 'One of the Russian admirals told the submariners: ""It would have been better if you'd gone down with your ship"". Extraordinary' Thomas Blanton, historian . Savitsky hadn't counted on . Arkhipov. As commander of the fleet, Arkhipov had the last veto. And . although his men were against him, he insisted that they must not fire - . and instead surrender. It was a humiliating move - but one . that saved the world. The Soviet submariners were forced to return to . their native Russia, where they were given the opposite of a hero's . welcome. Historian Thomas Blanton told the Sun: . 'What heroism, what duty, they fulfilled to go halfway across the world . and come back, and survive. Covert mission: In a game of high stakes cat and mouse it wasn't long before the Russian's were spotted . Proud: Arkopov's widow Olga said: 'I was proud and I am proud of my husband, always' 'But in fact, one of the Russian . admirals told the submariners; ""It would have been better if you'd gone . down with your ship."" Extraordinary.' 'Vasili Arkhipov was a submariner and a close friend of mine. He was a family friend. He stood out for being cool-headed. He was in control' Ryurik Ketov, commander of Sub B-4 . Four decades passed before the story of what . really happened on the B59 sub was discovered. It was after Arkipov . had died in 1998 from radiation poisoning. But to his widow Olga, he was . always a hero. She said: 'He knew that it was . madness to fire the nuclear torpedo.

"Shivering for 10 minutes can burn as many calories as an hour's exercise, new research suggests . Shivering with cold may be as effective as exercise at helping us stay slim, new research suggests. Both produce hormones that stimulate the creation of calorie-burning ‘brown fat’, a study has shown. Once thought only to be present in babies, scientists now know adults also possess ‘good’ brown fat - and those with more of it are slimmer. While ‘bad’ white fat stores energy, brown fat burns it up. Around 50 grams of brown fat can burn up to 300 calories per day, the same amount of energy stored by 50 grams of white fat. The new research involved exposing volunteers to increasing levels of cold until, with temperatures down to around 15C, they began to shiver. ‘We identified two hormones that are stimulated by cold - irisin and FGF21- released from shivering muscle and brown fat respectively,’ said study leader Dr Paul Lee, from Sydney’s Garvan Institute of Medical Research. ‘These hormones fired up the energy-burning rate of human brown fat cells in the laboratory, and the treated fat cells began to emit heat, a hallmark of brown fat function.’ Around 10 to 15 minutes of shivering produced as big a rise in irisin as an hour of moderate exercise, the scientists found. In the laboratory, irisin and FGF21 together transformed white fat cells into brown fat cells over a period of six days. ‘Excitement in the brown fat field has risen significantly over the last few years because its energy-burning nature makes it a potential therapeutic target against obesity and diabetes,’ said Dr Lee. ‘White fat transformation into brown fat could protect animals against diabetes, obesity and fatty liver. Glucose levels are lower in humans with more brown fat.’ The findings are reported in the latest edition of the journal Cell Metabolism. Shivering and exercising both produce hormones that stimulate the creation of calorie-burning brown fat . As part of the study, the cold-exposure volunteers were also asked to pedal an exercise cycle for an hour. The moderate level activity generated the same amount of irisin from muscles as shivering for 10 to 15 minutes. ‘From a clinical point of view, irisin and FGF21 represent a cold-stimulated hormone system, which was previously unknown, and may be harnessed in future obesity therapeutics through brown fat activation,’ said Dr Lee.","Both stimulate the creation of calorie-burning 'brown fat'

"There have been plenty of 'false dawns' when it comes to dark matter, with a 'discovery' seemingly announced every few months. But this latest announcement has understandably gripped scientists with excitement - because it might just be our first ever direct detection of the elusive particles. Researchers have spotted a type of particle believed to make up dark matter coming from the sun towards Earth - and it may indicate that dark matter is produced in the cores of stars like our own. University of Leicester scientists may have directly observed dark matter. At Earth's magnetic field they spotted a signal that could only be explained by axions - a type of dark matter particle - coming from the sun (shown in the illustration) and being converted into photons in Earth's magnetic field . The discovery was made by scientists at the University of Leicester using the XMM-Newton telescope in space. What they spotted was a signature of 'axions' coming from the sun towards Earth. The researchers observed a strange signal in the solar system - and the only explanation at the moment is that it is due to these dark matter particles. 'Axions are a type of particle whose existence was proposed to solve some problems in theoretical physics,' Dr Sembay, a co-author of the study, tells MailOnline. 'If they do exist then they could have been created in sufficient numbers during the early universe to constitute dark matter. 'However, axions are also created today in processes within our sun and other stars. 'As our sun is a locally strong source of axions this potentially provides a means of detecting them and verifying their existence. 'Ground based experiments have been built to attempt to do this very thing. They are based on the principle that axions can convert into a photon in the presence of a strong magnetic field and it is the photon which is detected by the instrumentation, not the axion itself directly. 'Our work uses a similar principle but instead of being a ground based experiment it uses data from a space based observatory, in which we have observed a signal which may come from axions converting into photons within the Earth's magnetic field.' What they spotted was a strange source of X-rays in Earth's magnetic field. Once they had ruled out other sources including other stars and galaxies, only one remained. That was that the signal was the result of axions being converted into photons as they hit the magnetic field. Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that are thought to at least partially make up dark matter. The existence of dark matter has been theorised owing to its observed gravitational effect on stars and galaxies. It is believed to make up about 85 per cent of all matter in the universe and gives the cosmos its structure. But if this result is confirmed, it would be the first ever direct detection of dark matter. The core of the sun is extremely hot and dense, and it is continually going through the nuclear fusion process. Because of the high temperatures and densities, it has a potential to create exotic particles such as axions. However, while theorised, their existence had been hard to prove. The best theory so far is that dark matter particles called axions are being converted into photons by Earth's magnetic field. It's thought these axions are being produced in the sun's core (illustration shown) where the extremely hot and dense conditions can produce exotic particles . The fascinating discovery was made by scientists at the University of Leicester using the XMM-Newton telescope in space. The team notes they will be performing repeat observations soon in the hope of confirming the potentially groundbreaking finding . The paper announcing the discovery was led by Professor George Fraser, who died in March this year. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or where to find it. In the paper he explains: 'It appears plausible that axions - dark matter particle candidates - are indeed produced in the core of the sun and do indeed convert to X-rays in the magnetic field of the Earth.' President of the Royal Astronomical Society Professor Martin Barstow, also Professor of Astrophysics and Space Science at the University, said the discovery could have 'a fundamental impact on our theories of the universe.' He adds that it is only a preliminary result for now, and follow-up observations by telescopes will be needed to confirm it. Speaking to MailOnline, he says: 'It is actually a really exciting result, potentially the first direct observational signature of dark matter. 'We do know it exists as we see it through its influence through gravity on things that surround it. 'There's been a long search for what dark matter really is in terms of particles, and this would tell you that axions are at least one kind of dark matter particle.' 'We have been looking for evidence of these particles in their effect on stars cooling or through radiation in various parts of the universe. 'So seeing something that looks like it might be a signal is an important result. Axions have never been spotted before.' The existence of dark matter has been theorised owing to its observed gravitational effect on stars and galaxies (Andromeda shown). It is believed to make up about 85 per cent of all mater in the universe and gives the cosmos its structure. But if this result is confirmed, it would be the first ever direct detection of dark matter . Dark matter is thought to permeate through the universe. This computer simulated image from the Virgo Consortium illustrates the distribution of dark matter in the universe. Its discovery would tell us more about the past, present and future of the cosmos . Exactly what axions might be is a bit more of a mystery, though. It is thought they have mass, as we know dark matter has a gravitational effect on objects. But they are likely 'some other aspect of subatomic physics' that is not yet understood, explains Professor Barstow. He also adds that it's unclear if all dark matter comes from stars. Instead, it is more likely that dark matter has a number of sources - including our sun. Dr Read, a co-author on the paper, added:  'These exciting discoveries, in George's final paper, could be truly ground-breaking, potentially opening a window to new physics, and could have huge implications, not only for our understanding of the true X-ray sky, but also for identifying the dark matter that dominates the mass content of the cosmos.' The team notes they will be performing repeat observations soon in the hope of confirming the groundbreaking finding.","University of Leicester scientists may have directly observed dark matter .

"Thirty-five years after the U.S. Olympic hockey team's stunning gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics, the once-fuzzy-faced heroes are being feted for their signature accomplishment. Every surviving member of the hockey team reunited for a 'Relive the Miracle' reunion on Saturday in preparation for a celebratory night tonight at Herb Brooks Arena, the hockey rink on Main Street they made famous with one of the most memorable upsets in sports history. Missing is Brooks, the Hall of Fame coach who was killed in a car accident in 2003, and rugged defenseman Bob Suter, who died at age 57 in September. Years later: Mike Eruzione of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team speaks during a news conference on Saturday in Lake Placid, N.Y. 35 years after the team's stunning gold medal at the  Lake Placid Winter Olympics . Miracle team: The underdog American team upset the Soviet Union and Finland to win the gold medal in 1980 . Sunday marks the 35th anniversary of when the U.S. took the lead on Friday, Febraury 22, 1980, against the powerful Soviet Union team on Mike Eruzione's goal midway through the third period. Eruzione, who works in alumni relations at Boston University, says the goal and the team's improbable gold medal have changed his life. He says he deals 'with it so often it's hard to believe it's been 35 years' because every week he's doing something or going somewhere that's associated with 1980. The Americans finished the 4-3 upset to the sound of broadcaster Al Michaels' call of, 'Do you believe in miracles?' Two days later, the U.S. beat Finland for the gold. Lake Placid News reports that 15 of the 19 surviving members of the 1980 U.S. hockey team who will be at tonight's program gave a brief press conference this afternoon in the Lake Placid Conference Center. The team paid tribute to Bob Suter, the first member of that team to pass away. Suter, a Wisconsin defenseman, died of a heart attack at age 57 in September, reports NBC. Remembering: Jerseys of Mike Eruzione, Neal Broten, Mark Johnson and Dave Silk, members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team, hang in a locker room at Herb Brooks Arena on Saturday . In celebration: Every surviving member of the hockey team is back for a reunion on Saturday at Herb Brooks Arena, the hockey rink on Main Street they made famous with one of the most memorable wins . 'He did a lot for hockey,' Eruzione said today. 'We all realize at some point we’re going to move on. But nobody thought Bobby, at 57, would not be with us,' he added. Eruzione then asked the people in the room if any were visiting Lake Placid for the first time since 1980. When no one said a word that's when Eruzione stepped back in. 'Ask the bartenders,' he said causing the room to fill with laughter. 'We are the most immature people that you will ever, ever meet,' Eruzione said . Win over Finland: The Americans finished the 4-3 upset to the sound of broadcaster Al Michaels' call of, 'Do you believe in miracles?' and two days later, the U.S. beat Finland for the gold (pictured) Miracle: Mark Wells of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team speaks during a news conference on Saturday in celebration of his team's miraculous win . Mike Eruzione, center, with other team members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team, speaks during a news conference on Saturday . 'You think we’re grown men? Not happening,' he added. 'Can you imagine that atmosphere in the locker room when we were playing?,' the jokes? Several of the players visited the locker room on Saturday morning but many of them couldn't remember where they sat 35 years ago. The locker room shown in the 2004 film 'Miracle,' with coach Herb Brooks‘ famous speech was much bigger and nicer in comparison to the small locker room. The players were asked what they were thinking before Brooks gave that speech, as they waited to crush the Soviets in an amazing game. 'It definitely wasn’t let’s go out and try not to embarrass ourselves,' said Eruzione. Celebration: Mike Eruzione of the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team cracks jokes at a press conference in Lake Placid today in celebration of the win 35 years ago . Eruzione scored the winning point in the third period, after Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak was infamously pulled by coach Viktor Tikhonov. 'The real story shouldn’t be Tretiak,' Eruzione said. 'The real story is why they scored three goals and not six or seven,' he continued. Before the press conference even began on Saturday,  team members gathered on a stage at what would normally be center ice at Herb Brooks Arena where an event will also take place tonight. The arena is formally the Olympic Fieldhouse where the 1980 Olympic games were played. 'We continue to be amazed that it has carried on and lived on in a lot of respects,' forward Dave Christian said. 'It gave people a sense of feeling good. When you think about it, you can’t help but smile.' Eruzione also piped up again talking about how the event warmed the hearts of the nation. 'When the Patriots won the Super Bowl, people in New England are happy,' Eruzione said. 'People in Seattle are not. People in California couldn’t care less. When it’s Olympic Games, it’s a nation.' Player Neal Broten, who scored 923 NHL points, the most among Miracle players, recalled the pre-Olympic game against the Soviets in Madison Square Garden in which the U.S. lost 10-3. 'We were setting them up,'Broten said. 'If you go on a scale from one to 10, we were two and they were 10,' he said while comparing the two teams. Mike Ramsey, a 19-year-old defenseman on the Miracle on Ice team, recalled soviet player Slava Fetisov discussing the Miracle on Ice when they were teammates on the Detroit Red Wings. 'You were on drugs,' Ramsey said Fetisov joked. The press conference ended with the players sharing their favorite quotations from their coach Herb Brooks. Festivities this evening which begin at 7:30 will include audio, video and still pictures, as well as a discussion of the game with the players. Suter's jersey also will be raised to the rafters as a tribute. NBC also plans to anchor its 'Hockey Day in America' coverage from Lake Placid on Sunday and feature the team. Several team members also are hosting a five-day fantasy camp beginning March 29 that so far has attracted more than 50 participants.","Thirty-five years after the U.S. Olympic hockey team's stunning gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Olympic the teammates are being honored .

"The BBC has been forced into an embarrassing climbdown over climate change claims made in Sir David Attenborough's groundbreaking Africa series. In the last episode of the series, entitled 'Future', Sir David discussed the challenges facing the region. Speaking over footage of Mount Kilimanjaro, Sir David made the . assertion that 'some parts of the continent have become 3.5C hotter in . the past 20 years'. Scroll down for video . Sir David Attenborough on the set of Africa, which has come under fire for claims made that some parts of the continent had become 3.5C hotter in the past 20 years - which were dropped from a repeat of the show . The BBC initially defended the claim, . saying it was taken from a report by Oxfam and the New Economics . Foundation. However, this report suggested the figure had come from a . report by Christian Aid. The 2006 Christian Aid Report,  entitled 'the climate of poverty' says the data . came from a 'conversation with authors; February 2006.' The BBC says the mistake was made by researchers, and not the presenter. However, figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by 0.76C, causing widespread concern among viewers. The comment, first broadcast in the final episode of the Africa series last Wednesday, was removed from Sunday night’s repeat of the show. A BBC spokesman said: 'There is . widespread acknowledgement within the scientific community that the . climate of Africa has been changing as stated in the programme. 'We accept the evidence for 3.5 degrees increase is disputable and the commentary should have reflected that. 'Therefore that line has been removed from Sunday's repeat and the iPlayer version replaced.' Many took to Twitter to dispute the fact, asking where the data came from.

A BBC source told The Times that the . mistake was made by the production team and not by Sir David, who told . them he did not know how it ended up in the script. The six-week wildlife series showed stunning footage of life on the continent. 'The mistake was being so specific. 'It should have been more carefully scripted,' the source said. In 2006, Sir David admitted that he used to be a sceptic but now believed it is one of the major challenged facing the world. 'I was . sceptical about climate change,' he said. 'I think conservationists have to be . careful in saying things are catastrophic when, in fact, they are less . than catastrophic. 'But I’m no longer sceptical. 'Now I do not have any doubt at all. 'I . think climate change is the major challenge facing the world. 'I have . waited until the proof was conclusive that it was humanity changing the . climate.' In the final episode of Africa he also focused on the threat of the growing population, with farmland expanding at the expense of wildlife. Later in the episode, Sir David said Africa was 'the world’s hottest continent and there is no doubt it’s getting warmer'. He also said that 80 per cent of the permanent icefields at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, had disappeared and 'soon it will be free of ice altogether'. The show had previously come under fire for accusations that its Africa series manipulated viewers by exaggerating 'emotional' scenes from nature.

For each year, the range of uncertainty is indicated by the gray vertical bars. The blue line tracks the changes in the trend over time. Sir David Attenborough's latest venture left many animal-lovers in tears, with scenes including one in which a mother elephant appeared to leave her herd to mourn over her dying calf. In the same episode, a mother shoebill was shown feeding and watering only her stronger chick, leaving the other to die of malnutrition. One viewer wrote on Twitter: 'That poor baby elephant and the poor mother having to watch her baby die! #tears had to stop eating my dinner. BBC #Africa warn me next time.' Another added: 'How heartbreaking watching the baby elephant calf die and the mother can only walk away. I'm in tears here.' Of a scene featuring rhinoceroses, another viewer said: 'Rhinos meeting down the local watering hole for a quick snog, we're all the same really, amazing.' The show's creators were also accused of using using music to create an emotional narrative. But producer James Honeyborne insisted that the six-part series reflected the 'breadth of what happens in nature.' Heartbreaking: A scene in which an elephant appears to grieve over her dying calf was distressing for many viewers . He told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'I don't think we do tell you what to feel, but we do lay open the broad pallet of what is happening in nature - and some of it is joyous and some of it is tough to watch.' The corporation received 16 complaints about the background music and 16 about the elephant calf's death. 'We are obviously concerned that some viewers have been upset,' said Mr Honeyborne. 'As soon as you look at an animal not as a species but as an individual, you do get drawn in and your empathy for that individual character will increase. 'It is part of the process of looking deeper and creating that more immersive experience.' He denied that the programme’s score 'told viewers how to feel' at different points. 'We’ve always used music in our films,' he said. 'The music tends to reflect what is happening in the film, so if we’re telling an intimate story then the music will indeed be intimate too.'","Broadcaster removed assertions that 'some parts of the continent have become 3.5C hotter in the past 20 years' in repeat shown last night .

"Scientists last night ended a voluntary ban on creating mutant forms of bird flu, despite warnings that an accidental release could kill millions of people. Research into H5N1 transmission stopped a year ago amid fears information about how to create potentially dangerous viruses could be used for bioterrorism. The self-imposed moratorium came after two teams independently discovered how to mutate the virus so that it could be transmitted through the air between humans. Deadly: The H5N1 strain of bird flu can currently pass from birds to birds, and from birds to humans, but not between humans. When it does infect a human, it is usually fatal . However, other leading scientists condemned the decision to go ahead with the research, with one warning an 'accidental release could wipe out a significant portion of humanity.' Forty of the world's leading flu researchers voluntarily halted investigations into the airborne transmission of the H5N1 avian flu strain last January, following public outrage over the work. Announcing the decision to resume studies in a letter published in the journals Science and Nature last night, they said the work would only be carried out in the most secure sites in countries that agree it can go ahead. That will allow work to start again in key laboratories in the Netherlands and elsewhere but not yet in the U.S or U.S.-funded research centres, pending further safety and security guidelines there. Flu experts said they have recognised the fears over their risky studies of the pathogen and worked hard to calm them, and now it is time to push on. They say the studies are essential for a deeper understanding of H5N1, which many fear could one day spark a lethal pandemic in humans. 'We want the world to be better prepared than we currently are when an H5N1 virus causes a pandemic,' said Yoshihiro Kawaoka of Tokyo University, a leading researcher on avian flu. 'We understand the risks associated with our research and we take every precaution to conduct H5N1 virus experiments safely.' He told reporters on a teleconference the research would boost efforts to develop global flu 'biosurveillance', early warning systems, as well as better flu drugs and vaccines. But other scientific experts warned that the potential risks of going ahead with the research outweighed the possible benefits. Former government chief scientist Professor Lord May told The Independent: 'As this research become more widely known and disseminated, there is the opportunity for evil people to pervert it. 'My other concern is the statistics of containment are not what they ought to be.' Genetic engineering expert Sir Richard Roberts, who won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1993, said the decision had been 'made by a small group of self-interested scientists' and made 'a mockery of the concept of informed consent'. 'Should we be trying to engineer in the laboratory a virus so dangerous that an accidental release could wipe out a significant portion of humanity?' he asked. 'I vote no.' Hazard to public health: A bird flies away from an Indonesian public health officer who tries to catch it as they kill birds in Jakarta, Indonesia following an outbreak in the country in 2006 . In the open letter announcing the lifting of the ban, flu researchers from the U.S., China, Japan, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy and Germany admitted their research was not without risks. 'However, because the risk exists in nature that an H5N1 virus capable of transmission in mammals may emerge, the benefits of this work outweigh the risks,' they added. Wendy Barclay, a flu virologist at Imperial College London and one of the letter's signatories, said lifting the moratorium would lead to scientific discoveries that would have 'direct consequence for human and animal health'. All research into H5N1 transmission was halted last January after teams at the University of Wisconsin and the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam made mutant forms that can be transmitted directly among mammals, meaning they could in theory also pass between people. There are serious concerns that the H5N1 bird flu virus poses an enormous pandemic threat. The first avian influenza virus to infect humans occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 in an epidemic that was linked to chickens. Human cases H5N1 have since been reported in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnman, the Pacific, and the near East. Hundreds of people have become sick with this virus, with slightly more than 60 per cent of those who catch it dying of the illness. The more the avian flu virus spreads, the greater the chances of a worldwide outbreak in humans. Currently, bird flu can be transmitted from birds to birds, and birds to humans, but not from humans to humans. When it does pass from birds to humans, it is usually fatal. Scientists are concerned the same mutations needed to make it transmissible among mammals in a lab could one day happen in nature. When news of the work emerged late in 2011, it prompted the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to call for the scientific papers about it to be censored to prevent details falling into the wrong hands. The censorship call sparked a fierce debate about how far scientists should be allowed to go in manipulating infectious agents in the name of research. Professor Barclay said this had been a 'knee-jerk response from certain quarters previously naive of this approach, expressing horror that scientists were brewing up deadly diseases.' During the moratorium, the World Health Organisation recommended that scientists explain the biological and other security measures they use to contain the virus and make more effort to show why the research is so important. 'The laboratories have expanded on their containment and security system ... and I think the value of the results has been recognised,' said John McCauley, director of the WHO collaborating centre for flu research at Britain's National Institute for Medical Research. Ron Fouchier, from the Rotterdam lab which led one of the studies, said his team would start fresh research on H5N1 viruses 'in the next few weeks'. 'We really need to understand how these viruses become airborne,' he told reporters in the teleconference, saying that was the primary goal of the work.","Flu experts overturn self-imposed ban on creating mutant firms of the H5N1 bird flu virus .

"Have you seen this man? Dorset Police have released this image of a man with his face covered and gripping a knife during a robbery - but won't call him a suspect to protect his human rights . With his face covered by a makeshift balaclava and a knife gripped in his right hand during a robbery at a bookmakers, it is probably safe to say this man is up to no good. CCTV footage also shows him threatening a cashier at Ladbrokes in the east Dorset village of West Moors before making off with cash from the till. But today the county's over-cautious force refused to call him a suspect in the violent crime, in case it breaches his human rights. And detectives have appealed for the public to help identify him - even though his face is impossible to see - and even hope he might come forward himself. A force spokesman maintained today the man in the photos is not necessarily the robber, just 'someone we want to talk to' in connection with the attack. This is because Dorset Police believe . calling him a wanted man could impact on his 'right to a fair trial', . and they say they would treat any person potentially involved in a crime . in the same way. Gawain Towler, a spokesman for UKIP, said: 'Actions like this are pointless and make the police laughable. 'It's all part of the retreat from common sense language. Calling a suspect a suspect does not imply guilt. 'In this instance they are being daft and it creates a lack of respect for the police if they can't be straight with us - it's counter productive.' They have also failed to issue a description of the robber, leaving out key details such as his height, build and accent. Members of the public who are being asked to help name the offender took to internet message boards to poke fun at the appeal. One wrote: 'This has to be a wind up. Not sure what's more laughable, the detective asking the man to contact him - errr do you really think that's likely? - or the CCTV image showing a man with his face completely obscured from view?' Dorset resident Carol Smith posted: 'How stupid is that? Shall we look for a man with a black woolly thing over his head?' Don't call him a suspect! The police have released these images in the hope he will be identified - despite his face being completely covered . The robbery happened at 6.50pm on February 26. Detective Constable James Lee, the investigating officer, said: 'I am now able to release CCTV images of the man I wish to speak with. 'I urge the man pictured - and anyone who recognises him - to contact me, in confidence, as soon as possible. 'I also would like to hear from anyone who saw this man enter or leave the premises around the time of the incident.' When asked about the fact that the suspect's face is hidden, a force spokesman said: 'We are looking for people to identify the man, not just his face. 'We are not suggesting the man in the pictures is the suspect, just someone we want to talk to.' The spokesman confirmed that no arrests have been made in connection to the raid.","Dorset Police say naming man as suspect could impede 'right to a fair trial'

"NFL player Warren Sapp allegedly filmed a sex act with one of the two prostitutes he is accused of assaulting the night after the Super Bowl. The two women told police that Sapp picked them up at the bar at the Renaissance Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, and that he threw $100 bills at them while they gave him a striptease in his room. The New York Post reports that Sapp told police he paid each of the girls $300 to perform a sex act on him and filmed the one of the women, who is 23 years old. Sapp reportedly showed this footage to police following the arrest. Scroll down for video . Took footage: Former NFL player Warren Sapp (pictured) allegedly filmed oral sex with one of the two escorts he is accused of assaulting the night after the Super Bowl\ . Sapp said that one of the women demanded more money and both women started screaming at him when he said no. 'He told her several times that she needed to leave, but she was irate,' says a police report. 'At one point, she used Warren’s phone to call security to his room.' During the argument Sapp allegedly tossed one of the woman out of his room, knocking the other woman down. Sapp was fired by the NFL Network after the story broke last month. Sapp, a member of the Football Hall of Fame, was in town covering the big game for NFL Network. Storied career: Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders . The incident took place early Monday morning at Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix . Sapp's biography has since been pulled from NFL Network's On-Air Talent list on its website. The football analyst was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution and assault. He has since been released from custody without bail after a judge ruled that he was not a flight risk. According to reporting by AZ Central, police were called to Renaissance Hotel in downtown Phoenix at around 2.30am Monday after the incident in response to a noise complaint. A woman told officers that she and another woman were working as escorts and an argument over money in Sapp's room turned physical and spilled into the hallway. Sapp admitted to investigators he had paid one of the women for sex but he denied any assault. Investigators said both escorts sustained minor injuries consistent with a struggle. The women involved in the incident were cited by police and later released. Warren Sapp has been in trouble with the law several times in recent years. In 2010, he was arrested on a domestic battery charge, which was later dropped.

Light on his feet: Sapp was the runner up on season 7 of Dancing With The Stars . As recently as last June, the 42-year-old football analyst and one-time contestant on Dancing With The Stars was picked up on a separate domestic battery charge in a Miami hotel. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy listing $6.7million in debt, including hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid child support, property and IRS taxes. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his palatial home in Florida for $2.1million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors.","NFL player Warren Sapp allegedly filmed sex act with one of the two escorts he is accused of assaulting the night after the Super Bowl .

"While Juventus find themselves assuredly top of Serie A, their last 16 Champions League opponents Borussia Dortmund, sit a very modest 12th in the Bundesliga. In fact, Dortmund were actually bottom of the table until a run of three wins in their last three games lifted them off it; but even that little upturn shouldn't detract from what a disappointing league campaign it has been for Jurgen Klopp's men so far. Juve midfielder Arturo Vidal, however, insists that neither the threat nor inherent quality of Dortmund has waned; and says that the Turin club must still respect BVB, who will be determined to atone for their poor domestic showing on the continent. Arturo Vidal has insisted that Juventus will face no easy task when they take on Borussia Dortmund . Ilkay Gundogan tussles for the ball with Pradal Serey (left) in Dortmund's 3-2 win over Stuttgart . Jurgen Klopp's side are currently a disappointing 12th place in the Bundesliga table . Vidal told German football magazine Kicker, 'Dortmund's league woes make them even more dangerous, because they will be focusing their efforts on the Champions League.' 'They'll want to show that their Bundesliga place doesn't represent their enormous quality and is merely a deceptive snapshot.' He added, 'The strength of Klopp's team isn't individual players, but the unity of the team, the pressing game they play out, their superior technique on the ball and the crazy pace they show.' Vidal has rejected the idea that Italian football is not as strong as it once was . Juve midfielder Paul Pogba (left) controls the ball ahead of Atalanta's Giulio Migliaccio (right) Claudio Marchisio vies with Cesena's Carlos Carbonero (right) during the Serie A match on February 15 . Vidal also rejected the notion that Italian football is not as strong as it once was and even suggested that Juventus boasted one of the world's best midfields in himself, Paul Pogba and Claudio Marchisio. 'Juve's midfield is definitely in the top three out there, but now we have to prove it on the pitch in the Champions League,' he said. Despite that lofty claim, though, Vidal could not hide his admiration for Dortmund playmaker Marco Reus. 'If I could sign any Dortmund player it would be Reus. He's a really great footballer. But he just signed a renewal with Dortmund...'

"Pensioners will suffer a double blow today with the arrival of freezing weather and news that their energy bills have doubled in seven years. Forecasters say temperatures could plummet as low as minus 10C over the next few days with snow in many parts. The cold snap will put huge pressure on the elderly who are increasingly fearful of turning up their heating because of the soaring cost. Scroll down for video . Struggling: Pensioners will suffer a double blow today with the arrival of freezing weather and news that their energy bills have doubled in seven years . Preparation: Highway Agency workers in County Durham prepare gritters ahead of this weekend's cold snap . Winter: Fog descended in Danbury, Essex on Thursday ahead of snowy conditions expected this weekend . The average gas and electricity bill for the over-65s reached £1,356 last year – more than double the figure of £669 seen in 2005. Pensioners were forced to find £17.4billion to stay warm and keep the lights on in 2012. Five of the ‘Big Six’ energy firms put up their tariffs as winter began, blaming higher wholesale energy prices and the cost of Government initiatives promoting green energy and household insulation. The sixth firm, E.on, will push up its gas bills by 9.4 per cent and electricity by 7.7 per cent on January 18. The elderly are particularly sensitive to energy price rises because they spend more time at home. Experts warn that thousands will die from medical conditions made worse by living in a cold house. Worrying: The cold snap will put huge pressure on the elderly who are increasingly fearful of turning up their heating because of the soaring cost . Five of the 'Big Six' energy firms put up their tariffs as winter began, blaming higher wholesale energy prices and the cost of Government initiatives promoting green energy and household insulation . A sign of what is to come? Temperatures are set to plunge to minus 10C . Bracing for impact: Highway Agency staff at the M25 gritting depot in South Mimms, Hertfordshire . Busy: The Highways Agency anticipates a hectic weekend minimising the damage of the snow . Official figures put the number of ‘excess’ winter deaths at 24,000 last year – far worse than colder countries such as those in Scandinavia, where home insulation is a high priority. - Age UK's director general . Saga says its analysis shows the portion of income spent by over-50s on fuel has increased at a faster rate than for the rest of the population. They say seven million over-65s are already struggling to pay their heating bills – while many are rationing their use of the central heating or gas fires. A survey of 8,500 over-50s found that 58 per cent are worried about the costs of heating their homes this winter and more than seven million – 35 per cent – are already struggling with heating bills. Many rely on the annual Winter Fuel Payment, which is currently worth between £100 and £300 based on age, to keep warm. However, all political parties are looking at capping, cutting or removing the payment. Such changes, providing political parties are willing to take on the powerful pensioner vote, would not come into effect until after the next election. Cold: Temperatures are set to dip below freezing this weekend as the recent warm weather ends . Ferry cross the Mersey: The iconic Liverpool docks were also shrouded in fog on Thursday . Saga’s director general, Dr Ros Altmann, said: ‘Energy prices are continuing to increase and we are still to feel the full effects of the latest price rises so energy costs are likely to put even more of a financial strain on households in 2013. ‘While incomes have increased in the last seven years, they have not kept pace with the rate that energy and fuel costs have risen, meaning that people are spending more of their income on fuel. ‘This is especially true for older people who are often on lump or fixed incomes or whose savings income has fallen.’ She added: ‘We know from our own research just how much of a burden energy prices are on the finances of those faced with fixed or dwindling incomes, especially older generations, of whom 29 per cent are having to raid savings every month in order to make ends meet.’ Age UK’s director general, Michelle Mitchell, said: ‘Cold homes clearly pose a serious health risk and with energy bills spiralling upwards, many older people will be struggling to heat their homes this winter. Preparation: Highways Agency maintenance operative Gary Cantellow looks at gritting salt at their South Mimms Depot in Hertfordshire . On it goes: A Highways Agency worker loads gritting salt onto one of their spreading machines at South Mimms . Getting ready: Crews load up gritting lorries ready to spread salt on the roads in Taunton, Somerset . ‘These people are facing serious pressures on their meagre household budgets and are too often being faced with the choice of heating their homes or eating. ‘The cold is a huge health risk for older people leading to thousands of preventable deaths and illnesses every winter.’ The group advises the elderly to ensure the temperature in their living room does not drop below 21C while the figure is no lower than 18C in the bedroom. Saga is supporting a voluntary scheme where wealthy pensioners can choose to donate their Winter Fuel Payment to others in need. The Surviving Winter campaign, which is backed by a raft of celebrities, including Stephen Fry, Dame Vera Lynn and Sir David Jason, has raised £1million so far this year. Supplies: Mountains of salt in County Durham which will be spread on the nation's roads over the next two weeks . Work: Councils will be keen to avoid the blunders of recent years when they have run out of grit . Money is used to help vulnerable people cover their energy bills, install insulation or practical help, such as providing hot meals. The Government insisted there is a range of schemes that will help pensioners. It said energy firms are required to help poorer households by providing subsidised or free home insulation under the Energy Company Obligation scheme. Other options include the Green Deal  system of loans to fund home improvements and the Warm Home Discount scheme, which offers a £130 saving on energy bills to up to 1.1m of the poorest pensioners. Greg Barker, energy and climate change minister, said: ‘A warm home should be a given, not a luxury. That’s why we  want to make sure everyone is aware of  the support available.’","Cold snap will put huge pressure on elderly, fearful of turning up heating .

"Miss Lee was described as a 'a sweet girl with a heart of gold' in an online tribute. Picture from Facebook tribute page . A young dental nurse found dead outside her sister’s house is believed to have frozen to death in the snow. Bernadette Lee should have  been staying with a friend after a  night out, but went to her older sister Jodie’s instead. Finding the house empty, it appears that she either slipped and banged her head, or that she fell asleep and succumbed to the freezing temperatures, which dropped below minus 2C. The 25-year-old’s body was discovered by a dog walker early on Sunday, hours after she was seen at a local nightclub. She was wearing only a dress, with no coat, and had taken off her shoes. Her sister Jodie, 33, said: ‘She was an amazing girl, she was so pretty and had everything to live for. Bernie loved life, was an adventurous traveller and had just started her own business doing teeth whitening. We are devastated, and can’t comprehend this terrible, terrible tragedy.’ Miss Lee said her sister had travelled from her home in Canterbury, Kent, to a friend’s flat where they had all got ready for a night out on Saturday. The group of friends had gone to a popular nightclub in Deal, Kent, but as the evening wore on they had become separated. Miss Lee said: ‘We were all having a good time and having quite a few drinks, but I thought she was staying with her friend as all her clothes were there. I came home but had lost my door key so went to stay with a friend. Tragic location: The scene at Church Meadows in Deal, Kent, where Bernadette Lucy Lee was found dead .

I don’t understand why she didn’t ring me or . knock on the neighbours’ doors. Nobody knows what happened and I fear . we never will.’ Thick snow blanketed Deal at the weekend, and temperatures in the early hours of Sunday plunged to minus 2.2C (28F). Alcohol increases blood flow to the . outer areas of the body, decreasing core body temperature, so Miss Lee . would have been more susceptible to hypothermia. Her father Roger, 63, said he was devastated at the death of his ‘beautiful little girl’. Mr Lee, a retired labourer, said: ‘The police told me she was wearing just a dress, no coat, and didn’t have her shoes on. ‘Someone must have dropped her off . outside Jodie’s house as apparently she didn’t have money for a taxi and . she couldn’t have walked. Who would leave a girl on her own, without . seeing that they had got into the house safely? I want to know who left . her there. ‘One of the friends Bernadette was out . with came to see me yesterday. She said she felt so guilty because . Bernadette had called her after they’d got separated, but she’d been . arguing with her boyfriend and hadn’t answered. Tributes: Flowers at the spot where Bernadette Lucy Lee was found in Deal, after succumbing to hypothermia .

I just wish Bernadette had phoned me. I would have come . straight round to get her. ‘I would have done anything for my daughter. I loved her so much – everybody did. She was a very popular girl, a lovely girl.’ He said Bernadette and Jodie had lived . with him when they were growing up, and Bernadette had been a . successful gymnast, winning a number of gold medals as a child. Hundreds of friends left messages on a . Facebook tribute page. Her half-brother Luke wrote: ‘I was closer to . you than anyone on this earth, words could never be enough to describe . how proud mum and I were of the beautiful person you’d become. ‘You’ll have the most special place in . our hearts now and for all of time. Heartbroken for the moments I’ll . never get to share with you, privileged for the ones I did.’ A spokesman for Kent Police said: ‘We . think it is probably a tragic accident. Police found no evidence of any . suspicious activity. ‘We think she either collapsed because . she was too drunk or she slipped on the snow and couldn’t get up and . lost consciousness because it was so cold or she had a medical episode.’ A post-mortem examination is due to take place this week to establish the cause of death. WHAT IS IT? Hypothermia occurs when a person's body temperature drops below 35°C (95°F); normal body temperature is around 37°C (98.6°F). When the body gets cold it, tries to prevent losing more heat by shivering (which keeps the major organs at normal temperature), restricting blood flow to the skin and releasing hormones to generate heat. But these responses use up energy and may not be enough to maintain body temperature if it is exposed to the cold for a long time. When the body runs out of energy, it gradually begins to shut down. Shivering stops and the heartbeat begins to slow. Eventually, it stops. WHAT CAUSES IT? As well as being caused by cold and windy weather - and not wearing enough warm clothing - there are other factors that can trigger or exacerbate it. Getting wet is a major factor as water conducts heat away from the body 25 times faster than air. Drinking alcohol is another major contributor, says Joe Mulligan, head of first aid education at the British Red Cross. 'Alcohol widens the blood vessels, so more blood - and therefore heat - goes to the surface of the skin and is lost from the body. 'In fact, the moderate stage of alcohol intoxication is similar to the intermediate stages of hypothermia and are often confused,' he explains. 'If someone is hypothermic, they may appear confused, disorientated and irritated.' SYMPTOMS . The symptoms of severe hypothermia (a body temperature of below 28˚C) can include:     unconsciousness (comatose), shallow or no breathing, weak, irregular or no pulse and dilated pupils.

"Barcelona residents will no longer be allowed to walk their dogs without a lead under new by-laws passed . Residents of Barcelona will no longer be allowed to walk their dogs without leads after a number of by-laws designed to help people and animals 'coexist' were passed. People in the Catalonian capital are also now prohibited from leaving their cats indoors for too long and will face fines for feeding pigeons.  Meanwhile, those caught feeding stray cats will face fines of €750 (£618). Owners, who do not keep their dogs on leashes or immediately pick up their pet's mess, will be charged up to €1,500 (£1,236). According to the Telegraph, the new by-laws – passed on Monday – are to improve ‘co-existence between residents and animals’. Previously, people were allowed to let dogs off their leashes if they behaved. Now, they will only be allowed to walk free in designated areas, which - according to the paper - residents feel are too few and far between. The paper reports senior city councillor Jordi Marti as saying that the laws are being imposed because of an ‘uncivilised’ minority. On the decision to pass the by-laws, El Pais reports him as saying: 'This is the 21st century, not the 19th century.' New by-laws also state that people may not leave their animals home alone for certain times – more than 12 hours for dogs, and three days for cats. Barcelona residents are now prohibited from keeping monkeys and horses as pets in the city. They are also prohibited from breeding animals for sale. Barcelona residents are also now prohibited from keeping monkeys and horses as pets in the city . Under the by-laws, dogs will now be allowed on to the city’s metro system. New animal owners, meanwhile, will only be able to buy or adopt a pet when they have signed a document saying they have not abused an animal. They will be charged with a crime if they are found to have lied. According to El Pais, there are an estimated 120,000 dogs, but only 30,000 of these are registered.

"Sophie Thomlison: Desperate to take her first steps . A mother has condemned the NHS for refusing to fund surgery which would allow her daughter to walk. Two-year-old Sophie Thomlinson was born prematurely and has a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use her legs. An operation on her spinal cord would enable her to take her first steps – but health chiefs have decided that it is  too expensive. Now her parents are trying to raise the £25,000 needed for her to have the surgery privately. Sophie, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, was referred by local doctors to Leeds General Infirmary, which  specialises in the selective dorsal  rhizotomy procedure. But the hospital, part of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, was denied funding by NHS England – which does not routinely agree to pay for such operations. Perversely, a 22-year-old aspiring glamour model was given breast enhancement surgery on the NHS last year at another Leeds hospital within the same NHS trust. Josie Cunningham had her 32A breasts enlarged to a 36DD with taxpayers’ money, after saying her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. Her operation came after she was recommended for funding by her local GP. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances when it is needed ‘to protect a person’s health’. Sophie’s mother Allison, 40, a former nurse, said: ‘When you think that you can get a boob job or a tummy tuck on the NHS but not something that can help a little girl walk, it really makes me angry and upset. Surely the type of treatments should be prioritised in terms of what is essential. 'When I was told we needed £25,000 for the operation my world came crashing down. ‘It’s ridiculous as £25,000 is a lot of money for a family to try to raise, but if it means Sophie can walk then it is all worth it.’ Family: Sophie with brother Lewis and parents Allison and Craig - who are trying to raise £25,000 for their daughter's operation . Last year, an aspiring model was given breast enhancement surgery at the same NHS Trust which is unable to operate on Sophie, pictured . Josie Cunningham, who hit the headlines when she had her breasts enhanced on the NHS last year . Sophie was born prematurely at 33 weeks and she spent most of the first year of her life  in hospital. Her mother noticed that at 18 months old she was ‘bunny hopping’ rather than walking and she was diagnosed with spastic diplegia. Sufferers of the condition are unable to use their legs as the signals from the brain do not reach the muscles, causing agonising contractions. Sophie has been undergoing painful intensive therapy to strengthen her muscles and spends an hour each day in a frame to help  her stand. Although the ten-hour procedure would allow her to take her first steps, it would take months of further therapy before she could walk freely and unaided. Mrs Thomlinson has set up an online fundraising page for the operation called Sophie’s Tiny Steps, which has so far raised more than £1,300. She and her husband Craig, 44, and son Lewis, 13, are raising money with the help of Tree of Hope, a charity that helps families with disabled children. Mrs Thomlinson said: ‘She is such a bubbly little girl but I get sad when I see her watching her friends from the sidelines and not being able to get involved. ‘She always says to me “mummy walk” and you can see how desperate she is to take those first steps.’ The family is hoping to raise the money before Sophie turns three. Their JustGiving fundraising page reads: ‘Hello, my name is Sophie and I am two years old. I was born premature at 33 weeks and weighed just 3lbs 8oz and I spent most of the first year of my life in hospital. ‘In July 2013 my mummy and daddy were told that I had a condition called spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy that means I can’t stand, walk or run like my friends do. ‘I have to do special exercises and use a standing frame for one hour every day which helps my muscles and joints to  get stronger.’ NHS England did not respond to requests to comment.

"A summer camp counselor taunted a former camper with horrifying messages, including threats to rape him, for nearly a year over the anonymous messaging app Kik, police say. Robert Yagid, 18, turned himself into a police on Thursday after authorities finally tracked the messages pack to his cell phone, according to authorities. Among the terrifying messages that Yagid allegedly to sent to the 13-year-old boy were 'you're so cute when you sleep,' and 'I'm coming for your tight little a**,' the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports. Camp counselor: Robert Yagid, a camp counselor at Tree Tops Park in Davie, California is accused of anonymously sending one of his male 13-year-old campers and a 12-year-old threatening messages on Kik . When detectives seized his hard drives, they discovered a slew of websites in his browsing history that he had allegedly been using as source material - including 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Pedophile's Guide.' After police identified Yagid as the alleged cyberbully, the 13-year-old identified the young man as his camp from Tree Tops Park in Davie, Florida. Yagid is also accused of sending inappropriate messages to a 12-year-old girl on Kik. According to police, some of the message that were sent are: . 'You're so cute when you sleep,' said one of the messages sent under the pseudonym Megan Hoffmin that brought the 13-year-boy and son of a Hollywood, Florida, police officer to tears. 'For a gated community [your home] has terrible security. BTW your gate was opened, so I closed it,' said another one of the messages. A third message read, 'Who am I? You have until July 20th to answer my question or else I'm coming for your tight little a**.' A very long threatening message detailing a sexual assault to the boy was sent in June, according to cops. It read, 'Have you ever been raped before? Because that tight, white little a****** belongs to me now … You can call authorities, you can pray to God, but you will never find me. Until I've found you first,' it said, according to the affidavit. 'The devil has plans for you; it looks dim and full of sickness, consuming your body. Make amends to free your heart, and soul; for soon, there will be no going back.' When the boy's mother discovered the messages she took them to Pembroke Pines police and obtained a search warrant. 'The suspect's actions caused him to be fearful and he believed that his life was in danger,' Detective Michael Silver wrote in the search warrant application. That day detectives used IP addresses to find suspect Yagid at his house in Davie. After showing the boy a photo line-up he recognized the photo of Yagid to be 'Robbie' his camp counselor. Mobile app: The threatening messages were sent via the mobile app Kik under the name Megan Hoffmin . Cops say they confiscated Yagid's electronic devices and found a Google history that read, 'The Creepy Sex Manifesto,' 'Stalking for Beginners,' 'How to Ruin Someone’s Life,' and 'Paedophiles Guide,' according to a juvenile arrest affidavit. The Sun Sentinel reports that Yagid was not arrested and that the case is being investigated as cyber stalking. The text messages to the 12-year-old girl, a friend of the boy he targeted, asked how far she'd gone sexually with the boy. Yagid allegedly then texted, 'You're the luckiest girl in the world. I'd give anything and everything to be [the boy's] girlfriend,' along with a sad face emoticon. When police questioned Yagid as to why he wrote the messages he wrote that he was, 'just bored.' 'We have no comment,'  Yagid's father told The Sun Sentinel. 'We have a lot of confidence in the legal system, and we'll leave it at that.' Scott Avras, a representative from the summer camp where Yagid worked said,'I'm in shock.' 'He's a very nice young man. Robbie has always been a very hard worker here,' said Avras, .","Robert Yagid, 18, is facing a juvenile charge of aggravated stalking for messages he sent to children at camp in Florida .

"UKIP leader Nigel Farage has made a dramatic offer to form an election pact with the Tories – but only if they dump David Cameron as leader. Buoyed by big gains in Thursday’s town hall elections, Farage last night said he is ready to join forces with the Conservatives to keep Ed Miliband out of power. Senior Tory sources flatly dismissed Farage’s call for Cameron to step down, but significantly did not rule out talks with UKIP on how they might work together. In his first major interview since winning 147 council seats, Mr Farage told The Mail on Sunday: . Farage said that if David Cameron were to quit he would join the Tories at the next election . UKIP and Tory candidates could run a single candidate in key parliamentary seats, in effect a Tory/UKIP coalition. He plans to take Parliament by storm by standing in a by-election expected in Portsmouth soon. He had given Mr Cameron a ‘kick in the balls’ in the local elections. ‘Foolish’ Tory Cabinet Minister Ken Clarke had driven voters to UKIP by branding the party ‘clowns’. Mr Farage’s success has shaken all three main party leaders, and Education Secretary Michael Gove has failed to kill off fresh reports of a bid to topple Mr Cameron by dismissing any such plot as ‘bonkerooney’. The rumours were refuelled by  rebel Tory MP Adam Afriyie who told the Prime Minister last night to ‘stop pussyfooting around’ and ‘get a grip on immigration’. Cameron has been criticised for failing to neutralise the UKIP threat . Tremors from the UKIP earthquake . prompted similar jibes against Ed Miliband from dissident Labour MPs. And Lib Dem MPs said it was ‘by no means impossible’ that Vince Cable . would replace struggling Nick Clegg before the next Election. Mr Farage’s offer to discuss a General Election deal with the Tories is another sign of the rapidly changing political landscape in Britain. He says it could win the Tories an extra 50 seats – enough for them to stay in power. Crucially, it would give UKIP a say in running the country for the first time. But Mr Farage says the Conservatives would have to agree to two demands: Sack Cameron, with a clear pledge by his successor to hold a prompt In/Out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Adam Afriyie told the Prime Minister to stop pussyfooting around the issue of immigration . He has seized on quirks in election law which would allow UKIP and Tory candidates to wear the rosettes of both parties. At a stroke, UKIP votes in key areas would help the Tories keep Labour out of power – and bring Farage’s dream of leading Britain out of the EU closer. Until now, the UKIP leader has ruled out any deals with the Conservatives, partly because Mr Cameron called UKIP ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. But Mr Farage’s surge in popularity, together with a slump in Mr Cameron’s, has prompted a rethink. He is now ready to do business with the Tories if Mr Cameron is replaced with a more eurosceptic Tory leader, such as Boris Johnson or Mr Gove. Mr Farage said: ‘There are lots of intelligent ways of doing deals in the future, all sorts of things a sensible, patriotic Conservative leader, could pursue. ‘I have been approached by Conservative Associations who say “look Nigel, not only have you taken a lump of our vote but you’ve also picked up the council estate vote round the corner which is never going to come to us. If we ran a candidate on a joint ticket we would walk it.” ’ Alternatively, the two parties could have a more straightforward non-aggression pact and agree not to run against each other in certain seats, says Farage. He denies claims it is fantasy politics. ‘Not at all. I have sat round the table on Sunday evenings with Conservative Party officials who have suggested this kind of thing to me.’ Farage has everything to gain from any such deal. UKIP’s success on Thursday may not translate into a single Commons seat in the 2105 General Election. ‘I’d rather have half an MP than not one at all,’ he says bluntly. Ken Clarke branded the party 'clowns' potentially driving voters to UKIP . He says the Tories could win ‘up to 50 extra seats’ by teaming up with UKIP, but it would carry huge risks. It could split the Party, with eurosceptic MPs grabbing the offer, while others may quit the Party rather than be associated with the reactionary views of UKIP. They would oppose  giving Mr Farage the whip hand and relying on him for a Parliamentary majority. Mr Farage maintains the likelihood of the Tories dumping Cameron before the election is not far-fetched. ‘I wouldn’t be so sure.’ A senior Conservative with close links to Mr Cameron said he would not resign, but did not close the door to talks. ‘If UKIP wants to put proposals to us, let them go ahead,’ he said.","Said MPs should stand for both parties, but only if PM quits .

The hotel was described as 'an escapist blend of OTT luxury, creativity and indulgence, with rooms reflecting a wide range of themes and eras'. According to the judges on that occasion, the suite itself ‘is shamelessly romantic: with heavy, textured fabrics, floral artwork and the kind of ornate, crimson-draped four-poster that makes you reach for the smelling salts, it’s an essay in decorative decadence’.","Water Villa number 5 is part of the Six Seasons Hotel in Nha Trang .

"In their navy tailcoats and sky blue silk bow ties, and with the desert as a backdrop, they do not look like the typical grouse-shooting party. But this is the new breed of members of the infamous Bullingdon Club. And instead of donning tweed and taking to the Scottish moors, they chose to celebrate the Glorious Twelfth earlier this month in the more exotic surroundings of the South African veldt. On guard: The 2013 Bullingdon Club travelled to South Africa for a spot of hunting (for a who's who, see below, number nine could not be identified) Oxford University’s notorious male-only dining society — whose alumni include David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson — usually pose for their annual photo on the steps of Christ Church, the Oxford college. The club is famously discreet about its membership and gatherings. But today the Mail can reveal the latest line-up of ‘Buller men’ and their antics. Standing arm-in-arm, the class of 2013 show off their haul of game after a day’s sand grouse shooting. The gathered party of current and recent members illustrates how the invitation-only club continues to be open only to the super-rich or those from aristocratic families. The presence of George Farmer, the son of Tory treasurer Michael Farmer — a close ally of David Cameron who has donated £4million to the Conservatives — shows how closely it is linked to the high echelons of the party. Others in the group, which flew into Johannesburg before taking a private plane to the shoot, include the great-grandson of the founder of Marks & Spencer and a member of one of America’s most powerful dynasties. On board the small aircraft used to fly the men to the exclusive jaunt, each seat pocket was filled not with an in-flight magazine but with a bottle of champagne. While on the five-day shoot, the men — who are without exception the product of incredible privilege — donned the 200-year-old society’s formal dress. Haunted: Chancellor George Osborne and Prime . Minister David Cameron, left, have been embarrassed by their Bullingdon . Club photographs. And Mr Osborne, right, with Harry Mount in the first . club picture . The class of '87: Buller men David Cameron (back, second left) and Boris Johnson (front right) The full uniform, which costs around £3,500 is usually worn for the Club’s annual dinner. But the members seemed eager to pose in the South African desert in their specially-tailored navy tailcoats, each with a matching velvet collar, offset with ivory silk lapel revers, brass monogrammed buttons, a mustard waistcoat and bow tie. After successfully shooting dozens of sand grouse, which are regarded as the kings of African game birds, the group quaffed more champagne before leaving discarded corks in the dirt. Members perhaps felt at ease dressed in their full regalia, being so far from Oxford where the ‘modern Buller’ rarely wears the full attire for fear of attracting attention. Even as a student, George Osborne was ferociously ambitious . Sand grouse shoots, which typically last two hours, take place around the waterholes where the birds come in to drink during the mornings. The birds have small pigeon-like heads and necks but sturdy compact bodies and incredibly tough skin. The Bullingdon Club was founded in 1780 and has a notorious reputation for its destructive binges. It is banned from meeting within 15 miles of Oxford since a dinner in 1927 when its member smashed every window in a college quad. Former members ran riot around the town for decades, paying thousands of pounds in cash to buy the silence of dining establishments they damaged during their disorderly evenings. David Cameron and George Osborne have seemed embarrassed by the emergence of photographs of them dressed in their Buller ‘uniform’. Other former members include Edward VII, Earl Spencer and broadcaster David Dimbleby. One of the nine men on the grouse-shooting trip is unidentified, but the other 2013 Buller Men are: . 1 The Hon Michael Marks . The great-grandson of Michael Marks, the Victorian co-founder of Marks & Spencer, he will one day be the 4th Baron Marks of Broughton. The 24-year-old Old Etonian read politics, philosophy and economics at Balliol before becoming a visiting scholar at Harvard. In college, Michael held a curious position which involved looking after Matilda, the 17-year-old college tortoise. When Matilda died, he was ordered to eat a whole lettuce as punishment. After graduation, he worked for blue-blooded bank Rothschild but this year joined Robertson Robey Associates. His father Simon, 53, the 3rd Baron, also studied at Eton and Balliol. His South African-born mother Marion is a ceramics restorer. High life: In-flight champers gives an insight into the kind of life of Bullingdon 2013 . 2 James Tilney . He studied chemistry at Lincoln College but, after securing an internship with one of the world’s leading hedge funds, he decided to pursue a career in finance. On graduation, he took a job at global investment bank Jefferies & Co. But last year he was poached by Italian banker Corrado Scian, a former Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase executive, who employed him to take charge of business development at his new investment management company Glider Trading. 3 Cassius Marcellus Cornelius Clay . Born in Massachusetts into the Clay business dynasty, 6ft 5in Cassius was invited to join the Bullingdon Club despite attending Oxford for only  two terms as part of his history of art studies at Yale – where he gained a reputation as an imposing cravat-wearing figure who carried a pocket watch and $5,000 Hermes Birkin bag. During his second year at Yale he took a leave of absence after Kanye West invited him to become his right-hand man. Cassius was described in the press as the rapper’s stylist, but said he was uncomfortable with the term, stating: ‘The word risks either oversimplifying fashion’s broader significance to identity and aesthetics, or somehow glorifying dressing up as some glamorous veneer du jour.’ The 22-year-old was a member of the infamous Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale – the closest American equivalent to Bullingdon. It has produced five US presidents, including both Bushes, but was banned after video footage of an initiation involving songs about necrophilia and sex acts was posted online. A direct descendent of slavery abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, after whom the boxer Muhammad Ali was originally named, he will start a postgraduate degree at Cambridge in October. Photo shoot: A Buller with his gun . 4 Nicholas Green . While reading engineering at University College, the Old Etonian was led away by police in handcuffs – wearing his Bullingdon Club tailcoat – following an alleged serious assault on a fellow student in a row over a girl, but was not arrested or charged. The 24-year-old, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was featured in Tatler’s list  of 200 ‘sexiest singles’ in 2009. He now works for a mining company in Johannesburg. His stepfather, Patrick Quirk, is thought to be a mining tycoon in Zimbabwe. Green’s Facebook page at one stage showed apparent support for an anti-Obama group – as well as a seemingly sexist group calling itself ‘The awkwardness when a woman doesn’t choose the iron in a game of Monopoly’. 5 Timothy Aldersley . The 24-year-old shared a student house with Nick Green while he read physics at University College. He appeared in a student production of Alan Bennett’s comedy The Madness of George III and was described as ‘suitably raffish’ in the role of king-hating radical Charles James Fox. He now works on the mining investment team at RK Capital Management, the hedge fund owned by George Farmer’s father. 6 Charles Clegg . While many students have to make do with college digs, the Exeter College undergraduate was able to buy a flat in the centre of Oxford which he later sold for £420,000. The the 26-year-old economics and management graduate has followed his investment banker father Christopher into finance and works at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. His mother, Jane Morris, is an interior designer who runs a shop in Knightsbridge. Since returning from the South Africa shoot, he has changed his Facebook profile picture to one of him brandishing a gun. 7 Alexander ‘Alick’ Dru . A Descendant of the 4th Earl of Carnarvon, the Old Etonian, 21, is in the final year of his history degree but has already started to map out a career in finance – he took an internship with Paris-based HMG Finance last year. His father Auberon, 61, and mother Catherine, 53, own a firewood business. His Facebook page shows him with a double-barrelled shotgun.

According to friends, George boasted that he once flew all his Bullingdon Club peers to Bordeaux on a private jet owned by his father, Tory Party co-treasurer and donor Michael Farmer. He went to St Paul’s – George Osborne’s old school – then read theology at St Peter’s and was social secretary of the Oxford University Conservative Association. OUCA became embroiled in scandal and was barred by the university after candidates for election to its committee were asked to tell the most racist joke they knew and name their ‘least favourite minority’. George was not present but his father – a hedge fund founder who is currently 522 on the Sunday Times Rich List with a worth of around £150million – helped bail out OUCA and also funded George’s Bullingdon membership. George was club president during his final term. The 23-year-old worked as an investment banker with Jefferies & Co after graduating. His Facebook page includes a picture of him and Nick Green with Boris Johnson at a Conservative Party fundraiser.","Not tweed and Scottish Moors but a jaunt into South Africa for grouse shooting .

"Top European football clubs are set to lobby for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to take place in May, according to reports. The European Club Association, an umbrella organisation representing the interests of 214 teams from the continent, is a powerful voice in the ongoing negotiations around when the tournament will be scheduled. And the group, which counts 10 English clubs among its number, is reported to favour May, a stance it will be able to present to the sport’s world governing body FIFA at a calendar task force meeting next month. Sepp Blatter (centre) suggested a winter World Cup in Qatar, which is unpopular with leading clubs in Europe . A traditional mid-summer competition appears to have few supporters, with heat and humidity in the Middle East state reaching levels that could compromise the safety of players and spectators. Bringing the event forward to January or February has its supporters but a clash with the Winter Olympics presents a potentially insurmountable obstacle. Another alternative, apparently favoured by FIFA president Sepp Blatter, would see the World Cup take place in November and December, when the climate would be more suited to football. But that would represent a huge disruption to many domestic leagues, a prospect that could wreak havoc with European structures - effectively splitting the 2022-23 campaign in two as well as having a knock-on effect to future seasons. Now it seems ECA, formed in 2008 and backed by the power of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris St Germain as well as the likes of Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and both Manchester clubs, will push for its own vision.

A task force, featuring a wide variety of stakeholders, will have its next meeting in November before recommending a preferred timetable to FIFA’s executive committee next year.","Umbrella organisation representing 214 teams favours May tournament .

"Robin Williams' suicide could have been triggered by a common but devastating form of dementia that may have disrupted his normal brain function. Court documents obtained by TMZ reveal that Williams, who was found hanging from a belt at his home in California last August, was suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies. Sources connected with the troubled comic's family told the news site that the degenerative disease was the 'key factor' they believe drove him to take his own life. Robin Williams was found hanging from a belt at his home in California last August. It has emerged that the actor was was suffering from dementia with Lewy bodies . Hallucinations and delusions are common among those affected by Lewy bodies dementia, and sufferers often struggle to identify friends and family. The disease also typically causes problems with attention and alertness. 'The condition itself is caused by the build-up of protein into clumps, called Lewy bodies, in the brain, which can damage nerve cells in areas involved in memory and thinking,' explained Hilary Evans, Director of External Affairs at Alzheimer’s Research UK. 'These protein clumps also play a role in Parkinson's disease, so some people with dementia with Lewy bodies will also experience movement symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's.' On Friday, authorities formally ruled the star's death as suicide as it was revealed he was struggling with a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease  as well as anxiety, depression and paranoia. It was found that the Mrs Doubtfire star - who had battled drink and drugs in the past - had four drugs in his system at the time of his death. Toxicology reports found two anti-depressants and two caffeine compounds and there was no alcohol in his system. When authorities found Robin's body, the reports states they saw a closed bottle of Seroquel, a drug that treats schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depression. It was prescribed a week before he died. Robin Williams with his third wife Susan Schneider. Sources connected with the troubled comic's family told TMZ that the degenerative disease was the 'key factor' they believe drove him to take his own life . The legendary comic battled paranoia, according to the report, and the night before he died, he placed several wristwatches in a sock and gave them to someone because he was worried about their safe keeping. The report says the last outgoing call from Robin's phone was at 7.08 PM the night before he died. He had called his wife Susan, and it lasted 38 seconds. Susan told authorities he called because he was picking up magazines for her at a bookstore. When asked about his behavior, Susan said he seemed well and had taken his iPad from their closet which she took to be a good sign because he hadn't watched TV or read anything in about six months. LBD is a common form of dementia - it affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States. The disease is caused by abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time . This leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning and independent function . The disease takes its name from Frederick H. Lewy - the neurologist who discovered the brain abnormalities  during the early 1900s . It shares symptoms with Parkinson's Disease - sufferers can experience motor control problems, such as hunched posture, rigid muscles and a shuffling walk . Those affected can suffer visual hallucinations, which generally take the form of phantom objects, people or animals  there . It is also linked to Alzheimer's disease as it is more common over the age of 65 and those affected often suffer from confusion and memory loss . The web browser had several tabs open to websites discussing medications, including Lyrica, an anti-seizure drug, and propranolol, which treats blood pressure and tremors. The couple were sleeping in separate bedrooms, Susan said, because Robin was having trouble sleeping and would talk loudly in his sleep. The last time she saw him was around 10.30pm on Sunday night and said he seemed 'excited'. According to the report, Robin had experienced Parkinson's symptoms since 2011. He had a tremor in his left arm and movement in his left hand had slowed. He had recently started taking Levodopa to treat the symptoms. Known as 'the funniest man alive', Williams fought drug and alcohol problems when he played a lead role in the Mork & Mindy sitcom, on his path to stardom. He had stayed mainly sober for 20 years but in July he went into rehab to use the 12-step program he championed, this time during a brief stay at a Minnesota facility. Publicist Mara Buxbaum said at the time that Williams had not fallen off the wagon, but was 'taking the opportunity to fine-tune and focus on his continued commitment, of which he remains extremely proud.' This year he has six movies either out or due for release and had also been working on the TV series The Crazy Ones - but it was axed after one season. He admitted he returned to TV after nearly three decades because two divorces have left him short of cash. The comic's breakups cost him £20million and he claims to need a 'steady job'. He was also selling his £20million California ranch due to his sizeable alimony payments.","Court documents  reveal Williams suffered from dementia with Lewy bodies .

"The judge who will rule on the investigation into World Cup bidding has said the full report will not be published, despite numerous figures in football calling for it to be made public. Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the FIFA ethics committee adjudicatory chamber, said only selected parts of the report would be published to protect people’s 'personal rights'. The report’s author, American attorney Michael Garcia, on Monday said it should be published because FIFA needed to embrace transparency. Germany players celebrate winning the World Cup in Brazil in July . Sepp Blatter announcing Qatar as the hosts of the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . Several FIFA members, including UEFA president Michel Platini, have also called for publication. But Eckert said that would not be possible. In an interview on FIFA website he said: 'We have to respect the personal rights of the people mentioned in the report, which in the case of full publication of the report would in all likelihood not be possible.' Garcia had criticised the culture of secrecy at FIFA and said his investigation into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively, would help the world governing body embrace reform. But Eckert claimed even Garcia does not want the full report published. UEFA president Michel Platini is among those to call for publication of the report . Eckert said he will release a statement in mid-November which 'will contain an overview of the investigation report, a summary of the main findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report, as well as a brief evaluation of the same'. He added: 'Michael Garcia has never said that the report should be 100 per cent published. He merely said that the ‘appropriate’ publication of his report should be authorised.

"Documents that will be presented to court in February appear to show that BP knew about the massive scale of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout weeks earlier than previously stated. BP have always claimed that they only realized the true size of the oil spill months after the disaster, and that they had always provided full disclosure to federal authorities, Congress and the public. Now attorneys for a former BP engineer, who is accused of deleting text messages relating to the incident, plan to reveal thousands of previously unread documents they say will exonerate their client, but not the oil company. Underestimated: Oil gushed unabated for for three months during the 2010 disaster. New evidence suggests that that BP vastly understated the scale of the leak for weeks . Kurt Mix, the former BP employee, has been charged with two felony counts of obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying hundreds of text messages during the incident. It is alleged that Mix deleted the messages he sent to a supervisor, including reports that the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico was bigger than BP were publicly stating at the time. As reported in the Huffington Post, on Friday Mix's lawyers asked a federal judge in New Orleans for permission to present thousands of emails at the trial in February 2013. His attorneys argue that as Mix did co-operate with federal officials about the size of the leak, he was not part of a cover-up. But the emails do suggest a large internal effort at BP to hide the true size of the leak. Kurt Mix, the man accused of deleting text messages relating to the incident. His lawyers have emails they claim exonerate Mix but not BP . Damaging: The Deepwater Horizon oil platform exploded in April 2010. BP pleaded guilty to 11 cases of manslaughter in November 2012 . BP pleaded guilty to 14 felony counts relating to the disaster in November. The initial explosion killed 11 men working on the Deepwater Horizon and injured 17 others. Last month's plea agreement included 11 manslaughter charges and one felony count for obstruction of justice. This related to BP's false statements made to Congress about the amount of oil leaking from the well. BP will pay $4.5 billion in fines and other fees to settle the charges, the largest payment of its kind in U.S. history. According to the Huffington Post, just two days after the explosion, Mix emailed a supervisor estimating that the out-of-control well could be leaking between 62,000 and 146,000 barrels of oil per day. Only two days later, BP told the U.S Coast Guard that their best estimate for the leak was 1,000 barrels per day. Since the disaster a scientific group concluded that the well was leaking 62,000 barrels per day at the beginning of the disaster. Huffington Post also reports on another email, in which a Norwegian oil consultant analyzed video leak sent to him by Mix. 'I do not think it can be ruled out that the flow at seabed is in the order of 40,000,' said the consultant. Only four days later, BPs' current chief executive, Bob Dudley, publicly defended the company's leak estimate (sent to Congress and federal officials) of 5,000 barrels per day. Dudley claimed that estimates that the oil flow was much higher were just 'scaremongering. 'Five thousand barrels a day, while inexact, is the best estimate of the industry experts,' Dudley said.

Travellers on board the Delta Airlines flight allegedly watched in horror as the young Chinese boy's parents laid down newspaper on his chair and encouraged him to relieve himself there and then.

Following the incident, Chinese social network Weibo came alive with commenters expressing their disgust, many of whom condemned the family for embarrassing their homeland. Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to MailOnline's request for comment. It is not clear exactly when the alleged incident happened but it is believed to have occurred some time around the middle of last week. It comes months after a disturbingly similar incident in which a child was photographed passing motion on a domestic flight in China in February.","Incident occurred on Delta Airlines flight when family laid newspaper on seat .

"Not content with creating a pair of fake legs so gamers can simulate lying on a girlfriend’s lap, Japanese developers have now gone a step further. Designers at Up Frontier have created a model with a fake pair of breasts that is fitted with pressure sensors, and connects to an Oculus Rift headset. When the wearer squeezes the model's breasts, a virtual character squeals with shock and places her arms over her chest. Scroll down for video . Designers at Up Frontier have created a model with a fake pair of breasts (pictured) that is fitted with pressure sensors, and connects to an Oculus Rift headset . A video of the breast simulator recently appeared on Japanese video share platform Nico Nico, in which a user called Ryuto was seen testing the breast simulator. In the video, Ryuto sees an image of the virtual girl on the Oculus Rift headset. Oculus was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. The firm is developing the leading VR headset - with a developer version on sale for $350 (£210). It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg . The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who have already unveiled their own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. As the player’s virtual hands close over the virtual girlfriend’s breasts, in the real world their hands are actually closing on the model bust. This is designed to make the experience visual and tactile. Upon squeezing the breasts - which are made using foam from a novelty mouse pad - the girl squeals with shock, covers her chest with her arms, and turns her eyes to the ground. It was created by the same firm that created a virtual reality girlfriend with fake legs. When wearing the headset, owners of the lap can rest their head on the virtual girl's legs and talk to her. Using a video-game controller they can also stand up and walk around, but if they stray too far from the girl she will give them a 'roundhouse kick.' The Oculus Rift headset has been handed out to independent developers to come up with modifications. A commercial version of the headset is due to go on sale at the start of next year. And the virtual reality breast groping headset, complete with model, will be on display at Japan's Oculus Rift Festival taking place this weekend.

"It is a mission set to solve the mystery of what happened to the atmosphere on Mars. Nasa's Maven spacecraft has given scientists their first glimpse of the upper atmosphere of the red planet, which has baffled them for decades. It is hoped the craft can explain why the red planet lost most of its atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Unprecedented ultraviolet images of the tenuous oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon coronas surrounding the Red Planet, taken by Nasa's Maven spacecraft . The hydrogen and oxygen coronas of Mars are the tenuous outer fringe of the planet's upper atmosphere, where the edge of the atmosphere meets space. In this region, atoms that were once a part of carbon dioxide or water molecules near the surface can escape to space. These molecules control the climate, so following them allows us to understand the history of Mars over the last four billion years and to track the change from a warm and wet climate to the cold, dry climate we see today. Maven observed the edges of the Martian atmosphere using the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS), which is sensitive to the sunlight reflected by these atoms. The first images from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft has provided scientists their first look at a storm of energetic solar particles on Mars. It has also produced unprecedented ultraviolet images of the tenuous oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon coronas surrounding the Red Planet, and yielded a comprehensive map of highly-variable ozone in the atmosphere underlying the coronas. The spacecraft, which entered Mars' orbit Sept. 21, now is lowering its orbit and testing its instruments. Maven was launched to Mars in November 2013, to help solve the mystery of how the Red Planet lost most of its atmosphere. 'All the instruments are showing data quality that is better than anticipated at this early stage of the mission,' said Bruce Jakosky, Maven Principal Investigator at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 'All instruments have now been turned on -- although not yet fully checked out -- and are functioning nominally. 'It's turning out to be an easy and straightforward spacecraft to fly, at least so far. 'It really looks as if we're headed for an exciting science mission.' Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are streams of high-speed particles blasted from the sun during explosive solar activity like flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Around Earth, SEP storms can damage the sensitive electronics on satellites. At Mars, they are thought to be one possible mechanism for driving atmospheric loss. A solar flare on Sept. 26 produced a CME that was observed by NASA satellites on both sides of the sun. Computer models of the CME propagation predicted the disturbance and the accompanying SEPs would reach Mars on Sept. 29. MAVEN's Solar Energetic Particle instrument was able to observe the onset of the event that day. The Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) instrument obtained these false-color images eight hours after the successful completion of Mars orbit insertion. The image shows the planet from an altitude of 36,500 km in three ultraviolet wavelength bands.  Blue shows the ultraviolet light from the sun scattered from atomic hydrogen gas in an extended cloud that goes to thousands of kilometers above the planet's surface.  Green shows a different wavelength of ultraviolet light that is primarily sunlight reflected off of atomic oxygen, showing the smaller oxygen cloud. Red shows ultraviolet sunlight reflected from the planet's surface; the bright spot in the lower right is light reflected either from polar ice or clouds. 'After traveling through interplanetary space, these energetic particles of mostly protons deposit their energy in the upper atmosphere of Mars,' said SEP instrument lead Davin Larson of the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. 'A SEP event like this typically occurs every couple weeks. 'Once all the instruments are turned on, we expect to also be able to track the response of the upper atmosphere to them.' 'With these observations, MAVEN's IUVS has obtained the most complete picture of the extended Martian upper atmosphere ever made,' said Remote Sensing Team member Mike Chaffin of the University of Colorado, Boulder. 'By measuring the extended upper atmosphere of the planet, MAVEN directly probes how these atoms escape to space. 'The observations support our current understanding that the upper atmosphere of Mars, when compared to Venus and Earth, is only tenuously bound by the Red Planet's weak gravity.' There will be about two weeks of additional instrument calibration and testing before Maven starts its primary science mission. This includes an end-to-end test to transmit data between NASA's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars and Earth using the MAVEN mission's Electra telecommunications relay. The mission aims to start full science gathering in early to mid-November.","First images reveal storm of energetic solar particles on Mars .

"Curved TVs may still seem like expensive gimmicks, but Samsung is hoping to attract those who aren't quite ready to give up their flat displays. It is launching the world’s first bendable TV in Korea from Friday, which goes from flat to curved at the press of a button. Viewers will also be able to control the acute angle of the curve on the 78-inch display, based on how many people are sat around it. Scroll down for video .

"Nato is getting ready to fight back against Russian aggression as it poses a ‘real and present danger’ to the Baltic States, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said yesterday. He told of the threat to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as Vladimir Putin continues to ‘test us’ by deploying submarines and warplanes near British territory. Warning of a new Cold War, he also said the UK must renew Britain’s nuclear capabilities as Russia steps up its own defences – but denied suggestions of an arms race. Scroll down for video . Visit: Defence secretary Michael Fallon (left) was speaking from Sierra Leone, where he was congratulating British troops on their work at defeating Ebola . Speaking from Sierra Leone, where he was congratulating British troops on their work at defeating Ebola, he said: ‘Putin is testing us. ‘The Russian defence spending is clearly worrying. Russia is modernising their conventional forces, they are modernising their nuclear forces and they are testing Nato so we need to respond.’ Mr Putin is as great a threat to Europe as the Islamic State, he said, adding: ‘We’ ve got to be ready for both. They are both very direct threats to Europe.’ He said he was worried that Russia could use the same subversive techniques which they used to annex Crimea in the Baltic States, including Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. He added: ‘It is a very real and present danger, he (Mr Putin) has been testing Nato all last year. ‘If you look at the number of flights, maritime activity… he flew two Russian bombers down the English Channel two weeks ago suddenly on a Wednesday morning. We had to scramble the jets very quickly to see them off.’ Russian aggression: Mr Fallon warned of the threat to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia as Vladimir Putin (centre, pictured yesterday) continues to 'test us' by deploying submarines and warplanes near British territory . In response to the fears, the UK will send troops to eight different sites across Eastern Europe and is creating a Nato ‘spearhead’ force lead by 1,000 British troops, ready to be deployed within 48 hours. His comments come after a Russian warship was intercepted by the Royal Navy this week as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel. Six Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 100 injured as they tried to withdraw from a contested town in the east of the country, it emerged yesterday. Deaths: Ukrainian troops on an armoured vehicle while pulling out of Debaltseve yesterday . Up to 2,500 servicemen trying to leave Debaltseve came under intense fire from Russia-backed separatists, who have now raised a flag in triumph over the embattled town. Renewed fighting threatens a fragile ceasefire brokered by European leaders on Sunday. Germany described the onslaught as ‘a serious strain’ on the deal but Russian president Vladimir Putin called on Kiev to admit defeat. The vessel – equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes – was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. The Secretary of State said: ‘We don’t want a war with Russia.’ But asked if we could defeat Russia if there was a war, he said: ‘Nato has to be ready for any kind of aggression with Russia whatever form it takes. Nato’s getting ready.’ America have accused Russia of violating a ceasefire agreed between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders last week as fighting has raged around the key strategic rail hub of Debaltseve. Samantha Power, the US ambassador to the UN, said it was ‘ironic to say the least’ that Russia had produced the motion at the same time as it was ‘backing an all-out assault’ in Ukraine. A Ukrainian military spokesman said the rebels had launched five artillery strikes on Debaltseve overnight, ‘grossly violating the peace accords.’ Referring to ‘Minsk 1’, a ceasefire agreement made between Russian and the Ukraine in September which failed, Mr Fallon said: ‘I’m worried about Putin, Minsk 2 looks to be like Minsk 1. ‘There’s no effective control of the border. I’m worried about his pressure on the Baltics, the way he is testing Nato – the submarines and the aircraft.’ He said if the peace deal collapsed, then Britain will renew its economic sanctions against Russia and review the ‘non-lethal’ equipment the country has been supplying to the Ukraine. Mr Fallon said they were keeping a decision to arm the Ukrainians ‘under review’ – but feared it could risk escalating the conflict. Conflict: Samantha Power (pictured), the US ambassador to the UN, said it was ‘ironic to say the least’ that Russia had produced a ceasefire motion at the same time as it was ‘backing an all-out assault’ in Ukraine . Asked if Britain was facing another Cold War, he said: ‘It looks pretty warm to me and it’s warming up. ‘You have tanks and armour rolling across the Ukrainian border and you have an Estonian border guard who has been captured and not yet returned. ‘You have jets being flown up the English Channel and you have submarines in the north sea- it looks to me like it's warming up.’ He said he was ‘outraged’ by Russia flying Bear Bombers south of Bournemouth a few weeks ago, adding: ‘It is the first time since the height of the Cold War that has happened and it just shows you, you need to respond each time he does something like that.’ ‘People are more worried about the defence of the UK than they have (been) for a long time’, he said, saying it would be ‘foolhardy’ to get rid of Trident at a time of heightened tensions. Asked if there was a danger the UK was going back to a nuclear arms race with Russia, he added: ‘We are not investing in a new type of Trident, we are simply replacing the submarines that are coming to the end of their life with four new ones.’ HMS Victorious: Mr Fallon said it would be 'foolhardy' to get rid of Trident at a time of heightened tensions . But he said Mr Putin’s activity underlined the need for Trident, adding: ‘They are modernising their nuclear forces and we need to modernise our submarines.’ He said it was ‘important’ that Britain had secured the 2 per cent spending of GDP on defence last year – but refused to say whether the 2 per cent Nato target would be hit following the election. He also stressed the importance of the building up of a 5,000-strong Nato high readiness task force by 2017. It will be led by 1,000 British personnel who would be ready to be respond to Russian aggression within 48 hours and troops will be stationed in eight different locations across Eastern Europe. He added: ‘You’ve got the Americans retracting some of their bases now in Europe, we have to step up, which is why the commitment to the Eastern bases is so important.’","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon tells of threat to Latvia and Lithuania .

"A Brazilian model accused of racking up $40,000 worth of charges Josh Brolin's credit card and shoplifting nearly $10,000 in clothes from Saks Fifth Avenue made a brief appearance in court yesterday. Giselle Oliveira, 34, is charged with making a number of unauthorized clothing purchases  on the Hollywood heartthrob's American Express account between October 2010 and January 2013. Prosecutors allege that the Latin American model also filled her shoulder bag with 'four pairs of pants, two dresses, two jackets and one scarf' totaling $9,485 at the New York department store. Brazilian model Giselle Oliveira, 34, has appeared in court after pleading not guilty to charges of theft . According to the New York Daily News, Oliveira appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court yesterday but the judge spent just half an hour with her lawyers, after trying and failing to find a resolution to the case. 'Nothing happened today. The matter has been adjourned to Nov. 25,' Oliveira's lawyer Ellen Resnick told the newspaper. Oliveira, who is the former girlfriend of Mambo Kings actor Armand Assante, has pleaded not guilty to charges of theft. She has previously claimed her crimes was part of her work as a cooperator with the Department of Homeland Security. She said she had been involved with some bad people including 'a Hispanic man named J' who 'threatened to show my boyfriend naked pictures of me with another man', the New York Daily News reported. Oliveira allegedly used No Country for Old Men star Josh Brolin's card to make $40,000 worth of purchases . The model was released on $10,000 bond, and has reportedly been staying at 64-year-old Assante's sprawling property   north of New York City - although the couple are no longer together. Earlier this year, Page Six reported that Assante was so broke he was forced  to borrow nearly $2,000 to get  Oliveira out of jail. According to the newspaper, Oliveira appeared in a Manhattan court saying she's been living 'the simple life' with Assante at his home. 'Armand and I live a very simple life, she said. 'I am a simple girl who comes from a farm in Brazil. I love to cook. I love to clean.'

"Sister Madonna Buder isn't your average nun, nor your average 82-year-old woman for that matter. This spirited Washington-based senior has completed more than 340 triathlons - 45 of them the notoriously grueling 'Ironmans' - and she only started when she was 48. 'People often ask me how I train for these kinds of these arduous events,' she tells Cosmopolitan magazine. 'And to that I say, ""I just boogie.""' The Iron Nun: Sister Madonna Buder (pictured) has finished more than 340 grueling triathlons in her life, and she only ran her first race when she was 48 years old . Sister Buder says she was never 'into' running as a child, but she was clearly born with a determined streak from the start. She decided she wanted to become a nun at the age of 14, and by the age of 23, she had entered a convent near her home in Missouri. She later transferred to the Sisters for Christian Community in Spokane, Washington State, where she didn't take up running as a hobby until she was 48 years old. When, a short while later, she approached her bishop, Father John, to seek his approval on whether it was OK for her to enter a race, he replied: 'Sister, I wish some of my priests would do what you're doing.' The deal was sealed then and there, and Sister Buder ran her very first 8.2 mile race, 'ass-backwards' she says, because the only place she had ever trained before was on a tennis court. No excuses: Sister Buder, pictured at the Hawii Ironman World Championship at the age of 77, didn't have her own bike, so trained for the race using her nephew's bike instead, during visits to her Missouri home . After that, she joined a running group, where she thrived on the group mentality, and it was here she eventually learned of the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii. Her first thoughts were of how claustrophobic she would feel swimming along with so many others, her second was that she couldn't conceive of sitting in a bike saddle for so long, and her third was that she simply had to try. The steely nun competed in her first triathlon in Branbridge, Ireland, at the age of 52. The course was hilly, she swam in the 'darn cold' water (before wetsuits had been invented), and she was riding a second hand men's bike she had scored from a police auction. Nevertheless, she finished the race and cooled off with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Omen: The spirited nun, pictured here blessing a fellow athlete before a 2007 race, took part in the 2013 Boston marathon and was twice 'randomly' urged to memorize a police officer's phone number before the bombings . Next stop: Hawaii, where she broke world records as the oldest women ever to complete the course. She practiced on her nephew's bike during visits to her parents' home in Misouri during the run-up, and ended up finishing just one hour before the race's 17-hour cut-off time. Sister Buder says it was here she first earned her 'Iron Nun' title, but it wasn't until seven years later, when she finished the Ironman Canada race in 16 hours 59 minutes, that she become the overall Global Ironman record holder. Asked how she trains for these triathlons, she says she runs to church every day and bikes 40 miles to swim in a lake near her home. She also jogs to her regular visits at the local jail, where she reads scriptures to inmates - an activity which she says makes her feel 'so blessed' to come home from. As for her diet, Sister Buder sticks to a mostly raw diet of fruits and vegetables, but incorporates carbs and protein powder into her meals, and she says she 'listens' to what her body tells her it needs. I love the feeling I get when I whiz past people younger than me and they say, ""I want to be like you when I get to your age!"" Well, not entirely. The keen athlete admits she fractured her pelvis in a recent bike accident, but as well as water jogging at the YMCA while she heals, she also hits the elliptical trainer - 'probably' against her doctor's wishes. It's clearly a hobby she feels she can't let go. 'I don't know what I'd do without running!' she exclaims. 'I love the feeling I get when I whiz past people younger than me and they say, ""I want to be like you when I get to your age!""' And while she cherishes the opportunity to be a source of inspiration to others, claiming she races now mostly out of 'camaraderie', she does have certain fellow-runners place her a little too high on the pedestal. '[Some] treat me differently because I'm a Sister,' she confesses. 'I feel like they think I'm supposed to be their mascot and pray for good weather for us or something.' Not every race she has run has been a blessing however. Sister Buder ran in the 2013 Boston marathon, where she recalls receiving an all-together spooky omen in the hours before the bombing disasters struck. Book deal: Sister Buder has written an inspiring book about her life . The morning before the race, she was approached by a police officer who gave her his card and told her to call him if she ever needed anything. Thinking little of it, she thanked the officer and held on to his card. A little later, a young boy approached her out of the blue and said he thought she should 'memorize' the phone number on the card. She took the child's advice. As she was approaching the 21st mile of the race, she heard sirens and noticed fire engines begin to rush to the scene. Panicked and 'numb', and unsure of what to do or where to go, she remembered the police officer's number and called it. The officer navigated her out of her confused and terrified state and she says that while her heart 'broke' for those injured and killed, it taught her a valuable lesson about 'paying attention' to her instincts. Asked what she would say to her younger self if she could go back in time, Sister Buder says her advice would be to live by what you 'do' rather than what you 'say' and to always focus on how old you 'feel' not how old you actually are. Finally: 'Patience' she says, admitting that she still struggles to slow down, and to 'stop and smell the roses.'","Sister Buder is known as the 'Iron Nun' and only ran her first race when she was 48 .

"Anxiously waiting for a phone call home is a scenario that any parent will understand. This evening that call was coming from 500 million miles, after a decade away and two and half years without contact. And it was late. The Rosetta spacecraft was due to send in a signal to the European Space Agency at 5.30pm this evening. Scroll down for video... Rosetta was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov/Gerasimenko. it is due to arrive at the comet in August this year . Rosetta, named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system. The probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times, picking up energy from Earth and Mars to line it up with its final destination: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation. Later this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet’s surface in November. ‘It could come any moment now,’ said operations manager Andrea Accomazzo. ‘We could get the signal at any time.’ Eventually, at 6.18pm, a tiny beep came through, a spike on a graph that showed the £1billion spacecraft was still intact. A few seconds later the all-clear message ‘Hello World!’ was sent out on social networking sites. The Rosetta craft is hurtling through space in a ten-year long pursuit of an icy comet. For . the last 31 months it has been in hibernation, too far away from the . sun for its solar panels to generate enough power to keep it going. But today, as it closed in on its target, it was woken up to prepare for several months of delicate manoeuvres. At 10am an alarm triggered a process by which its systems were slowly warmed up and turned on. The process was due to have taken just over seven hours before a signal was sent to Earth, a process that took 45 minutes. The European Space Agency (ESA) received the all-clear message 'Hello World!' from its Rosetta spacecraft, 500 million miles away, shortly after 6pm . The signal was received by Nasa's Goldstone ground station in California at 18:18 GMT, during the first window of opportunity the spacecraft had to communicate with Earth. It was immediately confirmed in ESA's space operations centre in Darmstadt (pictured) A screenshot of the moment the signal was received from Rosetta. The spacecraft's orbit has brought it back to within 673 million km from the sun . The Rosetta mission will perform several historical firsts, including the first time a spacecraft orbits a comet rather than just whizzing by it to snap some fly-by pictures, and the first time a probe has landed on a comet's nucleus. Rosetta is also the first mission to venture beyond the main asteroid belt relying solely on solar cells for power generation, which is also why it had to be put into a deep sleep for 957 days. 'It has been so far away from the sun that the solar rays were not able to generate enough energy to safely operate the spacecraft, said Rosetta spacecraft operations manager Andrea, who has been working on the Rosetta mission since 1997. But either Rosetta’s four clocks had fallen out of sync way out in space, or the warm-up took a little longer than anticipated. Eventually, 48 minutes behind schedule, the message came through to the operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, to huge cheers. ‘It has been a fantastic few moments of pure terror,’ said one exhausted organiser. Rosetta is now around 5.6 million miles from its destination, the comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and closing on the object at half a mile a second. The spacecraft, which was launched by in French Guiana in 2004, will now spend several months approaching and orbiting the comet. Once it has found for a suitable landing site for the box-like Philae lander it will attempt a landing in November. Philae will also capture panoramic images of the view from the comet’s surface with an on-board camera. Scientists hope Rosetta will answer important questions about the origins of the solar system and the way comets evolve and develop. Rosetta was put to sleep to conserve power as it headed to regions as distant as the planet Jupiter, where the sun’s weak rays provide only limited amounts of energy. Unlike other long-distance space probes the craft has no nuclear batteries and instead relies on electricity generated by ultra-sensitive 15-metre long solar panels. Scientists planned to hibernate Rosetta for 957 days before bringing its main systems back on line. For the coldest, loneliest leg of the mission, as Rosetta travelled out towards the orbit of Jupiter, the spacecraft was put into deep-space hibernation . Later this year, Rosetta will complete its cruise towards the comet, meeting with it in August, before putting its Philae lander onto the comet's surface in November .

One of Rosetta's first tasks will be to scout for a suitable landing location for its piggyback-riding Philae probe. Scientists are particularly keen to conduct organic chemistry experiments on samples drilled out from inside the comet's body. ‘It would be really interesting to find out whether the organic chemistry that is relevant for life is there on comets,’ Professor Ulamec said. Engineers who designed the lander did not know what type of terrain they would find on the comet's surface. It is outfitted with twin harpoons laced with tethers that will be fired into the comet's surface to anchor Philae and keep it from bouncing back into space after touchdown. The spacecraft will be involved a high-speed chase later this year followed by a delicate dance around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

'Finally when they got it open they yelled, ‘Gun,’ and then all of a . sudden you see them shoot him with a Taser. And he got shot with a Taser . and he went down to the floor, and then they handcuffed him.' A witness called police after Koppenhaver called attention to himself in a physical altercation with a woman at the hotel, KTLA reported. Officers . say the fighter, whose birth name is Jon Koppenhaver, is the primary . suspect in a dispute that left his ex-girlfriend and her friend with . serious injuries. Adult film actress Christy Mack says he knocked out her teeth, broke her bones and sheared off her hair in the Aug. 8 attack. The welterweight fighter has had previous run-ins with the law and missed two years of his career while he spent time in jail.

Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he . broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego,' Mack wrote on Twitter. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed . in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; . once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention . to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me . out and beat my face. I  have . no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries . that resulted from my beating.

Mack said that Koppenhaver had long been abusive in their relationship but that this beating had made her fear for her life . 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.' Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her.

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it . behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the . fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the . neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought . to the hospital and treated for my injuries.'

"An obese mother who refused to be seen with her daughters for ten years to protect them from cruel jibes about her size can now proudly go out in public with them - after losing 14 stone. Lisa Copeland, 46, saw her weight increase to 23 and a half stone after the birth of her first daughter Victoria. Her daily diet consisted of whole packs of biscuits and five Yorkshire puddings at a time, and she ate takeaways five nights a week as well as cooking large meals for her family. Slimming down: Lisa Copeland, 46, has shed 14 stone behind closed doors with strict dieting and exercise so she can enjoy a 'normal' life with her three daughters . Losing it: The super slimmer went from a healthy 12 stone to 23st7lb after the birth to her first daughter Victoria. She would regularly eat whole packets of biscuits . She shrugged off personal taunts but was heartbroken when Victoria came home in tears from school at the age of 13 to say she was being bullied because of her mother. Lisa, married to accountant Rob, 50, vowed to slim - but decided to do so in the privacy of her home to spare her girls more embarrassment. She embarked on a ten-year weight loss battle and for five years of it denied herself many of the joys of motherhood. She missed out on many things as Victoria and her younger sisters Rebecca and Abigail grew up, like shopping, playing in the park and collecting them from parties. But her secret battle saw her drop 20 dress sizes from a 28 to a sleek size eight and she is now a trim nine stone. Her slimming success has seen her being appointed a Weight Watchers leader as a model to others. Cruel jibes: She shrugged off personal taunts but was heartbroken when Victoria came home in tears from school at the age of 13 to say she was being bullied because of her mother . And Lisa is now finally venturing from her home in Hornchurch, Essex to enjoy shopping trips with her girls Victoria, 25, Rebecca, 22, and Abigail, 15. Lisa said: 'I was absolutely devastated that my child was being bullied because of me. 'I couldn't believe how unhappy she was - and I was mortified that it was all my fault. It felt like I was bullying my own child and I thought if I don't nip this in the bud now then my other children might be bullied too. 'I got up the next day and changed my life. I got up and made sure I knew what my diet was going to be.' Out and about: Lisa is now finally venturing from her home in Hornchurch, Essex to enjoy shopping trips with her girls . She added: 'It meant I didn't have anything to do with my children for about five years. 'I didn't want to go out, I didn't want people to know I was Rob's wife, I didn't want people to laugh at my children. Health problems: As her weight grew she also developed physical symptoms including breathlessness, lethargy and painful sores . 'It was easier not to go out as a family and Victoria actually has no memory of going out as a family. 'As I lost more weight I became more confident, but it has taken me this long to finally get over the hurt I caused my children.' Lisa, a former gymnastics coach, said she found herself trapped in a vicious cycle of comfort eating as her growing weight shattered her confidence. She also began suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) over the state of her house. The highlight of her day was tucking into cake instead of outdoors playing with her daughters. As her weight grew she also developed physical symptoms including breathlessness, lethargy and painful sores. Lisa signed up to Weight Watchers in 2002 and started swimming three times a week - although not with her children. In the first eight years she lost more than 11 stone and gradually started to feel better about her appearance. She has now lost an extra three stone and is finally happy with her weight - after more than 25 years. Daughter Victoria, a marketing executive from London, said: 'I can't remember spending much time with my mum. 'I was quite an active child and she was never really there. 'When it was a sports day or parents evening at school you would always see friends with both their parents there. 'For me it was normal to have an overweight mum but looking back I do wish she'd been there so I had some fond memories.' She added: 'It's amazing to have her back. What she has done is fantastic. We all love being able to finally go out together as a family.' Happy times: She has now lost an extra three stones and is finally happy with her weight - after more than 25 years .","Lisa Copeland's weight rose to over 23 stone after first pregnancy .

"These adorable pictures show Julian Becker and his 165 pound pet Max, the shaggy Newfoundland that never leaves his best friend's side. Five-year-old Julian's mother Stasha started taking pictures of the odd couple every day before they got in the family car in Whidbey Island, Washington state, U.S., although both Julian and Max were born in England. With her husband away regularly in his role as a U.S. naval officer, the pictures began as a way of keeping in touch. Found you! Max (left) and Julian are best friends and pose for a picture with different props every day . Shelter: Julian and Max snuggle under an umbrella. The pair were both born in the UK, and Julian still drinks tea in the morning . They have evolved into a charming document of a boy's love for a four-legged friend he began walking with his mother from the age of three. Mother Stasha says: 'My husband is a naval officer and I am a self employed lifestyle photographer. My son Julian and Max, our Newfoundland, were both born in England, where we were stationed before moving back to the States. 'My boy still drinks tea every morning but has mostly lost the accent. Max still barks with a Yorkshire twang. Max will turn six in May and Julian is five. They have been together all day, every day since Julian was born. Quirky: Some of the pictures, such as the one on the left where a pineapple adorns Max's head, are just plain bizarre . Superdog: The caped canine watches over his human friend . Comedy: The pair share their funny side and enjoy a bro hug at the beach . Contact: The pictures are a way of staying in touch with his father, a naval officer . Den: Max peeps out from a shelter on a sunny day . 'I started taking photos of them in front of the garage everyday before we got into the minivan when I joined Instagram. It was mostly to send them to family and my husband when he travels. 'Although my son usually refused to have his pictures taken with my camera he warmed up to the iPhone shots quickly and started directing them soon after.' Pose: Max is incredibly protective of Julian and the two go for a walk every day . Items that appear in shots are usually things Julian takes for show and tell at his preschool or gadgets he wants to take with him to the beach. She added: 'Max usually sits there and takes orders from Julian. I just snap a few and post the photo that made me giggle the most. 'When I take photos on our hikes and adventures I tend to click as moments evolve too. Very rarely will I ask if they can stand still for me and when I do photos never have the same ""soul"".' She says Max never takes his eyes off Julian when they are out and he likes to swim. She said: 'He is always slightly-to-very damp. He endures brushing and likes to be scratched just above his tail. 'The only time he barks is at whales, one particular UPS guy and if you stop scratching him before he had enough. He snores loudly and loves sleeping outside in cold weather. 'Julian, true to his NY Italian roots, talks non-stop. He loves hiking, documentaries and golf. He is pretty much great at everything he does, including bossing his 165 pound dog around.' Max's pet peeve is random strangers suggesting he should put a saddle on and ride his dog. Buddies: When Julian's boat was blown into the centre of a lake, Max swam out and retrieved it for him .

I believe the bond between them is strong because they take care of each other. Julian opens the door for Max to come in and out of the back yard and gives him a treat every morning. 'Max protects him by putting himself between strangers or other dogs. Just the other day Max rescued Julian's little toy wooden sail boat by swimming out when the wind blew it into the middle of the lake. 'My son cried telling him to go and get it and he sure did.

"Electric cars may help cut down on fossil fuel use, but their limited range has so far been their downfall. Now, BMW believes it has come up with a solution by using street lighting to charge up cars while they're parked, allowing them to run for longer. The German car manufacturer said it will run a pilot project in Munich next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks to power their vehicles. BMW has made two prototype 'Light and Charge' street lights, which combine Light Emitting Diodes (LED) with the company's ChargeNow recharging stations. The firm will run a pilot in Munich next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks to power vehicles . BMW has made two prototype 'Light and Charge' street lights, which combine Light Emitting Diodes (LED) with the company's ChargeNow recharging stations. 'Seamless charging infrastructure is essential if we want to see more electric vehicles on the road in our cities in the future,' Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of the board of management of BMW AG, said. The Munich pilot will install the first charging lights, which can be grafted straight onto the existing local authority street lighting infrastructure, BMW said. These additional charging stations can be used by as many drivers as possible, regardless of vehicle model and electricity provider. Two street lights (artist's impression left) are already installed in front of the BMW headquarters (right) and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app . Two street lights are already installed in front of the BMW headquarters and drivers can pay to charge their cars via a mobile phone app. The company  has already developed some of the most advanced electric cars, including the i3 city vehicle and i8 hybrid. But electric cars have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to their limited operating range, the scarcity of charging stations and the time it takes to recharge them. Motorways are to become ‘electric superhighways’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery-powered cars. ‘Supercharging stations’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year, enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is fitting the devices, which can charge the Tesla electric cars his company makes, in 20 minutes, giving a range of 130 miles (209km) . This is significantly faster than most current electric cars, which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles (160km). It means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across Britain without concerns about running out of power, known as ‘range anxiety’. The first network will stretch from Dover to London along the M20, cover the entire M25 and follow the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham. Tesla declined to say which service stations would be used, but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the South Mimms services at the junction of the M25 and the A1 in Hertfordshire. In addition to developing street lighting, BMW has already invested in software and applications that aim to help drivers of electric cars find parking spaces and charging stations. The group also recently met with rival Tesla Motors to discuss the availability of electric vehicle charging stations. In September, Daimler said it had bought my taxi and RideScout, two smartphone applications that will help the maker of Mercedes-Benz limousines provide services to people who do not own cars.

"The Highland estate made famous by the popular TV series Monarch of the Glen has gone on the market for the first time in 200 years for £7million. Balavil House was known as Kilwillie Castle and its 7,000 acres near Kinguissie, Inverness, as the fictional estate of Glenbogle by fans of the BBC programme, starring the late Richard Briers. The estate, which allows visitors to stalk red deer, shoot grouse and pheasant and even catch salmon, has been owned by Allan Macpherson-Fletcher's family since 1790. Balavil House, the Highland estate which featured in the popular TV series Monarch of the Glen has gone on the market for a primetime price of £7million . Balavil House and its 7,000 acres near Kinguissie, Inverness - known as Kilwillie Castle by fans of the BBC programme has been owned by Allan Macpherson-Fletcher's family since 1790 . Monarch of the Glen, first aired in 2000 and followed Archie MacDonald, a young restaurateur is called back to his childhood home of Glenbogle where he is told he is the new Laird of Glenbogle . But now he wants to retire and pass the land onto a younger shooting enthusiast. He said: 'Balavil has provided great fun for family, friends and clients over the years but, after running the estate for 40 years, the time has come to retire. 'We hope that someone with vision will take the estate forward into the next chapter of its rich history.' Andrew Rettie, of selling agents Strutt and Parker, said: 'A jewel in the crown of Scottish sporting estates, Balavil encompasses the very best the Highlands can offer, from spectacular sport to a house made for entertaining.

"A ‘graveyard’ of more than 70 trains from all over the United States was discovered by a young photographer and urban explorer in a forest in North Carolina. The trains, once filled with people, now sit decaying on winding tracks stretching through the snowy forest, infusing visitors with a certain apocalyptic feel. Among the many abandoned trains discovered and photographed by 24-year-old Johnny Joo are a passenger train from Philadelphia and several disused subway cars. There is also a cracked and broken New York street bus. Rusting away: A Pennsylvania line sits across from a former Cleveland line in a North Carolina forest . Joo, who has documented abandoned landmarks in America before, said the trains were collected by a man who once fixed them. Over the years, as certain train sets were no longer wanted, the man let them fall into disrepair, Joo said. 'There had to be 78 or so different cars all connected, some in better condition than others, while some were completely rusted out and it was almost as if we could fall through the floors at any moment.' Abandoned: The only red car within this collection, photographer Johnny Joo is still unsure of its origins . Ghost: Once filled with people, the trains sit decaying on winding tracks stretching through the snowy forest . Train graveyard: An old subway from under the streets of a large city transit system . Piles of leaves and dirt fill the compartments and one carriage's red paint, now faded and covered in rust, offers a stark contrast to the snowy landscape in North Carolina. The trains are from big cities such as New York City and Philadelphia, but have been left to rot in this unusual graveyard.

"Researchers have revealed exactly what facial features lead us to create a first impression of someone - ans say it could change the way we take selfies. They say even in a single image such as a selfie, small changes in the dimensions of a face can make it appear more trustworthy, dominant or attractive. For the first time researchers have now discovered the features that are associated with particular social judgements. Scroll down for video . We judge faces on three factors, the researchers say -  Approachability, dominance and youthful-attractiveness. Here, faces are ranked from least on the left to most on the right in a 'key' allowing researchers to rank faces. First impressions are created by three distinct factors: . Approachability (do they want to help or harm me?) Dominance (can they help or harm me?) Youthful-attractiveness (perhaps representing whether they’d be a good romantic partner - or a rival) The new study by researchers in the Department of Psychology at the University of York shows that it is possible to accurately predict first impressions using measurements of physical features in everyday images of faces, such as those found on social media. 'Showing how these first impressions can be captured from very variable images of faces offers insight into how our brains achieve this seemingly remarkable perceptual feat,' said Professor Andy Young, of the Department of Psychology at York. When we look at a picture of a face we rapidly form judgements about a person’s character, for example whether they are friendly, trustworthy or competent. Even though it is not clear how accurate they are, these first impressions can influence our subsequent behaviour (for example, judgements of competence based on facial images can predict election results). The impressions we create through images of our faces ('avatars' or 'selfies') are becoming more and more important in a world where we increasingly get to know one another online rather than in the flesh, the researchers say. Previous research has shown that many different judgements can be boiled down to three distinct 'dimensions': approachability (do they want to help or harm me?), dominance (can they help or harm me?) and youthful-attractiveness (perhaps representing whether they’d be a good romantic partner - or a rival!). To investigate the basis for these judgements the research team took ordinary photographs from the web and analyzed physical features of the faces to develop a model that could accurately predict first impressions. The team analysed hundreds of data points on each face . To investigate the basis for these judgements the research team took ordinary photographs from the web and analyzed physical features of the faces to develop a model that could accurately predict first impressions. Each of 1,000 faces was described in terms of 65 different features such as “eye height”, “eyebrow width” and so on. By combining these measures the model could explain more than half of the variation in human raters’ social judgements of the same faces. Reversing the process it was also possible to create new cartoon-like faces that produced predictable first impressions in a new set of judges. These images also illustrate the features that are associated with particular social judgements.

Reversing the process it was also possible to create new cartoon-like faces that produced predictable first impressions in a new set of judges. These images also illustrate the features that are associated with particular social judgements. The study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS), shows how important faces and specific images of faces can be in creating a favourable or unfavourable first impression. It provides a scientific insight into the processes that underlie these judgements and perhaps into the instinctive expertise of those (such as casting directors, portrait photographers, picture editors and animators) who create and manipulate these impressions professionally. The researchers users pictures taken from social media sites and modelled them to 'cartoon' versions using key attributes . Richard Vernon, a PhD student who was part of the research team, said: 'Showing that even supposedly arbitrary features in a face can influence people's perceptions suggests that careful choice of a photo could make (or break) others’ first impressions of you.' Fellow PhD student, Clare Sutherland, said: 'We make first impressions of others so intuitively that it seems effortless - I think it's fascinating that we can pin this down with scientific models. 'I'm now looking at how these first impressions might change depending on different cultural or gender groups of perceivers or faces.'","Team created 'guide' images showing the three factors we use to create first impressions - Approachability, dominance and youthful-attractiveness .

"Cara Delevingne might be racking up the showbusiness column inches but in the fashion industry there's only one contender for the title of the world's top model and her name is Joan Smalls. The Puerto Rican is ranked number one in the models.com industry hot list of best models thanks to the constant demand for her from leading photographers and fashion editors, global brands, magazines and fashion show producers. And her latest job, which sees her smouldering in a shoot for this week's edition of net-a-porter's digital magazine, The Edit, proves why she still holds the prestigious top spot. Smouldering: Joan Smalls, who is ranked number one on models.com's hot list, poses for net-a-porter this week . Under the creative direction of Editor-in-Chief Lucy Yeomans and shot by industry heavyweight Mario Testino, Joan models the famed photographer's exclusive MATE clothing and accessories collection. Speaking about working with friend and fellow Latin American, Mario Testino, Joan said: 'It is always such an honor to work with Mario, so I love that he mentioned me in connection to this collection. 'He always creates such a beautiful story that embraces you and takes you on a ride. 'He loves what he does so much. Whenever we shoot with him, we have to travel the day before just to do fittings. Dream team: Shot by industry heavyweight Mario Testino, Joan models the photographer's exclusive MATE collection . 'Mario will sit down with the stylist and he will go through every single look. He has an opinion and feels very strongly about what he shoots, and he says the fitting is the best part of the process. 'He is as much a stylist as a photographer, and is involved in every stage,' she said. But Joan doesn't just show her strength in editorial shoots.

'We stare each other out as we walk past and try to make the other girl smile. I play with Karlie [Kloss], but she has her game face on and never cracks, but on Karmen [Pedaru] and Abbey Lee [Kershaw] it works.

She may have numerous campaigns under her belt (she is currently the face of H&M denim, and is also starring in campaigns for Prabal Gurung and Estée Lauder) but Joan is still thinking big for the future. 'I think of myself as an empire. I am super- ambitious, but also believe in superstition, so I never show all my cards. 'It is about being associated with luxury brands, being in fragrance and cosmetic campaigns, or creating your own line of whatever it may be, so people associate your name with something, rather than what you are just the face of.'

"Yesterday details of Poundworld's latest bargain brassiere sent shoppers in to a spin as the company boasted that it expected to sell over one million units. Featuring a sensible design and a £1 price tag the nylon bra may lack the style and sex appeal of costlier rivals but is expected to fly off the shelves after trials of the ‘comfort bra’ in selected shops last weekend proved a huge success, with almost 100,000 snapped up in hours. Poundworld bosses are expecting to sell . over one million units by introducing the design in more than 200 branches . nationwide, where it will be sold alongside their more established . ranges of sweets, toys and toiletries. The bra comes in black, white and nude . nylon and sizes range from medium to extra large and the manufacturer . claims the curve-hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth . shape with no bumps or lumps. But does it really work? And will any woman with a bust size bigger than an A cup actually wear it? We asked banker Jessica Smith, 26, from Oxford and Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three from Leeds, to take it for a spin. Scroll down for video . Tried and tested: Jessica Smith gave the £1 bra a spin, but what did she think? Jump around: Jessica said the bra was quite supportive so may be ideal for the gym . Jessica, who admits that she normally wears lingerie that offers a lot more, wasn't impressed. She said: 'It's more of a top than a bra. Surprisingly the fabric feels fine, not too cheap and nasty, but I'm not convinced. Normally the only thing I buy in pound shops is bleach.' When asked if she would wear it after the trial in the MailOnline offices she said: 'Absolutely no way, it's not very sexy is it?' 'My verdict is, it's not at all sexy, but I might possibly wear it for the gym because the support is OK.' Not so sexy: 'It's not very sexy is it?' retorted Jessica whilst donning the bra . 'Comfort wise, it's wonderful. It feels like you're not wearing anything, which I think is part of the problem. I like my bras to do something!' 'But it is great value for money,' she added. Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three, however, was impressed. She described the bra, which comes in black, white and nude nylon, as packaged in a simple way not unlike many you see in supermarkets. She said: 'It is a crop top/sports bra style. I have 38E breasts so chose the XL which is sized as 16-18. 'It was plenty big enough to cover me. Very easy to put on. The material is soft and comfortable but fairly thin (this could cause some embarrassment in cold weather!). Road test: The bras are only available in black, white or nylon and are expected to sell millions . Supportive: As Jessica jumped around, she agreed that the bra was very supportive . Flattering? The bra claims to be flattering and help with posture but Jessica felt like she wasn't wearing anything at all . 'It only offers modest support - a quick skip across the garden with my 3-year-old daughter made it clear that any running in it would cause too much discomfort. Tried and tested: Cassie Williams, a 33-year-old barrister and mother-of-three, put the £1 bra to the test and she was impressed . 'Having said that, I have a large chest and it gave a relatively decent lift and cleavage so I expect a smaller breasted woman would be more suited to it.' The manufacturer claims the curve-hugging design gives women the perfect fit and a smooth shape with no bumps or lumps. Cassie said: 'It's not the prettiest bra but that style of bra never is in my opinion. 'I wouldn't wear it to feel sexy but it isn't ugly. 'I was wearing it on a very warm day and it didn't feel uncomfortable or cause me to feel too warm.' Cassie, who normally buys bras from Marks and Spencer's Limited collection or Autograph range (Poundworld boasts that its bra is £14 cheaper than the lowest-priced Marks & Spencer rival), concluded: 'For £1 I was impressed I have to say. 'I've tried on bras in that style when pregnant (as you can't have underwire) at a cost of £10-£15 and it was on a par with them. 'It says to hand wash which is a bit inconvenient and I haven't washed it to know how it would hold up but it looks relatively well made. 'If you are on a budget and you don't need too much support I'd say give it a go!' The retailer admits it will make a loss on . the product, but hopes it will lure more women into its stores. However, it cannot claim to be the . cheapest bra to go on sale in the UK. Two years ago, the 99p Stores . chain sold a padded bra with decorative bow in 150 branches nationwide. It's a no from me: Jessica said she would 'absolutely never wear the bra' Tried and tested: The new bra has been trialled in selected stores and will go on sale nationwide today .

"Cartel princess: Aspiring Mexican pop singer Melissa Plancarte sparked a backlash after posing in this photo in a dress featuring the symbol of her drug lord father's cartel, Knights Templar . The war on Mexico's deadly cartels spread from the streets to the web after the daughter of a notorious drug lord sparked an outrage by posing in an outfit featuring the symbol of her father’s gang. The controversial selfie that appeared on Instagram shows Melissa Plancarte, an aspiring pop singer known by her telling stage name, 'La Princessa De La Banda,' in a skimpy dress emblazoned with a massive red cross against a white background. The emblem best associated with medieval crusaders has been adopted by the Knights Templar cartel, which is allegedly controlled by Plancarte's father, Enrique Plancarte Solis, and a half-dozen others. The ruthless criminal organization has been spreading a reign of terror in parts of the Michoacan state in western Mexico. Melissa Plancarte's alleged sartorial tribute to her father's life of crime comes at a time when vigilante groups are battling cartels in Mexico's villages and towns. This week, Mexican officials announced that they have legalized the country's growing self-defense groups following the capture of Melissa Plancarte’s relative - one of the four top leaders of the Knights Templar drug cartel. Scroll down for videos . Historic emblem: A red cross on a white background is known as the sign of the Knights Templar crusaders, but it has been adopted by a violent Mexican drug cartel that goes by the same name . Bombshell: It has been revealed that Melissa Plancarte is the daughter of one of seven leaders of the Knights Templar cartel, Enrique Plancarte Solis . Telling nickname: Melissa goes by the stage name 'La Princessa De La Banda,' loosely translated as 'cartel princess' Melissa. the self-styled 'cartel princess,' and her brother, Enrique Jr, or 'Kike', who is also an aspiring singer, have been posting glamour shots of themselves on Facebook and Intagram, and sharing their music videos on YouTube. Recording under the label of Planrécords, the Plancarte siblings have performed with a number of well-known Mexican singers and bands, Hispanically Speaking blog reported. Relative busted: On January 27, Mexican officials announced the capture of senior Knights Templar member Donisio Loya Plancarte, who is believed to be Melissa Plancarte's great-uncle . Last week, Miss Plancarte addressed her relationship with her notorious father, releasing a statement on her Facebook page in which she sought to distance herself from Enrique Plancarte's criminal activities. ‘Regarding my father, I naturally love him, but I am not the one to judge him nor I am responsible for his acts, and I don’t have any regrets,’ she said in the statement. ‘I’m totally oblivious to the situations that people are linking me with. ‘My world, my dream and my passion is music and I have been devoted to it for a while, at the same time I focus on my studies. My career can not be tainted by events that I don’t take part in.’ The voluptuous blonde added that her career in music has been 'transparent and honest,’ according to Latin Times. ‘I think the focus of the media and people involved in the conflicts in my state must be something else and not my music and my career since it has nothing to do with it,’ she noted. The controversy over the Plancarte family exploded after it was discovered that Melissa and Kike jr were hired by the Michoacan government to perform at a public fair in 2012, Blouin News reported. To make matters worse, it has been revealed that Melissa got a permission to shoot a music video with Cuban singer Julio Camejo in the historic Michoacan Palace of Justice. Taking matters into their own hands: The rise of cartel violence and homicides in the state of Michoacan have sparked the emergence of well-armed vigilante groups . Street fighters: A vigilante member of the community police aims his weapon after entering the village of Paracuaro in Michoacan state, January 4 . Mexican officials announced that they have legalized the country's growing self-defense groups boasting about 20,000 members . PR war: It is believed that vigilantes are responsible for publicizing Melissa Plancarte's alleged connection to the Knights Templar cartel . The string of explosive disclosures about the ‘cartel princess’ and her brother have been widely attributed to the local vigilante groups, which have been waging a public relations war against the Knights Templar and their families. The scandal comes just days after Mexico announced that it had captured one of Enrique Plancarte Solis’s relatives, Dionisio Loya Plancarte, known as ‘El Tio’ ('The Uncle') - a top member of the Knights Templar. It is believed that Dionisio Plancarte got his nickname because he is the uncle of Melissa Plancarte’s father. The Knights emerged from a split in another cartel in Michoacan known as La Familia and have controlled large swaths of the restive mountainous state in recent years, extorting farmers and local businesses and diversifying away from drug trafficking to activities such as mining. Damage control: Melissa Plancarte released a statement on her Facebook page, distancing herself from her infamous father . Public fury: It has been revealed that in 2012, Melissa and her brother, also a singer, were hired by the state of Michoacan to perform at a fair . Entertainer: Miss Plancarte insisted that she is only interested in music and has nothing to do with her father's 'world' The rising number of homicides in the state helped spur the emergence of heavily armed vigilante groups which this month occupied several of the Knights' Michoacan strongholds. The government initially called on the vigilantes to disarm, but the so-called ‘self-defense’ groups refused, and security forces are now tolerating their presence in much of Michoacan. President Enrique Pena Nieto said last week that some of the vigilantes had ‘genuinely organized to defend themselves.’ Insult to injury: Her latest music video released earlier this month with a Cuban singer stirred a new round of controversy because it was shot in the historic Michoacan Place of Justice . The government has offered to incorporate the vigilantes into formal police ranks and give them training, in tandem with job-creating development programs. Questions have been raised about who is arming and funding the vigilantes, with some locals and security analysts saying there is evidence rival cartels have infiltrated them.","Melissa Plancarte, an aspiring pop singer, is the daughter of suspected Knights Templar crime boss Enrique Plancarte Solis .

"To commemorate the contribution of British and Commonwealth servicemen and women in the two world wars and later conflicts, a British Airways 747 has been adorned with a giant poppy. The 8ft by 8ft tribute was seen on the aircraft as it flew to New York's John F Kennedy Airport today on an 8.20am flight, to mark Armistice Day. British Airways asked customers and colleagues to observe a two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day at 11am and did the same for Remembrance Sunday. Reservists Kai Burman (left) and Chris Norris, who both work for British Airways, stand in front of a British Airways 747 adorned with a poppy at London Heathrow . The poppy is an excellent tribute to the servicemen who lost their lives in warfare . British Airways Senior First Officer Dheeraj Bhasin, said: 'I served for 17 years in the RAF, so I am proud that British Airways is right behind the Poppy Appeal. 'The airline is showing its support in lots of ways. British Airways teams are collecting donations alongside servicemen and women in Terminal 5 at Heathrow, observing the silences on Remembrance Sunday and Armistice Day and have displayed a giant Poppy on one of our Boeing 747s. 'The support British Airways is giving is extremely important, not least of all, to the hundreds of men and women who have served their country, as well as current reservists in roles across the airline.' Mr Bhasin has been flying for British Airways for seven years and has flown the Airbus 320, the Boeing 777, and is currently flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Before joining British Airways Bhasin served for 17 years in the RAF and he still serves in the reserve forces as a flying instructor and military skills instructor for cadets and reservists. British Airways 787 Senior First Officer Dheeraj Bhasin observes the two-minute silence with other staff . During both periods, British Airways pilots at UK airports did not start aircraft engines. Keith Williams, British Airways' executive chairman, said: 'We are honoured to pay our own tribute to the millions who have fought for their country during the last 100 years. 'We believe this will help deliver the spirit of remembrance to countries around the world and support the great work that takes place through The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.' The design and placing of the poppy was done entirely in house by the BA engineering team. British Airways' engineering department add the finishing touches to the poppy . A spokesperson for the airline added: 'As far as we are aware, the design of the poppy has been really well received by all who seen it.' The plane flew out from Heathrow to the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas on Saturday, returning back to London early Sunday morning. An afternoon flight was next on the agenda for the specially-designed aircraft as it flew to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York, returning on Monday. And the Boeing 747 flew back to JFK on Monday. Today, on Armistice Day, the plane flew out again to JFK at 8.20am.","First flight of the 'poppy plane' was from Heathrow to Houston .

"Compensation claim: Kerry Ann Taylor, 34, won just under £5,000 compensation from her employers at Hampshire Police . A policewoman has won her fight for compensation after cutting her thumb while dismantling a cannabis plant - leaving the taxpayer with a £150,000 legal bill. Kerry Ann Taylor, a Hampshire Police officer, will receive £4,837 damages after her employers today lost a bid to overturn an earlier decision in the Court of Appeal. The WPC, 34, was nauseous from cannabis fumes when she cut her thumb on broken glass while uprooting plants at a flat in Devonshire Avenue, Southsea, following a drugs bust. The serving officer sued her Chief Constable claiming the force had breached their duty of care by allowing her to be exposed to the fumes and failing to provide thick gardening gloves. The court heard WPC Taylor's task was to uproot plants and dump them in a skip outside. Her superiors thought that the only risk to her was skin irritation from contact with cannabis leaves and issued her with thin latex gloves. Her head swimming due to the effects of cannabis fumes, she tried to open a window, forgetting it had been sealed, and pushed her hand through a glass pane, suffering a cut to her right thumb. At Winchester County Court last year, Judge David Blunt QC upheld WPC Taylor's damages claim, ruling that the force had breached the duty it owed her under the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992. The force challenged that decision, insisting that it had done all it was obliged to do to protect WPC Taylor and that, had she confined herself to pulling up plants, she would never have been at any risk from sharp edges. Attacking judge Blunt's ruling as setting an unrealistically high standard, the Chief Constable argued it was 'absurd' to expect the force to allocate a specific task to each officer involved in the operation and to carry out individual risk assessments. However, dismissing the force's appeal, Lord Justice Elias said the duty on employers was a tough one and the risk to WPC Taylor, however slight, could have been avoided by the simple means of issuing her with heavy-duty gloves. Drugs bust: Kerry Ann Taylor was removing cannabis plants from a property in Southsea, Hampshire, when she cut her thumb . Sitting with Lord Justice Patten, he said WPC Taylor would have been exposed to a 'whole range' of risks while clearing the cannabis farm in September 2008 and ruled that the force had breached its legal duty to protect her. There was, the court ruled, also 'no injustice' in ordering the force to pay WPC Taylor's legal costs bills. Her barrister, Andrew Roy, earlier told the court: 'The whole place was a nest of wires. All these risks were magnified given that there was little ventilation and a nauseating atmosphere hazardous to health.' Force Solicitor Roger Trencher said that the taxpayer would only have to pay the first £100,000 worth of legal bills as they have insurance to cover the rest. 'We have always taken a firm position that we will defend claims where the specialist advice received is that the claimant is not legally entitled to compensation from the constabulary. We were advised by experienced counsel that we had a strong case for appeal and took the action we felt appropriate. 'However, on this occasion the court found against us. Costs of more than £100,000 were incurred by the claimant at the first hearing. 'We pay the first £100,000 of any action, and insurance covers any remittance above this, which in this case includes the cost of the appeal and our external legal fees. 'In light of the decision, will look again at the decision making process for appeals, as we are conscious at all times that we have a duty to make the very best use of public money, and this requires that claims that the constabulary is advised are without merit are defended and others resolved.'","WPC Kerry Ann Taylor broke a window while clearing a cannabis factory .

"An 89-year-old World War II veteran who initially refused a Purple Heart medal finally received it Saturday in Upstate New York. Richard Faulkner was only 19-years-old when his B-17 bomber went down in March 1944, he was the only survivor and was badly injured – but he refused the Purple Heart. Faulkner decided to receive the medal now after regretting not doing so earlier,  he wanted to leave a legacy to his grandchildren. The wait is over: Richard Faulkner, 89, received his Purple Heart almost 70 years after saying no . ‘They all got killed and I didn't,’ Faulkner said in an interview before receiving the medal. ‘It's just unbelievable that they all died and I didn't.' Faulkner was unable to accept the medal because he had a hard time accepting he was the lone survivor. Conflicting reports say Faulkner’s plane was either shot down by Nazis or collided with another Allied aircraft, but what is certain is that he was the only survivor of the crash over France. He then nervously parachuted into German territory and hid from a German patrol that saw him land. ‘He had to wait until the Germans had looked for him, they had seen somebody come down,’ his daughter Ann Pennell told CNY Central.’ Hard earned: Faulker was awarded the medal after he was the lone survivor of a B-17 bomber going down in enemy territory in France . Hero of the day: Faulkner listens just before receiving the medal as people extoll his heroism . Faulkner was eventually sheltered by a French farmer who helped back into Allied territory. ‘After they left after nightfall started, the farmer came out and found him and started him through the French underground,’ she continued. The teen was eventually picked up by a British ship on the coast. He was lucky to be alive but sustained injuries to his legs and feet from the hard landing. Purple Hearts are awarded to injured soldiers. ‘I don't deserve this. There's a lot of people who should of been honored, that weren't,’ Faulkner told the site. Perfect day: Faulker poses for a picture with family while holding his Purple Heart . The heroic soldier was presented the medal by Congressman Dan Maffei in a ceremony in front of about 100 people at his retirement home in Auburn, New York. Faulkner said nothing after accepting the medal except for 'thank you' to Maffei. ‘Just to be a part of that a part of teaching the next generation about the importance of sacrifice and that you can't take our freedom for granted -- it's a tremendous honor for me,’ Maffei told the site. A veteran in attendance agreed. ‘He didn't compete for it, he earned it the hard way and anyone that's been in battle deserves to be recognized,’ said Korean War veteran John Marwinczok.","Richard Faulkner was only 19-years-old when his plane went down over Nazi-controlled Germany .

"She may only have half a heart, but Sophie Maxwell is a determined little girl. The 12-week-old, who underwent major heart surgery when she was five just days old, has been allowed to go home for the first time. Sophie, from South Tyneside, faces two more operations and possibly a heart transplant. Sophie Maxwell (pictured with her mother, Kerry Anne) has hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare congenital heart condition that leaves the heart's left ventricle severely underdeveloped . She has hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare congenital heart condition that leaves the heart’s left ventricle severely underdeveloped. Her mother Kerry Anne, 27, said: ‘Despite everything she's been through, she's a really happy little baby. If it wasn't for the tube she still has, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong. ‘I think the oldest living person with Sophie's condition is 21, so that does give us a glimmer of hope that she could live for another 20 years or more, but we're treasuring every moment we've got with her.’ She added: ‘The surgeon who operated on Sophie said he always thinks, “where there's life, there's hope” and he's right.’ Mrs Maxwell and her husband, a customer services advisor, were faced with an agonising decision during the pregnancy. A routine 20-week scan revealed Sophie only had half a heart and the couple were asked to consider a termination. Sophie had to have open heart surgery when she was just five days old and she was not able to leave hospital until she was five weeks old. She will need at least two more operations as she grows . Mrs Maxwell said: ‘I did consider terminating the pregnancy for a minute, because I had to consider what kind of quality of life Sophie was going to have, but we decided that if Sophie was going to fight on, so were we.’ They decided to go ahead with the pregnancy and Sophie was born at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on August 20, weighing 8lb 9oz. She was then transferred to the Children's Heart Unit at the city's Freeman Hospital. Sophie (pictured with her mother, Kerry Anne, and her brother, Nathan) might eventually need a heart transplant . Her open heart surgery meant she spent the first three weeks of her life on a ventilator and she was five weeks old before she could go home with her parents and two older brothers, Nathan, three, and Joshua Tansey, seven. Sophie now faces another operation when she is a year old and a third when she is three or four. Mrs Maxwell said: ‘I think something like one in 5,000 children are born with this condition. ‘The left side of her heart just doesn't work, and it's considerably smaller than it should be. Mrs Maxwell (pictured with her husband, Ian, and Sophie) said: 'Despite everything she's been through, she's a really happy little baby. If it wasn't for the tube she still has, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong' ‘As she grows up, she'll get breathless a lot easier, and she won't be able to walk long distances. ‘Really, it's all just palliative care because Sophie's heart will never be fixed. ‘Even after she's had her third operation, there's a possibility in the future that she might eventually need a heart transplant. ‘Hopefully, it won't come to that.’ Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a condition in which the left lower pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) does not develop properly. In children with the condition, the valve between the left ventricle and the upper left filling chamber (left atrium) if often closed or small. The main blood vessel that carried blood from the heart to the rest of the body is also smaller than usual. This means the heart is unable to pump blood effectively around the body. Most babies with the condition appear healthy immediately after birth but quickly become breathless if not treated. Most are diagnosed before birth. It is not possible to cure the condition but most children can have a reasonable quality of life if they have successful surgery to manage it. Only about 60 per cent of patients survive all three of the required operations. For those who do, life expectancy is in the teens.

"The mummified bodies of soldiers who fell in the First World War 100 years ago are still being uncovered as glaciers melt - and experts say there could be many more to come. Corpses emerge every time there is a hot summer in Trentino, a rugged part of the Italian Alps where countless men were shot, starved or froze to death in a three-year campaign. Whenever the gruesome finds appear, archaeologists must act within hours - because not only do the bodies decompose, they are also looted by opportunistic thieves. Frozen in time: Mummified remains of two teenage Austrian soldiers were found in the Presena Glacier in 2012. Dr Franco Nicolis, Director of the Office of Archaeological Heritage in Trentino, blamed global warming . Gun: An Austrian Rifle found poking out of the ground, protected until its discovery by a thick layer of ice. But Dr Nicolis said many finds are stripped bare by looters who then sell the war artefacts on the internet . Dr Franco Nicolis, the director of the Trentino's Office of Archaeological Heritage, has blamed global warming for the surge in corpses found in the last decade. The last two soldiers, found side-by-side in 2012 on the Presena Glacier, were as young as 16 and 18 when they went to fight on the bitter Italian front and were buried by fellow fighters in a crevice. Archaeologists who studied their bones to age the bodies said both were shot in the head in 1918. One of the young men still had a spoon tucked into his uniform for digging away at rations. Other remains have been found almost every year before that dating back to 2004, when a major discovery of three Austrian soldiers buried in the ice made global headlines. Dr Nicolis, who watched the autopsy of the most recent bodies, told MailOnline: 'It was very emotional. The first moment I looked at the boy I thought about his mother, who would have seen him for the last time and never heard from her young son again.' Corpses have been found in the Alps almost every year since 2004, when these mummified remains emerged . Elusive: One body yet to be found is that of Captain Arnaldo Berni, 24 (right), who led Italian troops on the 3,678m peak of San Matteo in August 1918. The war would drag on until a final victory in October . More than a million soldiers from both sides were killed on the Italian front, which ranged across more than 400 miles with battles lasting almost the entire length of the First World War. The long fight, much of it in the mountains where blizzards could send temperatures dropping to minus 30 degrees celsius, was between Italian forces and those of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although the two sides had been allies until the time when war broke out, old emnities quickly showed and in April 1915, Italy changed sides by signing the Treaty of London in secret. Russia, France and Britain - all part of the Triple Entente - persuaded Italy to leave the Triple Alliance, which it had until then maintained with Germany and Austro-Hungary. The brutal mountain war stretched on until October 1918 and the Battle of Vittoria Veneto, which saw the final defeat of Austro-Hungarian troops and a crucial victory for those on the Western Front. Historians have been collecting material from the mountains ever since, with regular finds since the early 1990s. Dangerous terrain: While British forces suffered disease in the trenches, those on the Italian front had to string the razor wire denoting No Man's Land across the edge of perilous cliff tops . Hazardous: The Italian front, marked by the red line, stretched for hundreds of miles over the Alps . Discoveries have included clothes, shoes and a remarkably intact letter from a soldier to his lover. On the peak of Punta Linke, historians uncovered an entire cableway station concealed beneath the ice, with soldiers' letters still pinned to the walls. But recovering the bodies is not easy because of looters and thieves, claimed Dr Nicolis. 'We're not able to go on the glaciers and research the bodies ourselves,' he said. 'We have to wait until they are found by people making excavations for work or hiking. 'Usually people take away everything from the body and only call us or the police afterwards. Often we find bodies with none of the equipment of a soldier around them. 'People then sell what they've found online - I've seen it happening. It's surreal that you would get people going up the mountain just to find 100-year-old things they could sell on the internet.' There were no bodies last year, said Dr Nicolis. Now his team are waiting to see whether any will turn up this summer - but after heavy snow in the last few months, they fear the secrets of the past could remain hidden for many years longer.","Soldiers fought in the Italian Alps in temperatures plummeting to minus 30C .

"President Barack Obama revealed the 'real reason' he wanted a second term as president is because his daughter Malia, age 14, is about to start dating boys. 'One of the main incentives of running was continued Secret Service protection so we can have men with guns around at all times,' the father of two joked. The President and First Lady delved into their personal lives - including how they keep 'the fire alive' in their marriage - during a chat with ABC's Barbara Walters, their first sit-down interview since the election. Scroll down for video . Candid: President and Mrs Obama spoke about their personal lives - including their oldest daughter's maturation into a young woman . Armed guard: Malia, 14, walks off Air Force One under the watchful eye of a Secret Service agent. The President said one of the perks of being president is having armed guards watch his teenage daughter . The president said respect is the key to happiness after more than two decades together Michelle. 'You know, we've been married now 20 years and like every marriage you have your ups and you have your downs. But if you've worked through the tough times, the respect and love that you feel deepens,' he said. Michelle added: 'And there's a lot of laughter.' The Obamas married in 1992 after they met at the Chicago law firm where they both worked. The nation has watched Malia and Sasha, age 11, grow up in the White House - and watched Malia turn into a teenager. Malia was recently given a cell phone and her mother says she has given the 14-year-old a 'long rope.' Light-hearted: The interview with Walters focused on the Obamas' personal lives in the White House and less on political or policy issues . Her father, though, admits his fears about teenage boys calling his daughter and asking for dates. He lamented that cell phones mean boys no longer have to ring up the house phone and get past him or his wife before they can talk to Malia. The Obamas said she had not started dating yet, but the President conceded that the day may soon come when some brave boy tries to take his daughter out. 'She’s a teenager, she’s going to start at some point being interested in dating boys,' he said. The couple also addressed Michelle's political ambition - or lack thereof. Mrs Obama said couldn't run for office because she doesn't have the patience required of a politician. 'And she has bigger difficulty biting her tongue,' Barack Obama added. In a moment of defensiveness, Mrs Obama scoffed: 'I've done pretty well with that,' she said. On tour: The First Lady showed Walters around the White House during Christmas. She said 90,000 guests will visit during the holidays . The couple also revealed the story behind the photograph of their hug that became the most shared picture in Twitter's history after it was released on election night. 'Because I love my wife,' the President said. Mrs Obama said got gushy when she explained that their embrace, captured during a campaign stop in Iowa, was real. 'I hadn't seen him in a while and when you're campaigning, it's two ships passing in the night,' she explained. 'The first time I saw him was when I walked on stage to greet him. 'That's my honey giving me a hug.' Love: Asked why he was hugging his wife so tight in this photograph, President Obama said, 'Because I love my wife' The president added: 'I like giving you hugs.' The Obamas sat down with Walters on December 11 and the segment as slated to air on December 14. However, the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut led ABC to postpone the segment. This is Walters' fourth interview with the president. Her meeting at the White House included a tour of the holiday decorations led by the First Lady and 'first dog' Bo.

"Workers were given the runaround at Heathrow Airport after a swan on the runway delayed more than 20 flights. With planes queuing up, and an Air France flight dormant on the runway, this hilarious footage shows two members of staff and their efforts to snare the feathered fiend. The bird was not going to go quietly, and refused to be scooped up. The men resorted to using the car as a kind of battering ram to shepherd the feathered fiend off the runway . So using a car to shunt it off the main runway, the two airport workers do their best to get services resuming at Europe's busiest airport. Clapping at the swan to encourage it to fly off did not work, and it was seemingly intent on having a bit of fun on the tarmac. The runway was closed for around nine minutes before the swan was pinned down and taken off to Heathrow's bird hazard management team. The video was accompanied by a running commentary by those watching the action unfold. Comments of 'They're going to come round to shoot it,' and 'they can have it for Christmas dinner,' add to the fun-filed episode. Flights were queueing for around nine minutes, but Heathrow insist there were 'no delays' The swan for all intents and purposes seems to be having a bit of fun with his supposed capturers . When the video was posted on YouTube, it led to some unsurprisingly amusing comments. Gregster295 Aviation & Rail Videography wrote: 'They were in a bit of a flap there,' while Si Davey added: 'This has really brightened up my evening! It's just too funny. 'The background commentary from your fellow passengers was equally entertaining.' The audio and visual commentary make the video seem somewhat slapstick . Finally the two men manage to capture the swan and normal service can resume at Heathrow . A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport told the Evening Standard: 'Heathrow's bird hazard management team responded quickly and safely removed the swan to reopen the runway. 'Once rescued, the swan was taken to our animal reception centre to be properly looked after by the onsite team.'","Two staff members have to use emergency vehicle to force bird off runway .

"Sleeping next to a 200-foot icefall, walking amongst a colony of 6,000 emperor penguins, and standing at the lowest point on earth... this trip is certainly one for the bucket list. Would-be adventurers with cash to burn can now follow in the footsteps of the great explorers, but with private jet transport, luxury sleeping pods and a personal chef thrown in, they don't need to compromise on comfort. For £46,000 for an eight-day trip, polar explorer Patrick Woodhead takes wealthy clients on luxury safaris to Antarctica and the South Pole with his company White Desert. March of the penguins: For £46,000, wealthy adventurers can take a luxury safari to Antarctica and the South Pole . Into the wild: Clients get up close and personal with a colony of 6,000 emperor penguins with the tour company, White Desert . Red carpet treatment: Guests are flown by private charter from Cape Town and land on an ice runway . Living the high life! Adventurer Patrick Woodhead started White Desert in 2006 . VIP visitors: Prince Harry stopped by the camp after his South Pole expedition in 2013, while Bear Grylls has also visited . Royal guest: Prince Harry celebrated completing his Walking with the Wounded expedition at the camp . Adventure: Bear Grylls launches his paramotor and flies near to a cliff edge during his trip to the White Desert camp . Guests have included billionaire entrepreneurs, Jordanian royals and Saudi princesses who had previously never seen snow. Prince Harry stopped by White Desert's 'Whichaway Camp' after completing his South Pole expedition last year.  'While the rest of the team celebrated with champagne, Prince Harry was very abstemious and well behaved,' Patrick, 38, exclusively tells MailOnline Travel. He was really down to earth and chatted with all our staff.' Bear Grylls also swapped sleeping rough for a bit of White Desert luxury. The TV adventurer tried kite skiing while visiting the camp. VIP guests arrive by specially chartered private jet from Cape Town, landing on an ice runway in the middle of the Antarctic. Whichaway Camp sits on the edge of a frozen lake overlooking a magnificent 200foot icefall. For thrillseekers: Kite-skiing is one of the activities available to guests . Adrenaline junkies: White Desert's wealthy clientele can test their limits with extreme winter sports . Catching air: Patrick Woodhead pictured kiting during a 1,850km traverse of Antarctica . Record breaking: One client broke the world record for the first solo free flight of a balloon in Antarctica during a White Desert trip . Arctic excursion: Guests fly for two hours from base camp to reach the penguins at Atka Bay . Campsite: White Desert's camp features state of the art pods next to a frozen lake and 200-foot icefall . Once in a lifetime: Excursions to walk amongst the Emperor penguins  are best  November-December when the colony is at its fullest . State-of-the-art sleeping pods are made from strong fiberglass panels, insulated and heated inside, and even in high winds, very quiet. Double beds for couples or singles with a privacy screen for solo guests, the pods also have a washing area and toilet. There is a separate pod with showers, and three pods make up the large communal living and dining area. Chef Jenna Viney prepares three meals a day including steaks, seafood, and full English breakfast. White Desert describe the camp as 'furnished in the old world opulence of African safaris'. Adventures during the tour include visiting a colony of 2,000 emperor penguins at Atka Bay and treks to iridescent blue ice tunnels. There is abseiling, kite-skiing and rock climbing too, for those who wish to push their limits. Inquisitive: The penguins are  unafraid of humans and often approach visitors  - allowing incredible photography opportunities . Exploration: Activities from camp include walking through ice tunnels . Unforgettable: The incredible experiences make a polar safari a firm bucket list item - if you can afford it . Then, there is of course the seven-hour flight to the geographic South Pole, where the plane lands at the Amundsen-Scott American science station. Guests spend the night in special tents at the South Pole, take a tour of the station, and even send postcards from the souvenir shop. Woodhead came up with the idea while stuck in a small tent for four days during a snowstorm. He recalls that as the supplies dwindled, Patrick and his teammates discussed how most people never get to see the interior of Antarctica. 'We were sitting in a tent during the long expedition and dreaming about some decent food,' he says. 'We joked about having a chef and it got me thinking whether you could have a luxury experience in the interior of Antarctica. Normally, the only way to do a luxury trip down here is by cruise ship and they just touch on the coast of Antarctica for a few hours before zodiacing the clients back to the safety of their cabins. Comfort: Inside the spacious living area pods, guests are served meals by a first class chef . Fine dining: Chef Jenna Viney serves steak, seafood, full English breakfast and al fresco champagne lunches . 'We wanted to create something more authentic and have a luxury camp in the deep field. A place where clients could experience what a polar explorer saw - the incredible beauty and solitude...but not have to go through months on the ice and skiing the equivalent in calories of a double marathon a day.' White Desert are committed to their 'zeroimpact' policy and operate in accordance with the environmental tourism guidelines laid out in the Antarctic Treaty. The camp is powered by renewable energy, using solar panels for electrical supply and solar water heaters for the shower system. White Desert also offsets all emissions through Carbon projects. The dream that came out of that cramped, cold tent became a reality when Patrick founded White Desert with his South African wife Robyn, 36, in 2006. Both keen polar adventurers, the couple achieved what Sir Ernest Shackleton could not, leading two separate teams from opposite sides of Antarctica to meet at the geographic South Pole in 2005. Spacious: Heated sleeping pods boast washing areas and toilets and beds with fur blankets . VIP arrival: Guests have included everyone from billionaire entrepreneurs and Saudi princesses . Luxury: Every comfort is catered to, including the private jet transfer from Cape Town . Raising thousands of pounds for The Princes Trust charity, the couple and their teams spent 80 days traversing the continent, enduring temperatures as low as -70 C. A novelist as well as an adventurer, Woodhead uses many of his exhilarating real-life experiences as fodder for his storylines. Following his preivous books The Secret Chamber and The Forbidden Temple, Woodhead will release his latest, Beneath the Ice, in December. The book borrows one harrowing chapter in which an expedition team becomes trapped down a crevasse and the gruelling rescue, from his own pre-White Desert experiences. 'On one occasion whilst doing our 1850km traverse of Antarctica by kites  one of the team, David de Rothschild, fell into a crevasse that must have been about 800m deep,' Patrick recalls. 'He had broken through the surface snow covering the crevasse but managed to keep his arms wide and stop himself from plummeting into the depths. 'We couldn't see or hear that he was in trouble because of the blizzard and so David had to crawl forward across the thin layer of snow spanning the crevasse and crawl his way back to the safety of the other side. It was seriously close.' Beneath The Ice will be published by Random House in December. Departure to the ends of the earth: The chartered flight takes off for Antarctica .

"One in five British children live below the poverty line with the number rising to nearly half in the most deprived areas of Manchester, according to research released today. The Campaign to End Child Poverty published figures today showing that 20.2 per cent of British children are classified as below the poverty line, before housing costs. In eight areas of large cities, more than four out of every 10 children lived in poverty in 2012, the research showed. A study by The Campaign to End Child Poverty found 47 per cent of . children in central Manchester are living below the poverty line. Pictured here is the area of Benchill, which is outside the city centre but has similar levels of child poverty . But that is a decrease on the 19 parliamentary constituencies that had 40 per cent of children living in poverty in 2011. The poorest constituency for children was Manchester Central, with nearly half (47 per cent) of children living in poverty. More than four in 10 children were living in poverty in Belfast West (43 per cent), Glasgow North East (43 per cent), Ladywood, Birmingham (42 per cent), Liverpool Riverside (42 per cent), and Middlesbrough (40 per cent). In London, 40 per cent of children were living in poverty in Tower Hamlets, 42 per cent of children were below the poverty line in the constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow while 41 per cent were living in poverty in Poplar and Limehouse. The situation has broadly improved since 2011, except in some areas of the North East of England. In Newcastle, 38 per cent of children were poor in 2012, compared with 29 per cent in 2011, while in Middlesbrough the figure rose to 40 per cent from 38 per cent in the previous year.

This map compiled by the Campaign to End Child Poverty shows child . poverty in Britain with the most deprived areas in darker shades of purple . In deprived areas of Glasgow child poverty is running at 43 per cent, according to the research . Child poverty was the lowest in Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's Sheffield Hallam constituency (below 5 per cent). It was also under 10 per cent in Prime Minister David Cameron's Witney constituency, the report said. The figures revealed the wide disparity in poverty rates across the UK and within regions. For example, in London, Poplar and Limehouse has a child poverty rate of 41 per cent compared to just 7 per cent in Richmond. In the North West, whereas 38 per cent of children in the local authority area of Manchester are poor, in Ribble Valley the figure is just 7 per cent. In the figures, children are classified as being in poverty if they live in families receiving out of work benefits or in-work tax credits where their reported income is less than 60 per cent of median income. 47 per cent Manchester Central . 43 per cent Belfast West . 43 per cent Glasgow North East . 42 per cent Birmingham Ladywood . 42 per cent Bethnal Green and Bow . 42 per cent Liverpool Riverside . 41 per cent Poplar and Limehouse . 40 per cent Middlesbrough . 38 per cent Blackley and Broughton . 38 per cent Newcastle upon Tyne Central . The report said: 'This is not a direct measure of exactly how many children are in poverty on the official definition, but is the closest to an equivalent measure we have of local levels of child poverty (these data should therefore not be used for direct comparisons with official national and regional figures). The figures are estimates for mid-2012.' Enver Solomon, chair of the Campaign said: 'The child poverty map reveals the depth and breadth of child poverty across the country showing the gross levels of inequality that children face in every region. 'Far too many children whose parents are struggling to make a living are having to go hungry and miss out on the essentials of a decent childhood that all young people should be entitled to. 'The huge disparities that exist across the country have become more entrenched and are now an enduring reality as many more children are set to become trapped in long term poverty and disadvantage. 'Local authorities are having to deal with reduced budgets but they have critical decisions to make. 'We're calling on authorities to prioritise low income families in the decisions they make about local welfare spending, including spending on the new council tax benefit, and on protecting families hit by the bedroom tax. 'This week we have written to local authority leaders in the local authorities with the most child poverty, asking them what they will do to tackle child poverty in their local area. 'The government must also closely examine its current strategy for reducing poverty and consider what more it could do to ensure millions of children's lives are not blighted by the corrosive impact that poverty has on their daily existence.' Rhian Beynon, of the support charity Family Action, said: 'The Government must explain urgently how it is going to address these devastating findings by the End Child Poverty Campaign. For every child counted poor by this report there is a parent struggling to keep a roof over their heads, the house warm and food on the table. 'But on top of this daily struggle their child faces worse prospects for their education, a job and health. We know that what makes a difference is a mixture of support from services and the welfare system and it is the Government which sends the most important signal on these policies to local authorities.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: 'We are committed to eradicating child poverty, but we want to take a new approach by tackling the root causes including worklessness, educational failure and family breakdown. 'Our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities, with the Universal Credit simplifying the complex myriad of benefits and making three million people better off.'","20.2 per cent of British children are classified as below the poverty line .

"Australia has cemented its position as one of the world's fattest nations, a new study has revealed. The lucky country may not be so lucky coming in as the 25th largest nation in the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2013, which monitored the weight gain of 188 nations over a 33-year period. Along with New Zealand, Australia has experienced an 80 per cent increase in obesity rates in the past three decades, and it jumped nearly 40 places on the list, the biggest mover - but evidently not in the right way. The fat country: According to a new study obesity rates in Australia have increased exponentially over the last 33 years . Australia sits ahead of many European nations such as France and Germany, but still trailed the U.S. despite figures that show nearly one in three Aussies are considered obese. The study revealed that not one single nation decreased its overweight and obesity rates during the time period, a concerning statistic that could put pressure on health systems worldwide. Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne Rob Moodie told the Sydney Morning Herald that Australia had to act now if it wants to combat this obesity crisis. 'Waiting for a cure is not possible...The public health system will be crushed by the obesity crisis and the rise in cancer, heart disease and diabetes.' 'We have also failed to get anywhere with front of pack labeling, or with food reformulation, because of a huge resistance from the industry to anything that might improve our health,' Professor Moodie also told the publication. Put the pressure on: These increased rates will put strain on the public health system . These findings put the strain on the government to cut back on junk food marketing, restore the healthy food-star rating system and push companies to cut sugar and fat contents in their products. The study, which tracked the weight gain of adults and children from 1980 to 2013, was based on Body Mass Index measurements (BMI) which work on the relationship between height and weight to produce a figure. Anyone with a BMI of 25 or more is considered overweight, while a rating of 30 or more deems an individual as being obese. Nearly 30 per cent, or 5.2 million Australian adults, are classified as being obese - compared with a much lower figure of 16 per cent in 1980. The Global Burden of Disease findings also said that more than half of the world's obese people now live in developing countries, and around a quarter of children are suffering from obesity. In the lead: Around 5.2 million Australian adults are now considered obese . Another concern in Australia is that cuts in the recent budget could have an impact on fighting this obesity trend thanks to funding being scaled back on programs that target prevention in schools and communities. Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University, Mike Daube, told the publication that obesity has crept up on Australia as a nation and new co-payment scheme may defer people from seeing their GP about the issue. Obesity is linked to major health problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and range of cancers.","Australia experienced greatest increase in obesity rates than any nation .

"An Italian dairy mogul - who once dubbed himself the 'Armani of Mozzarella' due to his power in the world of Italian cheese  - has been arrested on mafia charges. Mozzarella magnate Giuseppe Mandara used the might of the Neapolitan mob to build his commercial empire, it is alleged. The Mandara Group, the biggest producer of buffalo mozzarella in Italy, had been effectively controlled by the notorious Camorra mafia since 1983, investigators say. Dairy tycoon Giuseppe Mandara - who once dubbed himself the 'Armani of Mozzarella' - used the power of the Neapolitan mob to build his commercial empire, it is alleged (file photo) The notorious La Torre Clan, which is based in the Caserta province near Naples, allegedly bailed the cheese king out when he was in financial trouble, investing 700 million of the old lira in his company. The mozzarella mogul was arrested at dawn on Wednesday on suspicion of money laundering and mafia association, Italian news agency ANSA reported. His mafia associates allegedly used their criminal earnings to pay off debts dating back to the 1970s and intimated land owners whose property he wanted to buy to build warehouses. Mandara was arrested at dawn on Wednesday on suspicion of money laundering and mafia association, Italian news agency ANSA reported . The dairy entrepreneur allegedly threw police off tack during the investigation into the disappearance of local politician Antonio Nugnes, who is presumed to have been murdered in 1990 with his remains dissolved in acid. Mandara was held in 2012 accused of adulterating his prize product, mixing ordinary cow milk with the more expensive and creamier buffalo product. He has previously been accused of mafia offences but the case was dropped for lack of evidence. In Italy, Mozzarella DOC is a protected name that is supposed to guarantee the quality of buffalo mozzarella. In the past the cheese has been the subject of public health scares after it emerged that carcinogenic chemicals were thought to be present in the soil – and the grass eaten by the buffalo – as a result of the illegal dumping of toxic waste by the mafia.

"Actress Natalie Dormer dazzled at The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 premiere on Monday night in an edgy mesh and satin gown. But the Natalie Dormer that appeared on screen as rebel spin doctor Cressida cut quite a different figure. Sporting a semi-shaven head, androgynous clothing and an inking that runs from the the bald patch on her head down her neck, the star appears anything but glamorous in the new film. But the 32-year-old Brit has described the high profile role as 'empowering' and claims that shaving her head was 'terrifying' but 'liberating'. Scroll down for video .

The actress told the Evening Standard she loved playing someone who was 'defined by her profession. It was gender irrelevant. It is nice to play a role not defined by romantic engagement.' She described her head shaving experience as 'terrifying at first' but also described it as a 'liberating experience'. 'So much of female identity is bound up in our hair,' she told the paper. 'It was fascinating to explore my idea of what makes me physically attractive. I felt empowered.' The star also admitted that being inked all over for her role as Cressida, a filmmaker who helps heroine Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) rally support, gave her the taste for more tattoos. On the red carpet during the filming of the film Natalie embraced the semi-shaven head look - and managed to carry it off with style. She said shaving her head was 'terrifying' and 'liberating'. The star in her most famous role as Margaery Tyrell in Game Of Thrones (left) and as Anne Boleyn in The Tudors with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as King Henry VIII (right) She only held back when she thought about the implications on her time in bed.

"Tragic: Melissa Bassi, 16, suffered horrific injuries in the explosion and was rushed to hospital but died a short while later from her injuries . A schoolgirl was killed and seven others injured today in a suspected mafia bomb blast which hit a school. Two powerful explosions scattered deadly shrapnel across a wide area just as students were arriving for lessons as the devices, connected to gas canisters and hidden in rucksacks went off. Melissa Bassi, 16, suffered horrific injuries in the explosion and was rushed to hospital but died a short while later from her injuries and there are fears over another of those hurt, a girl, whose condition was described as 'life threatening.' Paramedics and police were immediately at the scene and TV footage showed scenes of chaos as shocked students gathered outside the building and investigators immediately linked the tragedy to an anti mafia protest march. The blast went off close to the Morvillo Falcone school in the southern Italian town of Brindisi and home to the local mafia known as the Sacra Corona Unita who have close links with the Russian and Albanian mafia and are linked to drug and gun running. The school is named after Francesca Morvillo Falcone, who was the wife of anti mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who were both killed in a bomb blast on May 23 1992 which was carried out by the Sicilian Mafia and tonight/last night there was growing outrage at how innocent school children had been targeted. Rescue: A woman receives first aid after the explosion outside Francesca Morvillo Falcone high school . Panic: Emergency services and passers-by rush to help those injured in the blast . Mourning: Flowers are placed outside the school in Brindisi where the blast happened . Tributes: Dozens of Melissa Bassi's friends have left tributes on her Facebook page . Grief:  Massimo Bassi, the daughetr of bomb victim Melissa Barri, weeps during Mass in a church in Misagne . The devices were hidden in a bin about 30metres from the Brindisi courthouse and as they exploded students arriving for lessons caught the full impact of the blasts. Debris was scattered over a wide area with shrapnel from the canisters piercing shutters of nearby shops and blowing out windows of apartment buildings overlooking the scene. TV footage showed scenes of desperation as shoes and rucksacks were scattered over the floor, abandoned by the students as the bombs went off just as students arrived for lessons. Although security across Italy has been stepped up with fears of anarchist attacks due to the drastic economic situation the theory quickly gathering momentum was a never before heard of attack on innocent schoolchildren by the mafia. Demonstration: Local residents protest the explosion near the high school today . Search begins: Firefighters and forensic officers investigate the shrapnel-covered scene . Blame: Brindisi's mayor, Mimmo Consales, accused the mafia or carrying out the attack, but officials later ruled out organised criminal involvement in the attack . Concealed: The devices were hidden in a bin about 30m from the Brindisi courthouse . Brindisi's mayor Cosimo Consales said: 'This is an unprecedented attack by organised crime. The name of the school and the planned anti mafia march is all too much of a coincidence,'' adding how just two weeks ago a local anti extortion racket campaigner had cheated death after a powerful device went off under his car.'' One eye witness who works in the court building which overlooks the school told Italian media:''I was just opening the window when the blast caught me in full. When I looked down I saw all the kids on the floor, they were covered in black and their books were on fire. 'It was an infernal scene. Who could have done something like this ? They were just kids.' Police are today still investigating who was responsible for the blast. Devastating: Shrapnel pierced shutters of nearby shops as the blast blew out windows of apartments . Blast: Two powerful explosions scattered deadly shrapnel across a wide area just as students were arriving for lessons at Morvillo Falcone school . Accusations: Brindisi's mayor Cosimo Consales said:'This is an unprecedented attack by organised crime' The European Caravan for Legality, is an anti mafia protest that had left Rome last month and was due to wind its away across Italy promoting initiatives against organised crime. Giovanni Falcone and his wife were killed along with their three strong security escort after the Mafia detonated a bomb under a motorway as he made his convoy made his way from Palermo airport, on the mob's island stronghold of sicily airport to the city centre. Just two months later his successor Paolo Borsellino who was also killed in a car bomb in Palermo as he visited the apartment block where his mother lived. Local MP Alfredo Mantovano was also at the scene and said:''There is an anti mafia meeting taking place at the moment with the prosecutors and forces of law and order. This is the first time in Italy that a school has been targeted and this is the most terrible aspect of all this.'' The schoolgirl who was said to be in a serious condition was named as Veronica Capodieci and she had severe burns and internal injuries with doctors battling to save her life as her family waited outside the operating theatre. According to statistics from Eurispes, an Italian economic and social think tank the Sacra Corona Unita has a turn over of around 2.5 billion Euro a year from its organised crime activities and is mainly from drugs, prostitution and arms trafficking. Shocked: One eyewitness said: 'It was an infernal scene. Who could have done something like this? They were just kids' Investigation: Italian firefighters inspect the site where an explosive device went off . In April 2009 two leading mobsters from the organisation were gunned down in their cars, Franco Romita and Giuseppe Trotta, were left virtually unrecognisable after the hit as their bodies were riddled with dozens of bullets. Last week 35 people were arrested in a blitz by local police across Puglia, the region os southern Italy where the Sacra Corona Unita is based and also where Hollywood star Helen Mirren has a holiday home.","Two explosions scattered shrapnel just as students were arriving for lessons as the devices, connected to gas canisters and hidden in rucksacks went off .

"Filmed: Former minister Tim Yeo was filmed appearing to boast that he had previously coached a paying client in private . A senior Tory is facing calls to quit in a new lobbying scandal – after allegedly offering to help a private company influence Parliament. Tim Yeo, the chairman of the powerful Commons energy and climate change committee, was filmed apparently bragging that he had privately coached the director of the firm – to which he has financial links – on how to influence the committee. In reality, he was speaking to undercover reporters posing as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire him on a salary of £7,000 a day. Mr Yeo said he could introduce them to ‘really all the key players in the UK Government’, and guide them on how to give evidence to his own committee of MPs. The MP, who served as an environment minister in John Major’s government, has earned about £400,000 from consulting work for various green companies. He ‘vigorously’ denied any wrongdoing last night although he pulled out of TV interviews during the day. MPs and campaigners said the footage was ‘damning’ and called for him to stand down. Mr Yeo, whose committee scrutinises new energy laws, was recorded at a restaurant by Sunday Times reporters posing as representatives of a solar energy firm who asked for his help. He would have to declare such an interest, and was filmed saying he could not speak out for them in the House of Commons because ‘people will say he’s saying this because of his commercial interest’. However, he reportedly assured them: ‘What I say to people in private is another matter altogether.’ By way of illustration, he told them how he had advised John Smith, managing director of GB Railfreight, before the executive gave evidence to the committee last month. Undercover reporters posed as representatives of a green energy firm looking to hire Mr Yeo and filmed their conversation . Westminster has been embroiled in a scandal this week about MPs and peers handing lobbyists more than 200 Parliamentary passes despite mounting concern about their influence . Mr Yeo is a paid director and shareholder of Eurotunnel, the firm’s parent company. He told the reporters: ‘I was able to tell him in advance what he should say.’ Today he sought to play down the significance of the exchange. Mr Yeo told BBC Radio Wales: 'What happened was I travelled with the person concerned in the company of two other people, five days before his appearance before the committee, in a train. 'During that conversation I spoke very briefly to him about his forthcoming appearance in front of the committee so I could explain to him that because of the business connection between us, which of course was properly declared and registered, I wouldn’t take part in questioning.' The MP for South Suffolk has taken various paid roles at green firms since taking over the chairmanship of the committee in 2010. He also has shares and options worth about £583,000 in low-carbon firms that have employed him. The House of Commons code of conduct prohibits members from acting as paid advocates. He is the latest politician to be implicated in the ‘Westminster for sale’ scandal by the Sunday Times. It was revealed last week that three peers had agreed to ask parliamentary questions and lobby ministers for paying clients. Lords Mackenzie of Framwellgate, Cunningham and Laird all deny the claims. 'I intend to contest these allegations very vigorously indeed.' Tim Yeo MP . Tory MP Margot James wrote on Twitter that the allegations were ‘damning’. She said ‘paid consultancy and directorships relevant to committee work surely incompatible with chairing [a] committee’. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Tim Yeo appears to have been caught red-handed in a disgusting attempt to bend the rules. ‘Mr Yeo should resign but, more importantly, the Government should reconsider its disastrous energy policies that reward this sort of behaviour.’ Mr Yeo apparently told the reporters he could commit to at least one day a month, despite already holding four private jobs and negotiating to take a further two. He said: ‘If you want to meet the right people, I can facilitate all those introductions and I can use the knowledge I get from what is quite an active network of connections.’ Mr Yeo has referred himself to the Commons standards commissioner for the allegations to be investigated, and said he ‘totally rejects’ the claims. He said: ‘The Sunday Times has chosen to quote very selectively from a recording obtained clandestinely during a conversation of nearly an hour and a half in a restaurant with two undercover reporters who purported to be representing a client from South Korea. My lawyer requested the whole recording from which these extracts were obtained but this has not been given.’ He said it was ‘totally untrue’ that he had coached Mr Smith. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘He has referred himself for investigation, clearly he has to stand down while that goes on.'","Mr Yeo filmed appearing to say he previously coached a paying client .

"A British tourist has described her family’s ‘holiday from hell’ after all 20 of them were struck down with a serious illness at a ‘filthy’ Spanish resort. Mother-of-two Jillian Hajrizi, from Rotherham, said her dream getaway at the three-star Azuline Hotel Mar Amantis in Ibiza last May was ruined when the entire family suffered severe sickness and diarrhoea. They claim they were made ill by uncooked food at the resort’s buffet restaurant and have hired solicitors to pursue legal action against Thomas Cook and Jet2holidays. The family, including Jillian Hajrizi (second from right), her husband Labinot, her 11-year-old son Reece and her 27-year-old son Ryan, with his partner Jade (back row), fell ill during an all-inclusive break in Ibiza in May . Jillian Hajrizi took photos of food during her trip, including a dish which she claimed contained raw chicken . Mrs Hajrizi, 47, went on the all-inclusive break to San Antonio with her husband, Labinot, a 27-year-old wages clerk, and her 11-year-old son Reece. They were joined by her other son, Ryan, 27, his girlfriend and her child, and several other extended family members. Mrs Hajrizi, a full-time-carer for Reece, who has Sturge-Weber syndrome, a serious condition which means he suffers seizures, paid £1,200 for her family’s getaway. She alleges she arrived to find a dirty room with stains on the bedding and ants running across the floor. She said: 'I was still willing to give the holiday a chance. OK, I wasn't happy with the room but I still had hope that other parts of the hotel would be alright. ‘I realised it would not be the Ritz but it ended up being unbelievable.’ The family claims raw chicken was served at San Antonio's Azuline Hotel Mar Amantis . Jillian Hajrizi and her family claim they were sickened by uncooked food at the resort’s buffet restaurant . Jillian also snapped a pictures of her food after a family member reportedly found glass in the dish at the hotel . The next morning she claimed she cut into a sausage and saw it had not been cooked. As the family ate from the buffet they continued to spot uncooked food, she said. Jillian also claimed she saw a pool of urine on the floor in the corridor of the three-star hotel . Once the family members became sick Mrs Hajrizi said she had to be restricted to her hotel room with Reece for four days as he suffered badly with his symptoms. She claims she complained to the manager but was shrugged off and told to fill out a form. The family say they spotted a filthy swimming pool with algae in it and urine on the floor that was covered by staff with just a towel. They also claim that on one occasion a family member found a shard of glass in an omelette prepared by the restaurant chef. Mrs Hajrizi said: ‘This was supposed to be a nice family holiday but it turned into the holiday from hell.’ She and 16 other family members have instructed solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to investigate their claims. A spokesperson for Thomas Cook said: ‘Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority. ‘Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained. ‘However, we are aware that the party have approached a no-win, no-fee lawyer to act as their legal representative. While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings.’ Jillian Hajrizi and her husband Labinot branded their Ibiza break a 'holiday from hell' Jillian Hajrizi alleges she arrived to find a dirty room with stains on the bedding and ants on the floor . A Jet2holidays spokesperson said: ‘We are sorry to hear about the Hajrizi family's holiday experience and, whilst they were not customers of Jet2holidays, we are investigating the reported incidents.’ Jatinder Paul, an international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is representing the family, said: ‘We are very concerned to hear of the conditions this family have reported experiencing at the Azuline Mar Amantis resort. ‘It is shocking that 20 members of the same family have all suffered serious gastric symptoms, some of whom are children who can be more susceptible to long-term health problems as a result. ‘In particular, Jillian's 11-year-old son suffers from epilepsy and as a result of the severe vomiting and diarrhoea that he suffered. He experienced seizures and required significant care from Jillian.’","Jillian Hajrizi and husband Labinot planned a family break to Ibiza in May .

"A man who faked his own death in an £850,000 life insurance scam is attempting to dodge deportation by claiming his ‘right to a family life’ – despite the fact he has split from his wife. The 59-year-old fraudster, who can only be identified by the initials ‘HJS’, was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty of faking his own death to start a new life in abroad. The father-of-four - who is originally from Ecuador but was living in Farnham, Surrey, at the time of the offence – was jailed after being convicted of fraud totalling £850,000 at Oxford Crown Court in 2012. The man is claiming he should not be deported to his home country of Ecuador because he has a 'right to a private and family life' under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights . The court heard how he took out a £500,000 life insurance policy, several personal loans and ran up large debts on seven different credit cards before his wife – ‘SL’ – told his employers he had suffered a fatal heart attack while on holiday. His life insurance policy paid out and all his debts were wiped after she handed officials his death certificate – but the pair were caught out when investigators found his fingerprints on the document. ‘HJS’ was then extradited from Australia - where he had fled to start a new life under an assumed identity – and jailed. His wife was also jailed for two years for her involvement in the elaborate plot. However, after being convicted, ‘HJS’ was put up for ‘automatic deportation’ by Home Secretary Theresa May who said he should be removed from Britain under rules which state that any foreign criminal jailed for more than 12 months should be deported. He appealed the decision, arguing that being deported was a violation of his right to private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He also said he would face ill-treatment in his home country and claimed asylum under Article 3 of the Act, which protects against torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. His case was initially rejected by immigration judges but he appealed again and the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber said the decision on Article 8 was ‘fatally flawed’. Home Secretary Theresa May (above) said the man should be removed from Britain under rules which state that any foreign criminal who is jailed for more than 12 months should be automatically deported . The case is now due to be heard again, meaning he could potentially be allowed to remain in Britain indefinitely if officials rule his human rights have been violated. He continues to fight for the right to a private and family life, despite reportedly having abandoned his family following his conviction. Conservative MP Dominic Raab, who is campaigning for human rights laws to be reformed, described the situation as ‘crazy’. He told The Daily Telegraph: ‘It's crazy that, yet again, the immigration tribunal is allowing a convicted fraudster who abandoned his family to claim a right to family life to trump the public interest in seeing him removed from Britain. ‘Worse still, the tribunal is airbrushing details of the individual, eroding the principle of open justice, which is vital to retaining public confidence.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We remain at appeal and will be advised by the tribunal about a new hearing date in due course.’","The 59-year-old fraudster faked his own death to forge a new life abroad .

"Swiss food giant Nestle has vowed to remove all traces of artificial colors and flavors from its chocolates by the end of this year - becoming the first major US candy manufacturer to do so. The company announced yesterday that it is committed to giving its customers the healthier ingredients that they have been asking for and will therefore be swapping the artificial flavors and certified colors currently found in its beloved candy for natural alternatives, 'without affecting taste or increasing the price' of its chocolates. 'We never compromise on taste,' Leslie Mohr, the company’s nutrition, health and wellness manager, said in a statement about the changes, which will affect more than 250 products, including Nestle Crunch, Butterfinger and Baby Ruth. Healthy swap: Swiss food company Nestle has announced that will be the first major US candy manufacturer to remove artificial flavors and colors from its chocolate, including the brand's Crunch bars . She added: 'When making these changes to more than 75 recipes, maintaining the great taste and appearance consumers expect from the chocolate brands they know and love is our number one priority.' For example, the Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of Nestle's Butterfinger bars will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees. Meanwhile the brand's Crunch bars will soon be made with natural vanilla flavor instead of artificial vanillin. Nestle looked into making the changes after its internal research indicated that US consumers would prefer popular candy brands to be free of artificial flavors and colors. New recipes: The changes will affect more than 250 products, including Nestle Crunch, Butterfinger and Baby Ruth . Quick fix: The Red 40 and Yellow 5 additives used to make the crispy golden center of this Nestle Butterfinger bar will eventually be replaced with annatto, which comes from the seeds of achiote trees . The updated products will begin hitting shelves in mid-2015 and feature a 'No Artificial Flavors or Colors' label on its candy wrappers. And this is just the beginning. Nestle is also in the process of removing caramel coloring from its chocolate products. 'Our commitment to remove artificial flavors and certified colors in our chocolate candy brands is an important milestone,' said Doreen Ida, the company’s US president. 'We know that candy consumers are interested in broader food trends around fewer artificial ingredients.' She added: 'We’re excited to be the first major U.S. candy manufacturer to make this commitment.'","The Switzerland-based brand said it will replace the artificial colors and flavors with natural ingredients without changing the taste or price of its candy bars by the end of this year .

Mr Harris, who has hosted the Emmy and Tony awards, said it is tricky coming up with material for the Oscars that hasn't already been done. 'I'm finding good jokes that we had that are funny and strong, then I'll watch a late-night talk show and they'll say the same joke,' he explained.

"Mad Men fans will be able to take a stroll through Don Draper's swinging 1960s office and see Megan Draper's iconic 'Zou Bisou Bisou' dress in person with the debut of a museum exhibition dedicated to the AMC series. In celebration of the show's final season return on April 5, the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York, has recreated some of Mad Men's most iconic large-scale sets as a part of its exhibit honoring the drama's stage designs, retro costumes and key props. 'Mad Men is much more than a popular television series, it has become a cultural touchstone inspiring a renewed interest in a critical time in the country’s history,' the museum's curator Barbara Miller said in a statement. Work break: Don Draper (Jon Hamm) lounges inside his office at Sterling Cooper & Partners. A replica of the set will appear at the Museum of the Moving Image's upcoming Matthew Weiner's Mad Men exhibit . Iconic design: Megan Draper (Jessica Paré) sang Zou Bisou Bisou in this little black dress during season five. Her costume will be featured at the museum from March 14 to June 14 . Named after the show's creator Matthew Weiner, the exhibit, which will fun from March 14 to June 14, will feature stage designs, more than 25 iconic costumes, hundreds of props, advertising art and video clips, as well as Mr Weiner's personal notes and research material. In addition to Don's swanky office at Sterling Cooper & Partners, some highlights of Matthew Weiner's Mad Men include a replica of the Draper family kitchen from their home in Ossining, New York, Joan Holloway's red dress and the box of mementos revealing Don's true identity. After the exhibition ends, a number of props and costumes will remain in the museum's permanent collection. Mr Weiner will also make an appearance at the museum on March 20 to discuss the creation and production of the series following the exhibition's March 14 opening. And for anyone eager to get more Mad Men action, the show's creator has also curated a series of 10 films that inspired the series, including Vertigo, The Apartment, Les Bonnes Femmes, and The Americanization of Emily.

'The films chosen by Matt Weiner yield tremendous insight into Mad Men’s approach to character, tone, and atmosphere,' the museum's chief curator David Schwartz said in a statement. He added: 'And the films are great; they should be required viewing for fans of the show as well as its creative team.' Earlier this week, AMC released new promo photographs that featured an uncomfortable Don joined by his ex-wife Betty, his new wife Megan Draper and his teenage daughter Sally, sparking questions about the fate of show's characters. While part one of Mad Men's seventh season ended last May, Mr Weiner has remained tight lipped about how the show will end. 'Can’t tell you that, you got to watch,' he told Deadline after the midseason finale. 'You’ll have to see how we bring it all together.' As for fans' expectations for the final seven episodes, he said: 'We don’t want to punch them in the face. We want them to walk away changed or better or at least entertained by it. That’s all I can say.' But Mr Weiner was adamant that the series will be completely done after this season's last batch of episodes - without any possible sequels or spinoffs. A woman scorned: New promo images show Don sitting next to his ex-wife Betty Francis (January Jones), his current wife Megan Draper (Jessica Paré) and his teenage daughter Sally Draper (Kiernan Shipka) Unlikely friends: Betty and Megan join Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) in this season seven image .","The Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, New York is hosting an exhibit dedicated to Mad Men's sets, costumes and props .

"A mother who survived for 45 minutes without a pulse after giving birth has revealed that during that time she saw a vision of her father surrounded by light. Doctors at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida, were just about to pronounce Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, dead on September 23 when her heart restarted for no clear reason. Graupera-Cassimiro, who has now completely recovered, has revealed that during the 45 minutes, she felt herself floating along a tunnel. 'I remember seeing a spiritual being who I believe was my dad,' she told ABC News. 'I remember the light behind him and many other spiritual beings.' 'Picture of health': Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro is pictured with her daughter Taily at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital, where she mysteriously awoke after having no heart beat for 45 minutes after the birth . But then a 'force' stopped her and she said she knew she couldn't continue. Even though doctors had not touched her in several minutes, her heart started beating again - and miraculously, she had no brain damage or broken ribs from where doctors had performed CPR. Graupera-Cassimiro, who already has a son, had gone to the hospital for a cesarean section and after giving birth to a healthy baby girl, Taily, she started to experience a shortness of breath. She remembers being wheeled into the recovery room and then felt like she'd fallen asleep. Doctors now think amniotic fluid from her womb got into her bloodstream and had stopped her heart beating - which is usually fatal. Vision: She said that while she was unconscious she saw her late father, pictured left holding her first child, surrounded by light. Her husband, pictured with her before the birth right, told her she had looked dead . She passed out for three hours while medics fought to bring her back. Medical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try to restore heart beat and circulation while she was unconscious. But with no sign of life, they called her family into the operation room to declare her death. 'I was dead,' she said. 'My husband tells me, ""You were gray. You were cold as ice, and you were dead. You had no color in your lips"".' She told ABC News that the experience has taught her not to fear death because we 'don't really have control of our lives', she said. She is now at home and caring for her child. Last week she returned to the hospital to thank the medics who helped save her. 'Divine providence': Medics at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida say they don't know why she lived . At the reunion, she said: 'I don't know why I was given this opportunity - but I'm very grateful for it. God had the right people in the right place', she told the Sun Sentinel. A hospital spokesman said: 'She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death. Today she is the picture of health.' Doctors had no immediate explanation for her survival. The spokesman called it 'divine providence.'","Ruby Craupera-Cassimiro, 40, went to a Florida hospital on September 23 for a cesarean section and gave birth to a healthy baby girl .

"Dressed casually in a sweater and baseball cap behind the till surrounded by spirits, this is the photo which shows Barack Obama's uncle continuing to dodge deportation charges while working in a liquor store. Onyango Obama, the son of the President's grandfather, faces allegations of drink-driving and has also been handed a deportation order. The illegal immigrant 67-year-old, described as 'Uncle Omar' in President Obama's book, has allegedly been living illegally in the U.S. since 1992. Day job: Onyango Obama, who faced drink-driving charges today, is . seen working behind the till at Conti Liquors in his home town of . Framingham, Massachusetts . But while his distant nephew may be Commander in Chief, Onyango Obama was spotted this week making ends meet working behind the till at Conti Liquors in Framingham, Massachusetts. Onyango was arrested in August in Framingham on drink-driving charges over allegations he almost collided with a police car. Different lives: President Barack Obama waves as he arrives at Denpasar International Airport on Bali today on his Asian tour and his long-lost Uncle Omar in court today to face charges of drink-driving . Reports at the time claimed that he . pleaded not guilty to the charges and said he would 'call the White . House' when he was arrested. On Thursday a lawyer for Onyango Obama told a judge he plans to file a motion to suppress the traffic stop that led to his client's arrest in August because Obama was not committing any motor vehicle violations. Obama, dressed in a double-breasted suit and tie, has pleaded not guilty. He did not speak during the brief appearance in Framingham District Court. A hearing on his lawyer's suppression request is scheduled for January 12 of next year. Media interest: Onyango Obama was trailed by new cameras on his trip to court . Smartly dressed: Onyango Obama exits the Framingham courthouse today - 48 years after he first arrived on U.S. shores . Omar Obama, born on June 3, 1944, is the U.S. President's half-uncle. Born in Nyang’oma Kogelo, Kenya, as the oldest son of Onyango and Sarah Obama, he normally goes by his father's name. Onyango Jr moved to America in 1963 . as part of Tom Mboya's Airlift Africa project, where Kenyan students . were flown to the U.S. to study at American universities. His father Onyango is Barack . Obama's paternal grandfather, while his mother Sarah is Onyango Sr's third . wife and although not a blood relative, is referred to by the U.S. President as 'Granny Sarah'. Barack Obama's father, Barack Senior, was a Government economist in Kenya who died in 1982. As well as the U.S. President, Barack Obama fathered one daughter and at least four sons. Barack Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was an American anthropologist who died in 1995. In 1962, a year after Barack Obama Jr was born, his father left the family to go to Harvard and pursue a PhD in economics. Two years later the couple's . three-year marriage ended in divorce, with Barack Obama Jr being raised . by his mother and her parents. Onyango Obama is believed to have come to the U.S. in 1963 to attend a high-profile prep school in Massachusetts. He dropped out and was ordered to leave the country in 1989. He appealed the decision - but in 1992, he lost. However, it is thought the deportation order was never enforced, and Obama has been living illegally in the U.S. ever since. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said soon after Obama was arrested that he would not receive any special treatment. Prior . to his court appearance today, Barack Obama's uncle was seen . arriving at the liquor store in Framingham before completing a shift . behind the counter selling alcohol to customers.

"Estée Lauder Creative Director Donald Robertson, who moonlights as the popular Instagram artist Donald Drawbertson, has painted the fashion industry's most notable faces onto walnuts for his nutty project inspired by the holiday snack. The 53-year-old fashion illustrator and father of five from Larchmont, New York, has cleverly rendered portraits of Anna Wintour, Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Chanel, Kanye West, Grace Coddington and more onto the shells of walnuts for his aptly-titled new book Fashion is Nuts. 'Whether it's Edie Campbell dressed in nothing but body paint and a headdress, or Iris Apfel sitting front row wearing her signature glasses and dressed in red fur, fashion is, and has always been wondrously mad,' he explained on his website. Top dog: Instagram artist Donald Robertson painted Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour's face onto a walnut for his new book Fashion is Nuts, in which her portrait is labeled as 'Alpha nut' Suited up: The 53-year-old used walnuts, paint and duct tape to make his unique creations. In his book, Mr Robertson described designer Karl Laferfeld as an 'Uber nut' The 40-page collection of portraits celebrating the crazed fashion industry and its most creative stars retails for $40 and was released last Wednesday, with a limited print run of only 1,000 copies. Mr Robertson used walnuts, paint and duct tape to create his fabulous figures, which were later photographed by Henry Leutwyler. In addition to his book, the artist released $60 posters of individual 'nuts', including Hedi Slimane, Yves Saint Laurent, Pharrell Williams, and Riccardo Tisci. Mr Robertson told Yahoo that he came up with the concept while staring at a bowl of walnuts that were left over from Christmas. He explained: 'I thought: ""Those kind of look like heads."" The next thing you know, I was down in the basement painting all of them and I thought: ""These are kind of cool!"" And then I started to post them, and oh my god, people went crazy.' Double threat: Mr Roberton's rendering of rapper-turned-designer Kanye West is captioned, 'I AM A NUT' Vibrant color: The fashion illustrator used orange duct tape to depict Vogue creative director Grace Coddington's fiery red hair . French fashion: Legendary designer Coco Chanel was imagined wearing her trademark bouclé jacket and smoking a cigarette . And the project took off from there. 'The insane thing about Instagram [is that] you can do this crazy art project with your friends, and then the next thing you know, Sarah [Andelman] from Colette sees it and wants to collaborate,' he said. 'This is the world we live in right now.' The craziness of the situation inspired the hashtag 'fashion is nuts', which later became the title of his art book. When Paper magazine asked Mr Robertson if anyone was insulted by his nutty creations, he explained that he was only worried about rendering Pat MacGrath's portrait because her 'skin is so smooth'. 'I searched for the smoothest walnut I could find,' he told the outlet. 'She just flipgrammed the whole book to her hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram yesterday. So I'm good.' He added: 'Ali [Niroomand], the manager at Sant Ambroeus showed Grace Coddington hers. She laughed, I'm told.'","Estée Lauder Creative Director Donald Robertson painted the faces onto the shells of walnuts for his new book Fashion is Nuts .

"With its grandiose facade and manicured grounds The Elms could easily pass for a magnificent English country estate. But this picturesque mansion was actually built on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in Newport, Rhode Island in the 1900s by a wealthy New York family as an opulent holiday retreat. Newly discovered photographs and documents have shed light on the lives of the army of servants who used to live and work in the great house - which has been likened to that owned by the fictional Crawley family in the hit British TV drama, Downton Abbey. Impressive: The Elms mansion as seen through an opening in an iron fence, in Newport, Rhode Island. The house was built in 1901 as an opulent holiday retreat . Luxury: Rear view of The Elms mansion, facing the sea . Wealth: The Elm's owner was coal merchant Edward . Berwind (left). However, he only tended to have time to visit his . beautiful holiday home (right) on weekends due to his business . commitments in New York City . Opulent: This 1920s photograph shows butler Ernest Birch (centre), surrounded by footmen next to the terrace of The Elms mansion in Newport . Wealth: The nation's wealthiest families built Newport 'cottages' in the 19th and early 20th centuries like The Elms, viewed from its great lawn . The US success of the . British period drama about English aristocrats and their live-in . help has piqued interest in the life of servants in the Newport mansions. The . nation's wealthiest families built Newport 'cottages' in the 19th and . early 20th centuries and would move their households there from New York and elsewhere in the summer to enjoy the . ocean breezes and society scene. Just as the servants in Downton Abbey develop relationships with each other, household staff in the Newport mansions carried on a lively social scene of their own. Many of their stories have begun to emerge through research by the Preservation Society of Newport County, which owns and runs several of the houses. The newly discovered photographs, . documents and family histories have inspired the creation of a guided tour . of The Elms which focuses on the lives of the servants who once worked there. History: The Newport homes were They were built during the so-called 'Gilded Age' in American history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the 20th Century . No expense spared: The Elms' interior is covered with classical paintings and hung with delicate crystal chandeliers . Decorative: The mansion boasts toilets and bathrooms which were state-of-the-art in their day, and ornate fixtures and fittings, like this elegant staircase (right) Parties: The house was designed for entertaining and showing off to friends so its decoration was suitably extravagant. This room boasts a roman style marble bust and an impressive marble fireplace . The Elms was built in 1901 by architect Horace Trumbauer for the Berwinds and features stunning bronze sculptures and fountains . The guided tour allows visitors to . view rarely seen parts of the mansion, including servants' quarters, the . kitchen and the massive boiler room, where coal would be brought in . through a tunnel that goes under the garden wall. The Berwind family had begun to spend . their summers in Newport during the 1890s but it soon became clear that their original residence was too small for their party lifestyle. Edward Julius Berwind, a wealthy New York coal merchant considered at the time to be one of America's most powerful businessmen, hired the renowned architect Horace Trumbauer to build the much larger house that still stands today. It was the first home in Newport to be . completely electrified, boasted modern amenities such as an ice maker . and telephone, and was even featured on the cover of Scientific . American. It continued to be used as a residence until 1961. Social: The ladies of the mansion would groom and beautify themselves for their countless engagements in the wealthy enclave . Decor: The bedrooms at the sprawling mansion were furnished with the finest materials . Scale: The Elms is surrounded by landscaped gardens, which feature manicured hedges and trees and sweeping lawns . Staff: This undated photo shows Grace Rhodes Birch, left, a cook at The Elms mansion, with her husband Ernest Birch, the mansion's butler. The couple married in 1918 . Mr Berwind counted . powerful public figures from America and Europe as friends, including . Theodore Roosevelt and the German Kaiser Wilhelm II among his friends. A self-made man - he was the son of German immigrants - he was considered one of the most important people in Newport's high society. In Downton Abbey, the Crawley family's . own American grandmother, played by Shirley MacLaine, owns homes in New . York and Newport. The city is even mentioned on the . show from time to time, including by Lady Mary Crawley, who considers . fleeing to America to wait out a scandal involving the death of a . Turkish diplomat in her bed. 'It'll be dull but not uncomfortable,' she remarks to her lady's maid, Anna, who asks to come with her. Popular: The British TV series Downton Abbey, starring Hugh Bonneville as Earl of Grantham (left), and Jim Carter as his long serving butler Mr Carson (right) depicts what life was like in the past for servants on a country estate . Similar: The wealthy lifestyle of the family who owned the magnificent estate has been compared to that of the Crawley family in the British TV series Downton Abbey (pictured) Stars: Shirley MacLaine  (pictured) plays Martha Levinson, widowed American heiress and mother of Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham in the hit show . One servant's bedroom featured in the guided tour of The Elms is furnished as it might have been at the time, while another displays census records that show the names, occupations and countries of birth of the Berwind household's domestic staff. This includes around a dozen maids, footmen and others from countries including England, France, Germany and Sweden. The mansion's entire staff were dismissed in 1902 after they asked for more time off, said John Tschirch, director of museum affairs for the mansions, who did much of the research for the tour. Memories: This 1940s photo shows maid Nellie Lynch on the roof of the mansion outside the servants' quarters . The Berwinds simply hired in new staff from New York to replace them. Other bedrooms display photos of servants, as well as journals and other documents, many provided by descendents of those who worked there. One shows a maid standing next to a rocking chair on the mansion's roof. Next to her are flowers in pots displayed on a window ledge. In another photo, the Berwind . household's longtime butler Ernest Birch, who married the family's cook, sits on a . chair outside the mansion surrounded by footmen. Census . records from 1895 show that around 10 percent of the population in . Newport were domestic servants. Staff in the different mansions would have 'kitchen ratchets,' - or parties - in the kitchens. Mr Tschirch said all kinds of family stories have . surfaced, including a tale about the cook, Mrs Birch, whose finger was . clawed by a lobster and had to be removed. 'The descendants,' Mr Tschirch said, 'are beginning to feel that these houses are part of their family histories, too.' Downton Abbey has received critical acclaim on both sides of the channel, and has won numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Mini-series or Television Film and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Mini-series. The series, screened on the PBS channel in the US, has become one of the most widely watched television shows in the world. Grand: The Breakers (pictured) was one of the finest of the holiday 'cottages' built by wealthy families in Newport during the late 19th and early 20th Century . Wealthy families from New York and Boston built huge houses with sprawling gardens in Newport in which to holiday in the summer and to entertain guests. They were built during the so-called 'Gilded Age' in American history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the 20th Century. Among the families who began to build in Newport in the late 19th and early 20th century, were the very wealthy members of America's east coast high society - including the Vanderbilts, Astors and Wideners. Glamour: The Marble House was built between 1888 and 1892 for Alva and William Kissam Vanderbilt. Its construction is credited with helping to transform Newport into a holiday destination for America's wealthiest families . Picturesque: Chateau-sur-Mer was built as a French-style villa for William Shepard Wetmore, a merchant in the China trade. It is now open to the public as a museum . The buildings became key symbols of . status within New York high society, with families trying to outdo each . other with the expense and beauty of their homes. The mansions, which were known, ironically perhaps, as 'cottages,' costs tens of thousands of dollars to build (millions of dollars in today's money) and boasted features such as marble floors and fire places, palladian columns, electricity and other luxuries of the time. Perhaps the finest of these houses was The Breakers which was built in 1895 and the Miramar. The grandiose Marble House, which was built between 1888 and 1892 by the Vanderbilts, is credited with helping to attract other wealthy families to follow suit by building holiday homes in Newport. Design: Built between 1881 and 1883, The Isaac Bell House, Newport, is considered to be one of the finest Shingle Style houses in the US . Finery: Built between 1898 and 1902, Rosecliff was built by Theresa Fair Oelrichs - a 'silver heiress' from Nevada . Families came to Newport for the social season holding grand parties. However, for all their grandeur, the houses often had relatively few bedrooms, as the guests were expected to have their own property nearby. Many of the mansions . were designed by the renowned New York-based architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had a house in Newport himself. Many of the mansions remain in private use, although a number are now card for by the Preservation Society of Newport County. Others were . converted into academic buildings for Salve Regina College in the 1930s. Decorative: Kingscote is one of the first summer 'cottages' to be built in Newport.

"It was crunch time. Five months after being so ill I was virtually written off for dead by friends and the medical profession alike, I had rallied and felt well enough to brave a public appearance. The event was the Bafta Film Awards in February this year; the dress, a chiffon number, cut cleverly to disguise my pregnant-looking stomach – bloating being an unfortunate side effect of the steroids  I’m on for my secondary stage four breast cancer. As I walked the red carpet, I thought I looked good. But on closer inspection of the paparazzi pictures in the papers the next day, I was disappointed. Feeling fabulous: Sally Farmiloe-Neville, pictured with her daughter Jade in May at the BAFTAs, after she underwent non-invasive plastic surgery . It wasn’t so much my figure, but my face that let me down. My eyes looked tired, my skin wrinkled and jowly. I had the air of someone sad and slightly dejected – two words I would never use to describe myself. You might say that’s par for the course for someone who has a terminal illness. But I beg to differ. It is more important than ever for me to look good, to show the world that, despite this dreadful disease,  I am determined to enjoy life. As a model and actress, my looks are not only inexorably linked to  my identity and self-esteem, but  to my career. And even if my income weren’t reliant on my appearance, I would still fight to make the most of it, because looking good makes me feel good. Talk to any woman with cancer and she’ll tell you the prospect of losing her hair is every bit  as harrowing as the chemotherapy. Luckily, my husband, Jeremy Neville, 61, a chartered surveyor, tells me I’m beautiful. He has even been well trained to buy the false eyelashes I am reluctant to leave our west London home without, now my own have fallen out. Unhappy: Images of Sally at the BAFTA red carpet in 2013  made her desire a facelift . Nonetheless, since I was first diagnosed in May 2012, I’ve made it my mission to fight for my looks with the tenacity with which I have fought for my life. I started my career by winning a ‘beautiful eyes’ contest  in the Sixties and I’m certainly not going to let standards slip now. But two rounds of chemo – the first after my diagnosis and the second that I’ve been on for nearly six months since discovering, last year, the cancer had spread to my liver and bones – have taken their toll. My skin has a dryness not even the best creams can counter, while the steroids I take to combat the effects of chemotherapy have left it paper-thin. It bruises easily. Touch it too hard and it will bleed. After those Bafta pictures, my confidence plummeted. So when I saw an article about a non-surgical facelift in The Mail on Sunday a week later, it felt like serendipity. Here was a procedure that could give me back some youthful vigour without subjecting me to the surgeon’s scalpel – crucial because when your body  is weakened by chemo, anything invasive is off limits. Heyday: Sally is pictured in 1987, 25 years before her cancer diagnosis . Before my wedding in 2002, I had Botox. It gave me a droopy eyelid and the fringe I grew to disguise it made me look like a demented Yorkshire terrier. A few years later, I tried again and ended up with an almighty black bruise on my chin. I fared better with fillers, which softened the lines from my nose to my mouth, but post-cancer diagnosis they, too, were out of the question. The non-surgical facelift, which costs £2,000 to £3,000, works by using ultrasound to target the facial muscles. The energy creates thousands of little holes in the tissue, which heal after two to three weeks, contracting and tightening the skin. To top it all off, it was done by a man who is, to put it bluntly, gorgeous. Dr Georges Roman, from the Aesthetic Medical Clinic in central London, has had the procedure himself. He’s 49 but looks 39. The procedure, last month, took  40 minutes. A layer of ultrasound gel was spread on my face. Then Dr Roman moved the wand very slowly over my face. The sensation was that of tiny little prickles; slightly uncomfortable but not painful. After he’d finished half my face, he let me look in a mirror. I was astounded –  the side that had  been targeted looked tighter and smoother. My skin  was glowing rather than red. I was thrilled. With every day that passed after that my skin got a little bit brighter. Better still, the benefits can last up to five years. Ironically, I was booked to attend the Bafta TV awards just five days after the procedure – and three months after the initial Bafta pictures caused me dismay. It was to be the ultimate test. Standing on the red carpet with my 22-year-old daughter Jade, wearing a feathered oyster-pink dress, I felt fabulous. And the pictures didn’t disappoint. My agent has lined up some modelling jobs, including a semi-permanent make-up line I’m endorsing. I’ve also been offered a role in a play in September which, depending on my health, I may accept. Meanwhile, my cancer remains under control. Tests last month revealed that the tumours in my liver have gone and there is only a tiny bit in my bones. My oncologist has dubbed me Lazarus as I have risen from the dead. I hope I will inspire other women to realise that not only can they  live a full life with cancer, but that they can do so while looking good.

"A Washington couple . accused of starving, beating and forcing their adopted daughter to stay . outside as punishment have been sentenced to spend decades in prison for . her death. Larry and Carri . Williams were convicted on September 9 and sentenced on Tuesday for the . manslaughter in the death of a teenage girl they adopted from Ethiopia. Carri Williams was also found guilty of homicide by abuse. Hana . Williams was found dead May 12, 2011, in the backyard of the family . home in Sedro-Woolley, about 60 miles north of Seattle. Sentenced: Cari Williams (left) faces just under . 37 years behind bars and her husband Larry (right) was sentenced to . just under 28 years for their abuse of their adoptive daughter . Hana Williams was found frozen and starved to death in the yard of her adoptive parents' Washington home in 2011. They were given maximum sentences today for causing her death . The autopsy said she died of hypothermia, with malnutrition and a stomach condition as contributing factors. Carri . Williams was sentenced Tuesday to just under 37 years, the top of the . standard sentencing range, by Judge Susan Cook who said she probably . deserved more time in prison, the Skagit Valley Herald reported. Her . husband received a sentence of nearly 28 years. Cook vacated Carri Williams' manslaughter conviction because she was convicted of homicide by abuse for the same conduct. Both . also were found guilty of assault of a child for punishing a boy they . adopted in 2008 from Ethiopia at the same time as Hana. Carted away: During the trial, Larry Williams turned on his wife Carri and said that she was the main force behind the abuse of their adopted children . Shaming: The judge spoke out against the couple, saying that they deserved more than the maximum sentences . Both appeared in court in red jail uniforms and were led away in handcuffs after the sentencing. The boy from Ethiopia testified that the parents used sticks or belts to beat him all over his body as punishment. He also described being sprayed with a water hose if he wet his pants. After the arrests, the boy and six biological children were placed in foster care or with relatives. The . courtroom was filled with many Ethiopians and nine of the jurors who . convicted Larry and Carri Williams after a seven-week trial in Skagit . County Superior Court. Wasting away: Hana, pictured left sometime after . her arrival in the U.S., lost nearly 30lbs between 2009 and 2011, and . had her head shaven when she was found dead in the backyard . Angelic: Hana, pictured second left, seen as a young girl with her family back in Ethiopia . Cause of death: An autopsy showed that the 13-year-old died from hypothermia exacerbated by malnutrition and gastritis . Defense lawyers told jurors that questionable parenting practices didn't necessarily amount to a crime. On . the rainy night Hana died, Carri Williams called 911 and reported Hana . was not breathing, saying the girl had refused to come into the house. Hana was found face-down in the backyard with mud in her mouth. Hana is believed to have been 13, but no documentation of her birth in Ethiopia was available. The trial was postponed several times, and her body was exhumed in January. Manslaughter: Larry Williams (left) was . sentenced to 28 years and Carri Williams to 37 years after being found . guilty of manslaughter in the death of their 13-year-old Ethiopian . adopted daughter . Dragged away: Carri Williams is taken into custody last month after a jury deemed her guilty of the 2011 death of her daughter. She was also found guilty of homicide by abuse . Tests . on her teeth and bones gave varying estimates, and experts were unable . to agree on her age. Her age was significant because the homicide by . abuse charge applies only if the victim was younger than 16. During the trial, Larry Williams turned on his wife and blamed her for the child's death. Lingering fear: Foster mother Sheila Jackson, who took in Immanuel after the Williamses' arrest, said the boy was very thin, always hungry and  terrified to talk about his adoptive parents . Mr . Williams said through his attorney that his wife should spend decades . in jail because 'she was the primary actor' in all of the treatment of . Hana and Immanuel, the Ethiopian boy. A foster mother testified during the trial that the couple's other adopted son Immanuel was rail-thin and covered in scratches when she took him in. The testimony from foster mother Sheila Jackson came on day 18 of the Williams murder trial. Jackson, who is deaf, told the jury in a Mount Vernon courtroom that when the Williamses’ son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia, came to live with her, she could barely keep up with his demands for food. 'He ate fast. He ate a lot. He ate more than I expected,' she told on the stand, the station KIRO-TV reported. According to the foster mother, the child was so emaciated that his ribs were showing through his skin covered in markings from past beatings. Immanuel, now 12 years old, testified during the trial that the Williamses beat him and Hana with belts and switches. After the arrests, Immanuel and six biological children were placed in foster care or with relatives. The parents kept the family isolated from non-relatives, home-schooled the children and followed strict religious principles described in the Christian parenting book titled ‘To Train Up a Child,’ investigators said. Tough disciplinarians: Hana and her adoptive brother were allegedly spanked, hit with sticks, hosed down and forced to eat frozen food . As . punishment for bad behavior, the teen told the court that he and his . step-sister were fed frozen meals, hosed down and forced to sleep in . closets, where they would listen to recordings of the Bible on tape and . Christian music. The defense has attempted to paint Immanuel as a disobedient boy with an attitude problem. The . lawyers for the couple said Immanuel hit and bit Jackson’s daughter so . badly that her teacher ended up calling CPS after the child came to . school with bruises. Sheila Jackson said that Immanuel has been getting counselling and his behaviour has been improving. Blaming the victim: On a 911 call after Hana's . death, Carri Williams (left) told the dispatcher that her 'rebellious' adopted daughter had killed herself by throwing herself down to the . ground and refusing to come indoors . In 2008, Immanuel was 7 years old . when the American couple, both devout Christians, adopted him and Hana . from Ethiopia. Larry worked at Boeing while his wife was a stay-at-home . mom home-schooling the two adopted kids and their seven biological . children. 'I would suffer with the pain until it eventually went away,' he said in sign language July 29. Larry’s . attorney, Rachel Forde, characterized the Ethiopian boy as a . troublemaker who lied to his adoptive parents and refused to do lessons . assigned by his mother. While . the couple's biological children, five of whom had testified during the . trial, were generally treated better, the strict rules in the Williams . household applied to them as well. Guilty: Larry Williams listens in Skagit County court days before a jury found him and wife Carri guilty of neglecting and ultimately killing their adopted Ethiopian daughter Hana . Wicked: Carri Williams cries during her trial. She was convicted of homicide by abuse in addition to manslaughter . According to Joseph Williams, . however, he and his siblings were given the authority to punish and even . spank their adopted brother and sister, KIRO-TV reported. Joseph was called to the stand to describe the night of May 12, 2011, when his 13-year-old adopted sister died. Joseph . told the court that after Hana died while sitting in the yard in . 40-degree weather, his mother instructed him to bring the girl's body . inside, where she performed CPR and called 911. The mother of nine said on the call that her daughter Hana 'has killed herself.' When asked by the 911 dispatcher why she believed her daughter had taken her own life, Williams said that the girl was not breathing and lying face down in the mud after refusing to come indoors, according to the Seattle Times. Calling Hana 'rebellious,' the mother said that she had seen the 13-year-old throwing herself to the ground and staggering about the yard after taking her clothes off.","Larry .

"Migrants will be banned from receiving any benefits until they have contributed to Britain, under government plans to limit access to handouts. David Cameron today announced the period for which European migrants can claim benefits is to be halved and recruitment agencies are to be banned from advertising jobs exclusively overseas. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith revealed plans to go even further to secure EU agreement to stop benefits being paid to people who have not contributed to to the state, raising the prospect of handouts being linked to tax payments. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron announced migrants would only be allowed to claim benefits for three months, but Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith revealed plans to go further and ban claims for people who have not contributed to the welfare state . The Conservatives are forcing through further measures to deter so-called ‘benefit tourists’. In January, the Government introduced rules that meant European migrants had to wait three months before they could claim out-of-work benefits – and then could only claim for a maximum of six months. Today Mr Cameron said the claim period will be cut from six months to three months from November and applied to jobseekers’ allowance, child tax credit and child benefit. The Government will also stop recruitment firms from advertising British jobs elsewhere in the EU without also doing so in the UK – in English. Agencies have been accused of recruiting only foreign workers for specific shifts, for jobs such as fruit picking and hotel work, without even offering a chance to UK citizens. But Mr Duncan Smith said this was the limit of what the government could within European law, but ministers are pushing to go further. He said there was 'growing consensus' with countries like Germany, Holland and Spain to limit access to migrants who have not contributed to the state. Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'What we’re working on with others in Europe [is] that there should not be a right to just enter a country and claim benefits unless you’ve contributed. Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's World at One: 'What we’re working on with others in Europe [is] that there should not be a right to just enter a country and claim benefits unless you’ve contributed. He said there was 'growing consensus' with countries like Germany, Holland and Spain to limit access to migrants who have not . 'So the eventual plan – and this is where we want to be and I think there is a lot of general agreement about this – is that people should have contributed to the system when they come in before being able to claim anything.' In addition to the crackdown on benefits, to highlight the government's tough stance on immigration, David Cameron the Home Secretary Theresa May joined a raid on a property in Slough where illegal immigrants were thought to be living . The Government will prohibit recruitment firms from advertising British jobs elsewhere in the EU without also doing so in the UK – in English . Key measures announced today include: . He said that under the last Labour government it was possible to claim housing benefit 'so their immigration policies did leave a very, very big open door. We’re shutting that door, but we’ve yet more to do'. On a visit to an immigration raid in Slough, Mr Cameron claimed the changes announced today will save the British taxpayer half a billion pounds over the next five years. During this morning's raid, immigration officers found four Albanian men aged between 27 and 31, along with one minor, who all entered the country illegally. In the same house, they detained a Kenyan woman, aged 35, who had overstayed her visa, while at a separate address was a 35-year-old Indian visa overstayer who was in possession of a false Portuguese passport. A Home Office spokesman said all of them have been taken to immigration detention pending removal from the country, apart from the minor, who is in the care of social services. The Prime Minister said the crackdown was the latest attempt to reverse a ‘soft touch’ approach adopted by Labour, who he accused of ‘practically sending out search parties’ for people to come to Britain. He claimed so-called ‘highly skilled’ migrants allowed in under the last government had ended up ‘stacking shelves’. Mr Cameron said: 'Let's be clear - some people are coming here to work, some people are coming here to claim, some people are coming here pretending to be students. I have a very clear approach to this, which is, if you don't have a right to be here, you will be sent home, you shouldn't be here. 'People want to know that, yes, we have a fair legal migration system but, in terms of illegal migration, we will find you and we will send you home.' He added: 'We want an immigration system that puts Britain first and so what we're doing today is a whole series of changes that says to people if you come here illegally we will make it harder for you to have a home, to get a car, to have a job, to get a bank account, and when we find you - and we will find you - we'll make sure you're sent back to the country that you came from.' During this morning's raid, immigration officers found four Albanian men aged between 27 and 31, along with one minor, who all entered the country illegally . Mr Cameron said the latest crackdown was an attempt to reverse a ‘soft touch’ approach adopted by Labour, who he accused of ‘practically sending out search parties’ for people to come to Britain . Mr Cameron will also warn that some . universities and colleges could lose their licences to recruit overseas . students in a tightening of visa rules. Ministers say a current 20 per cent tolerance threshold of student visa refusals that education institutions are allowed before losing their ‘highly trusted’ status is too generous. It is expected to be lowered to 10 per cent. Other measures coming into force include attempts to rein in abuse of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to family life – by migrants to avoid deportation. In future, judges will have to consider the British public interest too, Mr Cameron said. Labour's home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper said 'we have had reannouncement after reannouncement from the Tories but little in the way of firm action' The Government is also introducing a new system of ‘deport now, appeal later’, designed to help the authorities remove foreign criminals – who will have to launch any appeal from their own country rather than delaying their departure with endless legal action. ‘Under Labour, 2.5million more people came to this country than left. As Peter Mandelson has admitted, they were practically sending out 'search parties' for people to come here,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘It used to be that European jobseekers could claim JSA (jobseekers’ allowance) or child benefit for a maximum of six months before their benefits would be cut off, unless they had very clear job prospects. 'We will be reducing that cut-off point to three months, saying very clearly: you cannot expect to come to Britain and get something for nothing.’ Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Government was failing on immigration despite Mr Cameron's promise to get it down to the tens of thousands. 'We need less talk from the Prime Minister on immigration and more action,' she said. 'It's almost a year and a half since Labour called for benefit restrictions on new migrants. In that time we've had reannouncement after reannouncement from the Tories but little in the way of firm action. 'Behind the rhetoric, the true picture of this Government on immigration is one of failure, with net migration going up, despite David Cameron's promise to get it down to the tens of thousands. 'The Government should get a grip and finally implement Labour's proposals to stop the undercutting of wages and jobs for local workers by the exploitation of low-skilled migrant labour, including banning recruitment agencies that only hire foreign workers and pressing for stronger controls in Europe.'","Recruitment agencies will be banned from only advertising jobs overseas .

"There's a graceful giraffe, a brightly coloured dragonfly and a spider that's far from itsy bitsy. At first glance, they all look like wonders from the animal kingdom. But look a little closer and you'll spot a woman's hand here, her foot poking out there, or the outline of her torso twisted into an extraordinary pose. For these remarkable images were all created by 'body concept artist' Emma Fay - with a little help from a couple of contortionists who acted as her human 'canvas'. Scroll down for video . Now you see it: Body artist Emma Fay, 27, spends up to six hours creating each of her animals, from a zebra (left) to a mandrill (right), by painting on two very patient contortionists. She lines them up and draws composition marks on their bodies to make the images perfect . Blink and you'll miss it! One of the talented contortionists is transformed by Miss Fay into a glittering, multi-coloured dragonfly . Here's looking at you! The eyes on this crab are shining out of the shoulder blades of Miss Fay's model. The 27-year-old from Leicester used to run a hair and beauty salon, and began honing her unusual craft three years ago. Now her pictures are known worldwide . Protected modesty: Contortionists Beth Sykes and Lowri Thomas wear white leotards against a white background to finish the effect . The stuff of nightmares: You wouldn't want this giant tarantula under your bed - no matter how elegantly it was painted . Miss Fay, 27, of Leicester, has been perfecting her unusual art for three years after previously running a hair and beauty salon. Each of the images in her 'The Marvels of Nature' animal series, which also include a seahorse, mandrill, zebra and crab, took between four and six hours to create from start to finish. First the contortionists, Beth Sykes and Lowri Thomas, who wore leotards to protect their modesty, got into the required pose so Miss Fay could draw compositional marks on their bodies. These acted as a guide to ensure her paintings would turn out to be the optical illusions she desires. Some of the poses were so difficult they could only be held for minutes at a time. But thankfully for Miss Sykes and Miss Thomas, they did not have to hold their poses throughout the painting process - the vast majority was done in more comfortable positions, often lying down. If I could talk to the animals: The models take their work very seriously, even when dressing up as a highly convincing mandrill monkey . Thoughtful: Miss Fay said the art reminds her of 'the remarkable ways animals have evolved to survive in their surroundings' The artist in her studio: It takes great patience, talent and upper body strength to find the west African mandrill in Leicester . Almost there! The contortionist has a rare chance to relax as Emma and her assistants put the finishing touches to the crab's face . The process begins: One of Emma's models takes the position for the crab portrait against a bright white background . Careful work: Emma then paints white lines on the models' bodies to help with her composition so they can relax again later . Patience: Once the structure of the animal is in place, Miss Fay can check it's worked, then paint the rest using a sponge and brush . Miss Fay used a brush and sponge to apply the water-based paints to their bodies. Once the painting was completed, it was then just a case of the contortionist resuming the requisite pose so a photograph could be taken of the finished artwork against a white background. Miss Fay, who sells prints of her animal creations, said: 'The photograph is pretty much the last five minutes of the whole process - then Beth and Lowri are free to go home and have a well-deserved shower. 'The photographs always get a briliant response. People love the optical illusion aspect of it. 'For me, it's kind of exploration of evolution - a study of the remarkable things humans can do with their bodies and the remarkable ways animals have evolved to survive in their surroundings. 'I consider them pieces of art, not body painting.' Concept and design: Emma Fay; Model: Beth Sykes; Assistants: Charlotte Mahdoodi, Charlotte Faulkner; Photography: Jonathan Macauley . Prepare to scare: Lowri Thomas gets into position after being painted as a giant tarantula in artist Emma Fay's studio in Leicester . Talent: The body paint takes many hours to apply, and the colours are chosen carefully to match those of the intended animals . Finishing touches: Miss Fay's work, including the giant tarantula, has been shared around the world by those who marvel at the illusions . Into the coccoon: The beginnings of one contortionist's transformation into a bright, glittering dragonfly in Miss Fay's studio . Painstaking: As the model holds the uncomfortable position, artist Miss Fay uses water paints and a picture booklet as a guide . Why so serious? Creating a dragonfly is no easy task - it takes a steady hand and some careful detailing on the contortionist's skin . The magician's secrets: Panning back out on the scene, the dragonfly almost complete, shows not a forest but a well-furnished studio .","Emma Fay, 27, from Leicester, began performing her elaborate trick after running a hair and beauty salon .

"Louise Huart with her son Keegan-James. She believes she was close to losing him during the complicated birth . A young mother claims hospital staff were at fault for her son almost dying - with one nurse even asking 'is he dead yet?' Louise Huart says her and her baby boy, Keegan-James, 'are lucky to be here' after they both survived a battle for life through the birth process. Her newborn son had suffered severe blood and fluid loss and contracted suspected sepsis during the delivery. The 22-year-old from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, claims midwives at Scarborough General Hospital, where Keegan-James was delivered, should have realised he was in a life-threatening condition and ordered an emergency caesarean earlier. After being transferred to Hull Women and Children’s Hospital after the birth, she said nurses told her that a member of staff from Scarborough had called to see if her baby 'was dead yet'. The allegation was refuted by a hospital spokesperson, who said there was 'no evidence' the 'wholly unacceptable' comment was made by its staff. She said: 'What happened to us was absolutely appalling. We are both so lucky to be here.' Ms Huart was rushed to the hospital in Scarborough on May 13 by her partner, Leo Parker, 23, as her contractions fell to just two minutes apart and she received gas and air, pethidine and an epidural. When her waters broke at 3.30am, they were thick with meconium, a sign that Keegan-James could be in distress. Despite a monitor showing her son’s heart rate was dipping, she claims a doctor who attended to her said the baby was fine. She had to have her epidural topped up twice, but by 7.30am her contractions had stopped completely. 'I thought he had just given up - it was heart-breaking.' Keegan-James Parker in hospital after the complicated birth process. He contracted suspected sepsis . Keegan-James' mother Louise Huart claims staff should have realised he was in a life-threatening condition earlier . Finally, after being encouraged to deliver her child naturally for two hours without contractions, she headed for a caesarean section at 10.30am. After she received another spinal injection, she had an asthma attack and fell unconscious. 'I’ve had asthma since I was a child but I don’t use inhalers and I don’t even go to reviews.' She met her son for the first time after 39 hours after they were both transferred to Hull Women and Children’s Hospital. She said: 'For the nine days we were there, staff in Hull were fantastic. 'On the day we were discharged, one of the nurses told me someone from Scarborough had called to see if Keegan-James was ""dead yet"". 'Obviously, they hadn’t expected him to survive.' Ms Huart has now contacted a lawyer and written a letter of complaint to Scarborough General Hospital . A . spokesperson for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs . Scarborough Hospital, denied a staff member had made the comment. 'This . type of comment is wholly unacceptable for any healthcare provider. We . keep clear records of contact with all neonatal units outside our area . and there is no evidence of such a comment.' Louise has just learned how close she came to losing her son after she was called to Scarborough Hospital to go through her delivery notes. Keegan-James was born with meconium aspiration syndrome, when a baby breathes in a mixture of amniotic fluid and meconium, and hypovolemic shock, which is severe blood and fluid loss meaning the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body. He also had suspected sepsis, which is an infection of the blood, pulmonary hypertension of the new-born and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, when the brain is deprived of oxygen. Louise has contacted a solicitor and is now writing a letter of complaint to Scarborough Hospital. Liz Ross, head of midwifery at York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, added: 'We were sorry to hear Ms Huart had concerns regarding the care provided at Scarborough Hospital during the birth of her son. 'A meeting has taken place with Ms Huart to go through the events of the birth and we are disappointed to hear she was unhappy with the outcome of this meeting. 'We are committed to being open and honest with our patients. We offered Ms Huart the opportunity to come back and speak to us at any time. 'We would encourage her to do this so we can continue to work with her to address the issues she has raised here.'","Young mother and her baby son survived a battle for life during birth .

"They were the louts of yesteryear, banned from the pubs of a city in the early 20th century after flouting strict public drinking laws. Now an Edwardian-era book of police mugshots depicting dozens of Dundee citizens banned from drinking houses is set to go under the hammer. Anyone convicted under the Inebriates Act of 1898 three times in the space of 12 months faced being added to the book. 'Wants teeth in the upper jaw': Jane Swaddel, aka Jane Williamson, a factory worker, was the oldest person listed in the book aged 63 . Descriptions: Jane Swaddel was a 63-year-old woman standing just over 5ft tall, who had dark brown hair and grey eyes . Mugshot: Alice Roony, 54, who lived at the Overgate in the city and was a pedlar. She was banned from Dundee's pubs for flouting strict public drinking laws . Child: The youngest in the book was 16-year-old Margaret Devannah who lived on Seagate and worked at Queen Victoria Works . Their picture and description would then be circulated around the city's bars and clubs. Those . pictured could then be fined up to 40 shillings if they tried to buy . alcohol again - and landlords could be fined up to £20 for serving them. The . pages of the book describe offenders with names, addresses, . workplaces, a description and space for peculiarities and marks to be . noted. Jane Swaddel, aka Jane Williamson, a factory worker, was the oldest person listed in the book aged 63. No drinking: Thomas Malloch of Blackness Road worked as a labourer. His picture and description was circulated around the city's bars and clubs . Barred: John Boyd, 46, was listed after being found in a state of intoxication and incapable of taking care of himself, and not under the care of a suitable person . Likeness document: John Boyd was described as standing 5ft 4in, with dark brown hair and brown hair - and with a 'left eye awanting', i.e. missing . It . was noted that she 'wants teeth in the upper jaw' and was added to the . book after being convicted under the Licensing (Scotland) Act in March . 1905. John Boyd, 46, was . listed after being found in a state of intoxication and incapable of . taking care of himself, and not under the care of a suitable person. He was convicted at the Police Court in Dundee and was described as of proportionate build with fresh complexion. However, officers noted under peculiarities that the unemployed fish dealer's left eye was missing. Under the hammer: Steven Dewar, of auctioneers Curr and Dewar, said it was 'quite an unusual lot - I've never seen anything quite like it' In detail: The banning order signed by chief constable W Dewar, who is no relation to auctioneers Curr and Dewar . Auctioneers Curr and Dewar said the . book was being put up for auction by a landlord who ran a pub on the . site of the current Bissell's Bar in Dundee. Licensing was ﬁrst introduced to Scotland in 1756, some two centuries later than in England and Wales. Temperance societies had been set up in the Victorian era to combat the problem of binge drinking, and they were initially made up of people who pledged abstinence from alcohol. One of the most well-known of these groups was Band of Hope - known today as Hope UK - which was established in Leeds in 1847. As support grew, the Christian charity’s estimated membership in 1897 was at 3.2million, with Queen Victoria its patron. Two years later, a survey in Liverpool found 55 per cent of children born to drunken mothers died before reaching the age of two. As the 20th century began, there were various reforms which saw shopkeepers banned from selling intoxicating liquors to children under 14, except in corked and sealed containers. And the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1903 established general opening hours for pubs of 8am to 11pm, as well as Sunday closing. Steven Dewar, of Curr and Dewar, said: 'It's quite an unusual lot - I've never seen anything quite like it. 'It's a book that would have been handed to publicans by the police. ‘It's . naming and giving a mugshot of people who have been convicted of being . intoxicated and incapable of taking care of themselves. ‘It . says if they try to buy liquor to report them to police to be dealt . with. This copy was given to a publican called John Kennedy of Polepark . Road. ‘It gives all the details of the person as well as their picture - and their “peculiarities”. 'It is signed by the constable in charge and there are about 40 of them in all. It's quite a unique piece - it's got a history. ' He added: 'It's quite fascinating really - a real snapshot of the time it comes from. It was very much a recognised thing at the time. 'But I suppose it's the kind of thing you wouldn't be allowed to do now in case it contravened someone's privacy.’ ‘It covers a big age range - from 16 to 63 - and surprisingly is mostly females. There's also a strong Irish contingent amongst it.' Many Irish immigrants made their way to the east coast of Scotland in the 1840s and 1850s, with a large female Irish community that established itself in Dundee. Respect MP George Galloway was born in Dundee a century later in 1954 to his teetotal parents - a Scottish trade unionist father and Irish republican mother. Mr Dewar added of the mugshots in the book: ‘These are all hard working people living at a hard time - jute mill workers and factory workers. ‘We've only valued it at £50 to £100 but that's just because we've no idea what it will be worth to someone.’ Dundee is often labelled as being the home of 'jute, jam and journalism', thanks to the prominence of each trade in its industrial heritage. Jute is a fibre used for making rope or woven into matting. In the late 19th century, there were more than 50,000 workers employed across 60 jute mills in the city. On jam, it was said that Dundee woman Janet Keillor discovered marmalade in the late 1700s. And on journalism, DC Thomson, which publishes The Beano, was established in Dundee in 1905. The mugshots book will go under the hammer at Curr and Dewar auctioneers in Dundee next Tuesday at 10am.","Anyone convicted under Inebriates Act of 1898 three times in the space of 12 months faced being added to book .

"In Quincy, California, it is against the law to drive without ice cream - at least according to a hilarious new ad featuring local cops with a sense of humor and a sweet tooth. In the commercial advertising Wall's Ice Cream, a group of officers from Quincy pulled over a half-dozen unsuspecting motorists - only to surprise them with Cornetto ice cream cones. The video, which has gone viral over the past week, begins with a stern-looking, real-life Plumas County Sheriff Greg Hagwood talking about how serious being a cop is. Scroll down for video . That's cold! In the commercial for Wall's Ice Cream, officers from Quincy, California, pulled over a half-dozen unsuspecting motorists and handed them ice cream . Panic-stricken: Motorists appeared nervous and tense when faced with sheriff's deputies seemingly performing a traffic stop . 'Law enforcement is serious work,' he says into the camera. 'We deal with serious issues.' The action then shifts outside as the sheriff and his deputies pile into a patrol car and proceed to stop at random several cars on the road. During each traffic stop, the drivers appear tense and filled with apprehension in the face of a looming traffic ticket as officers ask them routine questions like, 'How many people do you have on board' and, 'Are you familiar with vehicle code section 33942?' As the officers take their leave, promising to return shortly, the drivers look panicked because they think they know what's coming next.

"A poll has revealed that one in seven Britons don't know how to tell the time on a clock face. Pictured is Joey Essex, who famously admitted he didn't know to do so . The American mathematician and science fiction writer E.T. Bell famously wrote that time makes fools of us all'. He would probably have been pretty horrified to discover that one in seven Britons admit they can't tell time on a non-digital watch. A new poll by an online watch retailer has uncovered a worrying trend amongst Britons with regards to telling the time, with many parents not teaching their young children how. The issue hit the headlines during the most recent I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, where 23 year old TOWIE star Joey Essex admitted he could not fathom the myriad intricacies of the two arms on a clock. Firstly, the poll aimed to determine whether more Britons owned digital or non-digital watches. A fifth, 19 per cent, claimed to own a digital watch, while 52 per cent had an analogue watch of some description. All respondents were then asked if they could tell the time on a non-digital watch, with 14 per cent stating ‘no’. However, 32 per cent of these respondents said that they actually owned a non-digital watch, meaning that they wore one but couldn’t properly use it. When asked why they had a non-digital watch if they couldn’t even tell the time, the majority (67 per cent) said it was just a fashion accessory, while 17 per cent said that they planned to get round to learning at some point. A total of 47 per cent said that they had simply never been taught how, whilst 31 per cent claimed it was because they had never needed to learn. All respondents were then asked which accessories or devices they used the most to tell the time. The majority, 45 per cent, admitted to using their mobile phone the most to find out what the time was, while 27 per cent used a watch and 19 per cent used a computer, laptop or tablet. Not that hard: When asked why they had a watch if they couldn’t even tell the time, 67 per cent said it was just a fashion accessory . Six per cent said they used their TV to find out the time amd three per cent said they tended to ask somebody else. According to the poll of 2,197 people by . www.TwistedTime.com, 37 per cent of the parents taking part with . children aged 10 or under said they had not or didn’t plan to teach . their children to read the time on non-digital watches . 19 per cent claimed to own a digital watch . 52 per cent had an analogue watch . 37 per cent won't teach kids to tell time . 14 per cent can't tell time, and of them... 32 per cent owned an analogue watch and... 67 per cent admitted it was for style statement . The majority, 61 per cent, explained that they didn’t see the need because time was now, more often than not, displayed in a digital format. Alan Moore, Founder of TwistedTime.com, said the following about the findings: 'It’s shocking to see that as many as one in seven British adults can’t tell the time on a non-digital watch. With so many gadgets providing the time in a digital format however, it’s easy to see how some people just never feel the need to learn. 'I really can’t believe that 37 per cent of parents with young children don’t see the importance of teaching their children how to tell the time on an analogue watch – there will inevitably come a time in their life when they need to read the time in a non-digital format and instead they’re going to have to rely on others. 'More people use their mobile phones to tell the time than any other method, which seems funny to me because perhaps even those with watches on will be delving into their pockets to find their handset when they could just look at their wrist for a time check.'","A poll has discovered that many adults struggle with simple task .

"From its glamorous spectators to its stylish competitors, tennis has always been a fashionable affair that values its players' ensembles nearly as much as their backhands. In celebration of the sport's longstanding relationship with fashion, publishing company teNeues is releasing The Stylish Life: Tennis, a coffee table book exploring the game's preppy yet glamorous cultural evolution. 'Tennis grew as a sport from the Victorian time, played by the aristocracy,' author Ben Rothenberg told the Wall Street Journal. 'Looking good was just as important as playing the game.' American royalty: A young John F. Kennedy was photographed playing tennis with his then-fiancée Jacqueline Onassis (nee Bouvier) at the Kennedys's Cape Cod home in the summer of 1953 . A-list sport: Diane Keaton and Woody Allen hold tennis rackets during a scene in the 1977 film Annie Hall . The photography book is filled with both modern and vintage images of the celebrities, the players and the preppy outfits embraced by the sport, including snapshots of a young Jacqueline Onassis and Swedish tennis heartthrob Björn Borg. The $55 tome is due out in March as a part of the publishing company's new sports series, which also features style-oriented coffee table books about golf and yachting. 'From Wimbledon to other prestigious venues around the globe, tennis courts are a place to see and be seen - and admire the skill of the players, of course! Crisp, sporty tennis outfits by the likes of Lacoste and Fred Perry epitomize a relaxed yet active life,’ reads the book’s description. It's true that tennis's most notable contribution to fashion has to be the iconic polo shirt, which was invented in 1933 by French tennis champion René Lacoste.

Mr. Lacoste designed the short-sleeved shirt to give players the freedom of movement, adding a small green emblem inspired by his nickname, 'The Crocodile'. Nearly two decades later, English tennis champ Fred Perry debuted his own line of polos that featured a logo based on the original symbol for Wimbledon. And in recent years, a number of players have followed in Mr Lacoste and Mr Perry's footsteps by teaming up with big brands to launch their own sporty collections.

"Labour MPs have been told to stop talking about the ‘North-South’ divide in a drive to win back support. An internal party review warned that Labour’s traditional focus on the northern working classes has alienated crucial swing voters in the South. In an apparent change of tactics, the party will look to target the man ‘on the 6.54 from Basingstoke’, whose allegiance might be swayed as he struggles to make ends meet in the economic downturn. The review of the party’s performance . was overseen by former Cabinet minister John Denham and Labour general . secretary Iain McNicol. Mr Denham said Labour would be making a . ‘very explicit appeal’ to the type of southern voter who helped Tony . Blair secure his landslide victories. A North/South divide drawn by . researchers at Sheffield University, stretching from the Severn to the . Humber and based on factors such as political leanings, life expectancy . and educational prospects, showed Labour had just ten MPs in the South . outside London after the 2010 general election, but had 210 above the . line in the North and Scotland. Meanwhile, Mr Denham’s report notes . that the figure is the same as in 1992 and much lower than in 1997, when . New Labour secured around 30 seats. Mr Denham suggested that next year, Ed . Miliband’s speeches would put greater emphasis on the struggles faced . by southerners, many of whom are locked out of the property market and . face a major squeeze on living standards. Speaking about the North-South divide, . he said: ‘If you think  about it, the message is that everybody in the . southern part is doing okay. Vision: Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured launching his 'One Nation' initiative back in September. A review under the One Nation scheme found that southern voters are being alienated by Labour . ‘If you use that language, it sounds . as though you represent the northern bit. A classic mistake for the . party for a long time was using that sort of language, and then . wondering why people in the South didn’t think we were talking about . them.’ ‘If someone in the Labour Party talks . about rail fares, a southern voter may not automatically think they were . talking about them, on the 6.54 from Basingstoke. ‘You have to make the point that you are talking about the 6.54 from Basingstoke. ‘There are towns around London where . the average wage may be above the national average, but because the . costs of housing and transport are so high, the living standards are . below the national average. Divide: Former cabinet minister John Denham, left, has said that Labour MPs have been told to avoid alienating southern voters when making speeches. Former The Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie stoked fierce north-south debate earlier this month when he called for a political party to represent the interests of the south . ‘Part of what we are doing is making sure we are clearly rooting what we say with the lives of people in the South.’ Labour’s ‘Basingstoke man’ is  the latest attempt to target swing voters. ‘Essex man’ was the term coined to . explain the popularity of Margaret Thatcher, and came to epitomise . aspirational Tory-voters, many of whom had working-class roots but had . sought a better life in the Home Counties. Fresh appeal: Labour wants to concentrate its efforts to win back the southern vote. John Denham MP says that the party must appeal to the 'man on the 6.54am from Basingstoke' Northern: Ed Miliband's constituency of Doncaster North, South Yorkshire, is above the line which splits the UK in terms of Labour support . In 1996, Tony Blair targeted the same . type of middle-income voter, this time incarnated as ‘Mondeo man’, and . in 2001, the Tories identified them as ‘pebble-dash people’ – . professional married couples aged 35 to 50, living in pebble-dash homes, . typical of the suburbs. It comes as Mr Miliband this week pledged to unveil a string of new policies to woo middle Britain. In his New Year’s message he said he . had learned ‘hard truths’ about what Labour ‘got wrong’ on issues such . as immigration in the past, and promised to focus on rebuilding the . economy and helping  struggling families. But he will face a battle . after a survey showed Labour MPs remain firmly opposed to curbs on . immigration and  red tape. The new Ipsos/Mori revealed some 49 . per cent of Labour MPs said placing any restriction on immigration would . harm the competitiveness of Britain’s economy. By contrast, 82 per cent of Conservative MPs said that immigration restrictions would not harm the economy. The survey also found Labour MPs are . deeply opposed to slashing red tape, which is cited as a major problem . stalling the growth of small business.","Party MPs told to avoid discussing a 'north/south' divide in speeches .

"She's the Siberian-born beauty who has been turning heads since she burst onto the tennis scene in 2004 and won Wimbledon aged 17. Now Maria Sharapova, 27, has opened up about her passion for tennis - and her desire for a simpler life - in an interview with The Edit, Net-a-Porter's e-zine. Sharapova, who has appeared in campaigns for Tag Heuer and Cole Haan among others in the past, also shows off her glamorous side, smouldering for the camera in an accompanying photo shoot. Looking good: Maria Sharapova strikes a pose during a glossy shoot for Net-a-Porter e-zine, The Edit . Looking good: Sharapova showed off her stylish side during the sports-luxe themed shoot . But despite her striking looks and unparalleled ability to look good in a dress, Sharapova says that what she most wants is a simple life at her beachside home in California. 'I live a simple life by the beach where people don’t bother me much,' she explains. 'People seem to respect athletes that way.' One group of people who don't are the paparazzi, who thanks to interest in her relationship with fellow tennis pro Grigor Dimitrov, 23, seem to be able to find the couple anywhere. 'I think, ""Oh my goodness. How did they find us?"" We’re in the middle of nowhere, just sand and ocean, and all of a sudden a boat shows up. 'When we’re at home and away from the sport, we’re just two normal people who try to go about our life in a casual way, so [the media attention] is funny.' But not even media attention can stop Sharapova from throwing herself into her real passion - tennis - and she says she has her parents to thank for her success. 'The thing my parents taught me was that they were completely fine with going back to Russia, to the life we had before,' she reveals. 'The biggest gift they gave me was a sense of reality. They saw that I had potential, and they knew that there were sacrifices we had to make. But they never imagined how far we could go.' While Sharapova has lived in the US since the age of seven and currently resides in California, she says she remains a Russian at heart and adores her home country. 'The way that I speak and think is very Russian,' she confesses. 'I’m accustomed to [the US] but ultimately, it’s just the feeling you have inside.' Real world: Sharapova says her parents have helped her stay focused although she's not keen on the paps . She also says she remains passionate about seeing the world, despite spending more than a decade on the gruelling tennis tournament treadmill. 'I think of the 80/20 balance for my body and mind,' she insists. 'Disciplined 80 percent of the time, relaxed for 20.' It's a lesson that many of those left bruised by her 90mph serves and powerful approach will want to learn for themselves.

"In demand: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown declared income worth £1.37million last year, but used all of it to run his private office or donate to charity . MPs earned an extra £7million from jobs, speeches and directorships last year, new figures show. Almost half of MPs declared earning money from outside the Commons, including 20 who received more than the MPs’ standard salary of £65,738. Former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown was the most in demand, earning £1.4million from giving speeches and advice to organisations around the world. Mr Brown insists he does not receive the income himself  but ‘all the money goes directly to charity or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife’ Sarah. Analysis by The Guardian revealed 17 MPs declared income of more than £100,000 for the 2012-13 parliamentary year. They include Tory barristers Stephen Phillips (£740,000) and Geoffrey Cox (£417,000) and ex-Labour Cabinet ministers Alistair Darling (£263,000) and Jack Straw (£183,000). Rules forcing MPs to declare their outside work – and the time they spent earning it – were introduced after the expenses scandal. It meant any politician receiving extra income had to spell out the income and time they devote to second jobs. The latest revelations have raised fresh questions about the amount of time MPs can dedicate to their constituents and their duties in the House of Commons if they are in demand in high-paid, demanding second jobs. Mr Brown, who stood down as Prime Minister three years ago, declared income of £1.37million, The Guardian said. But a spokesman said: ‘Mr Brown personally does not receive a penny from speeches or writings. He has thus no 'second income' and does not benefit from 'outside earnings'. ‘All the fees from speeches and writings are not paid to him and all the money goes directly to charity or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife. ‘Mr Brown's only income is his salary as an MP, because he has also renounced the pension conventionally paid to all former Prime Ministers.’ Mr Phillips, Tory MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, spent 1,700 hours working as a barrister, earning £740,000. He told The Guardian: ‘What matters is whether or not I do my job as an MP and how well I do it. ‘People can check that from my attendance and other ﬁgures, which I believe demonstrate that I am one of the hardest workers at Westminster.’ Earnings: Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling declared outside income of £263,000 while Tory MP Geoffrey Cox earned £417,000 as a barrister . Transparency campaigners Unlock Democracy said MPs should focus on the their constituency not outside jobs. Deputy . director Alexandra Runswick said: ‘There are good reasons for MPs being . allowed to continue to do other work; there is tremendous value in . having a GP continue to keep a hand in their medical practice and thus . continue their expertise, for example. Some . 295 of the 650 MPs declared some form of income, and 20 made more money . outside Parliament than their MP's salary of £65,738. The total declared by Conservative MPs came to £4.3 million and by Labour MPs £2.4 million. The MPs to declare the most income included: . Gordon Brown (Lab) £1.37million . Stephen Phillips (Con) £740,000 . Geoffrey Cox (Con) £417,000 . Nicholas Soames (Con) £305,000 . Sir Malcolm Rifkind (Con) £276,000 . Alistair Darling (Lab) £263,000 . John Redwood (Con) £238,000 . Jack Straw (Lab) £183,000. ‘However . their priority should remain representing their constituents. I doubt . the majority of MPs can even imagine doing their jobs representing their . constituents while raking in hundreds of thousands of pounds. She . suggested expenses could be curbed for those earning large sums away . from Parliament. ‘At the very least the taxpayer should not be expected . to subsidise them as well,’ she said. ‘The . fundamental problem is our political culture, and that cannot change . while we have a system in which MPs can have extremely safe seats . without having to worry about being held to account by their . constituents.’ Jonathan Isaby, political director of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There is nothing wrong in principle . with Members of Parliament having outside sources of income, so long as . their constituents feel they are getting value for money. ‘However, any other jobs they do should not distract them from their primary focus of serving their communities as MPs, and I daresay the constituents of those with the highest outside earnings will be taking a closer look at how regularly their MP has been contributing to debates, asking parliamentary questions and doing work in the constituency. ‘If voters think they have been badly represented, they clearly have the option of voting for someone else come the next election. ‘It is right that MPs have to declare any other earnings in the Register of Interests, but they shouldn’t be stopped from doing other work: the last thing taxpayers want is a House of Commons jam-packed with career politicians completely insulated from the real the world outside Westminster or their own constituency.’","295 out of 650 MPs have extra income from outside Parliament last year .

"More premature babies born when their mothers are just 24 weeks pregnant are surviving - but babies delivered earlier rarely live, say British researchers. A new study found no improvement in the proportion of babies born 22-25 weeks who experience serious health problems into childhood. The figures suggest that while rising numbers of babies born very early are being helped to survive, the number of children and adults with long-term disability as a result will also increase. More premature babies born when their mothers are just 24 weeks pregnant are surviving - but babies delivered earlier rarely live . New research funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) appears to find a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - the current legal limit for abortion. Two studies, led by University College London and Queen Mary, University of London, compared a group of babies born between 22-26 weeks’ gestation in 2006 with those born between 22-25 weeks over a 10-month period in 1995. The normal length of pregnancy is 40 weeks. Some anti-abortion campaigners have argued that medical advances which increase the chances of very premature babies surviving bolster their demands for a cut in the time limit. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, speaking in a personal capacity, backs a reduction in the time limit from 24 to 12 weeks, while Maria Miller, the culture secretary and minister for women, wants a 20-week limit to ‘reflect the way medical science has moved on.’ However, the latest study in the British Medical Journal found significant survival improvements only among babies born at 24, 25 and 26 weeks. It found the number of babies born at 22-25 weeks and admitted to intensive care increased by 44 per cent over the 11-year period of the study. The research appears to find a cut-off point in terms of chances of survival at 24 weeks - the current legal limit for abortion . Overall survival increased by 13 per cent - from 40 to 53 per cent - but there was no significant increase in survival of babies born before 24 weeks. Altogether 11 per cent more babies . survived to the age of three without disability, but the proportion of . survivors born between 22 and 25 weeks with severe disability was about . the same at one in five. Babies born before 27 weeks face a . battle for survival and many go on to live with long-term health . problems such as lung conditions, learning difficulties and cerebral . palsy. The rates of premature birth are on the rise in many European countries and are high in the UK, for reasons including a higher proportion of older mothers. Doctors have also changed the way they treat premature babies, such as keeping them warmer and using steroids to boost lung development. Study author Professor Kate Costeloe, from Queen Mary, University of London and Homerton University Hospital, said the number of babies surviving before 24 weeks was ‘small to vanishingly small’. She told The Times: 'In 2006 if you were alive at the end of the first week you would have no greater chance of going home than you would if you'd been alive at the end of the first week in 1995.' Professor Neil Marlow, an MRC-funded researcher from the UCL Institute for Women’s Health and an author of both studies, said ethical guidelines in the UK on the care of very premature infants did not suggest providing active care for babies born at 22 weeks six days and earlier. On rare occasions babies born this early survived, he said, but it could be unclear exactly what the length of gestation was. Very premature babies born around 24 weeks go to neonatal intensive care units, although their parents often opt for withdrawal of care at some point when the medical outlook for the child worsens. He added:’Our findings show that more babies now survive being born too soon than ever before, which is testament to the highly-skilled and dedicated staff in our neonatal services. ‘But as the number of children that survive pre-term birth continues to rise, so will the number who experience disability throughout their lives. ‘This is likely to have an impact on the demand for health, education and social care services.’ Jane Brewin, Chief Executive of Tommy’s charity, said ‘Although it is good to see that survival rates of babies born at 22-25 weeks are increasing, this study highlights that we are still faced with the huge challenge of reducing the long term health problems that these extremely premature babies face - and so to really tackle this, we now need to focus on finding out why preterm birth happens. ‘That’s why Tommy’s goal is to develop effective screening tests and treatments so we can prevent premature birth from happening in the first place.’","Rising numbers of babies born very early are surviving thanks to medical advances .

The Israeli military said the soldiers were disciplined for 'unbecoming behaviour' after the pictures were posted online . The women posed in their underwear and combat fatigues in the images that were posted on Facebook . The statement did not identify the soldiers or give any details about the punishments. Military officials said the base conducted educational lectures to keep soldiers from repeating the offence. Several times in recent years, the Israeli military has disciplined soldiers for what were considered improper postings in social media sites. Last year, the social media chief for the Israel Defence Force was branded 'racist' after posting a picture on Facebook of his face covered in mud alongside the caption 'Obama style'. Lt. Sacha Dratwa faced a barrage of abuse for the picture, which appeared to show him swimming in the Dead Sea, and denied he was racist. A male Israeli soldier was also condemned after being filmed dancing suggestively around a blindfolded Palestinian woman in a video posted to YouTube in 2010. In 2010, this Israeli soldier was disciplined after posting a picture of her with a blindfolded man online . That incident followed the discovery of photos earlier that year showing a female soldier posing in front of Palestinian prisoners. The Israeli military banned soldiers from using social media sites while on base after the photographs came to light. The ban was an effort to prevent future embarrassing posts on social media. It remains unclear whether the ban is in effect. Early this year, another soldier was reprimanded for writing anti-Palestinian tweets and posting pictures to multiple social media services showing himself naked with a gun. Most Jewish Israeli men and women are required to serve in the military, starting at age 18.","Group of women are said to be new recruits based in southern Israel .

"At 72 ounces, the steak is big enough to feed nine people. Then there are portions of bread, soup, salad, baked potato and ice cream – plus servings of tomato juice and milk. Combine that with five decades of failure by countless customers who have tried to stomach this colossal spread in under an hour - and the Wedgwood Broiler challenge seems unconquerable. That was until Randy Santel showed up to restaurant in Seattle, Washington – and guzzled the estimated 5,000-calorie gut-busting banquet with 18 minutes still on the clock. Meat head: Randy Santel poses with the 72-steak and vast array of side dishes before gobbling it all down . Gut-busting: The enormous steak, served at the Wedgwood Broiler in Seattle, was complemented by a bread roll, soup, salad, baked potato and servings of milk and tomato juice. It took Mr Santel 42 minutes to finish it . As well as earning a place in American food folklore, the 6ft 5in-tall bodybuilder, who weighs 230lb, got the $75 back that he had paid for the platter. Kitchen manager Mike Hamman was stunned when he witnessed the meal being devoured by this hulk of a man, who chewed in rhythm to Dixie Chicks tracks on his Hannah Montana MP3 player. He was even more shocked when Mr Santel, 25, ordered an extra glass of soda and also added four tall glasses of lemonade. Even more astoundingly, he polished off a beer that an astonished customer offered to buy him after completing the challenge in 41 minutes and 46 seconds. ‘We have no documentation of anybody ever finishing this,’ Mr Hamman told Seattle Post Intelligencer newspaper. ‘I was in awe just after he finished the steak. Most people can’t even get to the sides.’ The restautant does not reveal nutrition values for the challenge. But it is estimated to contain at least 5,000 calories and 22g of fat - more than double the daily allowance. Mr . Santel, from Kansas City, Missouri, said he hoped to eat the steak . faster ‘but it was cooked almost between medium-well and well, which . made it a lot harder to chew.’ Grease: Within a day of eating the steak, Mr Santel had devoured this 6lb burger with buns made from grilled cheese sandwiches as the Loose Wheel in Tacoma, Washington . ll in a day's work: Hours before he had also eaten this 2ft-long Big Dawg hotdog at Wing Central in Seattle . Appetiser: Shortly before, he also downed this three-litre bowl of ramen soup at Kobe Sushi Bar Restaurant . But Mr Santel, a former Missouri State University football player who suffered obesity problems as a child, did have one trick up his sleeve. He had already completed more than 100 challenges across the U.S – in a bizarre bid to show the world how to ‘eat fat but remain fit’. Mr Santel follows a new competitive eating mania, which has in part been sparked by TV show Man V Food. But Mr Santel goes to lengths to point out that Adam Richman, the host of that programme, has only scored 37 ‘wins’. Since he embarked on his competitive eating adventure two years ago, he has eaten everything from heaps of hotdogs, a 6lb burrito and a 28in pizza. He had also knocked off an 84oz steak challenge in New York – but that didn’t include so many additional items. Steaking a claim: The Wedgwood Broiler in Seattle, where Mr Santel ate a 72oz sirloin . Challenge: Mt Santel's website. His bizzarre mission is to show the world how to 'eat fat and stay fit' Mr Santel, who has his own website and posts videos on Facebook of some of the challenges, had already polished off three challenges in the 24 hours before arriving at the Wedgwood. He guzzled down fries and a 6lb bacon burger with grilled cheese sandwiches for a bun at Seattle’s The Loose Wheel Sports Bar and Grill. After that was he ate a 1lb doughnut in Auburn before swallowing a 2ft-long chili-cheese hot dog with jalepenos, onions and a side of yet more fries. And just a few hours before the steak challenge, he gulped down  a three-litre bowl of ramen noodle soup at Kobe Sushi Bar and Restaurant in Bellevue. Mr Santel says the only thing holding him back from doing more challenges is his girlfriend. ‘It sucks I'm not single,’ he told the Seattle Weekly who has so far competed in 15 states. ‘Not I want to break up with my girlfriend or whatever, but I'd like to move out west.’ The highest concentration of eating challenges is in California .","Randy Santel devoured the 5,000-calorie gut-busting banquet in 42 minutes .

"A global vaccine to prevent the leading cause of food poisoning and diarrhoea is one step closer, scientists claim . A global vaccine to prevent the leading cause of diarrhoea and food poisoning is one step closer, researchers claim. Scientists have managed to colllect detailed information about the E.coli bacteria, which causes millions of cases of diarrhoea a year. They found that strains of the E.coli cluster into surprisingly closely-related groups. This means the bacteria causing disease in South America are very similar to those in Africa and Asia. Similarities between the strains of bacteria mean a global vaccine is possible, experts said. E.coli causes 400,000 deaths and 400 million cases of diarrhoea each year in low and middle-income countries, as well as misery to many travellers across the affected regions. The study, which was the largest ever into this potentially-lethal bacteria, was based on data from 362 different strains of E.coli which span 30 years and 20 countries. By comparing the way strains attach to human stomach lining, researchers from Cardiff University and the University of Gothenburg found that strains clustered into closely-related groups. The close relationship between samples suggests a vaccine could be effective worldwide. Professor Gordon Dougan, senior author from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: 'This research strengthens our belief that it is possible to target a broad range of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (Etec) groups with one vaccine. Etec is a strain of E.coli that is the leading cause of diarrhoea in the developing world. Lead author Astrid von Mentzer, from the University of Gothenburg and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute called the data gathered 'exceptional'. Researchers from around the world will be able to use it to find out about the ability of each strain of E.coli to cause disease, and what they have in common, she said. Escherichia coli (usually referred to as E. coli) are bacteria found in the digestive system of humans and many other animals. Many strains are harmless and may play a useful role in the gut, helping us to stay healthy. However, certain strains produce a toxin. Strains that produce the toxin can cause mild to bloody diarrhoea, stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting. Occasionally the infection is so severe that patients develop haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which is associated with kidney failure, anaemia, and bleeding. It can take three to four days  for symptoms to develop. They can last for up to two weeks or longer in cases where there are no other complications. Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk. She added: 'All of this research helps us to identify the shared weaknesses in Etec bacteria that we can exploit with vaccines.' Dr Thomas Connor, a co-author of the study, from Cardiff University, added that whole genome sequencing – a process in which the complete DNA of an organism's genes is established – has allowed them to understand what makes an Etec bacteria. The challenge now, he said, 'is to distil, from the vast wealth of data locked up in this dataset, the information needed to develop these new treatments to fight this key pathogen.' While Etec was previously thought to vary widely across the world, this study traces many of the 21 different strains back their origins. It was found that they can be traced back to an individual bacterium that was able to infect humans and spread, due to global travel. According to this data, the emergence of these strains of E.coli probably took place between 51 and 170 years ago, a finding that suggests that they stable and unlikely to become quickly resistant to vaccines. 'Our work to develop a vaccine has received a real boost from this research,' says Dr Åsa Sjöling, an author from the University of Gothenburg and Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. 'This data gives us confidence that a global, future-proof solution is within our grasp.'

"A former social services chief claims he was ignored when he raised concerns about a paedophile network in the 1990s with Department of Health officials. David Tombs says he was told by senior civil servants he was wasting his time because there were ‘too many of them [paedophiles] over there [in Parliament and Whitehall]’. Mr Tombs, 80, former Herefordshire and Worcestershire social services head, said he tried to raise the alarm with the government following a major sex abuse scandal. David Tombs - a former Herefordshire and Worcestershire social services head - says he was told by senior civil servants he was wasting his time because there were ‘too many of them [paedophiles] over there [in Parliament and Whitehall]’ His child protection team compiled a secret report in 1993, following a 12-month investigation into disgraced former child care consultant Peter Righton, who was arrested after child pornography was found at his home. Mr Tombs's child protection team compiled a secret report in 1993, following a 12-month investigation into disgraced former child care consultant Peter Righton (pictured above), who was arrested after child pornography was found at his home . The arrest of Righton, a founder member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, unearthed suspicions of a child sex ring operating at the heart of the residential care system. Mr Tombs told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday: ‘I was told I was probably wasting my time, that there were – and the words used were along these lines – “too many of them over there”. ‘Now, I was talking about paedophilia, I was in the Department of Health and the “over there” to me indicated – although the words weren’t used – was in Parliament or was in government and Whitehall. 'I went to the department because I was concerned some of the names that came from the police investigation related to people in my own authority and it seemed to me there was a serious issue which would have been of national concern. ‘It was coming across to me that there were names there linked into the establishment if you like and I had no particular names, but that was the impression I was getting, and I felt the government needed to be alert to it.’ But Tim Yeo, the Minister responsible for social services at the time, dismissed the suggestions. He told Today: ‘I think it’s incredible. 'There was no culture of child sex abuse that I was aware of either in Whitehall or in Parliament.’","David Tombs says he was told by senior civil servants he was wasting his time because there were ‘too many of them [paedophiles] over there [in Parliament and Whitehall]’

"A family has been left unable to cook or clean after their £10,000 kitchen installation was scrapped by Tesco on the day it should have been delivered. Samantha and Gary Williams said they paid a deposit and a workman from Tesco visited to help the family plan their dream kitchen, before telling them it would be ready yesterday. But as Mrs Williams waited for the kitchen yesterday, she received a call telling her it was no longer going to be delivered. The family are just one of 1,000 paying Tesco customers to be left in the dark as the company is locked in 'discussions' with its contractor regarding the future of its kitchen and bathroom service. Pictured is Gary and Samantha Williams (left and right) with their son Reece. The family have been left without a kitchen after Tesco cancelled their delivery on the day it was to be fitted . The current state of the Williams family's kitchen which they had prepared for replacement . They now have to go to the homes of family or friends in order to cook a meal . Tesco has yet to provide any clarification on when, or if, their kitchen will be fitted . She claims Tesco told her the company they work with, kitchen and bathroom-fitting business Mark Two, have 'pulled their contract'. The couple, who live with son Reece, 16, and nephew James, 30, even ripped out their previous kitchen to save workmen a job - so have been left with a derelict kitchen until the situation is resolved. Mrs Williams, an underwriting team manager, said: 'We were all set to go yesterday but then we got a call to say 'we've got some bad news'. 'We are a family of four. What are we supposed to do? I can't cook, I can't clean, I can't do washing. They haven't got an answer for me so I'm lost as they've left us in limbo. 'We're having to visit family and friends for meals, and go to a launderette to do our washing. We can't eat here because there's nowhere to wash up. It's a health hazard.' Tesco, which works with Mark Two to offer its kitchen service, has confirmed it is 'in discussions' regarding its kitchen service. But it is yet to provide any answers  as to when the Williams' bespoke kitchen may be fitted. She said: 'Apparently it's Mark Two that have messed up because they have pulled their contract with Tesco due to their recent profit losses. A skip at the family's home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, contains the remains of their old kitchen . Wiring is loose from the wall where the Williams' removed their old kitchen in preparation for the new install . Tesco sales this year have fallen at the fastest rate in the grocery industry. Last month it was revealed Britain's biggest grocer's like-for-like sales fell more than 3.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months. This announcement came after former CEO Philip Clarke had announced his exit in June amid tumbling sales and profits. Things worsened for the grocer two months ago when four executives at Tesco were suspended after the supermarket giant admitted it overstated its profits guidance by £250million - shares dived to their lowest level in 11 years. On October 30,  the Serious Fraud Office started a full investigation into the company in the wake of the accounting scandal. In total, eight senior executives lost their positions as the full scale of the scandal unfolded. 'When I have spoken to Tesco, they don't have a clue what's going on, but they've pulled the rug under our feet. 'Mark Two said the kitchen would be delivered on Monday but then said it wouldn't. 'I have paid a deposit and if I need to organise another kitchen I can't do so until I get that back. If we have to start looking again, we won't get it fitted before Christmas.' They are just one of a number of people whose kitchen plans have been thrown into disarray following news the company's contract with Mark Two is under review. A Facebook page, titled 'Tesco Kitchens/Mark Two a travesty', has been created with dozens of customers registering complaints. Several state Tesco has refunded their deposit, while others remain unaware of what is happening with their plans. The Williams said they spent weeks planning their dream kitchen and worked with a personal co-ordinator to achieve their chosen design. Mrs Williams said: 'We bought our house seven years ago and have only just been able to spend money doing it up.' 'We were looking for a kitchen and a design guy from Tesco came to design and plan it. Fortunately the replacement didn't extend to the washer and drier, which remain in place . The sink and a chest of drawers holding it up are all that remains in what used to be the family's kitchen . The old kitchen, including the tiling, was taken to a skip as they thought their upgrade was being delivered yesterday . 'He was with us for three hours and he was lovely. He planned it all and gave us a quote and then we just had to make a few tweaks before they said it would be ready on Monday. 'I feel stupid because I have recommended them to a colleague and I've had to go back and tell her what's happened to us, in case they have the same problem.' In a statement, Tesco said there were 1,000 customers affected. 'We are currently in discussions with Mark Two, the company which runs our kitchen and bathroom-fitting business, about how we work with them in the future. 'We are committed to ensuring we do the right thing for our customers and will be contacting them to discuss the options available to them.' A spokesperson for Mark Two did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment yesterday.","Family left without kitchen after it was scrapped just hours before fitting .

"Dr Bessam Farjo, who pioneered the world's first facial hair transplant in 1996 . The number of men opting for a 'beard transplant' has rocketed in the past year, according to experts. Pogonophobia (the fear of beards) may be rife at the BBC, but statistics revealed today show that more and more men in the UK want a beard, just like Jeremy Paxman. Having pioneered the world’s first facial hair transplant in 1996, Dr Bessam Farjo, founder of The Farjo Hair Institute, has seen a six-fold year on year increase in the amount of men having surgery to boost their facial follicles over the last five years. He said: 'A full beard is very much a statement look, and it goes in and out of fashion. For the last 12 to 18 months, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of men coming to my practice wanting to fill in bald patches or thicken wisps of hair. 'Whilst many men may be looking for full fop of facial fuzz, the majority of patients seeking facial hair transplantation do so to fill gaps and create ‘designer stubble’, he said. Dr Farjo added: 'The majority of men are looking to create a designer stubble look which seems incredibly popular nowadays. 'That being said, all it takes is for . one recognised face to show off a new look for men to start considering . their own facial hair. Gary Barlow 24 per centDavid Beckham 20 per centGeorge Clooney 13 per centBrad Pitt 11 per centJeremy Paxman 10 per centTom Selleck 8 per centEwan McGregor 6 per centAshton Kutcher 4 per centZach Galifianakis 3 per centRichard Branson 1 per cent . 'Paxman has become this summer’s talking point and it will be interesting to see whether his rugged new look sparks a trend among older men, in particular. 'Brad Pitt’s beard is often cited by men in their 40s, and David Beckham’s by men in their 20s and 30s. Perhaps we’ll see ‘The Paxman’ become the next hot look for men in their 50s and 60s!' Hair transplant procedures are the most popular form of cosmetic surgery for men in the UK. Over 4,500 procedures were carried out last year, 13 per cent more than those performed the previous year. This is over 300 per cent more than the 1,043 rhinoplasties undergone by men in the UK during the same year. 'Men are really starting to take . advantage of the options available to them when it comes to cosmetic . procedures,' said Dr Farjo. 'Adding or changing a beard is an easy way for a man to update and change his look, just as a woman would with her hairstyle.' Facial . hair transplants follow the same procedure as traditional hair . transplants, more commonly associated with treating male pattern . baldness. Dr Farjo says that while many men may be looking for full fop of facial fuzz, the majority of patients seeking facial hair transplantation do so to fill gaps and create 'designer stubble' Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, pictured, became this summer's talking point among men looking to grow a beard . Dr Farjo performed the world’s first full beard reconstruction by hair transplantation in 1996 on a severe burns victim. Donor hair is harvested from the back of the head via follicular unit extraction (FUE) - where individual hairs are taken and implanted - or follicular unit strip harvesting - where a strip of hair follicles are taken all at once and then microscopically separated.","Dr Bessam Farjo pioneered world's first facial hair transplant in 1996 - he says more men want to fill in bald patches .

"A wealth of artwork owned by the late Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon fetched more than $158.7 million at auction on Monday night, with some pieces quadrupling pre-sale estimates. In total 43 post-war and contemporary paintings by artists including Pablo Picasso, Georges Seurat and Edward Hopper, went under the hammer at Sotheby's New York, attracting bidders from around the world. The star lot items proved to be two paintings by American abstract impressionist Mark Rothko, which made a combined $76.4 million. Star lot: Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange), from 1955 and owned by the late Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, sold for $36.5 million in the Sotheby's sale on Monday night . Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange), from 1955, sold for $36.5 million, just over its pre-sale estimate high of $30 million. Meanwhile, Untitled - a dark blue expanse created 15 years later - brought in just under $40 million, almost double its top pre-sale estimate. At least two wall hangings brought in nearly quadruple their pre-auction estimates. Bouquet de Fleurs by the French impressionist painter Eva Gonzalez sold for $1.56 million and Le Saladier by the Russian master Nicolas de Stael netted $2.04 million. 'Richest couple in America': Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon is pictured in 1987 with her husband Paul Mellon - himself an heir and successful banker. He passed away in 1999 and their estate will go to family and charities . Sought-after: Rothko's Untitled brought in just under $40 million, almost double its top pre-sale estimate . Going, going, gone: It was anticipated that the slice of Mellon's artwork would bring in a high of $121 million but eager collectors pushed that figure through the roof (above, the White Barn by Georgia O'Keeffe) Eight paintings by the late American painter Richard Diebenkorn sold for a combined $32.2 million. At the other end of the scale, one bidder picked up a 1901 beach scene by Pablo Picasso for $700,000 - roughly half its estimated value. 'The bidding was big, was broad, was frantic,' Sotheby's auctioneer Oliver Barker said shortly after  dropping the final hammer. 'We saw bidding from literally all over the world . . . We are absolutely delighted.' It was anticipated that the slice of Mellon's artwork would bring in a high of $121 million but eager collectors pushed that figure through the roof. Vast collection: Eight paintings by American painter Richard Diebenkorn - including this one - sold for a combined $32.2 million . Exceeding expectation: This oil on canvas titled Paysage Bord de Mere by Russian painter Nicolas de Staël smashed its pre-sale estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 with a final selling price of $425,000 . Other items from the Mellon collection, including jewelry and furnishings, will be offered in a series of sales November 20 to 23. The total could realize more than $100 million. Proceeds will benefit The Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, which supports The Oak Spring Garden Library in Upperville, Virginia. The library houses Mellon's collection of rare books, manuscripts and works of art related to landscape design, horticulture and natural history. Mellon, a noted horticulturist and widow of philanthropist Paul Mellon, died in March at age 103 at her Virginia estate following a 15-year battle with stomach cancer. Well-connected: Here Mellon is pictured with Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The two women became firm friends and Mellon, a self-taught horticulturist, designed the White House Rose Garden . Mellon's grandfather Jordan W. Lambert created Listerine, and her father, Gerald Lambert, built a company that made everything from Dentyne to Schick razors. Paul Mellon had his own fortune, inherited from his Pittsburgh industrialist father and built on holdings in banking, coal, railroads, steel and aluminum. Bunny Mellon was a self-taught botanist and close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In 1961 she redesigned the White House Rose Garden, and later she created another White House garden that was named for Kennedy after her death. The Mellons donated hundreds of important artworks to museums, including the National Gallery of Art, founded in 1937 by Paul Mellon's father, Andrew Mellon.","The Listerine heiress and horticulturist passed away  in March aged 103 after a 15-year battle with stomach cancer .

"From impersonating pets to naming pigs, some parts of the world have laws that may be considered barking mad by many people. An infographic shows the most unusual, including rules about letting common animals breed with royal pets in the UK, tattooing dogs in the US, and letting inappropriately attired cats roam outdoors in New Zealand. While dogs aren't allowed to attend the opera in Chicago, Illinois and pet lions can't go to the cinema in Baltimore, Maryland. Barking mad? An infographic shows the most unusual pet laws, including those in the UK. One says that it is against the law to let a common pet mate with an animal from the royal household, such as one of the Queen's corgis (illustrated) According to helpucover's graphic, in the UK, it is against the law to let a common pet mate with an animal from the royal household, such as one of the Queen's corgis. It's also illegal to carry rabid dogs in a taxi, and to incite a dog to bark in Lancashire. Owners of pigs in France are forbidden from calling them Napoleon, out of respect for the late military leader. When it comes to walkies, residents of Lorinc, Hungary, have to keep their cat on a lead, while dog owners in Turin are legally required to walk their pet three times a day. Pig ignorant?

In another animal welfare move, officials in Switzerland have decided that pets must have companions so they don’t get lonely, and owners must pass written and verbal tests to keep a dog. The US also have some bizarre animal laws, and some of them comment on human behaviour, more than the behaviour of the animals. For example, it's illegal to imitate an animal in Miami, Florida, while people in Oklahoma are forbidden from pulling faces at dogs. They face a fine or even prison if they are caught offending man's best friend. Humans aren't allowed to sleep in a dog kennel in Wallace, Idaho and can’t give whisky or a cigar to a dog in Illinois. Meanwhile, pets are expected to behave properly too. For instance, dogs in Little Rock, Arkansas are banned from barking after 6pm. Are legislators barking up the wrong tree? Dogs are denied an education and the chance of attending an opera in parts of the US, and humans are under fire too - it's illegal to impersonate a pet in Miami (pictured) Pet whistelblowers: If your pet bird is lost in Berkeley, California, a law says that owners can't whistle to attract it back before 7am out of respect for sleepy neighbours . In Connecticut, dogs with tattoos must be reported to the authorities - even if the marks are to make them more identifiable if they get lost. It's illegal to educate a dog in Hartford, Connecticut and in Oklahoma, they are forbidden from congregating in groups or three or more unless they have a signed permit form the mayor. In the town of Barner in North Carolina, cats and dogs are forbidden from fighting and if chaos ensures in Paulding County in Ohio, a police officer is allowed to bite a dog to calm it down.

"John McAfee has not been captured, despite a cryptic post on his own blog saying that he is in police custody. Belize national police confirmed to MailOnline on Sunday that the whereabouts of the multimillionaire software developer are still unknown. Additionally, authorities have issued no arrest warrant in the murder of McAfee's neighbor and fellow American Gregory Faull. Scroll Down for Video . Multi-millionaire software developer John McAfee appeared on CNN for an interview on Friday and his blog was updated claiming 'unconfirmed reports' he had been arrest on Saturday . McAfee, 67, is wanted for questioning as a 'person of interest' in the case and remains at large, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez said. McAfee's blog, whoismcafee.com, was updated on Saturday . afternoon with an 'unconfirmed report that John McAfee has been captured . at the border of Belize and Mexico.' 'That is not true. He is not in police custody,' Officer Martinez told MailOnline on Sunday morning. McAfee has frequently used the rambling blog to keep the world updated on his bizarre attempts to evade captured in the Central American nation, which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection. He has in the past claimed that there exists enough material to keep the blog going for a year and has also stated that should anything happen to him a man named Chad would be put in charge of posting information - and it seems that day has come. In Belize, a source at the U.S. Embassy speaking anonymously to reporters said that friends of McAfee denied he had been captured and that they and the police had no information on a possible arrest. Rumors that the software developer has been apprehended come directly after an interview with CNN, in which he claimed his life was in danger and that he had tired of life on the run. McAfee has been the subject of police interest since his neighbour, Gregory Faull, was discovered with a bullet in his head on November 11th. Homecoming: Anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee is on his way back to the U.S. after his arrest last week in Guatemala . In the brief talk with a CNN reporter, McAfee said, 'I will certainly not turn myself in, and I will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog.' Claiming that he will either be arrested or get away, clarifying 'Get away doesn't mean leave the country. It means they will, No.1, find the murderer of Mr. Faull and, No.2, the people of this country - who are by and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out.' McAfee and Faull repeatedly had run-ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in one interview with Wired claimed that the killers of Mr. Faull were looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbour. In fact, the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after another for McAfee, which began in May when his home was raided and police said they found multiple firearms and the 67-year-old living with a 17-year-old girl. The CNN report also noted that police in Belize have said they don't consider . McAfee a suspect in the killing; they say they only want him for questioning. And yesterday, the ecentric fugitive millionaire . software mogul, dropped the f-bomb on . live television Friday while explaining his dislike for local . politicians. ‘I . do not donate to any political party. When I was asked to donate, I . said, “Get the f*** off my property,”’ McAfee, 67, said during a . telephone interview with CNBC from ‘an undisclosed location.’ On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government . He then apologized to the cable network for his verbal slip-up, one of many recent gaffes. McAfee was in the midst . of recounting an incident earlier this month in which 42 armed Belizean . officers allegedly stormed his compound, arrested him and detained him . for 14 hours with no food or water, and then let him go without charges. When . CNBC reporter, Robert Frank, asked McAfee why he thought the police had . done that, he said it was because he ‘does not play by the rules.’ McAfee . said that he has donated millions of dollars to the local economy, . including police departments and homeless agencies, but not through the . Belizean government itself. ‘I . don’t do it by giving to the government and letting them dole it out . because if I give $5 million to the government, $10,000 goes to the . people and $4 million plus change goes into the pockets of the . politicians,’ he said. ‘I give directly to the people. And I have been . doing this all along.’ McAfee, . founder of the anti-virus software company that bears his last name, . said he has been hiding out in the jungles if Belize and wearing . disguises in public when he needs to purchase supplies. He would not say what the disguises look like because he has ‘a feeling’ he will be wearing them again soon, he said. John McAfee has been a follower of alternative therapies and philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his business . The . fugitive software mogul has been on the run from local police since . November 11, the day after his American neighbour, Greg Faull, a . 52-year-old contractor from Florida, was found shot in the head. Two . days before Faull's body was discovered, four of McAfee's dogs were . poisoned to death, making McAfee a 'person of interest,' Belize . authorities have said. McAfee . says he is innocent and that he will not turn himself in. He has said . on several occasions that he will be killed if he is taken into custody. He has also said the he was set up by the Belizean government and that . it all goes back to a bribe he didn't pay to a politician. But he is certainly not shying away from reporters while hiding out. Over the past three weeks . he has given multiple media appearances, including two interviews with . CNBC, an interview with The Daily Telegraph, an interview with ABC News, . and an interview with Wired Magazine. He also set up a blog, . where he details his jungle adventures, his ongoing claims of . government corruption, his thoughts about the highly addictive drug bath . salts, and his own personal investigation into Faull’s murder. A . few days after the news of his hiding made headlines, McAfee logged . onto the Internet to seek technical support on how phone tracking works, . Gizmodo reported. Not surprisingly, skeptics are disputing the validity of McAfee’s claims. The . fugitive software mogul told CNBC Friday that he is beginning to run . out of money and is having trouble getting cash from his bank in Belize. ‘My life has been up and down from a comfort standpoint,’ he told CNBC. Tropical: John McAfee, founder of the anti-virus software firm, moved to Belize in 2008 . Beach house: The home of anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee in San . Pedro . McAfee said he has no plans to leave the . Central American country bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south . and west by Guatemala, and to the east by the Caribbean Sea. ‘This is my home,’ he said. McAfee has not been formally charged with murder and is only wanted for questioning, according to Belize National Security Ministry spokesman Raphael Martinez. The country’s prime minister Dean Barrow has called McAfee ‘extremely paranoid, even bonkers.’ Exasperated: San Pedro's Mayor Daniel Guerrero says police want to question McAfee, who is not a suspect . McAfee, . who relocated to Belize in 2008 after losing an estimated $96 million . due to bad investments, founded his namesake software company in 1987, . initially running it out of his home in California.

"Survey reveals 43 per cent of women think erotic fiction makes their own sex lives seem routine and boring . Backs up Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James' theory that her books provide readers with a 'holiday from their husbands' Good read: Nearly half of women surveyed said erotic fiction was more exciting than their own sex lives (posed by model) Thanks to the discretion of e-readers and recently released books like the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, erotic fiction is soaring in popularity. Incredibly, the past-time has become so popular that nearly half of women would rather read an erotic book than have sex themselves, according to a new poll. A survey by online bingo site Dotty Bingo found 44 per cent of women preferred reading about the (often fictional) erotic adventures of others over taking part in their own sex lives. Of the 400 women polled – all aged between 25 and 50 -  43 per cent said books such as the Fifty Shades trilogy by EL James made their own love lives seem routine and boring. They cited ease, a lack of energy and lack of imagination in the bedroom as reasons why their sexual encounters paled in comparison to sex scenes they'd read. Nearly all of those . quizzed (91 per cent) said they had read at least one erotic book, with more . than two thirds (68 per cent) stating that they would like to do so more often. One respondent, who didn’t want to be . named, said: 'I'd much rather read about it then do it. It's always . exciting in a book and, unlike in real life, the hero never rolls off . when he’s finished and starts snoring without so much as a cuddle.' Bestseller: The Fifty Shades of Grey book gives readers a 'holiday from their husband' according to author EL James . A spokesperson from DottyBingo.com said the results came as a surprise. They said: 'Erotic reading has shot to . prominence recently and with the rise of the e-reader never before has . it been easier to covertly read a racy novel in public. 'Ease was the main reason cited for this . as you can, understandably, have a book on hand more often than your . partner. Others liked the imagination and variety the books offered.' One person who won't be surprised by the survey is English mother-of-two Erika Mitchell, 49, who has written the erotic Fifty Shades trilogy using the pen name EL James. The first book in the series has just become the fastest selling paperback of all time in the UK, out-selling Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code. She describes her books as 'romantic fantasy' stories, which offer women a 'holiday from their husbands' and has received letters from fans crediting her books with saving their marriages by spicing up their sex lives.","Survey reveals 43 per cent of women think erotic fiction makes their own sex lives seem routine and boring .

"Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal have taken to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table at his exclusive Fat Duck restaurant which will be opened for a limited time next year at Crown Melbourne. The England-based restaurant headed up Blumenthal is temporarily moving to Australia for six months with a menu that costs $525 per person, which feature the chef's signature dishes that infuse science with food. The British chef is known for his kooky creations which include lickable wallpaper a la Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and bacon and egg ice cream. Scroll down for video . Fans of celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal (pictured here outside Fat Duck in England) have taken to social media to express their devastation at missing out on a table at his exclusive Fat Duck restaurant in Melbourne . He aims to provide diners with a full sensory experience when they sit down at the table. Last month, Australians had the chance to put their name in an online ballot to win a table at his temporary Fat Duck restaurant and on Monday the results were in. A total of 89,179 people entered the ballot from all over the world, news.com.au reported. Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour. '#fatduckmelbourne ballots are out, sadly I did not get a reservation #sadduck. Guess Ill [sic] get $500 of #maccas [McDonald's] instead,' Julian Ridden tweeted. Julian Ridden was one of the unlucky few to have his ballot application knocked back . Meanwhile Diana Forward said she was 'so bummed' to miss out on a table . Those who were not lucky enough to get a place have expressed their bitter disappointment on Twitter but not without a sense of humour . Fat Duck will cost $525 per person for a tasting menu which will take four and a half hours to finish . 'Missed out in the ballot for a reservation at #fatduckmelbourne,' James Caldwell tweeted . Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables . While Roslyn Grundy said: 'But Heston, I thought we were buddies?' Some who were knocked back were trying to negotiate their way onto others' tables. Twitter user Candice offered up a friend as payment. 'Will trade @Dame_1978 for a table at the #fatduckmelbourne - No luck in the ballot & this looks too good to miss out,' she wrote. But della wilson was more conventional in her method of compensation. 'Willing to pay if anyone has a fat duck reservation for Melbourne #fatduckmelbourne #gutted #alreadybeentodinnerbyheston,' she said. While David Brim will get a chance to taste the delights the exclusive restaurant has to offer . With devastation came jubilation from those who had received an acceptance email. 'Woohoo- this email made my day! Thanks #fatduckmelbourne and #crownmelbourne #reservation #heston,' Abby Mm tweeted. And David Brim was equally happy: '@Heston_Live just got my golden ticket to the #fatduckmelbourne very excited...'. But it appears some are stuck in limbo and did not receive a response at all. 'hmm, @crownmelbourne say I must have given wrong email to not have a response by now. Seems weird 4 of my friends same,' Herbal said. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Crown Melbourne for comment. It is believed all emails notifying the lucky diners have now been sent. However unsuccessful applicants who have been placed on the waiting list, only at their request, may still have a chance if there are any cancellations. Earlier this year, Fat Duck was named the third best restaurant in the world in an annual poll run by private jet lifestyle magazine Elite Traveler and Champagne Laurent-Perrier. His London eatery, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal also placed 23rd in the top 100 eateries in the world list.","A ballot was run to secure a place at the Melbourne's Crown casino eatery .

"Water once flowed beneath the surface of Mars - and the warmer, wetter ancient planet could have been considerably more hospitable for life. Scans by spectrometers on board the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters have revealed 175 outcrops in Mars's Tyrrhena Terra mountains that are unmistakably 'weathered' by water. The rocks, found in craters, seem to have been 'carved' out from beneath the crust by asteroid impacts - and offer an insight into the planet's history, and what lies beneath the surface. The find proves water flowed beneath the surface of Mars for a 'long period', say the researchers. Scans by spectrometers on board the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters have revealed 175 outcrops in Mars's Tyrrhena Terra mountains that are unmistakably 'weathered' by water . The find of 175 outcrops with weathered minerals in a region of ancient highlands, Tyrrhena Terra, could reveal more about the planet's mysterious history . Today, atmospheric pressure is so low on Mars that surface water cannot exist on its surface. However, studies made by orbiting spacecraft and surface rovers show that Mars was once much warmer and wetter than it is today. The find of 175 outcrops with weathered . minerals in a region of ancient highlands, Tyrrhena Terra, could reveal . more about the planet's mysterious history. The spacecraft observations revealed hydrated silicate-bearing outcrops at 175 different sites in Tyrrhena Terra, almost all of which are associated with ecrater walls and rims, and central uplifts inside craters. Although the region is dissected by numerous valley networks, rocks altered by water are rarely visible between the craters in Tyrrhena Terra. This implies that the chemical weathering revealed by the craters was not associated with weathering by liquid water at the surface. ‘These minerals are associated with . fresh craters that happened after activity caused by water,’ said Damien Loizeau, . an ESA Research Fellow and lead author of the study. ‘They probably . represent ancient hydrated terrains that have been excavated by the . crater-forming impacts. These impacts have revealed the composition of . the Noachian crust, which was chemically weathered more than 3.7 billion . years ago.’Their preferred explanation is that the hydrated minerals were formed underground in the presence of ground water. The rocks, found in craters, seem to have been 'carved' out from beneath the crust by asteroid impacts - and offer an insight into the planet's history, and what lies beneath the surface. The buried hydrated silicate-bearing rocks were then exposed and exhumed by later impacts. These impacts transported the hydrated minerals mechanically, without significant mineralogical transformations. The presence of a few phyllosilicate-bearing outcrops on a few buttes in the region, far from visible craters, also reinforces the idea that the crust has been broadly altered, not only around craters. Phyllosilicates are hydrous minerals formed by interaction between rock and liquid water. This important group of minerals includes the micas, chlorite, serpentine, talc and clays - primary products of chemical weathering of rocks. The minerals form at different temperatures and seem to be located at different depths, consistent with temperatures of up to 300 degrees Celsius a few kilometres beneath the surface. The presence of hydrated silicates on larger craters of the smooth plains can be explained by excavation: the lava plain is thin enough for larger craters to excavate rocks underneath, from the buried Noachian unit. Hence, hydrated silicate-bearing craters in volcanic plains illustrate the variation in plain thickness and excavation by impacts of buried hydrated rocks. ‘The large range of crater sizes studied, from less than 1 km to 84 km wide, indicates that these hydrated silicates are were excavated from depths of tens of metres to kilometres,’ said Damien Loizeau. ‘The composition of the rocks is such that underground water must have been present there here for a long period of time in order to have altered their chemistry.’ ‘Water circulation occurred several kilometres deep in the crust some 3.7 billion years ago, before the majority of craters formed herein this region,’ said co-author Nicolas Mangold, from the Laboratoire de Planétologie et Géodynamique, Université de Nantes, France. ‘The water generated resulted in a wide range of chemical changes in the rocks that reflect low temperatures near the surface to high temperatures at depth, but without any a direct  relationship to the surface conditions at the that time.’ ‘The role of liquid water on Mars is of great importance for its habitability and this study using data from Mars Express describes a very large zone where groundwater was present for a long time,’ said Olivier Witasse, ESA's Mars Express project scientist.","Rocky outcrops excavated from deep beneath surface by asteroid impacts .

"Alan Pardew says he would welcome Andy Carroll back at Newcastle and hopes to see him one day return to his hometown club. The West Ham striker is in line to face the Magpies at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon having recovered from the ankle injury he suffered during a summer tour of New Zealand. It is approaching four years since Carroll sensationally moved from Newcastle to Liverpool in a £35million transfer. Andy Carroll (right) celebrates with Mauro Zarate after the latter scored against Everton last week . Carroll came through the ranks at Newcastle, before his £35 million move to Liverpool . The 25-year-old continues to be linked with a return to St James’ Park and, rather than kill such speculation, Pardew admits it could happen. ‘I think he would (want to come back one day), and I hope he does come back to his hometown,’ said the United boss, who also backed Carroll for an England recall. ‘He has got that love here. I really enjoyed working with Andy. I think he's a terrific player. I know we get linked with him every two weeks, which is always probably going to happen whether it's me or another manager. ‘So I'm not going to hide from the fact that I like him. I'm not sure that it's something that's imminent for us in this window, because he looks fairly happy to me at West Ham. ‘I think it's difficult to take players who are happy out of Premier League teams. It's financially difficult.’ Newcastle, of course, chose to cash in on their academy product when Liverpool laid down a record fee for a British player in January, 2011. Pardew, though, never felt the move to Anfield was right for the Geordie frontman. ‘I think the Liverpool thing, for me, was a strange one,’ he said. ‘Big Andy's style was against the way they play. Carroll struggled to make an impact at Liverpool, so went on loan to West Ham, before joining for £15 million . When Carroll returned to Newcastle, some fans held negative banners, but Alan Pardew would love him back . ‘He's much more suited to West Ham and I think he's been a big success there, I really do. Actually, if you speak to any West Ham fans, they'll tell you that. ‘The only problem is getting him on the pitch - that's been his biggest issue. If he can have a run, there's no problem with it. ‘He's not just a target man, he's a good footballer and a real presence of the pitch that can win games.’ Carroll missed the bulk of last season with an Achilles problem and has been plagued by injuries since leaving Tyneside. Pardew, however, feels there is no long-term issue. ‘I think Sam (Allardyce) was right in his assessment of Andy - he's sometimes too brave for his own good,’ he added. ‘He's going full-hearted for challenges when he's off-balance. He does that in training as well as in games, so, of course, when you're in a rehab situation he's over-zealous at times purely because he's got that good, football aggression. Carroll has struggled with injury in recent months, but is now back fit and in the West Ham first team . Carroll battles with James McCarthy and Leon Osman during a Premier League match last Saturday . ‘But I don't think there's anything structurally wrong with him - or a major issue. He's just that type. Duncan Ferguson used to get a lot of injuries. It comes with that role.’ Kevin Nolan, meanwhile, is another player taking on his former club on Saturday. The midfielder skippered the side under Pardew and the Newcastle manager admits that he is indebted to the Scouser. ‘Kevin was brilliant at this football club,’ he said. ‘We owe him a lot - all the players here - with the professionalism he brought and the winning mentality. ‘I would like more Kevin Nolan's in my group. ‘He's a very special sort of person in the changing room, and he brings that to whichever club he goes to, that winning mentality, and that's why he's had such a fantastic career.’","Andy Carroll is in line to face his former club Newcastle on Saturday .

"Motorists in Boston who have been 'stealing' parking spaces shoveled clear by other people have returned to find their cars with tyres slashed and paint scratched. Across parts of the city, there is a certain etiquette involved in finding a parking spot which has developed since the 1970s. Visitors to the city are often baffled when they return to find their car damaged or covered in abusive notes. According to the blog, Caught in Southie, which covers the Wild-West area of winter parking, residents of the area block off 'their' part of the street with a 'space saver'. Motorists who use parking spaces cleared by others in Boston face the prospect of their car being damaged . Some of the unofficial space savers can be quite amusing such as this polite warning against parking . Other space savers explicitly threaten the person's car if they decided to steal the parking spot . A space saver can be anything from a shovel, bucket, to an old sofa. According to the unofficial rules, someone has the right to save a parking space if they have shoveled out the snow. Their efforts grant them a 48-hour pass to hold the spot using their own space saver. Also according to the unofficial rules, the 'gentleman's' agreement is backed up with the threat of force. Anyone stealing another's parking space is likely to return to their car to find it with its tyres slashed or paint scratched. According to Caught in Southie: 'If you move someone’s space saver and park your car in its place, you have no right to complain about what happens to your car. However, you are allowed to retaliate as long as you don't get caught. If you get caught, you shouldn’t complain about the beating you will most likely receive.' City authorities claim that all space savers must be removed from the street 48 hours after the snow emergency has ended. People in Boston learn at an incredibly young age the need to protect your parking spot during winter . Some Boston residents try to appeal to the better nature of their neighbors by saying they are a nurse . Boston is probably the only city in the world where someone would use a lobster trap to mark a space . It is unlikely that the person who cleared this snow was mobility impaired as they would probably require the walking aides once they arrive at the other end of their journey, unless they had a third walking device . However, South Boston, more commonly known as Southie, has banned the use of space savers, although the policy is being widely ignored. Cambridge has also outlawed their use. During earlier snow emergencies one man shot out the tyres of a car that stole his spot with a nail gun. Stephen Fox, co-chairman of the South End Forum, told The Boston Globe: 'This is a criminal act of vandalism. This is not a quaint Boston custom gone awry. This is something that is intolerable in an urban environment, and it needs to be treated as a crime and not with a shoulder shrug. 'You always hear the same arguments for them. ""These people don’t bother to shovel out their spaces and then they come as interlopers and take my space I spent hours shoveling out."" But the question they don’t answer is: ""How did they get their car out in the first place?"" They had to shovel to get their car out to go from point A to point B. The entire thing defies logic.' Interesting question, but moving a space saver in Southie normally results in only one outcome . This person escaped lightly after their wing mirror was defaced with an abusive message . Under conventional wisdom, space savers are only supposed to be deployed AFTER the snow . Some territorial people from Boston have been known to guard their parking spot in person . Not exactly the type of board that is normally used during a snow storm, but it serves a purpose . This space is being marked out by the front bumper of a car, presumably a victim of the snow storm .","Residents have been urged to abandon the tradition of 'space savers'
Several people have been assaulted over Boston parking disputes .
Others have returned to find the tyres slashed or paint scratched .
Business leaders in Southie want the controversial practice banned .
But Boston people think if they cleared the snow they deserve the spot ."
"Weighing little more than a bag of sugar,  twins Matthew and James were born 17 weeks premature. Fitting in the palm of their mothers' hand, the tiny brothers faced an uphill battle to survive. At 26 hours old, James tragically lost his fight, leaving parents Natalie and Adrian O'Hara devastated. But their grief was compounded when doctors warned their surviving son, Matthew, had just a one in five chance of living. But today, after months of treatment, Matthew is home with his parents. Mrs O'Hara, 34, from Walton, Liverpool, said: 'It was a huge shock to see how small Matthew was when he was born - I could fit him on the palm of my hand. 'Miracle' baby boy Matthew O'Hara, pictured with his parents Adrian and Natalie, both 34, survived against the odds after he was born at 17 weeks premature with his twin brother James . When the twins were born they weighed little more than a bag of sugar and fitted into the palm of their mother's hand. Pictured, Matthew in an incubator at Alder Hey Children's Hospital where he was cared for after his birth . 'Changing his nappies was terrifying - he was so small I kept thinking I was going to break him. 'When James died we really feared the worst for Matthew - we never thought he was going to pull through. 'We were both very numb after losing James and Matthew looked so fragile from the moment he was born. 'Doctors were telling us different things on an hourly basis - his condition could change very quickly. 'He was put straight on a ventilator when he was born because he needed help with his breathing and his lungs needed to be stabilised. 'But hours and days ticked by and Matthew eventually started to grow. 'He's still very small but he's absolutely amazing - he's doing all of the things he should be at his age.' The twins were born at Liverpool Women's Hospital on February 15 this year - with Matthew weighing a tiny 1lb 5oz. His brother James was so underdeveloped he lost the fight for his life a day later. Matthew, who is now nine months old, could only breathe using a ventilator and a tube because his lungs were underdeveloped. He also struggled to get oxygen to his vital organs due to a crippling heart condition. But Matthew, who now weighs a much healthier 11lbs 5oz, was finally allowed to leave hospital for the first time after five months and a day, of intense care. After five months of care at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, baby Matthew was finally allowed home . His twin brother, James, was too tiny and underdeveloped to survive, passing away just 26 hours after the brothers were born on February 15 . Mrs O'Hara said: 'Matthew has kidney stones and very poor eye-sight but everyone is completely shocked that's he's made it as far as he has. He spent five months and a day in hospital and still goes back to Alder Hey Children's Hospital for check-ups but it's a miracle that he's done so well' His remarkable journey is set to be aired on Channel 5's show Miracle Babies tomorrow night. Mrs O'Hara, a research scientist at the University of Liverpool, said: 'Matthew has kidney stones and very poor eye-sight but everyone is completely shocked that's he's made it as far as he has. 'He spent five months and a day in hospital and still goes back to Alder Hey Children's Hospital for check-ups but it's a miracle that he's done so well. 'They've been filming Matthew for the programme since he was two weeks old. 'I didn't want to do it at first because of what had happened with James but Adrian really wanted to do it. 'Looking back now I'm so glad we chose to do it - it's brilliant for people to get to see the amazing work the hospitals do. 'It'll be great to show the programme to Matthew when he's older so he can understand just how incredible his journey has been.' A spokesman for Liverpool Women's Hospital said: 'Only one in five babies who are born 17 weeks premature would usually survive because they're so underdeveloped. 'Babies are very fragile so we have to take extra care - especially with premature births. 'But we're constantly developing ways to help these babies and give them the best chance in life.'","Natalie O'Hara, 34, gave birth to twins Matthew and James in February .

"Getting on a plane for many people is an experience to be endured rather than enjoyed. But if you are among the estimated 10 per cent of the population who suffer from a fear of flying, help could be at hand. A London-based therapist specialising in anxiety disorders says she has a near 100 per cent success rate in helping clients overcome aerophobia – an extreme fear of flying - using holistic therapies and an unusual method called Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT). Lauren Rosenberg uses the Emotional Freedom Technique to help clients suffering from anxiety disorders . Fear and phobia expert Lauren Rosenberg describes the technique as ‘acupuncture without needles’. She says that as well as helping patients suffering from phobias, she has also been able to assist clients struggling with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, food allergies and stress-related illnesses. The process involves using a technique called ‘tapping’ – a method of freeing the body’s energy flow which Mrs Rosenberg says becomes blocked during moments of anxiety. The French-born former special needs teacher also uses techniques called Matrix Birth Re-imprinting, EmoTrance and Integral Eye Movement Technique, which she claims are able to help ‘collapse’ negative beliefs and emotions connected to traumatic events such as flying. She says she has seen around 15 patients for aerophobia, almost all of whom say they can now travel on planes without fear. Mrs Rosenberg says that as well as helping patients suffering from phobias, she has also been able to assist clients struggling with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, food allergies and stress-related illnesses . ‘If you have a fear of flying you have a belief that being on a plane is dangerous,' says Lauren. ‘Maybe the fear comes from not being in control. For one patient, it was related to a film she had seen when she was young. ‘We’ve all had negative experiences in our lives which felt very intense, especially if we were young when they happened and even more so if they were repeated. 'Thinking about these can cause strong emotions and anxiety years after the event. ‘Such bad experiences can cause a disruption in the body’s energy system, a kind of ‘short circuit’, which can be at the root of negative feelings, phobias and health issues.' Mrs Rosenberg says she has helped many clients struggling with aerophobia, with almost every one saying they can now travel on planes without fear . There are more than 12 million people in the UK who suffer from aerophobia. Many of the country's leading airlines now offer courses designed to help people overcome their fears, while aerophobics can also benefit from the increasing number of flight simulators throughout the country which are aimed at helping familiarise passengers with the safety measures and systems that pilots have to keep their passengers safe. Mrs Rosenberg explains that tapping is a type of ‘first-aid kit’ that she teaches clients to use themselves, and which can help calm them down if they need to during stressful moments such as during take-off and moments of turbulence. It involves a combination of deep breathing, applying pressure to different points of the body and using the fingertips to stimulate the body’s energy flow to overcome the anxiety. There are more than 12 million people in the UK who suffer from aerophobia – a fear of flying. Aerophobics can  benefit from using flight simulators aimed at helping passengers understand a plane's safety measure . Mrs Rosenberg previously worked as a special needs teacher, before deciding to work full-time with holistic therapy after seeing how her daughter's allergies had been helped by EFT. She now runs the Fear Busters clinic in north-west London and treats clients across the world. 'Gradually I had friends asking me to help them,' she said. 'It has taken me about four or five years to perfect everything I have learnt and to create a formula that works. ‘I am now a member of the Association for the Advancement of Meridian Energy Techniques (AAMET) and the AMT that is covered by the Holistic Services Insurance.’ ‘Everybody is different. People usually have three sessions to cure their fear. Some people need six sessions. 'For children I usually see them for a three week program and for adults it is a six week program. Julie, in her forties, had tried hypnotism, prescription drugs and herbal remedies to try and cure her fear of flying, but without success. She says she was finally helped after a course of EFT. ‘To say that I was scared of flying was a huge understatement – I was terrified. ‘The prospect of getting on a plane filled me with fear and dread, even looking at a plane in the sky made me start to shake. ‘I'd tried hypnotism, herbal remedies, prescription drugs and alcohol, none of which have helped. ‘With a girls holiday to Marbella approaching, I thought it was a great chance to give this therapy a try. ‘Lauren  sent me a questionnaire to complete before my first session, which asked for general information about my fear, plus other aspects of my life. ‘On my first visit, Lauren talked me through how EFT could work for me, alongside other holistic therapies. ‘The EFT involves ‘body-tapping’, which unblocks disruptions in energy flow. ‘Lauren made me realise that my fear is not ‘real’ - it’s an emotion, or energy, that can be cleared. ‘I had managed to train my brain that my fear was real and now we had to un-train it. ‘After a combination of EFT and positive visualization, we finally discovered the route of my fear – not a phobia passed down from my parents as I had always thought, but a scene from a long-forgotten film. ‘In my second session, Lauren used ‘eye-scrambling’ to reduce the intensity of the image I had from the film, and along with more tapping I was feeling much more confident. ‘In my third and final session Lauren needed to deal with the worst part of my fear - taking off. ‘She used breathing techniques along with visualisation to release the blocked bad energy that was causing the fear. I could physically feel the fear leaving my body! ‘At the end of the session I was very emotional, relieved that I no longer had my fear and very excited about my holiday. ‘The real test was two days later when I set off for Luton Airport with my friends. ‘I was still apprehensive, hoping beyond hope that all Lauren’s hard work was going to pay off. ‘We boarded the plane, and I was ok. We found our seats, strapped ourselves in and listened to the safety briefing, and I was ok. ‘Then as the plane started to move I felt myself relax, I picked up a magazine and chatted to my friends as the plane lifted in to the air. ‘No tears, no squeezing my friends’ hands, no shaking, no paranoia about every noise and bump! ‘I am so grateful to Lauren for this transformation. I can now look forward to going on holiday without fearing the journey.’ Recalling a patient she had who sought help for aerophobia, Mrs Rosenberg said: ‘I had a lady in Australia, who’d had a bad flight when she was little with her parents. ‘We did some ‘tapping’ inside the image and collapsed the belief that she made at the time. ‘Once she collapsed that belief she was able to go on a plane without fear. ‘It is all about the messages that the mind is sending.’","Therapist Lauren Rosenberg uses Emotional Freedom Technique .

"Louise Robinson, president of the Girls¿ Schools Association, says parents who pay for their children to go to private schools should not pay for pupils from state schools . Private schools should not be expected to open up their facilities to pupils from local state schools, a leading headmistress said yesterday. Louise Robinson, president of the Girls’ Schools Association, said it was ‘beyond the pale’ for the Government to insist that private schools share their ‘unique selling points’, such as facilities and resources, with the ‘competition’. She said that middle class parents who manage to find the money for private school fees should not be expected to bankroll state pupils who want to use the same resources. Her comments are likely to spark fierce debate among private school heads, many of whom justify their schools’ ‘charitable’ status by stressing the ways in which they share facilities with local state schools and the community. David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove have praised this practice and urged independent schools to go further, pooling their ‘DNA’ with state schools by extending financial backing and lending their ‘brands’ to academies. But Mrs Robinson, head of Merchant Taylors’ Girls’ School in Crosby, Liverpool, said parents already faced increasing fees due to the growing weight of regulation and red tape that private schools must follow. She said they should not be expected to pay for an independent education only to see the money spent on ‘local competition’. She questioned why, for example, private schools should help set up combined cadet forces (CCFs) for state pupils. Mrs Robinson stressed that many private schools were keen to help the state sector ‘on their own terms’ but said it was wrong for the Government to impose the practice. ‘Michael Gove has been very clear about the rules of co-operating with us, asking us to share our resources or facilities,’ she told the GSA’s annual conference in Liverpool. ‘Many of us happily do this already with a wide variety of schools on our own terms. ‘But when we are squeezed between the tightening rules and regulations being imposed upon us, the rising cost of our provision and the ability of middle-class parents to pay our increasing fees, it seems a bit beyond the pale to ask if we will share aspects of our unique selling points with local competition. ‘And competition it is; why should my school offer its CCF expertise and experience to parents who could have sent their children to my school, but chose not to, or to a Government which criticises my morality? ‘The current government cannot decide whether they are for or against independent schools: they want our DNA, our sponsorship of academies, but we know academies are not the answer to everyone’s prayers.’ Mrs Robinson said many private school heads backed an ‘open access’ scheme with poorer parents given financial help to give their children an independent education. PM David Cameron wants greater sharing of resources between state and independent schools (stock image) Fees would depend on parental income, with the wealthiest paying full fees and others paying nothing and the Government making up the shortfall. In a wide-ranging speech, she also forecast that pupils will be able to play video games and learn from the comfort of their homes using web-based lessons and Skype in ‘Star Trek schools’ of the future. Britain’s school system was failing to keep up with 21st century technology and must modernise to equip pupils with the skills they will need in the future, she added. Her call came days after Mr Gove announced plans for a computer science curriculum with the same status as traditional subjects. Pupils as young as seven could be required to learn how to ‘code’ computer programs. Mrs Robinson said she was calling for more ‘creative curriculum decisions’. Meanwhile, it was revealed thousands of places at the UK’s top universities were left empty as a result of the Government’s higher education reforms. The 11,500 unfilled spots at Russell Group universities were an ‘unintended consequence’ of the overhaul of the university sector, said Professor Sir Howard Newby, vice-chancellor of Liverpool University.","Louise Robinson criticises plans for private schools to share resources .

"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick launched an extraordinary Twitter rant at a fan who questioned his work ethic yesterday. The talented footballer had taken to the social media site to brag about his extreme exercise workout - while also fitting two hours of studying into the day. But when a fan responded to the tweet by mocking the athlete's performance on the field, Kaepernick reacted angrily, writing: 'You got 8 followers... Get better at life!' Angry tweets: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick launched an extraordinary Twitter rant at a fan who questioned his work ethic yesterday . Final message to fan: The talented footballer sent a series of impassioned tweets to the supporter, the last of which ended with 'get better at life' Kaepernick, 27, was once criticized by former 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh  for getting too involved in Twitter and social media disputes. The latest row began after the star footballer wrote: '1000 abs.... arm workout..... 10 min straight on the jump rope.... 2 hour study session in February..... that's what we call a recovery day!' A fan named Stephen Batten soon responded by saying: '@Kaepernick7 @49ers ab workout won't help find open receiver #study.' In two sharp replies, Kaepernick referred to the fan as a 'clown' and asked him if he was 'illiterate or just ignorant' before requesting he give him a 'breakdown of every defensive coverage' Working hard: General Manager of the San Francisco 49ers, Trent Baalke, recently praised Kaepernick's work ethic, saying: 'He's a very dedicated player. I'm sure he feels good about the progress he's made' Only 11 minutes later he sent the critical fan a third message, writing: '@battman_returns you got 8 followers bruh your own family don't even want to know what you doin!

He said: 'Colin is working his tail off. I think everybody saw the reports that he's down in Arizona working hard with Kurt and several other people.' 'He knows what he needs to work on. He's a very dedicated player. I'm sure he feels good about the progress he's made up to this point. 'The only reason you go down there and do the things he's doing is to get better.

"Cambridge University students are forced to dig trenches and clean toilets as punishment, it has been revealed. One student at St John's College, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was forced to help groundsmen dig and fill in a trench while another claimed they had been made to clean toilets at 8am for an hour every day - for six days after breaking rules. The Draconian measures were revealed as . part of an investigation into the punitive system employed by each . college at the university. Fooled: The homeless man is believed to have slept at a St John's College library for six weeks before being kicked out . Most colleges impose fines for misbehaviour, ranging from loud parties and parking bikes in the wrong place, to skipping supervisions. But St John’s college employs a 'community service' scheme instead of fines; the Office of the Dean can hand out any disciplinary measure it sees fit. A spokesman for St John's college . said: 'The range of disciplinary measures that can be imposed by the . Dean of St John’s is defined in the College's Standing Orders. 'These include making a community service order up to a permitted maximum of hours per term. Punishment: One student at St John's College claimed he was forced to dig a trench while another said they had been made to clean the toilets for an hour at 8am for six days (file pictures) 'The Dean's policy is to make such an . order in preference to imposing a fine. The College recognises that the . effect of a fine varies according to students' ability to pay it.' The claims of trench digging and toilet cleaning were made in the student newspaper The Cambridge Student. It also revealed student have paid out a total of £38,209 in fines for bad behaviour since October 2011 - an average of £1,232.54 per college. A Freedom of Information request found Newnham college had levied the most - more than a quarter of the total fines at £12,872 - all of which supplemented college income. Meanwhile student fines at Downing College were used to fund a staff coach trip, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed. Newnham College (pictured) levied the most fines upon students. It collected £12,872 . The College said the annual trip for ‘bedders,’ porters and administrative staff is justifiable because it rewards the staff inconvenienced by student misbehaviour. A spokesman for Downing college added: . 'Most fines are suspended, as a means . of encouraging better behaviour in the future and only in the worst . cases are they imposed immediately. 'Any fines which are actually . collected - and this may vary from nothing to a few hundred pounds in . any year - are fed back into the staff social fund. 'In many cases the staff have been . those who have had to deal with the often unpleasant outcome; the fine . is hardly a 'reward' more a small compensation. 'The staff fund is used to support an . annual outing, designed to improve inter-staff bonding; however, the . far greater part of this cost is covered by their own fundraising events . - raffles, cake sales, coffee mornings etc. The College agrees a day's . absence from work to support this aim.' One student from the college was fined £200 for stealing a candlestick and another student at Magdalene college was made to pay £600 for smoking cannabis in their room. The spokesman added: 'The theft of a silver . candlestick from another College was intended to send a very stern . message that theft is never condoned, and potentially avoided the . individual concerned being reported to the Police and ending up with a . criminal record which could affect his future job prospects.' Harsh: One student at Downing College (pictured) was fined £200 for a stolen candlestick . Students at Girton college are charged up to £15 for each supervision session they miss. But the figures showed the actual amount varies with £43.43 being charged for missing two supervisions and £50.32 for missing three. Students are also fined £50 for leaving their bikes unattended in prohibited areas. And if there is an act of vandalism on college grounds the entire student body is fined. King’s college charges students £25 per head for every person involved in 'noise disturbance' while a 'noise violation' in Pembroke college merits a fine of £180. Pembroke also fines £70 for setting off the fire alarm. But a Pembroke student, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'One of my friends was fined £80 for setting off the fire alarm by boiling a kettle. Pembroke said they’d lower the fine if he didn’t contest them.' Newnham £12,872 Gonville & Caius £9,930 Fitzwilliam £6,245 Clare £1,764 Girton £1,275.25 . All fines revealed in the figures at Lucy Cavendish arise from leaving rooms in what were perceived to be unacceptable states. A spokesman for Lucy Cavendish college said: 'Students are asked to clean their rooms on departure. 'If this is not the case, fines (as set out in College handbook) will be imposed.' Newnham College charged £6,719 for 'housekeeping', but it did not state specific charges. Queen’s college revealed it does not levy fines, but has other means of maintaining discipline. A student from the college said: 'I think fining is terrible, as how severely people are affected by the fines will be largely dependent on the economic situation of the student and his/her family, which makes the system of punishment highly unfair.' The University has no overarching policy with regard to fining students as it is at the discretion of individual colleges to enforce behavioural discipline. Girton College (pictured) fined students £1,275.25 since October 2011. In total, Cambridge University students have paid out £38,209 . Clare £1,205 - split between 5 students for a party . Magdalene £600 - smoking cannabis in room . Fitzwilliam £240 - bringing college into disrepute . Downing £200 - stolen candlestick . The University’s Statutes and Ordinances states that the University 'shall have all the powers of a natural . person to acquire, manage, charge, deal with, and dispose of property, . both real and personal [...] so that it may exercise any power and may . enter into and carry out any kind of transaction without limitation.' Colleges fine students for missing supervision, leaving their bikes unattended or for having disruptive parties. The majority of colleges charge for any damage done to rooms, but as this is a remunerative sum it is therefore classed as a charge rather than a fine. At matriculation, a student effectively acknowledges the University’s authority to deal with damage to property in any way the University sees fit.","One student claimed he had to clean toilets for an hour each day for six days .

"Last month was the warmest August globally since records began 130 years ago. Data by Nasa shows that August 2014 experienced global highs 0.70°C above the 1951-1980 temperature average. However, the difference is small compared with previous warm Augusts, including that of 2011, 2008, 2006 and 2003. Pictured is tow August 2014 compared to the long-term average global temperature in August, in degrees Celsius. The 0.68 shown at the top right-hand corner is an estimate for the global mean change . The second warmest August was 0.69°C. in 2011 followed by 0.68°C in 1998 and 0.66°C. in 2006. While this year has been exceptionally warm, Nasa has warned against reading too much into a single month’s records. Dr Gavin Schmidt, a Nasa climatologist told Huffington Post that a very hot August is just one part of the data that ‘point[s] towards the long-term trends.’ Scientists had predicted extreme weather events to surface earlier this year after it looked like an El Niño event would develop in the Pacific Ocean. El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. Global temperature anomalies for August 2014 on the north (left) and south (right) pole.  Scientists had predicted extreme weather events to surface earlier this year after it looked like an El Niño event would develop in the Pacific Ocean . El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (around 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. This refers to periods when sea temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (around 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Greg Laden wrote in Science Blogs: ‘We don’t know how 2014 will rank as a year. If there is no El Niño it will rank high. ‘If an El Niño gets going soon enough to affect the year’s average, 2014 may well be in the top few warmest years since global warming began.’ But warmer weather in some parts of the world could trigger a freeze elsewhere. In a separate study, researchers discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures, and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex. They found that as oceans heat up and melt the Arctic ice, warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere. The polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the US last winter. Last month was the warmest August globally since records began 130 years ago, according to recent data released by Nasa.

The weather is generally in the 70s during the day and in the 40s at night, perfect camping weather that isn't too hot or too cold, say the women. 'The employees like me,' Torres told the Star Tribune. 'Some say that’s dedication and others say that’s stupid,' she said of reaction from customers. Torres says she's been passing the time by, 'sitting here and watching people.' 'My daughter checks in on me all the time,' she added. The women have said they want to get a good deal on a television this year and don't mind waiting weeks for one. 'We could have started later, but then we wouldn't be sure to get first in line,' Torres told the Beaumont Patch. 'They only get a few items at the cheaper prices and it’s first come, first served.'

Passing the time: The women pass the time by people watching and take turns going home to take showers . 'While we recognize the decision to open on Thanksgiving affects Best Buy employees, customers have made it clear that many of them want to begin shopping on Thanksgiving evening, ' Best Buy said in a statement. 'In recent years, millions of Americans have shopped on Thanksgiving, and our store associates are excited and prepared to help customers fulfill their holiday wish lists,' the statement continued . 'Most Thanksgiving evening shifts are filled by employees who volunteer to work.' In states like Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, stores in those states will not open until Black Friday due to their individual state laws forbidding stores to be open. Other stores open on Thanksgiving are Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s, Staples, Wal-Mart, Sears, J.C. Penney ,Toys ‘R’ Us, and Radio Shack. More and more bargain hunters will begin lining up outside stores in order to get the best deal but unlike Torres and Salas, they may not begin lining up for a few more weeks.

"Iran has successfully tested its own version of a top-secret US drone  it captured in 2011, state news reports claim. General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the aerospace division of the elite Revolutionary Guard, was quoted as saying the test was carried out early Monday. 'As we promised earlier this year, a test flight of the Iranian version of the RQ-170 was carried out and a video will be released soon,' he told IRNA new agency. The newly made drone is pictured during an unveiling ceremony in Tehran on September 23, 2014 . The country said it managed to reverse-engineer the RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance it seized in December 2011 after it entered Iranian airspace from neighboring Afghanistan. News reports claim that after extracting the valuable technology, Iran is now capable of launching its own production line for the unmanned aircraft to be used by their own defence industry. In a video posted by the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, . Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei voiced satisfaction at the . news after seeing a replica of the drone, saying: 'Today is a . very sweet and unforgettable day for me.'

Iran says it has captured several American drones in recent years, including a Boeing-designed ScanEagle drone - a less sophisticated aircraft - after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf. Tehran says it is also copying the ScanEagle and plans to put its version into service. Iran has accused the U.S. of using drones to spy on the country's nuclear program.

Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei voiced satisfaction at the news, after seeing a replica of the drone . Tehran insists its nuclear program is entirely focused on peaceful applications like power generation and the production of medical isotopes. The two sides are currently struggling to reach an agreement under which Tehran would curb its nuclear activities in exchange for relief from crippling international sanctions.

"Archaeologists in Siberia have begun uncovering an extraordinary alfresco gallery of prehistoric art high in the 4,506-metre tall Altai Mountains. While the region is famed for petroglyphs (rock engravings), new finds are being made in the hidden and rarely-visited Saldyar valley, close to the fast-flowing Katun River. Here beneath the densely-wooded slopes they are discovering remarkable rock pictures dating back 5,000 years, close to Russia's border with China and Mongolia. Lush scenery: The 4,506-metre tall  Altai Mountains in southern Siberia are one of the great undiscovered tourist destinations of the world, featuring breathtaking lakes and peaks. The mountain range in East-Central Asia is known as the Siberian Switzerland . Archaeologists in Siberia have begun uncovering an extraordinary alfresco gallery of prehistoric art in the mountains . Further searches for this ancient treasure trove will go ahead after the snow melts next year. Professor Andrey Borodovsky, from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography at the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: 'The total number of petroglyphs in Saldyar is several thousand, both separate images and whole compositions. 'This area is very rarely visited by researchers. Therefore, we can confidently say that it is one of the few places in the mountains where we're still waiting for sensational discoveries to be made.' Reaching the artwork here is a task in itself, with the area separated from the outside world by the high jagged peaks of the Saldyarskiy pass. Roads in this region are almost non-existent and with no mobile phone signal, nor an modern civilisation close at hand, it can feel extremely isolated - yet this artwork suggest this was a hub of human creativity in millennia gone by. 'It is a place unlike any other and is, arguably, one of the greatest art galleries anywhere in the world. Yet you won't find masterpieces in the traditional sense here, with no Rembrandts, Monets, or Da Vinci's anywhere in sight,' said The Siberian Times. 'Sensational discoveries': The artwork suggest this was a hub of human creativity in millennia gone by . Rarely visited area: Archaeologists say that they are 'still waiting for sensational discoveries to be made' in the Saldyar valley . The Altai Mountains in southern Siberia are one of the great undiscovered tourist destinations, featuring breathtaking lakes and peaks, with many signs of the ancient lost world, such as burial mounds, standing stones and the exhibition of petroglyphs, many from the Bronze and Iron ages. Many of the carvings are found on rocks that form a symbolic rock garden, with the sun's beams helping to illuminate the artistic work and making them appear similar to photograph negatives. According to Altai legend, the location of these megaliths was a result of the mythical hero Sartaksakpay, who is said to have jokingly changed the direction of the rivers and scattered the mountain valleys with huge rocks. Archaeologists studying the petroglyphs found that the ancient artists had several favourite images, including the Siberian mountain goat, which has always been seen as a symbol of success and good luck as well as being good hunting prey. Another of the most popular images at Saldyar is the long horned bull, a symbol of a bygone era that once roamed in Ancient Egypt, Mycenaean Greece and Central Asia.

Searching for a meaning: Archaeologists are still puzzled as to why the ancient civilisations carved the images in the first place . Ancient art: These pictures highlight the fact that the world's artists were already hard at work many millennia ago . Drawings dating from the early nomadic era depict deer, shown with strangely disproportionate large sizes of horns and a snout that resembled a bird's beak. What is perhaps most interesting about these depictions is that similar petroglyphs have been found as far afield as Mongolia and Trans-Baikal, showing that even in ancient times certain ideas and styles travelled a considerable distance. Other carvings depict hunters standing beside the beasts with their bows and arrows. Yet archaeologists are still puzzled as to why the ancient civilisations carved the images in the first place. Some say they were drawn as signs of rituals dedicated to the gods or spirits, to help them fatten up their cattle, others believe they are simply depictions of hunting parties. Another theory is that the carvings showed where the best hunting trails lay. The truth is, no one will truly know. Yet, whatever else these pictures show, they highlight the fact that the world's artists were already hard at work many millennia ago.","Mountain range in East-Central Asia, known as the Siberian Switzerland, is 4,506-metre tall complex mountain system .

"David Cameron was accused of trying to stage-manage Prime Minister’s Questions last night, after leaked emails revealed Tory MPs are routinely pressured to ask him easy questions. The weekly 30-minute session is supposed to be a test of Mr Cameron’s wits, with MPs able to ask him about almost any topic. But a leaked series of memos reveal that his aides routinely try to take the pressure off him by encouraging Conservative MPs to ask friendly questions. The PM pronounces during Prime Minister's . Questions: Leaked emails allege that David Cameron's aides have been trying to stage manage the weekly session by pressurising Tory . colleagues into asking easy questions . The memos show that Mr Cameron’s . parliamentary aide sends out a weekly email to all Tory MPs suggesting . ‘free hits’ for them to read out during PMQs. Gavin Williamson says that any mentions of the suggested questions would be greatly appreciated by Number 10. The most recent email, which was sent out last week, said: ‘Please find below some questions, should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today. ‘Good news on the economy features heavily – any mentions would be greatly appreciated.’ Other questions include whether Mr Cameron agrees that a ‘growing economy means more economic security for our country and a more financially secure future for hardworking people’. Mr Williamson also suggests asking the Prime Minister whether he agrees that the Government’s economic plans were ‘delivering a sustainable recovery’. ‘Please find below some questions, should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today. 'Good news on the economy features heavily - any mentions would be greatly appreciated.’ Similar emails from the past two months suggest Mr Williamson’s pleas have gone largely unrewarded – perhaps indicating the strained relationship between Tory high command and many backbench MPs. But a question asked on December 11 by Tory MP Stephen Metcalfe bears a striking resemblance to one sent out by Mr Williamson an hour earlier. Mr Williamson’s suggestions included . the question: ‘Does the Prime Minister agree with me that the only way . to raise my constituents’ living standards is to stick to the . Government’s long-term plan to fix our economy, rather than abandoning . the plan through more borrowing and more taxes as the party opposite . propose?’ Mr Metcalfe went . on to ask the Prime Minister: ‘Does my right honourable friend agree . that the best way to raise the living standards of my constituents is . for the Government to stick to their long-term plan to rebuild this . economy and not abandon it in favour of more borrowing and more taxes, . as proposed by the Labour party?’ Mr . Cameron responded by saying Mr Metcalfe was ‘entirely right’, going on . to explain the importance of reducing the deficit and continuing with . the Government’s ‘difficult spending decisions’. Gavin Williamson, left, Mr Cameron’s parliamentary aide, whose suggestion for a 'free hit' sent on December 11 was strikingly similar to an actual question asked by Tory MP Stephen Metcalfe, right, just an hour later . Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, described Mr Williamson’s emails as ‘depressing’. He said: ‘If it continues like that it just helps people’s disengagement from politics because they don’t think it’s a serious engagement, it’s a manufactured bear garden.’ Party whips have long pressured MPs on all sides to ask friendly questions. Commons Speaker John Bercow has warned that soundbites and planted questions have helped damage the reputation of Parliament.","Cameron's aide sends weekly email to all Tory MPs suggesting 'free hits'

"A lesbian couple were legally wed in Russia on Friday, despite the country's ban on same-sex marriages. Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova were able to exploit a legal loophole because, despite living as a gay woman, Irina is a transsexual and listed as male on her passport. Bride Irina explained that she categorically does not identify as a man. 'Yes, in my passport it says 'male',' she said. Scroll down for video . Gay couple Irina Shumilova (left) and Alyona Fursova (right) have become the first lesbian couple to legally wed in Russia. Here they are pictured signing the register after marrying in St Petersburg . The couple both chose to wear lace wedding gowns as they tied the knot in front of family and friends . According to her: 'Transgender is a term to describe discrepancies between social and biological sex. I am transsexual, meaning that despite I have XY-genome (sic), psychologically I am a woman.' The couple married at a registry office in St Petersburg, with both choosing to wear traditional white wedding dresses for the day. They were surrounded by their friends and family who could be seen clapping and smiling as the two brides entered the building. Irina watches on as Alyona signs the wedding registry using a gold tipped pen - one Russian MP has questioned the validity of their marriage . The first of its kind! Irina and Alyona celebrate becoming Russia's first gay couple to marry, holding each other close on their wedding day . Irina and Alyona celebrate with a large group of friends and family on the steps at the registry office in St.Petersberg . Their situation was explained by LGBT rights activist Anna Anisimova, 'The official registration by two women happened because one of them is a man according to the documents,' she said. 'Formally it was a wedding between a man and a woman but de-facto it was between two women. It was the first (LGBT wedding) in Russia. Both brides wore white dresses.' Following their nuptials Irina and Alyona were given a legal marriage certificate. Irina is currently undergoing hormone therapy and wears a blonde wig and make-up at all times. However, despite their joy at their big day Irina and Alyona's union has come under fire from some members of their community who have suggested that their marriage should be annulled. St Petersburg MP Vitaly Milonov has said that he will investigate the validity of their marriage and made controversial comments. He claimed that the workers at the registry office should not just have checked their sex on their passports. A smiling Irina is handed a wedding certificate by their wedding registrar. She could not hide her excitement at getting married to Alyona . The couple are cheered on by their friends and family as they celebrated their wedding over the weekend at a beautiful registry office in Russua . Milonov reportedly told the Russian media, 'I understood their [registry office workers'] unconvincing arguments; they formally approached the issue and saw passports, but not people. I told the head [of the wedding registry office] that it is criminal negligence.' He went on to say the wedding was, 'an ugly insult to millions of Russian families in the future... There are certain moral standards which it is vital to implement. These mad people should be banned altogether from getting married.' Gay marriage has only recently been legalised in the UK. The legislation to allow same-sex marriage was passed in July 2013 and came into effect in March 2014. The first official gay marriage took place on the 29th of March 2014. Prior to this same-sex couples who wished to solidify their union would have to enter into a civil partnership. This gave them the same rights as married couples however they were not allowed to refer to themselves as 'married.' Russia is known for its discrimination against those in the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community. Until 1999 homosexuality was referred to as a mental illness. And although sexual activity between same-sex consenting adults in private has not been a criminal offence since 1993 there are still strict rules over the propagation of gay rights propaganda. Indeed, in 2013 a law was put in place banning the distribution of materials promoting the LGBT community to young children. And earlier this year a shocking documentary named Hunted highlighted the plight of gay people in Russia. Although many see Irina and Alyona's marriage as a step forward for the country and the first of its kind gay rights activist Nikolay Alekseev disagrees. He told Russian TV show Russia Today that he does not believe their wedding should be counted as a same sex marriage, 'This is in no way a same-sex marriage. This is a question of transgender, not homosexuality.' 'This is an old story, there had been such cases before. A certain gender is written in a passport, but how they dress for the wedding is their business.'","Irina Shumilova and Alyona Fursova married over the weekend .

"Yingying Dou reportedly runs an essay writing company . The vice-chancellor of a university that was targeted by a company that offers to write students' essays for them said she was 'not surprised' about the latest cheating revelations. UTS Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Shirley Alexander spoke out after a woman was accused of running a business that writes university essays to help Chinese international students in Australia pass their degrees. Chinese-born Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly runs a website called MyMaster which  helps students cheat, a Sydney Morning Herald investigation by Amy McNeilage and Lisa Visentin claims after they discovered more than 900 ghostwritten essays. The businesswoman allegedly charges up to $1000 for essays written by her  100 employees working from a Chinatown office on George Street in Sydney. It’s claimed that MyMaster has an annual turnover of $160,000 thanks to international students desperate to pass their courses or too lazy to do the work themselves. Professor Alexander told the ABC: 'I'm not as surprised as you might think. In higher-education we've had to up the ante in how students are changing the methods of cheating for some time.’ She said that the news that flyers advertising the MyMaster essay writing service were posted in UTS toilets was not alarming. ‘We find those kinds of things all the time, that's not something that is new,’ she said. ‘When we find them we do take the number and call them and point out how illegal it is but they do appear all the time that's not something new,’ she explained. Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website MyMaster website which has now been taken down . Students (a stock photo is shown) have reportedly paid up to $1000 for their essays to be written for them . The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a flyer posted at the University of Technology Sydney said: ‘Are you racking your brains on your school work? Do you worry about spending $3000 retaking tuition on the failing subject? Leave your worries to MyMaster and make your study easier!’ Ms Dou has denied knowing anything about the website, which has now been taken down. The company’s Facebook page has also been removed but a holding page shows 605 previously people 'liked' it. She reportedly also runs Yingcredible Tutoring, a page which she has endorsed from her own personal Facebook account. ‘We provide commerce subjects tutoring service to university students to help them pass the course,’ a description on the page reads. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Dou for comment but she has not responded. Most university websites display clear advice about plagiarism. The University of Sydney says that while nobody commences their studies with the intent to plagiarise ‘many people do, for a variety of reasons’. ‘Some students plagiarise because they don’t fully understand what plagiarism is, why it is wrong and how it can be avoided. Others plagiarise, because of time or other pressures,’ a warning on their website reads. Ms Dou also reportedly runs Yingcredible Tutoring, which is another service for students . When handing in work students must satisfy the notion that it is ‘all your own work’. Students who have used the MyMaster website could be found guilty of ‘dishonest plagiarism’, which is when they ‘knowingly presenting another person’s work as one’s own work without appropriate acknowledgement of the source’. And ‘engage another person to produce or conduct research for the work, including for payment or other consideration’. A spokesperson for the University of Sydney told Daily Mail Australia: 'The University of Sydney is unequivocally opposed to academic dishonesty, including plagiarism and fraudulent authorship, and takes seriously any allegations of academic misconduct. Breaches of academic honesty are not tolerated at the University of Sydney.' 'Failure to adhere to the University’s high standards of academic merit, intellectual rigour, and ethical behaviour constitutes a breach of the University’s Code of Conduct for Students and Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in Coursework Policy. If proven, academic dishonesty may constitute misconduct, resulting in serious penalties that may include failure or exclusion. 'The University thoroughly investigates all cases of alleged academic dishonesty and provides education and support to assist students to observe the rules of honest scholarship,' they added.","Yingying Dou, 30, reportedly runs the website called MyMaster .

"Jailed: A judge told Connah Smith she hoped there was something who could be saved inside his mind . Two trainee nurses were tortured for seven hours by a spurned lover who tricked his way into their flat in an attack from a ‘horror movie’. Gabby Price and Megan Parson were tied up, doused in petrol and had lit matches thrown at them by Connah Smith who asked them how they wanted to die. He repeatedly stabbed the pair and held Miss Price under water in the bath. When he finally left the women’s home, he said: ‘Don’t tell the police, give it a day. I want to have a good night’s sleep.’ Smith, who watched violent pornography online in the months leading up to the attack in March, was yesterday jailed for life for attempted murder. Miss Price, 22, had rejected his advances after they met while working at a supermarket in Brighton, Lewes Crown Court heard. Smith spent weeks plotting his revenge, searching on the internet for ‘what’s the best way to murder somebody and not get caught?’ and ‘how are most serial killers caught?’. The 20-year-old packed a rucksack with a hammer, knives, an imitation gun, a can of petrol, matches and gaffer tape and waited outside Miss Price’s home. When she returned from work, he asked to use her toilet before slamming the door behind them both. He stabbed Miss Price and tied her up before pouncing on her 21-year-old flatmate Miss Parson when she arrived two hours later. Smith told the pair he was going to kill them as he stabbed them in the head, neck and body. He then covered them in petrol and forced them to lie on the bed where he threw lit matches at them. When the petrol failed to ignite he said: ‘Oh, this is not what happens in films. I thought it would be a bigger explosion.’ The pair’s ordeal ended just before 3am when Miss Parson feigned a miscarriage and begged to be allowed to call an ambulance. Terrified: Former colleague Gabby Price, 22 (left) and her housemate Megan Parson, 20 (right) outside court today. Both were tortured by Smith in the home they shared in Brighton and asked how they wanted to die . She later told police: ‘It was like a horror movie, like he had watched hundreds of horror movies and he just liked to do it. ‘I kept asking him why and he said it did not matter why.’ Smith’s father Michael said his son had given no sign of having committed a crime when he arrived at their shared Brighton home in the early hours. ‘He came back that night and he was OK. I just think [it was] like a game and it just got out of hand,’ he said. Smith's father Michael said after the trial: 'I don't know why he did it. He came back that night and he was OK.

But he said he did not intend to kill the women, with his defence lawyers arguing in court that his acts were ‘consistent with someone who sets out to terrorise, to harm and humiliate’. After a five-day trial, jurors took barely two hours to convict Smith of two counts of attempted murder. Judge Shani Barnes ruled he should serve a minimum of 15 years.

"Older women were mostly likely to die as a result of freezing temperatures . High fuel bills were held partly to blame yesterday for a huge surge in winter-related deaths. The number of excess winter deaths soared by almost a third last year, official figures revealed. The data, which compares deaths in winter months with averages in other seasons, found an extra 31,100 people died, mostly as a result of cold weather and flu. Critics said it was a ‘damning indictment’ of high fuel bills and cold homes. The 29 per cent rise in excess deaths occurred against a background of soaring gas and electricity prices, which left millions worried about whether to spend on heating or eating. Most victims were 75 and over, and had medical conditions, such as heart and lung problems, made worse by the cold. Last year’s harsh winter was clearly a factor, along with high fuel bills and the fact that British homes are far colder and less insulated than those in many other parts of Europe. The NHS is to provide an extra 2,500 hospital beds and 3,000 staff to help prevent a crisis in A&E this winter. Age UK’s charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ‘Excess winter deaths are preventable and today’s figures are a damning indictment of our failure to address the scandal of cold homes in this country.’ The Office for National Statistics figures showed that the highest winter death rate was in the North West and the lowest in London, with women making up 58 per cent of the total. Temperatures plunged across Britain at the start of this year, with March the coldest record since 1962 with an average monthly temperature of just 2.6C (36.7F). The ONS said: 'Winter 2012-13 was characterised by a milder than average December, followed by a prolonged period of lower than average temperatures. 'The number of deaths peaked in the . first week of January, which coincided with a peak in rates of . influenza-like illness over the Christmas weeks. 'The mean number of daily deaths was higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013.' More women died as a result of the cold (18,000) compared to 13,100 men. Notably the number of deaths peaked in the first week of January, as many people were struck down with flu over Christmas. The mean number of daily deaths was also higher than average for a prolonged period between February and April 2013. The ONS said excess winter mortality . for 2012/13 was highest in the North West of England and lowest in . London - which bucks the trend of the previous year when the highest . excess winter death rates were observed in the capital. Labour's . shadow public health minister Luciana Berger said: 'It is appalling . that thousands of people are dying unnecessarily in Britain today. 'On . the brink of another cold winter, England’s A&Es are already in . crisis. The Government’s severe cuts to elderly care mean support is . being withdrawn from homes and hundreds of thousands more older people . are turning to hospital - they deserve much better. 'A . third of these excess deaths are caused by people living in homes that . are too cold. This winter, David Cameron’s failure to stand up to the . energy companies will leave too many people forced to choose between . heating and eating. 'Ministers need to take urgent action and back Labour's plans to freeze energy bills.' Health officials are calling for an army of good . samaritans to care for the nation's elderly this winter. NHS England wants 100,000 people to sign a pledge saying . they will look in on an elderly friend or neighbour over the coming months. Actress Joanna Lumley (pictured) was the first person to become a 'Winter Friend' and sign . the online pledge, which reads: 'I will take time out this winter to look . in on an elderly friend or neighbour to make sure they are warm and coping . well.' She said: 'A little help really does go a long way. You will also find, I'm sure, that giving a bit of your time in this way is . hugely rewarding. 'Older people can be physically frail but they have a . lifetime's wisdom and experience to share. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today gave details of how an extra £250 million for struggling A&E units will be spent this winter. He said 'winter is tough' but that the extra resources will make sure patients 'get the excellent care they expect, no matter what season it is'. Almost 2,500 extra beds will be made available across England as a result of the funding, first announced in August. The equivalent of almost 3,000 extra staff will be brought in to help the NHS cope with winter pressures, the Department of Health said. This consists of temporary staff, extending the hours of existing staff and creating new positions. The majority of the funding was distributed earlier this year to 53 areas where hospitals were identified as being under the most pressure. The Department of Health said the extra staff is the equivalent of up to 320 extra doctors and 1,400 extra nurses, as well as up to 1,200 other NHS staff including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. A further £150million was announced by NHS England last week to help other health trusts cope with the cold weather. Mr Hunt said: 'The NHS is performing well and more than 95 per cent of patients are being seen in our A&E departments in under four hours. However, we know that cold weather affects our health and has an impact on the NHS every year. 'Winter is tough, but the NHS has never been better prepared.' The ONS said there were 18,000 winter-related female deaths, a rise from 13,610 the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of excess male deaths was 13,100 - a rise from 10,590 observed in 2011/12. 'In common with other countries, in England and Wales more people die in the winter than in the summer,' the report adds. 'In 2012-13 19.6 per cent more people . died in the winter months compared with the non-winter months, up from . 15.5 per cent in 2011-12.' Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners' Convention, said: 'This is a national scandal which the government seems incapable of doing anything about. 'Making sure older people have got a well insulated warm home and the income to pay the fuel bills isn’t green crap. It’s what a decent society should do. 'How can colder Scandinavian countries avoid this annual toll while we simply wring our hands? 'The government needs to roll out a more effective programme to insulate homes, build more suitable properties for older people, raise the winter fuel allowance and tackle the excessive profits of the big six energy companies.'","Excess winter deaths hit 31,000 last winter, Office for National Statistics .

"Publicly shamed golfer Tiger Woods banned his ex-wife from smiling on the golf course, according to his former swing coach Hank Haney. In a revelatory book he reveals the pro sportsman’s controlling attitude towards Elin Nordegren. He claims Woods banned Nordegren from smiling on the golf course if he won, because he felt that he was ‘supposed to win’. Controlling: Tiger Woods told his ex-wife she wasn't allowed to smile on the golf course if he won, according to former swing coach Hank Haney . Excerpts from the book, entitled The Big Miss, have been published in the new York Post. In it Haney describes the relationship between Woods and his Swedish wife as being ‘calm, almost cool’. Revelatory: In the book Haney describes the relationship between Woods and his Swedish wife as being 'calm, almost cool' Three months after the couple married, Nordegren apparently wanted to celebrate her husband’s victory at Torrey Pines. She suggested they throw a party like they used to when she worked as a nanny for fellow golfer Jesper Parnevik. But Tiger shot her down, saying: “E, that’s not what we do. I’m not Jesper. We’re supposed to win.’ Haney adds that the model’s smile ‘got smaller’ as their marriage continued. ‘In the future Elin would keep her emotions under wraps whenever Tiger won,’ he writes. ‘As life became more complicated, I thought Elin changed...She and Tiger developed a calm, almost cool relationship in front of other people, and conversations with them tended to be awkward and strained. ‘I never saw them argue, but they weren’t openly affectionate either.’ Haney goes on to write that during their six years together, Woods showed little respect for those around him. He would make others pay for takeout and simply leaving a restaurant when he was done eating - whether or not those around him had finished. Cold: When Woods went out to eat with Nordegren, he'd get up and leave, expecting her to follow, even if she hadn't finished her meal, the ex-coach claims . Spilling the beans: Swing coach Hank Haney (left) paints a less than flattering picture of golf pro Tiger Woods (right) For months, Haney was afraid to ask Woods for a Popsicle when the golfer was heading to the refrigerator. ‘He never offered me one or ever came back with one,' he writes. Written off: Woods called Haney¿s anecdotes 'one-sided' and a cheap way to earn money. 'I'm not going to waste my time reading it,' he said . He describes the anguish he felt over Woods’ simple lack of courtesy. ‘It actually took me a while to summon the courage to blurt out, “Hey, Bud, do you think I could have one of those Popsicles?”’ In the tell-all, Haney depicts Woods as bad-mannered, cheap, and a lover of pornography and potty-humour. Before the 2006 Ryder Cup, several golfers, including devout Christian Zach Johnson, shared a hotel room with Woods. Woods ‘immediately purchased the adult-move 24-hour package and turned it on,’ Haney said, according to the New York Post. Johnson had no choice but to ignore the adult programming. The ex-coach said Tiger let his fame go to his head. When . he went out to eat with Nordegren, he’d get up and . leave, expecting her to follow – even if she hadn’t finished her meal. ‘When he was done – and he habitually ate fast – you were done,’ he wrote. Though Woods said he hated the ‘vultures’ in media for picking apart his personal life, he oddly loved his South Park depiction, in which he is seen calling Nordegren a ‘fat Swedish cow.’ Walking on eggshells: Mr Haney says he was afraid to ask Tiger for a Popsicle and said Woods never offered . The coach quit via text message in May 2010 – perhaps a good move since he said Tiger was glued to his phone and would routinely ignore people to SMS. As it turned out, the golfer was messaging his mistresses. Woods has written off the book, calling it ‘unprofessional and very disappointing.’ Dine and dash: Tiger would supposedly leave the restaurant as soon as he was done eating, and wouldn't wait for then-wife Elin Nordegren to finish . He told ESPN.com in a telephone interview the book – which will be released prior to the Masters – was especially hurtful because ‘it’s someone I worked with and trusted as a friend.’ He called Haney’s anecdotes ‘one-sided’ and a cheap way to earn money. ‘I’m not going to waste my time reading it,' Woods said. In the end, the 247-page book ends with Haney wishing Woods well – he even thanks him for ‘an incredibly rewarding six years.’","Swing coach Hank Haney claims Woods told ex-wife she wasn't allowed to smile on the golf course because he felt like he was 'supposed to win'

"Elon Musk has confirmed plans to bring low-cost internet to the masses by releasing hundreds of micro-satellites. The news follows rumours earlier this week that Musk was planning to launch a swarm of tiny satellites to bring remote parts of the world online. The SpaceX co-founder today said on Twitter that he is 'still in the early stages of developing micro-satellites,' and promised an official announcement in the next two to three months. High flyer: The SpaceX co-founder today said on Twitter that he is 'still in the early stages of developing micro-satellites,' and promised an official announcement in the next two to three months . The billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly working with Greg Wyler, a satellite expert and former Google employee. Mr Wyler was involved with developing Google's bid to get less developed parts of the world online, The Wall Street Journal reported. The race is on to connect the two-thirds of the planet without internet access, with Google and Facebook both announcing grand plans to roll out access using satellites, drones and even giant balloons. Mr Wyler founded WorldVu Satellites, based in the Channel Islands, which controls a large block of radio spectrum and is said to talking to industry executives – along with Mr Musk – about plans to launch around 700 satellites, each weighing just 250lbs (113kg). The satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment, and the constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet. Elon Musk (pictured) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online. The billionaire entrepreneur is now exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against Google and Facebook . The duo may build a factory to make the satellites, either in Florida or Colorado. Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk's firm Space X, which has 48 launches planned by 2018. Elon musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet. He is said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert Greg Wyler, of WorldVu Satellites. The duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet. They would each weigh just 250lbs (113kg) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering. The duo is considering opening a factory in Florida or Colorado to build their creations for a cost of at least $1 billion (£600 million). Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk's firm Space X but there are many obstacles in the way. Last month, the company won a $2.6 billion (1.6 billion) contract to develop, test and fly 'space taxis' for Nasa, in order to put US astronauts into orbit. However, there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before the satellites are deemed a success. They are predicted to cost $1 billion (£600 million) to develop and may be able to be launched until the end of the decade, depending on Space X's schedule. Mr Musk's involvement in the long-term is not certain and WorldVu risks losing its spectrum in 2030, too. The company currently controls a  block of radio spectrum in the Ku band, communicating in the microwave range of between 12 and 18 GHz. In June, it was announced that Google is planning on launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. According to sources close to the company, it plans on spending more than $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology. Two-thirds of the world still remain without internet access. Google is planning to change this by launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online, and now Elon Musk and an ex-Google employee plan to launch around 700 satellites in an even larger project . Mr Wyler was working at Google on the final design of the satellites, which are thought to be small, high-capacity and intended to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. Google: The internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. The project was led by Mr Wyler. Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. Facebook: Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain's Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record. He only stayed for around one year before leaving to work with Mr Musk. Sources close to him told The WSJ that Mr Wyler's relationship with Google broke down because he doesn't think Google has the manufacturing experience needed for such a commitment. Google did not comment. If the ambitious project goes ahead, Mr Musk and Mr Wyler will be competing with established firms such as Sierra Nevada and Britain's Surrey Satellite Technology. They will also be going head-to-head with Google and Facebook, too. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. It's hoped that it could save developing countries the high cost of laying fibre cables to get online and lead to a dramatic increase in internet access for the likes of Africa and south-east Asia. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. Facebook, meanwhile, has its own drone plans. In March, Mark Zuckerberg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. He has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next three billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time. Before Mr Wyler left Google, there were reportedly plans to make small, high-capacity satellites designed to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. There is also a project to launch giant balloons to connect remote regions to the internet . The Institution of Engineering and Technology's president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.' Companies such as Facebook and Google have a checkered . history with privacy, and many have voiced concerns about how the site could . use drones to collect data about people. In theory, the drones could be . used to take aerial images, or collect details about wireless networks and . individuals. As Facebook and Google's drones will be . used to provide internet to people home's, there will need to be a limited . amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network. With this in mind, they are . likely to be subject to strict regulation. In the U.S, for example, the . Federal Aviation Authority's (FAA) guidelines state private operators  are . allowed to fly their drones 'recreationally' and commercial drones are . 'prohibited.' However, earlier this year Judge Patrick Geraghty, from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dismissed a fine, which the FAA had placed on a drone photographer. Geraghty said Raphael Pirker's . camera drone was 'not subject to [federal regulation] and enforcement,' and . therefore the fine wasn't valid. It is unsure exactly what this . ruling will mean for companies such as Amazon, and now Facebook, but it could . see the restrictions relaxed. The FAA is appealing. Facebook and Google are also . planning to use these drones in areas outside the U.S., and it will depend on . the individual country's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance. 'The difficulty has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.' Mr Musk and Mr Wyler both want to cut the cost of the technology, not least because WorldVu needs a lot of satellites. Mr Musk has an enviable track record of reducing the cost of space travel by simplifying the design of rockets and building components in-house and it is hoped he will help to develop satellites that cost under $1 million (£629,008), instead of several million as they do at the moment.

"Jurors in the Catherine Pileggi murder trial deliberated for more than eight hours yesterday without reaching a verdict over the killing. Pileggi, 58, is accused of second-degree murder in the June 27, 2011, death of her long-time boyfriend, multimillionaire Ronald Vinci, in Fort Lauderdale. According to Pileggi's defense, Vinci, 70, had a long history of abusing Pileggi verbally, physically and sexually throughout their tumultuous relationship. Jurors in the Catherine Pileggi murder trial have so far been unable to decide whether she is guilty of killing her long-time boyfriend, multimillionaire Ronald Vinci, in Fort Lauderdale, in June 2011 . Her lawyer Bruce Udolf told the court the killing was in self-defence and portrayed Pileggi as a 'battered spouse'. Earlier on the night Pileggi admitted killing her partner, she claimed that Vinci held a gun to her head and told her she didn't deserve to live, the Sun-sentinel reported. Somewhere between 10 and 11 pm that night, as he lay in bed with a head wound from a fall down the stairs, Pileggi said she shot him, stabbed him repeatedly, slit his throat and hit him on the head with a hammer. Prosecutor Brian Cavanagh told jurors Pileggi illegally took the law into her own hands, killing Vinci while he was unconscious and posed no threat to anyone. Vinci was found dead in the $3 million waterfront mansion he had only moved into two weeks earlier. Neighbours had reported hearing screams coming from the house during the early hours of the morning on the day of the incident. Vinci had only just moved into his $3 million waterfront mansion and was said to have wanted to leave Pileggi . Before the case went to court, Pileggi's stepmother, who declined to give her name, had said she wouldn't 'hurt a fly'. 'In all honesty, she wouldn’t even say anything that would hurt somebody’s feelings.' Police had previously said Pileggi's relationship with Vinci had soured before his death. Detective Travis Mandell said: 'We believe there was some sort of argument that ensued because Mr. Vinci had been trying to get Mrs. Pileggi out of his life.' 'Vinci had recently moved to Florida from Rancho Santa Fe to retire and spend time with his son Kerry and his grandson. The self-made millionaire started as a Honda motorcycle dealer in San Diego before building up a successful car dealership spread across southern California and Las Vegas.

"Alan Johnson last night ruled out replacing Ed Miliband as Labour leader, saying he would ‘never’ take the job. The popular former home secretary threw Mr Miliband a lifeline by warning rebel MPs that he will not step in if the beleaguered leader is ousted. It comes after claims up to one in five of Mr Miliband's frontbenchers was ready to call on him to go, with Mr Johnson favourite as a caretaker leader. Scroll down for video . Former home secretary Alan Johnson threw Ed Miliband a lifeline after inisisting he will never stand to be Labour leader . Support for Mr Miliband has plummeted even among his party's supporters. Pollsters YouGov found that only 34 per cent of people who voted Labour at the last General Election believe Mr Miliband is up to the job of Prime Minister, compared to 51 per cent just a month ago. The sheer scale of the unhappiness is also highlighted by the fact that 45 per cent of those who voted Labour in 2010 believe he should quit as party leader. An opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election. Senior Labour figures have publicly admitted the party is having 'jitters' about Mr Miliband's stewardship of the party, and have issued a put up or shut up plea for plotters to 'show us your colours'. In an article for The Guardian, former Home Secretary Alan Johnson ruled out ever running for Labour leader. He said: . 'Miliband will lead us into an election that I am convinced we can win. It was my decision to walk away from frontline politics, not Ed’s. 'He knows that while I won’t return, I will do everything I can from the backbenches to put Labour into government, and Ed Miliband into 10 Downing Street. 'The position of Labour leader has been vacated twice during my time as a member of parliament. Both times I chose not to stand. I happen to think that a better person took this onerous role on each occasion. 'I have never stood for the leadership of my party – and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will.' Yesterday Mr Miliband attempted to brush off the reports, saying he agreed that 'you shouldn't believe everything you read in the papers'. Asked if he agreed there was a 'crisis of confidence' in his leadership, he replied curtly: 'No.' Mr Miliband received a major boost when Mr Johnson gave the clearest statement yet that he would not take the reins. ‘I have never stood for the leadership of my party, and for the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the circumstances, I never will,’ he told The Guardian. His comments are a blow to rebel MPs who want Mr Miliband to go for the sake of the party, as Mr Johnson is viewed as one of the few figures who could unite Labour in the six months before the election. Mr Johnson said Mr Miliband was ‘entitled to our loyalty’. But he revealed that he had turned down Mr Miliband’s request to take a senior front line role in the election campaign, saying that he would only offer informal help from the backbenches. Earlier, Mr Miliband attempted to get on the front foot after enduring days of sniping from his own side, by giving a major speech on Europe to the CBI. But his woes pursued him to the business organisation’s conference in London, where one delegate asked him whether he now wished he had lost the leadership to his elder brother David. ‘Certainly not,’ Mr Miliband snapped back. A new opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft put Labour on just 29 per cent, the same level of support secured by Gordon Brown in the 2010 general election . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna . Senior Labour figures publicly rallied behind Ed Miliband. But their attempt to shore up Mr Miliband's position risked being derailed when shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna - widely tipped as a possible future leader - appeared to muddle him up with his elder brother David. Mr Umunna admitted there were 'noises off' about Mr Miliband's leadership, but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It is a small minority of people, who are doing so anonymously and off the record.' However, in a later interview, Mr Umunna appeared to mix Ed up with brother David, who he defeated by a narrow margin in the 2010 contest for the leadership. The shadow business secretary told Sky News: 'I know, for my constituency, (we have) a united Labour Party in ensuring that we get David, um, that we get Ed Miliband into No 10. I know ultimately that that's what's going to make a difference to their lives.' Mr attempted to laugh off the speculation about his position, recalling a conversation with CBI president Sir Michael Rake. ‘I always remember him saying to me, “Ed, you shouldn’t believe everything you read in the newspapers”. It won’t surprise you to know that I rather agree with that just at the moment.’ Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper dismissed suggestions that she was preparing for a leadership bid as ‘complete nonsense’. The new poll showed support for Labour has slipped to 29 per cent – the same level achieved by Gordon Brown in his 2010 election defeat. The poll, conducted for former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, put the Conservatives on 30 per cent, Labour on 29, Ukip on 16 and the Liberal Democrats on 10. Lord Ashcroft said polling now consistently showed that while David Cameron is an electoral ‘asset’ to the Conservatives, Mr Miliband is a ‘drag’ on Labour’s fortunes. But two other polls last night gave Labour a narrow lead. A Populus poll put Labour on 36 and the Tories on 34, while an ICM poll put Labour on 32 and the Tories on 31. However, the ICM poll for the Guardian, found Mr Miliband’s personal ratings had hit a new low. It found that 63 per cent of voters think the Labour leader is doing badly, while just 21 per cent think he is doing well. The minus 42 rating is three percentage points lower than his previous worst result in June this year and will give fresh ammunition to the rebels. Labour MP John Mann said Mr Miliband’s personal unpopularity was ‘an issue’ on the doorstep. He added: ‘Any Labour MP who says otherwise simply hasn’t been talking to their electorate.’ But Mr Miliband’s allies are increasingly bullish about his ability to survive.

"England geared up for Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia without Gary Cahill, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Andros Townsend in Tuesday's training session at St. George's Park. The quintet all sat out of the morning session as a precautionary measure but should all be available to face Slovenia. They were not the only notable absentees from the training session at St. George's Park with Danny Welbeck, Calum Chambers, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley and Saido Berahino  all taking part in a modified session due to their Premier League excursions on Sunday.

The latter five started the training session but then went in to do gym work, with Jamaal Lascelles and Jack Robinson brought up from the Under-21s to make up the numbers. Those who attended training on Tuesday observed a two minutes silence in memory of the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day alongside members of the armed forces. Wayne Rooney, who is set to earn his 100th cap in Saturday's match at Wembley, took part in the full session as the Three Lions look to maintain their 100 per cent start in qualifying for the 2016 finals to be held in France. The 29-year-old took over the England armband following the retirement of Steven Gerrard after the World Cup this summer, and was elected to lead Manchester United  under new manager Louis van Gaal this season. While Hodgson accepts such expectation can sit heavy on some shoulders, he is confident Rooney will continue to rise to the challenge for a few campaigns yet and could challenge goalkeeper Peter Shilton's landmark England appearance target at 125. Raheem Sterling (centre) could make his first start for England since telling Roy Hodgson he was 'too tired' to line-up against Estonia . Sterling started last month's qualifier on the bench, as a result, but came on to win the decisive free-kick for Rooney's winner . Nathaniel Clyne (front left) will be hoping to earn his first England cap after being selected in the 26-man squad by Hodgson . 'I think Wayne is in a very good place at the moment, and he has been a very good player over the past couple of years,' said Hodgson. 'I made an effort to meet him before I was officially appointed in that two weeks spell where I was doubling up as West Brom manager. 'I was interested in what am I going to meet here? Will it be someone who is burning to play? Or someone who will take it as 'well, I will do you a favour for a bit longer if it suits me'. I met the man who was burning to play, and that is the way he has been all along. 'Since he has been made captain, I think he has taken an even further step, both at Manchester United and with us. 'The big question is, of course, as one of the few seniors left in the team, absolutely guaranteed if you like a place in the team, the same at Manchester United, I worry the sense of responsibility is going to weigh him down. 'We do all we can, myself and the coaching staff, to make sure that will not happen with us, but of course when you take something seriously, it is all very well telling someone to leave your problems behind and don't worry about them, to get on with your life, it is easy to say, but very hard to do sometimes.' England players observed a two minutes silence during the session on the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day . The England squad lined-up alongside members of the armed forces as they observed the two minutes silence . Rooney and Hodgson walked out onto the pitch with members of the Armed Forces before observing the two minutes silence . Hodgson added: 'That is the danger - sometimes when players take on responsibility, they take on too much and it is to the detriment of their own game. 'We have seen Steven do that on occasions in the past - he cares so much for England, for Liverpool, sometimes they take it all on their shoulders. I think that is very unfair. 'I don't care whether you are a captain or Lionel Messi or (Cristiano) Ronaldo, I don't think you can be expected to take all the responsibility on your shoulders. 'What you should be doing is doing your bit and being as good as you are and inspiring the other players in the team. 'At the moment Wayne is coping with it well, but we will have to keep an eye on the situation, as will Louis, to make sure it does not weigh him down. 'But until that time comes we have just got to get on with it and be glad that he is doing the job that we as coaching staff want him to do, and ensure that the other players know there job so well that they are not relying on him to get them out of trouble.' Sterling (right) signed autographs to fans who watched England train ahead of Saturday's clash against Slovenia . Hodgson believes Rooney (right) can break Peter Shilton's record of 125 England international apperances . Rooney certainly seems to have enough left in the tank to push on through to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, by which time he could well have overtaken Sir Bobby Charlton's 49-goal international record. 'He is just 29, so to be honest players can play so much longer than in the past if they look after themselves,' said Hodgson. 'If we are generous and give him another five years, which is not beyond the bounds of possibility, he should beat Peter's record.'","England quintet sat out of the session as a precautionary measure but should be available to face Slovenia .

"Maybe one day far in the future humans will be capable of flying past huge cosmic structures like nebulae. For now it’s just the stuff of fantasy. But a series of animations aim to mimic that experience as closely as possible by letting you fly around and through these giant regions of dust and gas. The result is a stunning array of cosmic objects, from the Lagoon Nebula to the Bubble Nebula, revealed in glorious 3D. A Finnish astrophotographer has created amazing 3D animations of nebulae. Shown here is Melotte 15, an open cluster of stars in the Heart Nebula about 7,500 light-years away . The animations were created by Finnish astrophotographer J-P Metsävainio. He created all of them himself using an observatory in the city of Oulu in Finland. Using known distances to stars, and some guesswork, he creates the estimations of how the cosmic regions might look in 3D. A nebula, which comes from the Latin word for ‘cloud’, is a region of gas and dust in space. Some are the remains of dead stars that have expelled their gas, whereas others are regions where new stars are being formed. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. There are four main types: planetary nebulae, reflection nebulae, absorption nebulae and emission nebulae, the latter of which were focused on by J-P Metsävainio. ‘My 3D experiments are a mixture of science and an artistic impression,’ Metsävainio tells MailOnline. ‘I collect distance and other information before I do my 3D conversion.’ To work out how a nebula might look in three dimensions Metsävainio looks up the distances to known stars, so that they can be placed at the correct location. And if the distance to the nebula is known, he fine tunes the distance to the stars so that the right amount of stars are in front and behind the object. ‘I use a “rule of thumb” method for stars: brighter is closer,’ he explains. ‘But if a real distance is known, I try to use it.’ In each can be seen the structure, shape and features of the objects. Shown here is the full Heart Nebula, also called IC 1805, in three dimensions . The Pelican Nebula with the North America Nebula in the constellation Cygnus is seen here . By looking carefully at the structures in nebulae he says their shape can be discerned, with most star-forming regions like these having similar structures. For instance most nebulae have a group of newly born young stars as an open cluster inside the nebula. The stellar wind from these says blows the gas away around the cluster, forming a sort of ‘hole’ around the centre. Pillar-like formations of dust and gas also point to a source of stellar wind. Metsävainio processes all of this information in a process he likens to ‘sculpting’ and then comes up with the resulting animation, which is ‘always an approximate reality’. Above is the California Nebula, an emission nebula in the constellation Perseus . The Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant 1,470 light-years away, is seen here . He continues: ‘Astronomical imaging is a passion of mine! ‘All aspects of art, science and technique are needed for a good photo. ‘Even though my images fulfil rules of scientific imaging, this is an art form and a self-expression channel for me. ‘There is so much beauty around us, hidden from our limited senses, and I enjoy being able to reveal it. Astro imaging is a form of nature imaging.’ He adds that the 3D animations help to show that astronomical objects are not like paintings in canvas but real three-dimensional forms, floating in three-dimensional space. This animation shows the Bubble Nebula, also called NGC 7635 .","A Finnish astrophotographer has created 3D animations of nebulae .

"Koala populations face a new threat - from a zip line thrill ride which is being proposed to attract more visitors to a Queensland national park if it goes ahead. Trees in Obi Obi Gorge that will to be used to hold up the high-flying attraction located in the Sunshine Coast hinterland's Kondalilla National Park are koala habitats, environmentalists say. National Parks Association of Queensland executive coordinator Paul Donatiu said the steel platforms needed to hold up the adventure ride and clearing vegetation to make way for the cables would hurt the habitat and rare bird species. Koala populations could be threatened by a proposed zip line in the Sunshine Coast hinterland's Kondalilla National Park in Queensland . 'This government is ignoring its duty of care to conserve rare species in our national parks, including koalas, in the name of adrenaline tourism,' he said. The warning comes after Queensland's tourism minister, Jann Stuckey, named Australian Zip Line Canopy Tours as the project's preferred proponent. 'The hinterland business community recognises that a zipline attraction would draw more visitors and revitalise the region, which would have flow on economic benefits to the broader community,' she said. Sunshine Coast tourism operators have welcomed the proposal. Hinterland tourism president Christine Kardash said the  zip line attract more people to the park. The zip line will be located in Kondalilla National Park. The route at the park's Obi Obi Gorge is mapped out on the right. According to Sunshine Coast Destinations Limited, the zip line would create 50 full-time jobs and generate more than $3 million a year for the area. It has been reported the zip-line would affect less than 0.3% of the Kondalilla National Park. 'I do think the opportunity to pass through the forest at a new ""level"" without actually touching the ground will be a huge drawcard,' Mr Kardash told the Hinterland Times in March. But Mr Donatiu said the zipline, which would be a first for any Australian national park, would attract the wrong kind of visitor. 'A key aspect of ecotourism is that the tourism activity leads or adds to the conservation of the ecosystem in which it operates,' he said. 'The inclusion of an environmental educational component in the proposed zip line will do little for the national park itself, particularly as research overseas shows a strong indication that tour guests are impatient for the thrill of the ride.' Australian Zip Line Canopy Tours have been invited to submit a more detailed proposal to show environmental checks have been incorporated into the planning, design and operation of the project and explain its financial benefits. Koalas live mostly on the east coast of Australia, where eucalypt varieties they eat are more common . The zip line is expected to create more than 50 full-time jobs and provide $3 million a year for the area .","Trees used to support zip line are habitats of koalas and rare bird species .

"Chinese police destroyed £21 million of counterfeit designer goods today in a lavish publicity stunt aimed at showing the world they are cracking down on the illegal trade. Fake wine, cigarettes, handbags and cosmetics were all thrown on a fire in Guiyang, southwest China's Guizhou Province. But authorities have a long way to go - a recent UN report revealed a staggering 75 per cent of all fake goods seized worldwide from 2008 to 2010 were primarily from China. Fake: Chinese police destroyed £21million of counterfeit designer goods today in a lavish publicity stunt aimed at showing the world they are cracking down on the trade . Destroyed: China is the largest source of counterfeit goods, according to a UN report . Most of the counterfeit trade sourced from East Asia ends up in the United States and Europe. A high percentage of items are purchased on the internet. Shippers sometimes route deliveries through . ports in the Middle East or Africa to avoid detection by customs. Most counterfeits fall into four categories: CDs and DVDs; accessories, watches and footwear; tobacco products; and textiles. Gucci handbags retail between £500 -£3,390 in stores. But fake versions can be picked up for around £15-£30. Rayban sunglasses usually sell for £100, but they fake reproductions can be bought for as little as £4. London boroughs and county councils prosecuted 372 people for the sale of counterfeit electrical goods in 2009. That figure dropped to 245 last year. In the past four years there has been a . six-fold increase in the number of counterfeit electrical goods seized . in the UK in the last four years, according to a report. The value of seized counterfeit . electrical items has risen from £2,614,783 in 2009 to £15,725,462 in . 2012, according to figures obtained by The Co-operative Electrical from . local councils and Border Force, the arm of the Home Office responsible . for border control operations. The World Customs Organisation also said . the booming industry accounts for some two per cent of world trade . despite it being considered a 'soft' form of crime. The UN report stated that counterfeit goods accounted for one third of the organised crime in East Asia and the . Pacific is worth approximately $90bn (£58bn). Most counterfeits fall into four categories: CDs and DVDs; accessories, watches and footwear; tobacco products; and textiles. Counterfeit commerce over the Internet . has soared in the past couple of years, turning what had been an . irritant to businesses into a serious competitive threat. Last year an entire city in China literally shut up shop when nearly all . of its stores closed after it was falsely reported that officials were . planning a clampdown on the sale of counterfeit products. Officials in Shenyang city were forced to beg store owners to reopen after 95 per cent of shops remain closed. The online rumour sparked fears that . the local council needed to get more revenue and had ordered taxmen to . come down hard on shop owners. Western countries have often complained China is woefully behind in its effort to stamp out the trade, although it has started to crack down. Domination: Nearly 75 percent of counterfeit products seized worldwide from 2008 to 2010 were made in east Asia, and China was the primary producer . In July 2011, the Chinese government concluded a nine-month enforcement drive, leading to the arrests of more than 9,000 suspects in connection with the seizure of £34 million worth of counterfeit products . In November police arrested 73 people suspected of manufacturing and selling almost 1 million fake luxury bags in China. The Ministry of Public Security said . police seized more than 20,000 fake Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Coach bags . and closed 37 sites where the forgery ring made or sold the bags. Police said the ring sold more than 960,000 bags and exported many to the United States and Middle East. The ministry said that police in . southern Guangdong province uncovered the forgery ring in January 2012 . and that Chinese agents worked with U.S. customs and immigration . officials in the case. It said authorities seized assets . worth 5 billion yuan (£52million), including unsold counterfeit goods, . production equipment and bank accounts. Another series of raids took place in July 2012 across 190 cities - the products seized were valued at £117 million. More than 2,000 people were arrested and 1,100 facilities were destroyed.","UN report: China is the largest source of counterfeit goods in the world .

"London's notoriously windy weather almost got the better of the Countess of Wessex as she arrived at Westminster Abbey for the Queen's coronation celebrations. Sporting a stunning white lace dress . with a scalloped hem by favourite designer, Bruce Oldfield, and a beautiful white picture hat by milliner, Jane Taylor, the Countess looked elegant, although she struggled to keep her headgear in place. But despite the unhelpful breeze, the wife of Prince Edward looked in good spirits as she made her way into the cathedral alongside her cheerfully grinning husband. Scroll down for video . Elegant: A windswept Sophie Wessex arrives at Westminster Abbey accompanied by Prince Edward . The white stuff: The Countess joined the Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen and plumped for a pale frock . The royal couple were accompanied by . their nine-year-old daughter, Lady Louise Windsor, and their nieces, . Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Their five-year-old son, Viscount Severn, was not at the Abbey but the rest of the the senior royals and crowned heads from all over Europe did make an appearance. Like the Countess of Wessex, both the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Cornwall plumped for pale, summery shades as did Princess Michael of Kent. The Queen, too, wore a suit made from ivory jacquard - the same colour in which she was crowned 53 years ago, as did her daughter, Princess Anne. Two who chose more formal, dark colours were the princesses, Beatrice and Eugenie, who looked elegant in navy blue and teal dresses. Stylish: The Countess has reinvented herself in recent years and is now one of the most fashionable royals . Excited: Little Lady Louise Windsor looked thrilled to be at the Abbey and sat between her parents . For the third time this year, Sophie Wessex appeared in a hat by milliner, Jane Taylor (pictured right). For the Commonwealth memorial service, for the royal family's trip to church on Easter Sunday and now for the coronation celebrations at Westminster Abbey, the Countess chose creations by the Fulham-based milliner, who has been designing for just five years. So just who is Jane Taylor? First launched in 2008, the designer began by creating one-off pieces for friends attending events such as the Henley Royal Regatta and Royal Ascot, but demand for the pieces quickly snowballed. Five years on, the designer now creates bespoke hats for a veritable who's who of royal and jetset clients, as well as releasing three ready-to-wear collections per year.

"Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has defended the club's decision to sell Angel di Maria to Manchester United this summer, claiming the Argentina star's  style of play sometimes hindered his side. Di Maria moved to Old Trafford for a British record £60million fee in August after helping Real seal their 10th European crown last term. The 26-year-old played an integral role in their triumph in Lisbon but Ancelotti believes the midfielder's knack of 'losing control' at times, when in possession, meant the sale was justified.

Speaking in an interview with Onda Cero, Ancelotti said: 'Di Maria could take matches by storm with his energy, but he also used to lose control sometimes, misplacing important passes. 'People should think twice before saying that James can fill Di Maria's boots, because they're very different players.'

"The lunar dirt brought back by mankind's first moonwalkers contained an abundance of titanium, platinum and other valuable minerals. But our satellite also contains a substance that could be of even greater use to civilisation – one that could revolutionise energy production. It's called helium 3 and has been dumped on the moon in vast quantities by solar winds. Helium 3, scientists argue, could power clean fusion plants. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay's worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. Pictured are the stages in getting the material back to Earth . Now China is looking to mine the moon for the rare helium isotope that some scientists claim could meet global energy demand far into the future, according to a report in The Times. Professor Ouyang Ziyuan, the chief scientist of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, recently said, the moon is 'so rich' in helium 3, that this could 'solve humanity's energy demand for around 10,000 years at least.' Helium 3, scientists argue, could power clean fusion plants. It is nonradioactive and a very little goes a very long way. For instance, two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. Helium . 3 is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and . one neutron. It is abundant in the moon's soil after being dumped there . by solar winds. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about . 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the . current rate of energy consumption . An artist's impression of what mining in space.  In this image hot gases are seen flowing through chambers . Helium 3 (He-3) is a light, non-radioactive isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron. Its presence is rare on Earth, but it is sought after for use in nuclear fusion research. It is also used in MRI scanners and in sensors to detect smuggled plutonium. Helium 3 is abundant in the moon's soil by at least 13 parts per billion (ppb) by weight. The gas, he estimates, has a potential economic value of $3 billion (£1.78 billion) a tonne, making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon. According to experts in the U.S., the total estimated cost for fusion development, rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $20 billion (£11.8 billion) over two decades. Two fully-loaded Space Shuttle cargo bay’s worth - about 40 tonnes worth - could power the United States for a year at the current rate of energy consumption. This would require mining an areas the size of Washington, D.C. This would require mining an areas the size of Washington, D.C. The isotope is so rare on the Earth because our atmosphere and magnetic field prevent any of the solar helium 3 from arriving on the surface. The moon doesn't have this problem as there is nothing to prevent helium 3 being absorbed by the lunar soil. Fabrizio Bozzato, a doctoral candidate at the University of Tamkan in Taiwan, recently wrote in World Security Network that helium 3 could be extracted by heating the lunar dust to around 600°C, before bringing it back to the Earth. The gas, he estimates, has a potential economic value of $3 billion (£1.78 billion) a tonne, making it economically viable to consider mining from the moon. According to experts in the U.S., the total estimated cost for fusion development, rocket development and starting lunar operations would be about $20 billion (£11.8 billion) over two decades. While China has expressed an interest, it has yet to outline concrete plans about how it would mine the moon for helium. The prospect, however, raises the controversial issue about who owns our satellite. The United Nations Outer Space Treaty, signed by China, suggests that lunar resources are for all mankind. China is hoping to mine helium 3 from the moon. The scenarios sounds like science fiction, and has been depicted in Hollywood through films such as the 1998 blockbuster Armageddon starring Bruce Willis . Private groups are also interested in using fuel from the moon by mining water rather than helium . However, legal experts claim the language is ambiguous enough to allow for commercial exploitation of the moon. In a recent paper, Mr Bozzato said: 'China appears determined to make [lunar mining] a reality of tomorrow. 'China maintains its lunar mining would be for the benefit of all humanity,' he added. 'However, given the absence of willful competitors, it is also speculated that the Chinese intend to establish a helium 3 monopoly.' Private enterprise is also interested in using fuel from the moon – although possibly by extracting water rather than helium 3. The Shackleton Energy company envisages providing propellant for missions throughout the solar system using lunar water. Some teams vying for the Google Lunar X-Prize also see mining as an ultimate goal of their landers. ESA has also considered using the Moon to help missions farther into the Solar System. Arguments have also been made for mining Helium-3 from Jupiter, where it is much more abundant – it would need to be given the distances involved. Extracting the molecule from Jupiter would also be a less power-hungry process.","Helium 3 in dumped on moon's surface in vast quantities by solar winds .

"British cyclist Sir Chris Hoy's spectacular Olympic gold medal win is now marred with controversy after a teammate said he deliberately fell in an earlier round because he was losing.

Despite the claims, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Britain's gold medal would stand. Asked if they would look at the . result, IOC communications director Mark Adams said: 'At present there . are no plans to do so. Our view is that people were not deprived of a . contest. 'I have spoken to . the Union Cycliste Internaionale (UCI) and they are obviously aware of . the situation. At at this stage they don't see any reason to question . the result and neither do we.' Tumble: Hindes later said that his fall was 'all planned, really' The British team was allowed to restart the qualifier after German-born Philip Hindes crashed seconds into the race. The trio went on to post a world record time and later won the final against France. Hindes, 19, suggested the crash was part of a deliberate ploy because the British team had made a poor start.

'But the best team won, they beat the . world record twice, they deserved their victory. They played with the . rules. When you crash in the team sprint, it's considered as a false . start.' Last night, British Cycling categorically denied the fall was any part of a plan and said Hindes's comments were 'lost in translation' from a man who began learning English only after moving to Manchester from his native Germany two years ago.

"Thieves cut a large rectangle hole out of an expensive jewellery store window in the middle of the afternoon to steal around 100 diamond rings, before they fled on motorbikes. The burglary took just over a minute while customers and staff were still inside Griffin's Jewellers in Prospect Street in Bridlington, north Yorkshire and the street was busy. Steve Gregory, manager of the store, estimates around £400,000 worth of jewellery was stolen in the raid. He said the three thieves, all wearing helmets, fled on motorbikes after the shop's automatic shutters came down. Customers and staff at a nearby pub then started to chase them. Scroll down for video . A large  rectangle was cut out of the front window of Griffin's Jewellers in Bridlington in the daytime while customers were inside before thieves fled with around 100 diamond rings, estimated to be worth £400,000 . Mr Gregory said: 'We have quite a high staff level, so it's very difficult for anyone to attempt anything inside, which is why we think they went for the window. 'Staff were shaken but fortunately no one was hurt. 'It was all captured on CCTV and probably  was over in about a minute and 10 seconds before our automatic shutter came down.' The theft took place shortly before the store was due to close at 5pm on Monday, which meant there were more staff than normal on the shop floor. After the thieves fled with their haul glass, rings and other jewellery were left scattered on the pavement. Due to the high value of items in the shop customers can only gain entry by ringing a doorbell. Grffins Jewellers sells clocks and jewellery and is in the top 100 UK Jewellers and is back open for business . The thieves fled on motorbikes, leaving rings, glass and other jewellery scattered on the Bridlington pavement . The business sells jewellery and clocks and is officially listed in the top 100 UK Jewellers. Mr Gregory, who has worked for the company for 38 years, said this was the first time a raid had happened during the day. He said the last time the store was burgled was 20 years ago during the night, and thieves made off with less of a haul. He added: 'Fortunately we had the high staff levels at the end of the day and a high security locking system. 'The very nature of the trade that we are in means we very conscious of security. It happened so quickly and unexpectedly but some customers in the store and at the Half Moon pub opposite gave chase. It was a very valiant effort.' Mr Gregory said the store was still open for business on Tuesday and they were now considering how to get an even faster automatic shutter locking system for the window. The huge square was cut out shortly before the jewellery store was due to close for the day at 5pm on Monday . A 48-year-old man, who did not wish to give his name, was at the scene shortly after it happened. He said: 'It looked like a real professional job. 'The window was cut in a perfect square and it looks as though the glass was lifted out - all done while the shop was still open. 'Griffin is a well known jeweller in Bridlington and sells high-class jewellery.' Jenni Hird said: 'I drove by at about 5.30pm and there were police outside and a lot of people there having a look. 'I was gob smacked at how clean the cut looked and the fact whoever did this had the balls to do it during opening hours, when the street will probably have been busy with people going past. 'There must have been quite a few people there. 'It must all have been over very quickly. 'It is madness.'

An interactive map shows coverage hotspots throughout the UK on key networks - EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Click below to explore network coverage in your region . Phone owners can check the strength of coverage in their area before committing to a new contract using a new interactive map that shows coverage hotspots throughout the UK on key networks including EE, O2, Three and Vodafone. Online phone retailer Mobiles.co.uk is hosting the tool, which was created by  OpenSignal based on data crowdsourced from users of the its app which helps users find better mobile phone signal in real-time . For example, the map shows that Three has the best 3G and 4G coverage in Scotland with an average 4G download speed of 3.91Mbps. But at the other end of the country, in the south west of England, Vodafone has the best coverage for 3G and 4G with an average 4G download speed of 24.41Mbps. The map also shows how variable areas can be. EE has the best 3G and 4G coverage in Greater London, with an average download speed of 19.33Mbps. It was created using crowd sourced data from OpenSignal's app and is now being offered as a tool by online phone retailer Mobiles.co.uk. London calling: This map shows 3G and 4G mobile coverage across the networks for Greater London. It also reveals that EE has the best 3G and 4G coverage in Greater London, with an average download speed of 19.33Mbps . According to the map, the average 4G speed is currently 14.7Mbps, with the strongest signal, as expected, in the country’s largest cities. But significant rural areas of Northern England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, however, receive weaker signal with slower speeds. Leading the way for coverage is EE, which covers 75 per cent of the UK population over 300 towns and cities and offers the best overall performance. Although there was a slow roll out of 4G networks and infrastructure between mid-2013 and 2014, competition between networks has led to a faster spread of 4G technology, coverage and a wider choice of plans for consumers. These 4G plans have led to competitive promotion of 4G from major retailers, offering budget smartphones with LTE capabilities from £10 per month. for example. And speeds are expected to increase. This portion of the map shows network coverage for Scotland and the North East of England. Three has the best 3G and 4G coverage for this area with an average 4G download speed of 3.91Mbps . The uptake in 4G use has risen dramatically across the UK within the last year. Sales data gathered from the retailer shows that only 2 per cent of consumers were purchasing 4G contracts in April 2013, compared to an average of 85 per cent in 2014. The expectation is that next year, 4G will be the only option offered in new contracts and upgrades, with 3G only used when 4G connectivity is not available. However, despite its growing popularity, UK performance is yet to match the average speeds of other countries, such as Australia, which has an average of 24.5Mbps. This is closely followed by Brazil, Hong Kong and Italy, which all have averages of 22Mbps. Using advanced settings (pictured) it is possible to see the average speeds available in certain areas for different networks. This screenshot shows that Three has the best coverage in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire with an average 3G speed of 3.9Mbps . 4G is growing in popularity in the UK and it is predicted that contracts will only offer 4G connectivity as soon as next year. According to the map, the average 4G speed is currently 14.7Mbps. However, UK performance is yet to match the average speeds of other countries, such as Australia, which has an average of 24.5Mbps. This is closely followed by Brazil, Hong Kong and Italy, which all have averages of 22Mbps. Brazil’s Claro network offers the fastest speed at 27.8Mbps, over 5Mbps faster than UK’s EE, which reaches up to 22.7Mbps. South Korea provides the most coverage to users with a 91 per cent average, compared to the UK’s average of 56 per cent. Sweden’s Tele2 network offers the best coverage by individual network with 98 per cent, compared to UK’s EE which provides LTE coverage to 75 per cent of UK population . South Korea recently introduced ‘LTE Advanced’ mobile broadband, which itself offers download speeds of up to 225Mbps, and the UK can expect to see this technology rolled out in 2015. In the UK, EE is switching to live 4G+ and Vodafone’s own version of 4.5G, is being rolled out with expectations that speeds will reach 90Mbps. EE has been testing the improved technology since late 2013, and expansion across key UK cities is expected over the next year, while Vodafone has already launched 4.5G across sites in Birmingham, London and Manchester, with further expansion of the network expected into 2015. Jay Karsandas, Digital Manager at Mobiles.co.uk, said: “Despite a slow start, the UK has made significant progress in the provision and speed of 4G.

"Wakar Akhtar, 21 and his uncle Azad Raja are among four men accused of raping the woman in Bradford . A school teacher was raped by two men on a park bench - after she fell asleep in a mini cab and was taken to a park, a court has heard. The unconscious woman is alleged to have passed out after drinking at a birthday celebration before she came round to find one of her the men having sex with her. Now four men are standing trial at Bradford Crown Court accused of conspiracy to rape between May 25 and 26 this year. Private hire driver Tamseel Virk, 42; Azad Raja, 38, his nephew Wakar Akhtar, 21, and Najeem Ul-Saeed, 31, all of Bradford, West Yorkshire, deny the charge. Prosecutor Andrew Kershaw told the jury on Monday that Virk picked up the woman from a street in Leeds, in breach of his licence, shortly before midnight on May 25. Mr Kershaw suggested the fare was not reported to Virk's controller because he had identified a vulnerable woman who could be sexually exploited. The court heard she was 'noticeably affected' after drinking lager and whisky in a pub with friends. She was 'talking gibberish' and left her jacket, handbag and phone behind. Mr Kershaw said Virk 'delivered' her to Akhtar and Raja, getting her to commit a sex act on him on the way. The jury heard she was dropped off near their home and raped in turn on a bench in Great Horton Park, Bradford, while she was unconscious. 'They manhandled her, causing bruises and minor injuries to both of her knees, as if she were put in a kneeling position on the ground,' Mr Kershaw said. She is said to have come round while Raja was having sex with her. Akhtar is alleged to have told her he had already had sex with her. Mr Kershaw said DNA evidence supported the woman's evidence that sexual activity took place with both men. He has also alleged that Ul-Saeed then turned up 'too late physically to join in the rape that he had set up'. 'The prosecution case is that there was a conspiracy to rape (the woman) while she was in no fit state either to consent or resist,' Mr Kershaw said. He continued: 'Akhtar and Raja conspired to rape her because they both agreed to do so; to take delivery of her and rape her together in each other's presence. 'Virk, the prosecution say, is part of the same agreement because he delivered the girl to Akhtar and Raja for them to rape her. 'Virk knew that she was in no fit state to consent or resist because he had been able to abduct her to Great Horton Park, rather than take her home. 'Ul-Saeed is also part of the same agreement because he trafficked her from Virk to Akhtar and arranged where and to whom she was to be delivered; he tried to organise a hotel room and attended at the park to join in but was too late because she had regained consciousness by then.' Akhtar, pictured, is accused of telling the woman that she had already had sex with him when she came around on a Bradford park bench while she was allegedly being raped by Raja, who also denies the claim . The schoolteacher said she was 'absolutely mortified' to realise she had been raped by two men on a park bench after falling unconscious on a night out. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said it was 'like a massive bad dream' after claiming she had been 'abducted' and taken by a taxi driver to a park bench in Bradford, West Yorkshire, where she was raped by him and his friends. Giving evidence at Bradford Crown Court earlier today, the woman said: 'I was absolutely mortified but I just could not deal with it. 'This isn't the way I would behave normally, in the morning it was just like a massive bad dream. 'I'm a decent person and I would never want to do this to anyone. I like to be in control.' The jury heard that the educated woman, who teaches secondary school students, had gone on a birthday celebration to Leeds, West Yorks., over the May bank holiday earlier this year, with a group of friends. After becoming heavily intoxicated, she had become separated from friends and made her way to Leeds Station, where she bought herself some fast food. It was from there that the jury was shown CCTV of her getting into the first of three taxis she hired to get her home, but she claims she doesn't remember anything until she woke up on a park bench in Bradford. Under cross examination at Bradford Crown Court, pictured,  the woman denied that it was 'sex between consenting adults' claiming that the incident on May 25-26  was 'life-destroying' Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said: 'I just can't believe it. I was on my own and I think I must have just blacked out. 'I like to drink and I like to socialise but in terms of sleeping with men on a park bench, that's totally out of character for me. 'I got back home, went to the top of the stairs and went to bed.' The following morning, the woman said she woke early and phoned her partner of four years to inform her of the events from the night before. She said: 'I said to her 'I had sex last night with four Asian men'. I was really, really drunk and needed to get back. 'My elbows were swollen, my chest hurt and my knees were grazed. I felt sick and I was gagging. 'I wasn't going to tell my parents. I was still slightly drunk when I woke up.' The jury heard that after leaving Leeds, the woman took a taxi to Cookridge, West Yorkshire, but asked to be dropped off in nearby Headingley. She then got into another taxi and ended up being taken to Great Horton Park in Bradford,  where she alleges the sexual assault took place. 'I felt scared when I was on the park bench,' she said. 'There were these two guys talking in a different language and I thought what is going on? 'I don't know how I got from the pub into the taxi. 'I remember having a conversation with the taxi driver about my bag and my phone as I had lost them. 'It would be out of character for me to bring the conversation round to the subject of sex. 'It's 1000 per cent not in my character to do something like this.' The court heard the woman made three cash withdrawals on the night, totalling more than £80, as well as spending over £60 on drinks in a Leeds city centre bar. The woman said: 'I don't recall buying anyone a spirit but I recall buying those £1 shots that you buy in those plastic glasses. 'I can't remember withdrawing the cash. The only thing I remember is thinking I needed to pay the third taxi driver.' Mr Elyas Singh, defending Akhtar, said: 'I'm going to suggest to you that what happened in Great Horton Park in the early hours of 26 May, Bank Holiday Monday, was not rape in any sense of the word. 'It was sex between consenting adults, all of whom were active, voluntary and an enthusiastic part of what went on. 'I suggest that it was you that in fact instigated the sex and you positively encouraged it. There's no secret or mystery to it. 'Are you crying rape because you regret what happened? Is that what all this was about?' The woman added: 'This is the most humiliating experience of my life. I knew what this would entail. 'If I wanted it to happen, I would never have mentioned it. 'It was life-destroying. I never expected anything like this to happen to me.' The trial, which is expected to last ten days, continues. All of the men deny all of the charges.

"Cesc Fabregas celebrated his first goal in a Chelsea shirt as Jose Mourinho's men eased to victory in their pre-season friendly against Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem. Diego Costa supplied Mohamed Salah for the first after three minutes. The Spain striker was later involved in a heated exchange with Vitesse captain Guram Kashia. But he composed himself to lay on a second-half assist for Nemanja Matic. Host commentator . It's all over in Holland as Chelsea win the game 3-1 thanks to goals from Salah, Fabregas and Matic. Costa stood out once again as he bagged two assists while Petr Cech laid down a marker as Thibaut Courtois watched on. Cesc Fabregas will be pleased to get off the mark in a blue shirt after a delightful 25-yard free-kick put the Blues 2-0 ahead in the first half. And the home side have a late consolation goal as Djurdjevic finds space in the box to head past Beeney. 84mins: Torres is still toiling away at the top, but can't get onto a through ball from Boga. The Chelsea youngsters are on now and have been keeping the ball well. Six minutes to play! 81mins: That ends a brilliant night for Costa, who had a hand in all three goals - setting up two and winning the free-kick which Fabregas hit home. 79mins: More changes for Chelsea as Costa, Cahill and Matic make way for Boga, Zouma and Solanke. Fabregas has also left the field and Baker gets in on the action . And now Matic has his first goal in a Chelsea shirt after another brilliant bit of play from Costa. Vitesse's defence was nowhere to be seen as Costa burst through before laying the ball off to his right for Matic to do the rest. 72mins: Van Ginkel is getting some (hopefully) precautionary treatment on the right knee that he injured so badly last season. Shouldn't be anything to worry about for Chelsea fans. Mike Dickson: On comes the wonderfully named Marvelous Nakamba, who has just signed for Vitesse after a trial. Marvelous Nakamba is from Zimbabwe, a country which once had a tennis player called Genius Ndzwike (he wasn’t). 66mins: Former Vitesse star Van Ginkel makes way for Oriol Romeu. The Dutch youngster gets a huge reception from the home fans . The Dutch side have rung the change now as both Chelsea loanees, Traore and Wallace, leave the field. 61mins: Labyad hits the crossbar for Vitesse with a spectacular 30-yard effort from out in the left wing. Cech, who has been brilliant, could have done nothing about that strike. 58mins: Costa should have just put Chelsea into a 3-0 after running through on goal, but substitute keeper Velthuizen was equal to his left-footed strike. The ball rebounded back out to Torres who couldn't quite turn the ball back towards goal. 55mins: Costa has moved over to the left in what seems to be a move to get Torres into the game and give the Spaniard a chance to shine in his rightful position. Costa, however, is still seeing more of the ball as he chests down yet another crossfield pass from Ivanovic. 54mins: Jose Mourinho calls to Chelsea midfielder and says, 'Matic, control the ball' as he demands that his side start to dictate play once again. 50mins: There was a counter-attack on for Chelsea as Torres galloped forward but the striker over-hit his pass to Salah and the chance was missed. Mike Dickson: Didier Drogba reappeared after half time with a baseball cap on back to front saying ‘Sorry I’m Fresh’. Not bad for 36. We're back underway in Holland as Chelsea go on the attack with Fernando Torres. That's right... he is playing! The attack comes to nothing as the Spaniard is blocked. No wholesale changes for Chelsea, but John Terry will come on in place of Filipe Luis meaning Cesar Azpilicueta will go out to left-back for the second half. Mike Dickson: The close relationship between these clubs is the subject of much conjecture but this has been pretty competitive and there could have been more goals. Salah could have scored a hat-rick but has faded after a bright start, Torres anonymous. Costa formidable. Player who has caught the eye from Vitesse is attacking midfielder Kelvin Leerdam. You doubt this will stay 2-0. And that's the end of the first half as it ends 2-0 to the Blues. Chelsea have been excellent going forward as goals from Mo Salah and Cesc Fabregas put Jose Mourinho's side in the driving seat. 44mins: Chelsea loanee Wallace goes down after a tackle from Luis, but there was no foul there. The Brazilian defender grabbed his face as he feigned injury for Vitesse. That's not the right way to impress Mourinho. 41mins: Cech saves again. This time from a Vejinovic free-kick. The Blues stopper doesn't seem in the mood to let any goals in this evening. Particularly with Courtois waiting in the wings... 37mins: Cech is forced into another save with as Leerdam goes through on goal. The Blues skipper sticks out a left leg to keep the score at 2-0. Mike Dickson: If I was Jose Mourinho looking at my two loanees to Vitesse I would be much more impressed so far with Bertrand Traore, who has looked pretty lively, than with Wallace. The Brazilian, playing wing back, has been caught out of positioin a couple of times and has not made much happen down the right. But it can’t be an easy game for either. 33mins: That second Chelsea came after some brilliant work by Costa as he ran through the Vitesse defence before being fouled. The Brazil-born striker showed another glimpse of what he's all about. Pace, power and aggression. Three things that Chelsea fans have been missing since the departure of a certain Didier Drogba. Mike Dickson: That was nearly a severe embarrassment for Petr Cech, who had looked rock solid up until that botched clearance. The crowd, which is [probably more like 20,000 after a late influx, have got defalted after Vitesse looked far more composed following the shaky start. Friendly or not, one thing pretty evident already is that Diego Costa is not someone to be messed with. And Fabregas curls the resulting free-kick home from 25-yards. He has his first goal in a Chelsea shirt and what a way to start! 20mins: The game has settled down now as Vitesse go on the attack with Vako, but Cahill is there to clear the danger. At the other end, Diego Costa has got into a bit of a scrap after being fouled just outside the Vitesse box. It may be a pre-season friendly, but you wouldn't want to argue with the Chelsea striker... 15mins: Vitesse seemed to be causing their own problems here as they insist on playing the ball around the back and forcing the passes back to their goalkeeper Room. Matic has started brilliantly, breaking up play and laying on the ball for Costa for the first goal. 11mins: It's been a brilliant start from Chelsea as they continue to press Vitesse after scoring the early goal. As I write though, Vako has just forced Blues keeper Petr Cech into a brilliant save. The Georgian found space and struck a powerful effort with his right foot which Cech was equal to. Thibaut Courtois, who is in the Chelsea dugout, will have enjoyed that one. Mike Dickson: The smoke from the flares at the start barely had time to clear before that notably unselfish bit of play from Diego Costa to put Salah in and the Egyptian nearly added to it a minute later. Not much sign of Vitesse from the home defenders so far. Chelsea are in the lead after just four minutes as Diego Costa runs through on goal before sliding the ball to the onrushing Salah who taps into an empty net. We're underway at the GelreDome as Chelsea start with the ball. Mike Dickson: Slightly surreal start to the evening as the stewardess in the press area asks me if I am the bloke who presents Match of the Day back in England (I am not). A pleasant evening in the East of Holland with a cluster of about 250 Chelsea fans in their own corner. Quite a smattering of Chelsea fans all over the ground, reinforcing the close relationship between these two clubs. The Gelredome is a nicely appointed stadium seating 26,000 but looks like it will be about 10,000 short of capacity tonight. Chelsea look set to offload Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku for a fee of £25million. The striker had been expected to join up with Jose Mourinho's side on Wednesday afternoon but he is now flying to England from Belgium to seal a five-year, £75,000-a-week deal with the Toffees. Click here to read more... So, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has opted to start with both Fernando Torres and Diego Costa in the Blues line-up. Chelsea's £32m signing Costa will be hoping to add to his impressive start in a blue shirt which saw him bag a goal on his non-competitive debut. Tonight's clash comes too soon for Didier Drogba to make his second Chelsea debut as the Ivorian has just two days of training under his belt but Blues fans will be able to catch another glimpse of new signings Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis. Hello and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of the pre-season friendly clash between Chelsea and Vitesse Arnhem.

"A desperate mother has been told by a top judge that her teenage son cannot live with her because she is an advocate of home schooling. The mother-of-four, in her 50s, says her son is being 'deprived of his liberty' by being forced to attend a conventional school. She told London's Appeal Court she had home-schooled the disabled teenager for 10 years, along with two of her other children. A judge at the Appeal Court sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured) has told a mother her teenage son cannot live with her because she wants to home school him . But, after he was admitted to hospital as an in-patient in 2011, she was informed by Northamptonshire County Council that the boy would not be allowed to return to the family home - because her alternative stance on education was 'not in his best interests'. She bitterly resisted the move, saying her son - referred to as 'T' in court - is desperate to come home. But a family judge ruled earlier this year that the now 18-year-old 'lacked mental capacity to make decisions relating to his welfare'. As a result, he was placed in residential care and enrolled as a pupil at a school 100 miles away from his family home. Due to the judge's decision that the boy was unable to make important decisions for himself, he was entitled to no personal say on where he lived and how he was educated - despite being clever enough to study Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, his mother says. Challenging the decision at the Appeal Court, the mother insisted her son wanted to come home and that his views should be respected. Representing herself before top family judge, Lady Justice Black, she said her son, who has cerebral palsy, was suffering emotionally due to separation from his family as well as physically from not being cared for in the residential placement as well as he would be at home. 'I say that my son can make decisions. He can decide where he wants to live, who he wants to see and his care needs. He has a clear memory and he is an adult, not a child. At 18, he is past compulsory schooling age,' she told the judge . She added outside court that her son's intellectual gifts far outweigh his physical abilities, to the extent that he was 'studying Shakespeare last year.' Lady Justice Black said: 'There is a question over whether the mother would enable T to obtain education. 'The mother doesn't fully support schooling and the judge had no confidence that she would ensure that T had his last year at school. 'The mother says the judge misinterpreted the Mental Capacity Act and placed too much emphasis on her son going to school. 'She argues it is wrong to force T to attend school now, after he has passed compulsory schooling age, and says that her son is being deprived of his liberty by being required to attend school, and that it is not in his best interests to do so.' But, dismissing the mother's challenge, she added: 'The judge concluded that the education was good for him, was in his best interests and that he was happy at school. T's time at school is extremely important, educationally and socially. 'The benefits of the schooling outweigh the difficulties of the placement in his current home. To attend his current school he has to live nearby, which meant staying in his current placement, even if there were shortcomings'. Dashing the mother's hopes of her son coming home to live with her, Lady Justice Black concluded: 'The judge was entitled to come to the conclusions that he did and I cannot identify any reasonable prospect of success on appeal.' Outside court, the mother said she would fight on, adding: 'Home schooling is a better method to meet individual needs. 'We have home schooled him for 10 years. My son is a unique individual and his cognitive ability far outweighs his physical abilities. 'He was learning Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet last year - how does that fit in with him not having capacity to make his own decisions?'","Mother, in her 50s, home-schooled the teenager for 10 years .

"On Monday, Mexican officials tried to respond to public horror at the disappearance of 43 students at the hands of a city police force on September 26. On Friday, officials said members of a drug gang based in Guerrero - the state where Acapulco is located - had confessed to killing the students and burning their bodies, leaving only charred fragments of bones and teeth. But supporters of the missing students, refusing to believe they are dead, continued protests on Monday, building on demonstrations that have blocked major highways and set government buildings ablaze in recent weeks. On Monday, relatives and supporters battled federal police in Acapulco, then blocked roads leading to the Pacific resort's airport, forcing tourists to trudge for a half-mile (a kilometer) to the terminal. Many then had to make the same hike back after finding the airport closed. Scroll down for video . Where are they?

Tense: On Monday, relatives and supporters battled federal police in Acapulco, then blocked roads leading to the Pacific resort's airport . 'We are carrying out a symbolic closures of the airport,' said protest leader Felipe de la Cruz, who said outgoing flights would be blocked for a couple of hours to press demands that the government find the students. Protesters had left and roads reopened by later afternoon. The airport returned to normal operations around 3.30pm, said security supervisor Rafael Fajardo. He added that flights were on time. Sixteen police officers reportedly suffered injuries, according to The Guardian. The airport opened again after three hours, the newspaper reported. 'We are now going back to [Normal de Ayotzinapa] to see what we organize next,' de la Cruz said, according to The Guardian. 'We are not going to sit back and do nothing.'

Disguised: Multiple protesters wore face coverings in the crowd . Assembled: The police in Acapulco carried riot shields as protesters gathered . Open again: Protesters had left and roads leading to the airport reopened by later afternoon . President Enrique Pena Nieto's government, which had seen smooth sailing through its first year and a half in office, is suddenly listing in the face of multiple crises. The administration scrambled Monday to respond to growing questions about the family's multi-million-dollar mansion owned by a government contractor, even as it tried to calm the continuing protests over the disappearance - and probable murder - of 43 students. The president has tried to shift Mexico's focus away from a bloody fight against organized crime to a series of political and economic reforms his administration successfully pushed through congress. But as he attended a summit in China on Monday, Pena Nieto's aides were trying the quell doubts about what the administration called his wife's 2012 purchase of a $7 million mansion from a company that had won extensive contracts from the State of Mexico while Enrique Pena Nieto was governor. According to a story published Sunday by Aristegui Noticias, the house was built and is still owned by Ingenieria Inmobiliaria del Centro, a company belonging to Grupo Higa. Grupo Higa also owns a company that was part of the Chinese-led consortium awarded a $3.7 billion high-speed rail project this year. The consortium was the only bidder. All other competitors bowed out, saying they had been given only two months to put together an offer on the extremely complex project. Apprehended: Jose Luis Abarca, mayor of the city of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa were detained last week by Federal police. They are  accused of ordering the September 26 attacks on the students . Attack: A police officer held his hands up as he was attacked on Monday . Exchange: Masked students confront federal police outside the Acapulco airport . Delayed: Travelers walk to their terminal due to students protesting the disappearance, and probable murder, of the 43 students . But three days before the Aristegui story was published, Pena Nieto abruptly cancelled the contract, and the government announced it would take new bids in the interest of transparency. Presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez denied there was anything improper about the housing deal in which the company granted first lady Angelica Rivera a loan to buy the mansion, saying she had money from her former career as an actress. Sanchez said the property borders Rivera's existing home. 'She needed to expand her house, she bought out her neighbor, regardless of who that neighbor was,' Sanchez said. 'Why is she to blame for being the wife of the president, being successful, having savings and, forgive the expression, spending it anyway she wants?' But according to the Aristegui article, it wasn't a random purchase of a neighbor's property to expand. Rivera and Pena Nieto worked extensively with the architect, Miguel Angel Aragones, to build the home to their specifications. The plans posted on the website archdaily.com are dated October 2010 and the home is listed as being completed in 2011. Sanchez's explanation was met with much skepticism. Guarded: The protesters blocked roads leading to the Pacific resort's airport, forcing tourists to trudge for a half-mile (a kilometer) to the terminal . Travel delay: Magnolia Seguino, who lives in New Jersey, waits with her luggage behind a line of masked students blocking access to the airport . Sixteen police officers reportedly suffered injuries . According to the Aristegui article, Grupo Higa and its affiliates won more than $8 billion pesos ($600 million) in construction projects in the State of Mexico, which borders Mexico City, while Pena Nieto was governor. It said an air-charter service owned by Grupo Higa ferried Pena Nieto during his 2012 presidential campaign, while another Grupo Higa company printed campaign materials. 'It opens up a lot of questions ... If she needed a loan to buy a house, why didn't she go to a bank?' said Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope. 'When they realized it was a big government contractor, didn't that set off an alarm bell ... that a transaction like that might represent a conflict of interest?' Federico Estevez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said Pena Nieto's administration is 'just being backed into a corner' by repeated scandals. Pena Nieto began his term as the master of high-level political pacts to pass structural reforms, but made little progress on more chronic problems like corruption and violence. 'The carpet sort of has been pulled out from underneath him,' Estevez said. 'He's really good at elite consensus ... but this is no longer about that.' Pena Nieto's predecessors spent much of their terms lurching from one scandal to another, and the country's outbursts of violence threaten to erase the president's efforts to convince the world that Mexico has put the worst behind it. 'I think we are going through some difficult moments,' Sanchez said. 'I am sure we'll get through this, and that something positive has to come out of this all.'","Officials tried to respond to public horror at the disappearance of 43 teachers college students at the hands of a city police force in September .

"American aviation chiefs warned six months ago that a kind of Boeing jet similar to the Malaysian Airlines plane that has gone missing was vulnerable to a mid-air break up. As searchers headed for a possible crash site for Flight MH370, it emerged that the US Federation Aviation Authority ordered airlines to fix a potentially fatal flaw in Boeing 777 jets. The FAA reportedly warned the planes could break apart and suffer a drastic loss in cabin pressure because of cracks in the fuselage. Authorities have today insisted the plane had been 'fully serviced' and all the maintenance checks 'were in order'. The U.S. Federation Aviation Authority ordered airlines to fix a potentially fatal flaw in Boeing 777 jets, like this one and like Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which has gone missing with all 239 passengers and crew . Airlines were given until April 9 this year to 'detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage skin' beneath the passenger jets' communications antennae. Failure to do so would put the planes at risk . In an ‘airworthiness directive’ (AD) dated September 18 last year, airlines were given until April 9 this year to ‘detect and correct cracking and corrosion in the fuselage skin’ beneath the airliners' communications antennae. Failure to fix the flaw could put the aircraft at risk of ‘a rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity of the airplane,’ said the FAA. One airline reportedly found a 16 inch crack 'under the 3-bay SATCOM antenna adapter plate in the crown skin of the fuselage' on a 14-year-old airplane with approximately 14,000 total flight cycles. After this finding, the same operator inspected 42 other jets between six and 16 years old and found 'some local corrosion but no other cracking'. The  AD applied to other B777 models and not the B777-200ER, which is the model of the missing jet. Boeing is said to have claimed the two models have different antennas. The directive said the warning applied to the B777-200, -200LR, -300, -300ER and -777F series airplanes. But according to a second report the FAA said it had also determined that this unsafe condition 'is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design'. An Indonesian Airforce pilot looks out of a military surveillance airplane over the Malacca straits during a search mission for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared on Saturday en-route to Beijing . An officer aboard a Vietnamese military helicopter scours the waters in the area where the flight vanished . Experts were speculating last night that a failure to correct the flaw could possibly be behind the plan’s disappearance with 239 people on board. Analysts suggested that if the plane had lost pressure the pilots may have become disorientated and possible fly off course, leading to the confusion over its whereabouts. The FAA was not available for comment in Washington last night. But Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General at the US Department of Transportation, was reported last night as saying: ‘Boeing put out a warning back in August, and it said the 777 had a problem with fuselage cracking. ‘I wonder what didn’t get done. If this plane had a problem and it had cracking or some sort of rapid decompression and lost the ability to communicate, it would make perfect sense.’ An official points to a map at the rescue command office on Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam . The claim came as it was also reported that an IT manager from Chicago thinks he may have tracked down the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. He reportedly used  a satellite imaging website that allows people to comb vast distances. The Tomnod website allows people to work their way through satellite images square by square. One user, Mike Seberger, claimed it took him only a few minutes on Sunday to come up with a possible match. 'At first I skipped past it, thinking: ""Nah. No way I would find anything that quickly"",' Mr Seberger told CNN. 'But then I kept scrolling back to it and thinking to myself, ""It does resemble a plane"".' play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video .","FAA had ordered airlines to fix possibly fatal flaw in Boeing 777s by this April .

"Omega-3 supplements can help smokers quit the habit, according to research. Taking the fatty acid reduces the craving for nicotine, scientists found. Smokers who were given omega-3 capsules every day for a month cut their cigarette consumption by 11 per cent compared to those given dummy pills. Smokers given omega-3 capsules every day for a month cut their cigarette consumption by 11 per cent compared to those given dummy pills - this is the equivalent of about two cigarettes a day . Dr Sharon Rabinovitz Shenkar, of the University of Haifa, Israel, who carried out the research said: ‘The substances and medications used currently to help people reduce and quit smoking are not very effective and cause adverse effects that are not easy to cope with. ‘The findings of this study indicated that omega-3, an inexpensive and easily available dietary supplement with almost no side effects, reduces smoking significantly.’ Cigarette smoking is known to reduce the levels of essential fatty acids in the brain, especially that of omega-3. A deficiency in omega-3 damages the structure of nerve cells and interrupts communication between nerves in areas of the brain involved with feeling pleasure and satisfaction. These areas are essential in reward and decision-making, and are very important in addiction, so an omega-3 deficiency makes it harder for the smoker’s body to deal with its craving for another cigarette. Dr Rabinovitz Shenkar said: ‘Earlier studies have proven that an imbalance in omega-3 is also related to mental health, depression and the ability to cope with pressure and stress. Fish, particularly oily fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout . Grass-fed meat . Nuts and seeds . Sunflower and olive oils . ‘Pressure and stress, in turn, are associated with the urge to smoke. ‘It is also known that stress and tension levels rise among people who quit smoking. Despite all this, the connection between all these factors had not been studied until now.’ Researchers took 48 participants who had smoked for an average 11 years, and who consumed an average of 14 cigarettes a day, and randomly divided them into two groups. One group took a 950mg omega-3 capsule (504mg eicosapentaenoic acid – EPA – and 378mg docosahexaenoic acid – DHA – from cold-water fish) five times a day for 30 days. The other group took five placebo pills a day for the same amount of time. None of the participants knew which group they had been placed in. A deficiency in omega-3 makes the smoker's body less able to deal with cigarette cravings. Earlier studies have shown omega-3 (found in oily fish) is also related to mental health, depression and stress . After 30 days, the smokers who had taken omega-3 reduced their cigarettes by an average of two a day. This equates to an 11 per cent decrease – even though they were not asked to change their smoking habits in any way. Additionally, when their craving for nicotine was assessed – by exposing them to smoking-related images after they had abstained from smoking for two hours -  they showed a significant reduction compared to at the start of the study. Meanwhile the group receiving the placebo did not show any significant changes in their craving levels or in the number of cigarettes they smoked a day. The research was published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.","Smokers given fish oils for a month cut their cigarette consumption by 11% .
Reduction is the equivalent of about two fewer cigarettes a day .
This was compared to people given dummy pills with no omega-3 .
Smoking is known to reduce levels of omega-3 in the brain .
A deficiency in omega-3 damages the structure of nerve cells in the brain .
This interrupts communication between nerves involved with satisfaction .
Lack of omega-3 makes it hard for the smokers body to deal with cravings .
Scientists said fish oils are inexpensive and have no side effects ."
