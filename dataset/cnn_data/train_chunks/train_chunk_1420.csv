"Mariusz Krezolek: A bullying thug who used his training in the Polish Army to inflict further pain on Daniel . Bull-necked Mariusz Krezolek used his experience of a year in the Polish Army to devise punishment exercises he knew would hasten Daniel Pelka's emaciation. The powerfully-built plasterer, who worked in an automotive plant while living in Coventry, forced his starving stepson to use precious calories performing squats and other energy-sapping drills. Also a trained brick-layer, Krezolek once told a work colleague that Daniel was 'retarded' and should be sent back to his biological father in Poland. Krezolek, who boasted at work about having served jail sentences for driving offences, told the colleague in the summer of 2011: 'It's not even worth beating him because he won't feel pain as he's autistic.' In other disturbing comments, Krezolek also informed the same work-mate that Daniel was 'all f***** up' and 'a very bad person'. Born in the small town of Trzebnica in south-western Poland in June 1979, Krezolek showed not a shred of remorse during 17 hours and six minutes in the witness box. The former soldier was accused of faking tears and even grinned in the absence of the jury as he sought to minimise his role during five days of testimony. In his at times heart-breakingly callous account, Daniel's stepfather admitted he would not have subjected a child of his own to the punishments and cruelties Daniel was forced to endure. On his fourth day in the witness box, . Krezolek appeared to take pleasure from confirming he and Luczak had sex . on the eve of their arrest, two nights after Daniel died. The . following exchange then took place between Krezolek - who said Daniel . had been 'pushed to the back burner' - and prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC. Krezolek angered several jurors when he feigned distress while looking at black and white CT scans of Daniel's body . Mr Hankin: 'I am interested to know how you were able to treat a little boy in the way that you did, was it because he was not your own flesh and blood?' Krezolek: 'It happened because I simply wanted to satisfy Magda.' Mr Hankin: 'You had no respect for Daniel as a human being did you? Krezolek: 'I did.' Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time you cuddled him?' Krezolek once told a work colleague that Daniel was 'retarded' and should be sent back to his biological father in Poland . Krezolek: 'I cannot remember. He simply didn't come for cuddling.' Mr Hankin: 'You have told the jury that little boy lived in the shadow of alcoholism and violence. Who in the quiet periods needed care more than Daniel?' Krezolek: 'Of course it was needed for Daniel more than anyone else but it was the arguments that made a man simply think about something else.' Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time in life you tucked him into bed?' Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.' Mr Hankin: 'Read him a bed-time story?' Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.' Mr Hankin: 'When did you bathe him?' Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.' Mr Hankin: 'When was the last time in life you played with him?' Krezolek: 'I cannot remember.' Mr Hankin: 'This is a little boy who had been in your life for two years and you can't remember when you last tucked him in, read him a story or bathed him, or even played with him. You didn't have his best interests at heart did you?' Krezolek: 'I think you're right. Not because I didn't want to but because my head was occupied with something else.' Several jurors shook their heads in apparent disbelief as Krezolek again appeared to feign distress as he was shown haunting black-and-white CT scan images of Daniel's body. Mr Hankin asked Krezolek how he could look at the deeply distressing scans without remorse. After Krezolek claimed he was 'truly sorry' for what had happened to his stepson, Mr Hankin told him: 'You cry for yourself Mr Krezolek and not Daniel.'","Krezolek angered several jurors when he feigned distress during trial .
Admitted he would not have subjected his own children to the same abuse .

"Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said Wednesday that he was 'stunned' to hear President Barack Obama during his speech to the United Nations making an 'outrageous' comparison between a white-on-black police shooting in Missouri and a mass genocide by the ISIS terror army in Syria and Iraq. 'I was stunned,' Cheney said during a Fox News Channel interview. 'I mean, in one case you've got a police officer involved in a shooting. There may be questions about it. They'll be sorted out through the legal process.' 'There's no comparison to that with what ISIS is doing to thousands of people throughout the Middle East,' he said, 'with bloody beheadings of anybody they come in contact with.' Cheney said it's 'outrageous' to compare Ferguson with Syria 'as though somehow there's moral equivalence there' 'We have our own racial and ethnic tensions': Obama brought the August shooting in Ferguson, MIssouri into his speech condemning ISIS terrorists for a genocidal march across parts of Syria and Iraq . Michael Brown's police-shooting death followed his participation in a convenience-story robbery, but civil rights protesters descended on the town of Ferguson, Missouri to demand the cop's prosecution . Obama had said hours earlier at a UN General Assembly meeting in New York that the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri was evidence that the United States has 'our own racial and ethnic tensions.' Brown, 18, committed a strong-arm robbery at a convenience store before a physical altercation with a police officer, which turned deadly minutes later . Critics quickly jumped on Obama's comment, saying the president was drawing lines of similarity between the teen's death and the ethnic cleansing plaguing the Middle East. Richard Grenell, formerly the spokesman for America's UN mission, wrote Wednesday in an online essay that 'overstating America's issues doesn't make us relatable; it makes others' issues easily dismissable.' Obama had offered what some interpreted as an apology on the world stage for a local law-enforcement crisis that left a single man dead. 'I realize that America's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals, that America has plenty of problems within our own borders,' he told world leaders, referring to the shooting. 'In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.' Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Wednesday night that he was 'stunned' to hear President Obama bring the Ferguson, Missouri police shooting into a speech about ISIS terrorism and genocide . Fair comparison? The murderous Islamist terror group ISIS has mass-slaughtered fellow Muslims for the crime of belonging to the wrong religious sect . The case brought American race-rioters to Missouri from as far away as California and Maine. Ferguson was the scene of looting and nightly riots. Cheney appeared on the 'Hannity' program. Later in his interview, he said Obama would eventually have to heed calls for American ground troops to intervene in Iraq and Syria, where the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions in its quest for a 'caliphate' state ruled by religious extremists. The president, Cheney said, repeatedly refuses to 'accept good military advice in terms of how he actually uses the force.' In part because of that, the former VP said, the next decade will see another bloody terror attack on American soil. 'It's not just ISIS. ISIS front and center right now,' he said. 'But I believe there'll be another mass casualty attack against the United States.'","Former VP said he was 'stunned' to hear the president invoke a police shooting as evidence that the US has ethnic tensions .
Obama's move was widely slammed by critics who believe he was equating a single slain teen with victims of a mass-genocide .

"Moooove over, Ben Roethlisberger. There's a new No. 7 in western Pennsylvania.

"It was an extraordinary thing to say, akin to putting your head in the noose and stepping up on the stool beneath the gallows. Guus Hiddink, who started his second spell as Holland manager just 70 days ago on September 4, could be out of a job come Sunday night as a consequence of his own words. He has, in effect, filled out his own P45 form and is awaiting the rubber-stamp from his employer. Hiddink said of the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia in Amsterdam: 'If we lose, it makes sense that I leave.' Guus Hiddink, pictured here during Wednesday's defeat to Mexico, has said he will resign if Holland lose to Latvia in their Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night . Striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar rues another missed chance in Holland's 3-2 loss to Mexico in Amsterdam . (Left to right) Stefan de Vrij, Daley Blind, Leroy Fer and Ricardo van Rhijn leave the pitch after the defeat . (Left to right) Wesley Sneijder, Ibrahim Affelay and Daley Blind react after a fourth loss in five games . And after Wednesday night's 3-2 friendly loss to Mexico heaped even more pressure on his shoulders, Hiddink, sounding as gloomy as a man writing his own obituary, confirmed: 'Yes, I will still leave if we lose to Latvia.' Even by the standards of their recent slump - a post-World Cup hangover that has seen four defeats in five matches - Holland should beat a team ranked 99th in the world. Following Michel Platini's tinkering, expanding the tournament from 16 to 24 games and ushering through up to three teams from each qualifying group, Holland will not fail to reach the finals. But after Wednesday night, Hiddink is not as certain as he was when he made that ultimatum on himself last weekend. The odds were stacked against the former Chelsea caretaker boss from the outset. Holland were excellent at the World Cup, finishing third, and Louis van Gaal returned from Brazil and headed off to Manchester United a national hero. The way he had his team playing vibrant, attacking football was a tough act to follow and so it has proved. There had been criticism of his return in some quarters, with plenty saying Ronald Koeman should have come in. Louis van Gaal is greeted by the TV cameras and fans after Holland returned home from the World Cup . Van Gaal congratulates Robin van Persie after Holland's 5-1 rout of Spain at the World Cup . Holland's coaching team of (from left) Danny Blind, Guus Hiddink and Ruud van Nistelrooy have struggled . September 4 (Friendly) Italy 2 Holland 0 . September 9 (Euro 2016 qualifier) Czech Republic 2 Holland 1 . October 10 (Euro 2016 qualifier) Holland 3 Kazakhstan 1 . October 13 (Euro 2016 qualifier) Iceland 2 Holland 0 . November 12 (Friendly) Holland 2 Mexico 3 . And the results have been underwhelming to say the least. In Hiddink's first game, a friendly with Italy in Bari at the start of September, they found themselves two-down inside the first 10 minutes. In their opening Euro qualifier, against the Czech Republic, they were beaten by a stoppage time goal by Vaclav Pilar. In last month's double-header, they had to come from behind to beat lowly Kazakhstan and then slumped to a 2-0 defeat in Iceland, leaving them third in the standings. And their glaring weaknesses were exposed in an exciting game with Mexico at the Amsterdam ArenA. After Wesley Sneijder had rewarded a high-tempo start to the second-half by bringing Holland level at 1-1, they were unlocked at the back by a sweeping Jesus Corona ball, which left Carlos Vela to score his second of the night. And Mexico's third was the worst. Joel Veltman was woefully out of step with the rest of the back line, playing Javier Hernandez onside as he received Andres Guardado's through ball, rounded Tim Krul and finished. Javier Hernandez (right) sprints off in celebration after rounding goalkeeper Tim Krul to score Mexico's third . Arjen Robben was highly critical of the Dutch defence after the match, saying there is no 'security or stability' Huntelaar and Holland made front page news in Metro on Thursday morning . On both occasions, Hiddink sat in shock on the bench, apparently unaware of how to fix things. Arjen Robben, at least, didn't hold back in his criticism of the back line afterwards. 'We should not point the finger at each other,' he told SBS6 . 'But we have to speak to each other about the errors that were made. We have no security or stability at the back and we fall into repetition.' Hiddink wasn't helped when centre-back Ron Vlaar was forced off injured in the first-half, replaced by Stefan de Vrij, and the manager admitted they were threadbare at the back. 'It is true we are a bit thin on good defenders, especially after the new injury to Vlaar,' Hiddink said. 'I do not have many alternatives.' Under Van Gaal, any defensive frailties were usually masked by exciting forward play but now they look profligate. Stefan de Vrij fails to stop Mexico's Raul Jimenez getting in a header on goal during the friendly . Wesley Sneijder blasts home Holland's equaliser early in the second-half but they were soon behind again . Daley Blind (centre) celebrates with Joel Veltman (left) and Wesley Sneijder after his goal . Both goals, from Sneijder and Daley Blind were spectacular, but Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was wasteful. At one point he missed an open goal from two yards out. Robin van Persie, not quite fully fit and left out of the Mexico game with Sunday in mind, cannot return soon enough but he has been far from his best for Manchester United this season. Memphis Depay, in excellent form for PSV Eindhoven, failed to sparkle for Holland and was removed for Quincy Promes on the hour. The crowd only became animated when Robben received the ball and many had already voted with their feet, with sections of the ground empty. This Holland fan was still getting behind his team - but many jeered as they slipped to defeat . There were audible jeers when the teams walked off at half-time and after the Mexico goals. The Oranje optimism of the World Cup has long since evaporated. But Hiddink has been here before. When first appointed Holland manager in 1995, he started with four losses from five, including competitive defeats to the Czech Republic and Belarus. They still made the finals, albeit via the play-offs. In that first spell, Hiddink remained until 1998, leading Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup in France. This time round it may be a considerably shorter stay and under-fire Hiddink has already outlined his own exit strategy.","Guus Hiddink is on the brink following a fourth defeat in five games .

"A compliment is supposed to make the receiver feel better about themselves, but bashful British women say that they are either 'in denial', embarrassed or uncomfortable when something beautiful is pointed out about them. New research by skincare brand Dove has found that some women find it so difficult to talk about their bodies in a positive way that they would rather fall over in the middle of a public place than tell people a part of their body they think is beautiful. In their latest campaign for real beauty the brand has partnered with award-winning photographer Laura Pannack to capture real women celebrating a part of themselves that their friends have helped them identify as beautiful. Scroll down for video . Dove's new Beauty Spot campaign asked real women to identify their own most beautiful parts- and found very few women see themselves as attractive . The women were asked to cover themselves with a white sheet- only exposing those parts of themselves they felt were beautiful . The imagery features five real women covering most of their bodies with a sheet, revealing only their own 'beauty spots', while the TV campaign features the real women in the photography being asked to name something beautiful about their friends and themselves. Dove is aiming to capitalise on the ability of women to help their friends see their own personal beauty in its Beauty Spot campaign which launches today. When asked what part of themselves they would call beautiful, the range of answers shows just how unpredictable women can be with responses including calves, toes, shoulders, wrists and even ribcages!  Sadly 7 per cent of women said they couldn’t name a single thing. Over half of women  make sure they tell their friends what's beautiful about them on a regular basis . Yet while only 1 per cent of British women would call themselves beautiful, they find it easy to see beauty in their friends. On average, it takes women less than half a second to name something beautiful about their friends, compared to up to eight seconds to name something beautiful about themselves. Over half of women (52 per cent) make . sure they tell their friends what’s beautiful about them on a regular . basis, with two thirds (66 per cent) saying they do so because they know . the positive impact this can have on how they feel about their . bodies.

Kate Goodridge, 32 from Coventry, who chose her bottom as her beauty spot, says: 'At first it was hard to think about a part of my body I was happy with, but with people encouraging me to look at the parts of my body I am happy with, I realised my bum was my beauty spot.' 25 year old Miriam Bashorun from .

"Mr Justice Holman (pictured) said that in almost 20 years as a judge of the Family Division he had rarely heard a more harrowing case . A mixed-race toddler must be taken from a ‘perfect’ white couple who wanted to adopt him and given to a black aunt he has never met, a judge ruled yesterday. The 20-month-old boy has been lovingly cared for by his adoptive parents for the past 13 months and will suffer distress and perhaps psychological harm when he is removed from them. But Mr Justice Holman said these factors were outweighed by the child’s chance to be brought up by his father’s family, who can teach him about his African heritage. The experienced family court judge said it was one of the most harrowing cases he had heard and expressed regret at the ‘intense grief’ his ruling would cause. The adoptive parents’ heartbreak could have been avoided if the father of the boy had come forward earlier. But the man, a 32-year-old black African who claimed asylum in England in 2001, initially showed no real interest in the baby, referred to only as ‘C’, and even denied it was his. The child’s mother, who is white and in her early twenties, has struggled with alcohol and drug problems. While still a teenager she had two children by different fathers. They are now aged three and five, and have both been adopted. Her third child, C, was taken from her five days after his birth in March last year and placed with foster carers by Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council in South Yorkshire. At seven months old he was placed for adoption with the white couple, named as ‘A’ and ‘B’. Social worker Elizabeth Lancaster assessed the couple as being ‘remarkable people’, ‘perfect’ parents for the little boy and almost ‘the ideal adopters’. The judge paid tribute to how they attended courses to prepare themselves for taking on the child, and read books to him about his father’s home country in Africa. The child is now ‘very well attached’ to the couple and feels secure with them, the judge said. One of the adoptive parents told the court: ‘He is such a happy, settled, loving little person who knows who we are ... I love him so much. He will always be my son.’ The judge of the Family Division ruled at the High Court (pictured) that the 20-month-old boy should live with his aunt in the Home Counties . This is not the first time Rotherham’s social services have caused controversy. This summer they were criticised in a report that found at least 1,400 children suffered sexual exploitation in the borough over a 16-year period. And in 2012 there was a row after the council removed three siblings of ethnic minority descent from experienced foster parents because they were members of Ukip. The married couple, who had been fostering for nearly seven years, said they were made to feel like criminals when a social worker told them their views on immigration made them unsuitable carers. Rotherham council’s former director of children’s services Joyce Thacker said at the time that the quality of the couple’s care was ‘not an issue’. She added: ‘These children are from EU migrant backgrounds and Ukip has made very clear statements on ending multiculturalism. I have to think about how sensitive I am being to those children.’ But while frontline social workers supported adoption by A and B, Rotherham’s interim director of children’s services and C’s court-appointed guardian backed the aunt. C’s biological mother had initially claimed that the child’s father was her white long-term partner, who has a criminal record and a history of drug problems. Social workers noticed that the boy appeared to be of mixed race but accepted the mother’s word. But this March, after A and B had started formal adoption proceedings, the aunt contacted social services to say her brother was in fact the father. A genetic test confirmed this was the case, and social workers assessed that the 29-year-old aunt, a single mother who lives in the Home Counties, was a suitable carer for the child. Mr Justice Holman ruled that C should be placed with the aunt after a five-day family court hearing. He said: ‘I know, and deeply regret, that my decision will cause intense grief. After hearing all the evidence and argument, and after due consideration, I am, however, clear as to the outcome, which I do not reach narrowly or marginally. ‘I have no doubt that public reaction to this judgment and decision is likely to be polarised, with some agreeing and some strongly disagreeing with what I have decided.’ Under the Adoption and Children Act 2002, the most important concern of family courts is a child’s welfare ‘throughout his life’. Judges must take into account the likely effect of the child’s being adopted and ceasing to be a member of their original family. They must not make an adoption order unless they consider that doing so would be better than not doing so. Once a child has been formally adopted, the order can be revoked only in ‘highly exceptional and very particular circumstances’.","Justice Holman said toddler will live with family of father who rejected him .

"Ryan Giggs showed his boss Louis van Gaal just what he is missing by scoring as he took on the Salford City team that he now co-owns with Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville in a fund-raising match that attracted a 12,000 crowd to the AJ Bell Stadium in Eccles.

By isolating movies set largely in each state then finding the most popular among them on IMDB, Reddit user Jakubisko has created a visual representation of favorite flicks from sea to shining sea. The fascinating endeavor left many states branded with a feel good classic (Indiana got A Christmas Story!), but others weren't as lucky (sorry South Carolina, you get Full Metal Jacket). Some states also wound up matched with some unexpected films. While Washington, DC's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is no surprise, the most popular film set in the state of Washington is the 2011 Joseph Gordon-Levitt film 50/50. Which is your state's? Reddit user Jakubisko created this map of each state's favorite film that takes place largely within its borders . Some of the states' films were obvious. The gambling state of Nevada ended up with 1995 Casino while Mississippi's most popular native flick is Django Unchained . Contention: Some films seemed obvious but made for contentious additions to the map. Fargo, for instance, is listed as North Dakota's favorite movie, but commenters pointed out that only a small portion of the film takes place in the state .

"A mother has released harrowing pictures of her son who was left in a coma after his drink was allegedly spiked with ketamine in a nightclub. Jack Mcewan is feared to have unknowingly taken the horse tranquiliser at the Crush nightclub in Dartford in Kent. The 18-year-old was only saved by a quick thinking friend, who put him in the recovery position and door staff who gave him emergency treatment before he was rushed into intensive care. Scroll down for video . Teenager Jack Mcewan, who was left in a coma after allegedly having his drink spiked with ketamine at a nightclub in Dartford, Kent . The 18-year-old was only saved by a quick thinking friend and door staff, who put him in the recovery position and gave emergency treatment . Now his mother Carrie, 36, has released a picture of her son in the hope it will raise awareness of the dangers of drugs. Mrs Mcewan received a call from another parent on Saturday night to say that her son had collapsed at the nightclub. When she arrived at the Darent Valley Hospital in Kent she found him hooked up to life support machines and in a coma. Mrs Mcewan said: 'I never thought I would be one of those mums to get a phone call like that. 'When I got to the hospital I broke down, it was my baby lying there. 'He had all these tubes in his throat and coming out of his veins. It was awful. The teenager is said to have had his drink spiked with ketamine at the Crush nightclub in Dartford, Kent, pictured . 'He was in a terrible way. His body had just shut down. 'By the time he had got to the hospital his body had sort of comatosed itself. She added: 'Why would someone do something like that? Was it a joke or where they trying to mug him? 'He was lucky that his friend was there. He put him in the recovery position and checked for his pulse.'

"Pop songs which refer to alcohol brands could be encouraging young people to binge drink and have sex, experts have warned. Almost a quarter of chart music lyrics over a three-year period mentioned booze, analysts said. Four brands of spirits – Patron tequila, Hennessy cognac, Grey Goose vodka, and Jack Daniel’s whiskey – made up more than half of specific references to labels. Songs by Rihanna (left) and Kanye West (right) feature specific references to brands of alcohol . The songs almost always showed alcohol as a good thing. More than one in ten, or 16 per cent, linked getting drunk with sex. Rihanna’s song Cheers states: ‘I drink to that/ Oh let the Jameson sink in’. In Bittersweet, Kanye West raps: ‘This relationship it even got me back to drinkin’/ Now this Hennessy it’s going to be the death of me’. Rap, hip hop and R&B were most likely to mention booze, at 38 per cent, then country music at 22 per cent and pop at 15 per cent. In How We Do, British pop star Rita Ora sings: ‘You look so sweet while you’re dreaming/ Holding your bottle of Tanqueray’, while in his song Jack Daniels, country idol Eric Church says: ‘I’ve thrown a punch or two . . . But Jack Daniel’s kicked my ass again last night.’ US experts analysed the 720 top songs of 2009, 2010 and 2011 as ranked by Billboard Magazine. In all, 167 mentioned alcohol and 46 songs mentioned brands. Four brands of spirits, including Patron tequila (right) and Grey Goose vodka (left), made up more than half of specific references to labels . Professor Michael Siegel, of  Boston University, said: ‘Many songs glamorise underage drinking and excessive alcohol consumption and their association with sex and partying.’ He said: 'A small number of alcohol brands and beverages appear to make frequent appearances in popular music.

"Liam Bridcutt has completed a £2.5million move to Sunderland from Brighton, becoming Gus Poyet's fifth signing of the transfer window. The midfielder on Thursday travelled up to Wearside to discuss personal terms with the Black Cats and completed his move on Friday morning. Brighton had rejected a transfer request from the 24-year-old earlier this month but were unable to prevent him from signing for Poyet's side. Proud: Liam Bridcutt stands in his Sunderland shirt after completing his move from Brighton . Done deal: Bridcutt finally made the move away from the Amex to the Stadium of Light . On the lookout: Gus Poyet has brought in new faces for the Premier League survival scrap . Bridcutt had been at at the Amex Stadium since 2010, when he joined the club on a free transfer from Chelsea. Meanwhile, Albion boss Oscar Garcia has drafted in Spanish forward David Rodriguez from Celta Vigo. Brighton have also been watching midfielder Dale Stephens as a potential replacement for Bridcutt but Charlton have rebuffed an offer. Following suit: Ignacio Scocco gives a thumbs-up after sealing his £3million move to the North East . Wanted man: Charlton have rejected an offer from Brighton for 24-year-old midfielder Dale Stephens . Starting at Chelsea, Bridcutt had loan spells with Yeovil, Watford and Stockport County before being allowed to leave on a free transfer to Brighton in 2010. Impressing at the Amex in the engine room of midfield, the Scot was called up to the national side for the first time for the 2-0 World Cup qualifying defeat by Serbia in March last year. Bridcutt made 132 appearances for Brighton, scoring twice and was part of their 2010-11 League One promotion-winning side. Bridcutt, who will wear the No 23 shirt, had not played for the south-coast club since submitting a transfer request earlier this month after the Black Cats formalised their interest in him. The midfielder, who made his Scotland debut against Serbia last year, joins fellow January signings Marcos Alonso, Santiago Vergini, Oscar Ustari and Ignacio Scocco at the Stadium of Light. Poyet needs to clear the decks and bring some money in too to keep owner Ellis Short happy, and Lee Cattermole could be leaving for Stoke City. Despite Mark Hughes’ surprise that the proposed deal has caused Poyet so much consternation – ‘I don’t know where that came from,’ he said on Wednesday – there is interest in the former Sunderland captain according to first team coach Charlie Oatway. On the way out? Stoke City are interested in signing Sunderland's former captain Lee Cattermole . Speaking at the weekend, Cattermole . said: ‘I will definitely be a Sunderland player on Wednesday. I've heard . no different and the manager has come out and said he has heard no . different. I will be back in training on Monday. ‘I am contracted to Sunderland. They make the decisions not me. ‘It's . out of my hands. I'm contracted here for the rest of the season and . another two years. It's out of my hands. Until I know any different, I . will keep working. I have got a cup final to play in – if I'm here – and . that would be brilliant.’ As well as making five signings this window, Sunderland snapped up 13 players last summer under Gus Poyet's predecessor Paolo di Canio. Including the five this window, that's 18 altogether. Here's the full list of Sunderland's movers and shakers: . Summer signings 2013: Vito Mannone, Emanuele Giaccherini, Jozy Altidore, Fabio Borini, Ki Yeung-sung, Andrea Dossena, Charis Mavrias, El Hadji Ba, David Moberg Karlsson, Ondrej Celustka, Jozy Altidore, Modibo Diakite, Duncan Watmore .

"Streaming a football match on a smartphone or tablet using mobile data produces the same amount of carbon emissions as driving a petrol car for 10 miles, claims a new study. However watching the match when connected to Wi-Fi produces eight times less emissions than when the same sporting event is watched on a television set. According to figures from the Carbon Trust, the most environmentally-friendly way to watch shows, films and events per viewer is by sharing a screen with other people either at home or in the pub.

Wi-Fi produces emissions eight times lower than when the same sporting . event is watched on a television set. Watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized LED television. Whereas a laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer. Whereas going to see a game live at the stadium produces the most carbon of the lot, particularly for an away game, due to the added impact of transport. The reports claim watching a match on LED screens is most energy efficient, followed by LCD and then plasma. It is estimated that this Sunday’s FA Community Shield at Wembley between Manchester United and Wigan will produce 5,160 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is the equivalent of the annual energy emissions of around 1,000 homes. The research found that when watching alone, the lowest carbon way to view football is by using a smartphone or tablet connected to broadband. Emissions can be as much as eight times lower than watching on television, mostly due to the smaller size of the screen. In Britain, 27 per cent of smartphone owners and 63 per cent of tablet owners are now using their device to watch live TV. For the upcoming season both Sky and BT are offering apps that allow football to be watched on personal devices and each device and screen sizes can vary in energy consumption. However, watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized LED television. A laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer. During the 2010-11 season The FA reduced its own carbon footprint by more than seven per cent, compared to 2008-09 and the organisation achieved the Carbon Trust Standard. Michael Rea, chief operating officer at the Carbon Trust, said: 'Our work helping teams, broadcasters and the telecoms industry to continuously reduce their environmental impact will in turn help to reduce the impacts of fans when they are watching football.' Roger Maslin, managing director of Wembley Stadium, said: 'We are continuing to find new ways to reduce our environmental impacts. 'Only a small part of the total carbon emissions associated with a game at Wembley are in our direct control, so we are calling on fans to do their bit and help to shrink the carbon bootprint of watching football.' Both BT and Sky offer apps, pictured, that allow football to be watched on phones or tablets.

"How many times have you plated up a serving of food, only to realise that your eyes were too big for your stomach? In most cases we leave the leftovers to the side of our plate and throw the food away without a second thought. But a new app could be about to put an end to that. LeftoverSwap is being developed to help cut down on waste by offering those 'tasty', unwanted morsels to those who might appreciate what you are happy to bin. Will leftovers save the planet? The new app, LeftoverSwap, hopes to cut down on global waste and ensure people don't go without food . The basic premise of the app is that you can advertise your unwanted food by photographing  and uploading images of it. Hungry app owners in the local vicinity can then get in touch, order their ‘takeaway’ and eat the otherwise redundant food – saving them money and, the developers hope, the planet. The creators also believe the concept will help reconnect communities as they get in touch and share meals. The website says that the app is for people ‘who hate the idea of throwing out food, but also don't want to be eating the same leftovers for the next few days.’ LeftoverSwap (mockup of app pictured) could help you get rid of that overindulgent takeaway . It says: ‘LeftoverSwappers don't feel the need to eat an enormous restaurant portion, and instead pass it on to a hungrier neighbour, in turn learning their name and avoiding excess calories. ‘Through increasing the efficiency of each plot of land dedicated to food production, we can reduce our intensive use of natural resources, and reduce our expansion into sensitive environmental areas. The site points out that research has shown that 40 per cent of the food we produce goes to waste. However, there are suspicions that the app is a hoax. The app’s website features a ridiculous graph predicting that as more people use the app and reduce their food waste, there will be a rise in the Spotted Brown Owl population . But developers are adamant the concept is genuine. Seattle entrepreneur Dan Newman says he . and his friend Bryan Summersett conceived the idea for LeftoverSwap several years ago,when  they ordered too much pizza and couldn’t fit the . remaining portions in the fridge, according to a report by uproxx.com. Good sense of humour or hint of a hoax? Some believe the new app is a prank but the developers maintain they are very serious about the concept . They said that at first it was just a joke but that over the past three years the concept seems to have made increasing sense. 'We were like, ""We don’t want to throw this out, and it would just be great to broadcast that we have extra pizza to share"",' he recalls. The idea really started to take shape after Mr Newman hosted a 'couch surfer' in his apartment who lived as a 'freegan' - meaning he only ate from other people’s plates, or from the bins. 'That was enough to spark initiative in me,' Newman said. It is not clear when the app will be launched. The website says: 'We're currently building out LeftoverSwap and are aiming to release it for the iPhone as soon as possible with an Android version coming after.'","LeftoverSwap is being developed by two university friends who claim the app will help reduce food waste and help connect people .

"Prince Charles asked paedophile Jimmy Savile for advice on health policy and to read over his speeches, a controversial new biography has claimed. The Prince of Wales and Savile were known to have had a working relationship after they met in the late 1970s while supporting wheelchair sports charities and is has long been claimed that the Prince relied on the now disgraced DJ for advice during the 1980s and 1990s. In the biography, Charles: The Heart of a King, it is claimed that Savile was regular visitor to Highgrove and St James' Palace and was once at a meeting at Highgrove being held to discuss closures to emergency services. Scroll down for video . The Prince of Wales asked prolific paedophile Jimmy Savile for advice about health policy and to read over his speeches and make any suggested changes to them, asking for his advice since they met in the 1970s . The book, by journalist Catherine Mayer, also claims the Prince once deferred to Savile to look over a speech he was due to give and make any changes, the Telegraph reported. 'One source tells of an occasion when the Prince asked his famous occasional adviser to read over a speech he was due to give on a topic unrelated to health care or any field in which Savile had expertise,' wrote Mayer. She said Savile did not make any changes on that occasion. The book sheds new light on the extent to which the Prince relied on Savile as his confidant. Savile died in 2011 and was exposed as a prolific paedophile, using his celebrity status to prey on child victims. He is said to have abused hundreds of victims, taking advantage of having free run of Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary. The book also deals with Prince Charles' relationships, revealing that he had doubts about his wedding to Princess Diana and on the eve of the ceremony said 'I can't do it.' Sarah Goodall, a former Lady Clerk to the Prince previously claimed in an autobiography that Savile gave marriage guidance counselling to the Prince and Princess of Wales. This claim was denied by Clarence House. The Prince of Wales (left) pictured with Savile (centre) and deputy Lord Lieutenant Ian Thornber (right) in 1999 . Prince Charles and Princess Diana toured Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1983, accompanied by Savile (centre) Savile, who was exposed as a paedophile after his death, was at a charity dinner with the Prince in 1978 . Prince Charles met former world champion boxer Frank Bruno (left) in 1998 at Buckingham Palace, where Savile (centre) was also present . The biography also says the Prince no longer wants to promote the interests of British arms firms in the Middle East. Prince Charles, who like other members of the Royal Family has close links to many ruling families in the Arab world, particularly Saudi Arabia, told ministers that he 'doesn't like being used to market weaponry'. Last year BAE Systems announced a deal to sell Typhoon jets to the Saudis the day after the Prince had finished a visit to the country. Although aides insisted the deal was 'never discussed', anti-arms campaigners said it was 'clear that Prince Charles had been used by the UK Government and BAE Systems as an arms dealer'. The book claims his objections were made 'discreetly.' The prince will visit the country for two days next week - for the 12th time - as part of a whirlwind tour of Arabia, also taking in Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE. Mayer wrote: 'A source close to the Prince says he doesn't like being used to market weaponry and now sidesteps such activities wherever possible. ' Prince Charles has signalled he no longer wants to promote British arms sales in the Middle East . Prince Charles, left, gives his country's condolences for King Abdullah, to the newly enthroned King Salman, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The Prince is due to visit the country for two days next week . The writer highlights Charles's appearance at an arms fair in Dubai several years ago, which he defended in his 1994 documentary with Jonathan Dimbleby by arguing that he was boosting trades and if the UK didn't sell them 'as a deterrent', then someone else would. Charles is regarded as a particularly valuable asset by diplomats who believe he can gain access at the very highest level to Arab rulers in a way politicians simple cannot. A Clarence House spokesman said last night: 'The Prince of Wales' upcoming visit to the Middle East is not about sales of defence equipment and is not essentially commercial. Charles has told ministers that he 'doesn't like being used to market weaponry', author Catherine Mayer claims . 'The Prince of Wales undertakes official visits on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. 'The five countries The Prince is visiting in the Middle East are important allies and key partners to the UK. 'This visit to the Middle East like others is to strengthen relationships and highlight stability in the region. 'The programme has been designed by the FCO, its Middle East Posts and Clarence House to make the most of The Prince's knowledge and expertise, and to highlight both HRHs concerns and those of the UK Government about conflict in the region.' Prime Minister David Cameron defended Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia yesterday – despite its appalling human rights record – saying it had given information 'which helped save British lives'. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday, saying it was important to maintain a relationship with the kingdom despite its poor record on human rights. The British government's decision to fly the Union flag at half-mast on public buildings following the death of Saudi's King Abdullah last month drew criticism human rights campaigners and several prominent British politicians. Asked about this decision during a question and answer session on Sky news on Monday, Cameron said the countries had a long standing relationship and it was 'a mark of respect'. Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) defended Britain's close relationship with Saudi Arabia yesterday – despite its appalling human rights record . 'We have a relationship with Saudi Arabia partly over things like trying to achieve peace in the Middle East but crucially over fighting terrorism ... Since I have been prime minister a piece of information that we have been given by that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives here in Britain,' he said. While King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz pursued a modernising legacy of cautious social and economic reform, against a backdrop of regional turmoil the authorities had in the last year issued tougher penalties against all forms of dissent. A sentence of a thousand lashes on a blogger accused off offences including insulting Islam, cyber crime and disobeying his father has also caused international outrage. 'We don't agree with lots of things that the Saudis do ... we make very clear those differences,' Cameron said. 'I would argue if you have a relationship with them and you have a way of talking to them they are more likely to listen to you than if you just cut yourself off.'","Biography says Prince Charles deferred to Jimmy Savile for advice .

"Plastic bags are seen as the scourge of the landscape, threatening the lives of wildlife and marine creatures around the world. Yet urban bees in Canada have found a novel use for the litter. Research from the University of Guelph has revealed some urban bees have resorted to using small pieces of plastic bags and plastic building materials to construct their nests. The plastic is used as a substitute for plant resins and researchers claim it highlights the 'bees' resourcefulness and flexibility in adapting to a human-dominated world.' Researchers from Canada found two species of urban leafcutter bees, pictured, have started using small pieces of plastic as a substitute for plant resins in their nests. In both cases, larvae successfully developed and were free from parasites. The study claims this means the plastic could be making the nests more secure . ‘Plastic waste pervades the global landscape,’ said lead author Scott MacIvor, a doctoral student at York University and a Guelph graduate. ‘Although researchers have shown adverse impacts of the material on species and the ecosystem, few scientists have observed insects adapting to a plastic-rich environment.’ The flight of the bumblebee may seem clumsy and slow, but new research claims these humble insects can reach altitudes higher than the peak of Mount Everest. Despite their rotund bodies and relatively small wings, researchers from Wyoming found that bees can negotiate air so thin it would kill a human - making them the finest flyers in the insect world. In a series of experiments, scientists placed wild bees in a flight chamber and while all managed to fly at heights of 7,500m (24,606ft), two exceed heights of 9,000m (29,528ft). MacIvor, along with Professor Andrew Moore, supervisor of analytical microscopy at Laboratory Services, made the discovery while examining nest boxes in Toronto. They found two solitary bee species using plastic in place of natural nest building materials. The first bee, Megachile campanulae, traditionally uses plant resins to build its nests, yet MacIvor found evidence of a grey ‘goo’ in the bees’ boxes, which he initially believed to be chewing gum. Moore used a scanning electron microscope to take highly detailed pictures of the item, as well as x-ray microanalysis to determine the elements in the sample and infrared microscopy to identify polymers. He discovered that the M. campanulae was occasionally replacing plant resins with polyurethane-based exterior building sealant, such as caulking, in its brood cells, created in a nest to rear larva. Researchers found two solitary bee species using plastic in place of natural nest building materials. The first bee, Megachile campanulae, was found using plastic building sealant, while a second, the alfafa leafcutter, pictured, replaced parts of its nest with plastic bags . The researchers also discovered another kind of bee, Megachile rotundata, an alfalfa leafcutter, was using pieces of polyethylene-based plastic bags to construct its brood cells.The glossy plastic replaced almost a quarter of the cut leaves normally used to build each cell. Markings showed that the bees chewed the plastic differently than they did leaves, suggesting that the insects had not collected the plastic by mistake. Nor were was there a shortage of leaves for the bees in the study. ‘The plastic materials had been gathered by the bees, and then worked - chewed up and spat out like gum - to form something new that they could use,’ Moore said. In both cases, larvae successfully developed from the plastic-lined nests. In fact, the bees emerged parasite-free, suggesting plastic nests may physically impede parasites, according to the study. The nests containing plastic were among more than 200 artificial nest boxes monitored by MacIvor as part of a large-scale investigation of the ecology of urban bees and wasps, a project involving numerous citizen scientists. ‘The novel use of plastics in the nests of bees could reflect the ecologically adaptive traits necessary for survival in an increasingly human-dominated environment,’ MacIvor said. The research was published recently in the journal Ecosphere.","Researchers from Guelph University studied bee nest boxes in Toronto .

"A driver for ride-sharing company Uber is accused of striking a passenger in the head with a hammer during a dispute over the route he was taking, the San Francisco District Attorney's office said Friday. Patrick Karajah, 26, picked up three people from a bar around 2 a.m. Tuesday and, while driving the passengers to their destination, he got into an argument with one of the passengers who questioned the route he was taking, according to court documents obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. The documents said that Karajah, who was driving for the basic UberX service, forced the passengers out of his car in the Bernal Heights neighborhood. Once the victim was out of the car, Karajah allegedly struck him on the side of his head with a hammer and drove away. Trip from hell: Uber driver Patrick Karajah, 26, has been accused of beating one of his passengers in the head with a hammer .

"Coloured contact lenses are all the rage and now one surgeon has designed a permanent way of changing people's eye colour. The procedure, called artificial iris implant, involves inserting a thin, medical grade silicone implant into the eye to alter the appearance of the iris. It was pioneered by Dr Kenneth Rosenthal, of the Island Eye Surgicentre in Long Island, New York. Scroll down for video . A surgeon has designed a permanent way of changing people's eye colour by using a silicone implant . The artificial iris implant can be used for cosmetic reasons but it can also be used to treat some medical conditions, such as heterochromia - a pigment condition which causes a person to have one eye a different colour to the other. In some cases, the procedure can even be used to restore sight. For example, in 2011 it was used to treat Nathaniel Schull, 17, who had been partially blind since birth because he was born with congenital aniridia - the absence of irises. Dr Kenneth Rosenthal has pioneered the procedure which takes 15 minutes per eye and is carried out under local anaesthetic . Following the treatment, he has near perfect vision. The procedure involves creating a 2.8mm incision in the cornea and inserting a folded implant through it. Once it is inside the eye, the implant springs back into shape and can be positioned. The implant’s manufacturer, BrightOcular, says it does not affect short or long sightedness meaning people who require glasses still need to wear their spectacles after the operation. While the surgery is considered to be safe, some patients do develop eye infections, sensitivity to light and inflammation among other complications. However, BrightOcular say the implants can be removed easily if they are causing problems. Inserting them takes about 15 minutes per eye and is done under local anaesthetic. BrightOcular say it takes between one and two months for patients to fully recover from the surgery but that they can usually go home on the day of the treatment. As with traditional forms of plastic . surgery, patients have to take it easy after the procedure - they are . not allowed to drive or to lift heavy items for a few days and cannot go . swimming for three months. Artificial iris implants are currently available in clinics across the U.S. One . patient, Chizu, from Japan, said: 'I am not a stranger to cosmetic . procedures but this has been the most fulfilling procedure I ever had . and probably the last I will ever need. The procedure involves making a small incision in the cornea before inserting the implant into the eye and moving it into position (pictured) 'I have been wearing colour contacts since my early teens which are very popular in Asia. ‘Now people can look into my light baby blues that are really mine! I really feel I now finally found my own unique special identity that sets me apart from the world.'","Dr Kenneth Rosenthal pioneered the artificial iris implant procedure .

"The FIFA presidential election - becoming a bigger circus by the day – has another candidate with former world footballer of the year Luis Figo surprisingly deciding to stand on the eve of the deadline. However Figo entering the crowded race has more to do with the tactical machinations going on between FIFA's Zurich and UEFA's Nyon than the Portuguese football great having any noted sporting political ambitions – even with compatriot Jose Mourinho's endorsement. The UEFA game plan is to crowd the election hustings with as many 'credible' candidates as possible so that the anti Sepp Blatter agenda is heard loudly in as many places as possible before the ballot on May 29. Luis Figo surprisingly announced his intention to stand against Sepp Blatter to become FIFA president . UEFA want to flood the presidential vote with anti Sepp Blatter candidates so word of the unhappiness spreads . This is seen as the best way of destabilising Blatter, who is seeking a ludicrous fifth term and already has enough promised votes from the 209 territories to practically guarantee him victory. Such is the way that UEFA are spreading their bets that they have welcomed the bizarre decision by the FA to support Prince Ali of Jordan when Europe are now fielding Holland's Michael Van Praag and Figo. And it will not go un-noticed by Paddy Power stunt funded David Ginola that Figo has just cut his links with Asian betting company Dafabet . Scotland have pledged their backing to van Praag having supported Blatter in 2011 on proviso that it would be his last term – which it isn't . Jerome Champagne, the most fanciful of candidates for the FIFA presidency, is having to rely on former colleague Sepp Blatter - if he sees fit - gifting him the necessary five nominations needed to stand. Champagne has failed to garner enough support despite spending a year on the campaign trail and sending out regular dreary policy statements. Jerome Champagne needs Blatter to gift him five nominations to stand against him as a candidate . So who - if anyone - will want to read an entire book about his way forward for FIFA being published in France this week. The Premier League fast tracking their TV rights auction over the next fortnight to ensure broadcast regulator Ofcom did not derail the expected £5 billion bonanza was reported by Sports Agenda last Saturday. Now Virgin Media, whose initial complaint about the cost of TV matches instigated the Ofcom probe, have asked Ofcom to force the Premier League to postpone the auction until the investigation is completed. Ofcom said last: 'We aim to reach a decision in a matter of days'. But Ofcom themselves could have decided a lot earlier in the process to order the delay and the timing of Virgin Media's request was described as 'self- serving' by the PL. And the PL , who would bring in lawyers ASAP if challenged, say there is 'no legal basis whatsoever for any interference.'.

But overall football and cricket 's APS numbers will be up today.. Greg Dyke faces an explosive board meeting at the Football Association on Thursday . The FA board meeting today is likely to be an explosive affair after the Premier League – represented at Wembley by David Gill and Nic Coward – rejected Greg Dyke's England commission-led initiative to scrap work permit appeals. Home Office regulations require a consensus within English football for such a change. As limiting overseas players was a central plank of Dyke's strategy for improving the national team, this issue is sure to cause ructions.

"The BBC have told Phil Neville and his Match of the Day colleagues to watch what they say after the ex-Manchester United star made comments seeming to glorify dangerous tackles on players who are showboating. Neville, 38, sparked controversy when he said he would 'smash' team-mates in training if he saw them perform a 'no look' pass like Tomas Rosicky's during Arsenal's 3-2 FA Cup win over Brighton and Hove Albion. Viewers of Sunday's Match of the Day 2 heard Neville remark: 'If that was a training session and somebody did that, I'd be first over there and I'd probably look to two-foot him or take him out of the game. If somebody did that in training to me, winding me up, I would be straight in there. I'd smash them.' Phil Neville made the comments on Match of the Day, but later claimed it was 'tongue in cheek' Tomas Rosicky looks one way but passes another during the build up to his spectacular goal . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . After receiving angry responses on Twitter, he went on to say his comments were not to be taken seriously. Gary Lineker dismissed the furore around Neville's comments, tweeting: 'What bunkum. He was clearly joking. Absolutely no chance that anyone at the BBC will warn him.' BBC Sport reminded its on-screen team to be more circumspect in their punditry after some viewers complained. 'This comment was not meant to offend in any way but, on reflection, Phil acknowledges that the language he used was unfortunate,' a spokesman told their website.

"Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz apologized on Thursday for claiming the day before that Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker gives women 'the back of his hand.' At a round-table discussion on women's issues in Milwaukee on Wednesday the Democratic Party leader had ridiculed Walker's policies toward women and drew comparison between the Republican Governor and a perpetrator of domestic violence. After Wasserman Schultz's hyperbolic comments attracted outrage from both Republicans and Walker's Democratic opponent in Wisconsin's upcoming gubernatorial race, the DNC chair admitted in a statement that her argument could have been better phrased. 'I shouldn’t have used the words I used,' she said. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz apologized on Thursday for making controversial statements about Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. Schultz pictured above at a press conference for Florida gubernatorial candidate Nan Rich on August 26 . Walker is . currently in the middle of heated re-election battle against Democratic . candidate Mary Burke. Recent polling shows that both candidates in the November election are within one to two points of each other. Schultz was criticizing Walker's opposition to a minimum wage increase and support for a bill that would prevent people claiming employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court, when she made the controversial about his treatment of women. 'Scott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' she said. 'What Republican Tea Party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch,' she added. The Republican National Committee pounced on Schultz comments and issued a statement saying it was a 'new low for an already flailing Democratic Party'. 'This is a sad attempt to gain political points that’s offensive to victims of abuse and well beneath the chair of a major political party,' RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement. Incumbent Scott Walker (left) and Democratic challenger Mary Burke, right, are currently in the middle of a heated gubernatorial race . 'Mary Burke should denounce the leader of her party or explain why she’s standing by as Democrats mislead Wisconsin voters.' A spokesperson for Burke told FoxNews.com afterward that it was 'not the type of language' that her candidate 'would use, or has used, to point out the clear differences in this contest.' Burke's spokeswoman, Stephanie Wilson, added that 'those disagreements can and should be pointed out respectfully.' The DNC also put out a statement explaining that Schultz was in no way trying to make light of domestic violence. 'Domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience,' DNC spokesman Lily Adams said. 'That's why Democrats have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act and won’t take a lesson from the party that blocked and opposed its reauthorization. 'The fact of the matter is that Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin’s women.' Wasserman Schultz said in a statement of her own on Thursday 'it's unacceptable that a majority of Congressional Republicans opposed . this critical legislation, of which I was a proud cosponsor, after . blocking its reauthorization for more than a year.' While she expressed regret for the way in which she critiqued Walker's record, Wasserman Schultz stood behind the intent of her previous remarks and said they 'shouldn't detract from the broader point' she was making. 'Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin women, whether it's mandating ultrasounds, repealing an equal pay law, or rejecting federal funding for preventative health care, Walker's record speaks for itself,' she said. A poll . published in late August by Marquette University showed Walker's opponent, Burke, up two . percentage points, while a poll taken earlier in the month by Rasmussen Reports . found that Walker was up a single point.

"The Muslim ex-husband of American woman Nicole Lynn Mansfield, shot dead in Syria for supposedly fighting with rebel forces, is a religious hardliner who may have indoctrinated her into his beliefs. Ayman Mohammed Bafil, from Saudi Arabia, hates the freedoms that people have in the U.S. and thinks anyone who does not believe in Islam is ‘going to hell’. A close family friend said that he has medieval beliefs and sees women as only being fit for cooking, raising children and having sex. Marriage: Nicole Lynn Mansfield was converted to Islam by ex-husband Ayman Mohammed Bafil (pictured) according to a friend . Covert mission: Nicole Lynn Mansfield, pictured with her daugher Triana, died in Syria last week after taking part in rebel activities against the government . The friend fears that he could have . controlled Nicole Lynn Mansfield, killed by government forces in Syria . last Sunday. The claims, made exclusively to . MailOnline, give an insight into the man Nicole’s family . believe could have set her on the course which resulted in her death. MailOnline has also obtained the . first picture of Bafil, who now lives in Saudi Arabia with his third . wife, an American Muslim convert like Nicole. The photo, reportedly taken in 2007, shows a man in traditional Saudi dress with a slim face and youthful appearance. Nicole, 33, and two other Westerners . were shot dead in Idlib province in northern Syria, making her the first . American to be killed in the country’s civil war. State media reported that she was . fighting with an al Qaeda-affiliated group and that she threw grenades . at government soldiers when caught in an ambush. Other reports suggested she was setting up an observation post when she was shot. Her . family, including her 18-year-old daughter Triana Jones, who all live . in Flint, Michigan, are baffled as to how an apparently harmless woman . could have ended up in such a situation. Nicole Lynn Mansfield was shot dead by Syrian government forces along with two other Westerners - reportedly both British - The 33-year-old is from Flint, Michigan and converted to Islam several years ago following marriage to an Arab man . Gunned Down: Syrian state television showed the vehicle the woman was traveling in with a British man that appeared to be riddled with bullets . The . turning point in her life appears to have been five years ago when she . met Bafil and converted to Islam, though it is not clear if he . introduced her to the religion or if she was already interested in . becoming a Muslim. Now . MailOnline can reveal his full story for the first time - and how he has . been married three times in his quest to find the perfect housewife. Bafil, . 32, wed his first wife in Saudi Arabia in 2002 under an arranged . marriage to a Saudi woman. Both were from strict Sunni Muslim families. They . moved to Eugene, Oregon in 2006 so he could study English and then . engineering with a grant from the Saudi government which covered his . tuition fees, accommodation and living expenses. However his wife soon grew unhappy and rebelled at how she was treated. In 2007 they split up and later divorced. The friend said: ‘He carried on as if they were still in Saudi Arabia. He is very religious and didn’t allow her to get cable or to play music. ‘He did not let her drive - even in America - and the only way she could was by stealing his car when he didn’t know. ‘He hated Christianity and people who were not in the same religion as him. ‘His wife was supposed to wear the full burka. He thought a woman should be at home, cooking, watching the kids and there for sex. That’s what a woman is in his eyes.’ Bafil and his first wife have two children, a girl aged nine and a five-year-old boy. They went through a bitter court battle which ended with her being granted custody but he is allowed visitation rights when he returns to the U.S. He does so once or twice a year even though he reportedly detests America. The friend said: ‘He is completely against America. He thinks there’s too much freedom here. He thinks young people who have sex are like animals and he doesn’t like drinking. ‘The bottom line is that he thinks they (Americans) will burn in hell’. In July 2010, Bafil married Nicole in Flint having met her on the Internet but their marriage lasted just over a year. They divorced in August 2011. Her relatives have told MailOnline that it was a ‘deal’ under which he would get a green card and paid her cash and gave her a van in exchange. Daughter: Triana Lynn Mansfield, right, took to Facebook on Friday to blame the Syrian government for her mother's death while denying her accused ties to terrorism . But for Nicole at least it seems that there was definitely a commitment of some kind, regardless of her motives. The friend said: ‘She came to visit him every weekend and do the wife thing and cook and clean for him. ‘Then she would go back home and carry on her life. She paid for everything and just wanted to be there for him. ‘She would be a housewife for him, basically’. It is not clear if Nicole was already a Muslim before she met Bafil or if he persuaded her to convert, although in Islam converting a non-believer is seen as extremely praiseworthy. Regardless of which, it is likely that he brought her round to his militant viewpoint during their time together. The friend said that he was ‘capable of putting ideas into her head’ and that he was supportive of Muslims who had taken part in jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s with the backing of the Saudi government. The friend said: ‘He is capable of doing anything. He is manipulative and two-faced.' By October 2011, Bafil moved onto wife number three and wed Muslim convert Theresa Rutgers, who was 33 at the time and living in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Defense: Nicole's daughter Triana Lynn Mansfield took to Facebook today to defend her mother, pictured, claiming she was a 'regular American woman who was misguided by the people' The pair are now living in Saudi Arabia where he works as an engineer for Saudi Airlines and she is a stay-at-home mother. She has told friends she is extremely happy and loves her new life. During a phone conversation, Theresa, who was not aware that Nicole had died, said: ‘That’s awful news. I’m so sorry. ‘Ayman never has a bad thing to say about her. I knew they were married but it was not a bitter divorce.' MailOnline has not received a comment from Ayman Mohammed Bafil. Among those who have defended Nicole's actions have been her daughter Triana who has given a tearful interview in which she said that her mother was ‘lied to’ by whoever persuaded her to go to Syria. She claimed that her mother could not have afforded her plane ticket and that she told her last week that she wouldn't be home for a few weeks because someone stole her ID. That same ID, her Michigan state driver’s licence, was later flashed on TV screens when she was killed. Nicole’s father Greg Mansfield revealed that he contacted the FBI five years ago when Nicole traveled to Dubai and asked them to take away her passport. He has said that he ‘knew something wasn’t right’ and that if they had followed his instructions she would still be alive. Nicole’s family now want her body returned to the U.S. so they can give her a Christian burial and bury her in a plot next to her grandfather. Today the Sunday Telegraph reported the group that Nicole was fighting with is called Ahrar al-Sham, translated as ‘Free Men of Syria’, which controls a large area in the north of the country. A rebel fighter who declined to give his name said that Nicole was not a terrorist and that she was helping to plan operations against government forces and nurse wounded fighters. He said: ‘The American sister, Nicole, is a brilliant woman. ‘She was an instructor for our movement. She gave training to other women who wanted help. ‘When she died, she was on a mission planning and studying the military geography of an army base.","Ayman Mohammed Bafil was married to Nicole Lynn Mansfield for little over a year .

"Top members of computer hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec have been arrested across two continents after their leader - one of the world's most wanted computer vandals - turned them in. In a startling show of betrayal towards his fellow hackers, 28-year-old Hector Xavier Monsegur led authorities to the five people who have now been charged in court papers in New York. Dad-of-two Monsegur, who has pleaded guilty to a dozen hacking-related charges, is portrayed in court papers as the ringleader of LulzSec, and an 'influential member' of Anonymous. Ever since his arrest last June, he has reportedly been working with authorities to bring down the groups' top hackers. Betrayal: The leader of hacking group LulzSec has been identified as Hector Xavier Monsegur. Since his arrest last June, he has reportedly been working with the FBI to identify other members . The suspects reportedly include four LulzSec members - two men from Great Britain and two from Ireland - and one member of Anonymous - an American named Jeremy Hammond from . Chicago. Three were arrested and two were charged with conspiracy, Fox News reported. Hammond was arrested and appeared before a federal judge in Chicago before he was transferred to New York. 'This is devastating to the organization,' an FBI official told the channel. 'We’re chopping off the head of LulzSec.' The hackers have claimed to be responsible for a number of attacks on large companies, law enforcement and government agencies, including the CIA, FBI and Sony. They are believed to have caused billions of dollars in damages to corporations, banks and agencies. Members attained notoriety last May by attacking the PBS website and posting a story claiming rapper Tupac Shakur was alive and living in New Zealand. Caught: The information he provided reportedly led to charges for five top members across two continents. Four worked for LulzSec and one for Anonymous, whose supporters wear Guy Fawkes masks, as pictured . The group was allegedly led by Monsegur, who works under the alias of Sabu. The unemployed father of two was living in New York's Lower East Side when he was seized by authorities. They found his address after logging into a chatroom without masking his IP - the address which shows a user's whereabouts. Authorities launched surveillance and watched him for weeks - but were forced to move when a rival hacker revealed Monsegur's identity online. Anonymous is the umbrella term used to represent an internet subculture – a collection of online individuals, or 'hacktivists', who share common ideas of anti-censorship and freedom of speech on the internet. They have carried out cyber attacks on Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Amazon, and have threatened to take down Facebook and Twitter servers. Although it is not formerly . affiliated with it, the group has connections with the lesser-known . hacking group LulzSec. LulzSec, short for Lulz Security, is an offshoot of Anonymous and some members have been parts of both collectives . LulzSec is an elite . computer hacker group that has claimed responsibility for several . high-profile, debilitating cyber attacks. Their big hits include the compromising of user account data from Sony Pictures and taking the CIA website offline. They also attacked Fox.com, leaking . the names of more than 7,000 X Factor contestants, and the PBS Newshour . website, where they posted a story claiming that slain killer Tupac was . still living and in New Zealand. The group aims to cause mayhem as well as manipulate flaws in security and passwords systems. Fearing he would destroy his hard drives - and thus evidence needed to prove his guilt - they arrested him in June last year. He pleaded guilty to 12 counts of hacking charges on August 15. His records were unsealed today, charging him with conspiracy to engage in computer hacking, among other charges. The court papers describe him as an . 'influential member of three hacking organizations — Anonymous, Internet . Feds and Lulz Security — that were responsible for multiple cyber . attacks on the computer systems of various businesses and governments in . the United States and throughout the world'. They claim he acted as a 'rooter', a computer hacker who identified vulnerabilities in computer systems. As part of Anonymous, court . papers claim he took part cyber attacks from December 2010 until last . June, including attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPaul, and further . attacks on government computers in Tunisia, Algeria, Yemeni and . Zimbabwe. As part of Internet Feds, he is alleged to have participated in attacks against businesses including HBGary Inc., a private security firm and Fox Broadcasting Co. And he is accused of forming LulzSec last May with other hackers, who then attacked Sony, PBS and the United States Senate, among others. Monsegur was free on $50,000 bail.

The hacks had occurred four weeks . before the discovered. Using information passed on by Monsegur, the FBI . was able to work with the server company to mitigate the damage, Fox . claims. The FBI then alerted 300 government, . financial and corporate entities around the world to potential . vulnerabilities in their computer systems. Stories . have also emerged about Sabu's far-reaching power. When the CIA found . itself under siege from LulzSec hackers, Sabu, working for the . government, told them to stop, and they did. 'He's a rockstar,' a New York-based . hacker told Fox. 'All the girls, you buy them a drink, but all they want . to talk about is Sabu, Sabu, Sabu.'

'He was an admired Anon,' he told AP. 'He's been a leader. People came to him with information. God knows what else he told them.' The arrested member of Anonymous, Jeremy Hammond from Chicago, was arrested on charges of hacking and device access fraud. He reportedly caused the hacking of Stratfor Security Intelligence, which led to the leak of 200GB worth of emails then published on Wikileaks. Fox sources said Hammond will be charged in a separate indictment, and they described him as a member of Anonymous. Some of the alleged associates of the group are already facing charges elsewhere. In July, reputed LulzSec spokesman, . 18-year-old Jake Davis, was arrested in Scotland. Sources named him as . one of those facing charges in New York.

"Display: Artist impression of Saint Peter. The Vatican is to display the remains of St Peter for the first time since they were discovered in the 1940s . The Vatican is to display the remains of St Peter for the first time since they were discovered in the 1940s. The bones of the Christian martyr were found during excavations of the necropolis under St. Peter's Basilica decades ago, but have since stayed below ground. But Archbishop Rino Fisichella, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization made the announcement in Monday’s editions of L’Osservatore Romano. He said that the Catholic faithful . making a pilgrimage to St. Peter’s tomb to mark the end of the Year of . Faith will enjoy 'the exposition … of the relics traditionally . recognized as those of the apostle who gave his life for the Lord on . this spot, reported the Religious News Service. It is the Catholic belief that Peter was crucified upside down and died in either A.D. 64 or 67 on the spot now marked by the Clementine Chapel inside the basilica that bears his name. The remains were found during a 1940s excavation of mausoleums under the foundations of St. Peter's Basilica. The current basilica that now stands in the centre of Vatican City was built to replace the original structure built by Constantine, the first Christian emperor - he had built it because he believed it was where Peter was buried. Then in 1939 routine alterations under the floor of St Peter's unearthed an incredible find, reported the BBC. Archaeologists . discovered a whole street of Roman mausoleums and ornate family . tombs of both pagans and Christians dating to the early centuries AD. Discovery: The remains were found during a 1940s excavation of mausoleums under the foundations of St. Peter's Basilica (pictured) They asked for papal permission to dig . towards the high altar and when it was and there they found a simple, . shallow grave and some bones. Claim: Pope Paul VI announced the bones belong to St Peter . APeter's original tomb empty and in disarray. But after years of analysis it became apparent the bones were three different people and several animals. But it emerged years earlier one of the Vatican officials overseeing the dig had removed some bones from a niche above the grave for safe keeping. The Vatican Insider reported the bones had been inside a box. 'They . were encrusted with earth and wrapped inside a piece of purple woollen . cloth with golden thread – a particularly opulent burial. Fragments of all bones were found except those of the feet.' The bones were handed over and tests showed they were the remains of a man in his 60s or 70s and of stocky build. Written on the graffiti-covered plaster next to the bones were the words: petros emi, which means 'Peter is within'. It was Pope Paul VI who announced that the bones of St. Peter had been . found during a General Audience on 26 June 1968: 'New investigations, . most patient and accurate, were subsequently carried out with the . results that we, comforted by the judgment of qualified, prudent and . competent people, believe are positive. The relics of Saint Peter have . been identified in a way we believe convincing.' Fisichella said the veneration of the relics at the Vatican was a fitting way to conclude the Year of Faith on November 24.","Found during excavations under St. Peter's Basilica in the 1940s .

"An Australian father who is believed to have been brainwashed by the preachings of Islamic extremist Musa Cerantonio has joined the ranks of terror group Islamic State to fight in the Middle East. According to Twitter, Zia Abdul Haq's current location is in an IS-controlled area of Ash-Shaam, also known as Syria. Friends of the 33-year-old believed the man from Logan - south of Brisbane - was moving to Syria to look for a new wife after the breakdown of his marriage, but The Courier Mail has revealed Abdul Haq is in fact fighting with the extremist organisation. Scroll down for video . The friends of Zia Abdul Haq says the father-of-one, from Logan, is a 'good-hearted guy' Two of Australia's most notorious jihadists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar are part of the same group. Abdul Haq is one of the latest of three men who are believed to have joined IS, including Melbourne's Abu Khaled al-Cambodi and Mounir Raad. The 33-year-old's friends described him as a 'good-hearted guy' but had been 'brainwashed' by Cerantonio - who is believed to be an influential IS figure - after hearing the radical sheik speak in Brisbane two years ago. The 33-year-old's friends claim he was brainwashed by prominent IS supporter, Musa Cerantonio - a radical sheik . 'He wasn’t a bad guy but he fell off the rails and under the spell of the extremists,' friend Yehya El-Kholed told The Courier Mail. 'Sheik Cerantonio is a hypocrite because while he urges people to go to Syria, he won’t go himself.' Since he landed in Syria, Abdul Haq - who came to Australia in his 20s and took up a job as a finance officer - has been actively posting photos depicting life as a fighter for IS on the social media site. These include M16 training, jihadists playing violent video games and cooking up a shared meal. But like Sharrouf and Elomar, Abdul Haq - who has a young son - has used Twitter as platform to fire off threatening messages, including one to foreign forces to 'bring dead body bag for each of your soldiers'. Most recently, he took aim at the U.S. saying 'Send you (men) to fight us, your drones are useless on the ground'  and 'How come you fight #IS with your gays & lesbians army' on Saturday night. Abdul Haq has also hit back at media outlets circulating news about him. 'Many lies about me in Australian news. =/,' he tweeted within half an hour of reports emerging. Since arriving in Syria Abdul Haq has been posting photos on Twitter of what it is like being an IS fighter . Last month Musa Cerantonio was deported back to Australia from the Philippines after he was arrested after breaching the Philippines' immigration laws. Changing his name from Robert Edward, the 29-year-old was detained in the central Filipino city of Cebu where he was believed to have been hiding from Australian authorities, despite claiming on Twitter he had arrived in the Middle East just days before his arrest. He was found with a Filipino fashion designer claiming to be his wife, inside an apartment. Australian authorities cancelled his passport, triggering his arrest and leaving without any documentation. He was then set free when he arrived in Melbourne after deportation as he had not broken any Australian laws. Musa Cerantonio is thought to be an influential IS figure and Abdul Haq is believed to have taken up extremist views after hearing the sheik speak in 2012 in Brisbane .","Zia Abdul Haq is believed to be fighting in Syria for the terror group .

"Freezing Britain was last night facing the unprecedented prospect of gas rationing.A combination of bitterly cold weather and pipeline failures has left the energy grid at breaking point. The country has less than 36 hours of gas reserves remaining and one energy expert warned yesterday that if the cold snap continues, rationing is ‘inevitable’. If this happens, businesses and power stations will be restricted first, but then householders will be ordered to cut down on the amount of gas they use for heating their homes. Britain’s gas stores are dangerously low as unexpectedly low temperatures have forced people to keep their heating on. The crisis deepened yesterday when a crucial undersea pipeline connecting Britain and Belgium shut down without warning, pushing the price of gas up by 50 per cent to a record high. Ships bringing desperately needed supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar are still more than two days away, and could be delayed further because of the bad weather. The looming national energy crisis also threatens to push up household bills for hard-pressed families. The Government admitted gas supplies were under pressure, but Downing Street  said David Cameron was ‘confident’ that  they would not run out. But energy analysts warned that with the freezing conditions set to last into next month the consequences were ‘worrying’. Ann Robinson, analyst for uSwitch, said: ‘If this dreadful weather continues for the next two or three weeks we should be very worried, because if we get into a position where we do run out of gas there is not a lot that can be done in the short term. Running low: Britain's gas reserves could run out in 36 hours ¿ leaving the country dependent on costly foreign imports. ‘Rationing would be inevitable, for businesses and domestic users and maybe for gas-powered electricity producers as well, so we might be looking at electricity rationing too.’ She said the Government’s response to the crisis had been ‘very complacent’. Angelos Anastasiou, from investment bank Liberum Capital, added: ‘There’s a bit from the pipes and there’s LNG but that’s it. There isn’t any more. I would say rationing is a distinct possibility. We’re not there just yet, but it’s a distinct possibility.’ Energy Minister John Hayes said the issue was ‘a priority’ and confirmed he has held ‘discussions with industry and others about gas security’. Michelle Mitchell, Age UK’s charity director general, highlighted fears for the elderly if the gas shortages become a reality. She said: ‘This continuing bitter weather is a major threat to the health of older people, and older people need to know their gas supplies are guaranteed. Age UK would like the Government and the industry to offer them some public reassurance this weekend that the UK’s gas will continue to flow.’ The crisis was sparked early yesterday morning when a water pump failed at one of the four underwater pipelines that connect the UK and the Continent. The pipeline from Belgium, which has the capacity to supply around a fifth of the UK’s gas needs, was immediately shut down by operator Interconnector UK. The group said it ‘has a technical issue at its Bacton terminal which stopped gas flow into the UK’. It began pumping gas at a reduced rate later in the morning, but had to shut operations again completely in the afternoon. The full flow did not begin until late afternoon, and no one from Interconnector UK was last night able to say how much gas had been lost as a result of the outage. The other pipelines – two from Norway and one from the Netherlands – were open during the day, although one is due to be shut down at the beginning of April for routine maintenance. The daily price of gas rocketed to 150p a therm – up from Thursday’s price of 100p. It is the highest level ever seen in the UK gas markets, according to traders. It came just hours after it emerged that the UK’s domestic gas stores have fallen to a new low after  millions of households turned up their heating. The stores are now more than 90 per cent empty and have less than two days’ worth of gas remaining. They are forecast to be completely empty by early next month. AS well as dwindling North Sea reserves, gas is running low in Britain because of the ‘limited’ size of storage facilities. This means the UK is in a worse position than other EU countries when families turn up the heating to cope with cold winters. At full capacity, Britain’s storage infrastructure can stockpile enough gas for up to 20 days. This compares with more than 100 days in France, 92 days in  Germany and 70 days in Italy. The US protects itself against gas shortages by storing contingencies for up to six months. The historic lack of storage facilities and a failure to attract investment to build new ones has helped create the current crisis. One reason for the lack of storage facilities is that the importing of gas, whether from the North Sea or overseas, fluctuates throughout the year. In the UK, more gas is shipped in during the winter and is effectively dumped straight into the national grid so people can heat their homes. In the summer, demand drops off as householders switch off the heating. This has been the case since British Gas began exploiting the resource in the 1960s. Consequently the country has never needed huge storage facilities. On the continent, the supply of gas is ‘flatter’, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, so bigger stockpiles build up during the summer. This means countries such as Germany have bigger storage facilities. Analysts warned that higher gas prices now could push up long-term rates for next winter, adding 15 per cent, or more than £200, to the average family bill. Apart from the North Sea, Britain’s only other source of gas comes from the volatile Gulf state of Qatar. The next delivery is not due for another two days, it is understood. Ships can take two and a half weeks from leaving Qatar to arriving in Britain, and can often be delayed further by having to stop off to deliver at other ports. Energy analyst Peter Atherton said: ‘When you run out of storage, National Grid will need to start reining demand back in. ‘You get cases where ships are told to turn around and go back because Japan is willing to pay more. We can get LNG here, but we will be bidding against the rest of the world. We can get it, but we will have to pay the price.’ National Grid has protocols for gas shortages, designed to stop households being affected immediately. Power stations which run on gas are the first to be rationed. ‘They can do that to keep the lights on because we have coal and oil-run power stations which can be ramped up to meet demand,’ said Mr Atherton. But next month many of the UK’s coal and oil plants come offline to meet green regulations handed down by the EU, and will not be available as a stop-gap if another shortfall arises next winter. After the power stations, heavy industry and factories will see gas use sanctioned. Only after that has been tried will other businesses be asked to reduce usage – with households last on the list to face rations. ‘The answer is that we need more storage,’ said Mr Atherton. ‘We need to have enough to get through a winter if something happens to the interconnector pipes. Can we get through the winter on our own supplies? Other European countries can, but we certainly can’t.’ A Department of Energy spokesman said: ‘In the unlikely event of a gas supply emergency, Government and industry have in place well-rehearsed plans to ensure that gas supplies can continue, so that gas consumers would not be cut off.’ Mr Hayes said: ‘Protracted cold weather increases demand, but the UK gas market is functioning well and our gas needs are continuing to be met. Gas storage could never be the whole answer, so to think purely in terms of how many days’ supply is in storage, is unwise. We have relied on a diverse range of sources for many years.’ But Joe Conlan, of the Inenco energy consultancy, said: ‘There is a very real prospect of running out, especially given the colder weather forecast for next week, the long, cold winter and disruptions to supply as a result of a very intensive period of maintenance in Norway.’ He warned there was still a risk customers might be asked to rein in their gas use next week. His calculations suggest the UK has just one and half day’s gas supply in storage. He said: ‘The next week is critical.’The Department for Work and Pensions has made £4million in cold weather payments to help vulnerable people pay their bills during March. Not a penny was paid this month last year. Price rise: The shortfall is likely to push up the long-term price of gas and could result in household tariffs rising by up to 15 per cent before next winter .","Plunging temperatures forced millions to turn up their heating .

But now families buy these big items on the internet and Tesco has cancelled a planned 100 new stores in what it calls the ‘end of the  space race’. Managing director Chris Bush said yesterday: ‘Watford represents a fundamental change  in the way  people are doing their shopping. It offers us a glimpse into what stores of the future might look like.’ But praise was not universal. One critic tweeted: ‘This new Tesco store just looks like an absolute mish-mash mess. Either go for the fully bespoke look or don’t.’ 'Retail innovation': The newly revamped home department at the Tesco branch in Watford - the first to be transformed .

"Carlos Vela scored twice in his first international appearance since 2011 as Mexico exacted revenge for their controversial World Cup exit with a 3-2 victory against Holland. And Vela was quick to get back on the scoresheet as Miguel Herrera's men held out for an exciting win. The former Arsenal man put the visitors in front with a superb strike in the eighth minute and added a second goal in the 60th after Wesley Sneijder's sublime long-range equaliser. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Holland 2-3 Mexico: Sneijder and Blind goals . Mexico upset Holland with a 3-2 victory at the Amsterdam ArenA in their international friendly . Holland: Krul, Van Rhijn, Vlaar (De Vrij 24), Veltman, Willems, Blind, Afellay (Wijnaldum 68), Sneijder (Fer 81), Huntelaar, Depay (Promes 60), Robben. Subs Not Used: Cillessen, van der Wiel, Bruma, Narsingh, De Jong, Vermeer. Booked: De Vrij. Goals: Sneijder 49, Blind 74. Mexico: Ochoa, Aguilar, Reyes, Miguel Herrera (Corona 61), Alanis, Aldrete, Vazquez (Rodriguez 89), Hector Herrera (Dominguez 81), Guardado (Ponce 87), Vela (Giovani 76), Hernandez (Jimenez 76). Subs Not Used: Talavera, Jonathan, Gonzalez, Venegas, Corral. Booked: Alanis, Ochoa, Aguilar. Goals: Vela 8, 62, Hernandez 69. Javier Hernandez dribbled past goalkeeper Tim Krul to add a third with a simple finish after 69 minutes before Daley Blind's deflected long-range shot five minutes later reduced the deficit. Defeat heaps more pressure on Dutch coach Guus Hiddink, who has come under increased scrutiny, after  defeat at the Amsterdam ArenA subjected them to a fourth loss in five matches since a third-placed finish at the World Cup. The last time a Dutch manager lost four of his first five games was also Hiddink during his first reign in 1995. Since taking over from Louis van Gaal, the former Chelsea boss has only three points from three Euro 2016 qualifying games. Holland turn their attention back to qualifying for Euro 2016 when they face Latvia in a Group A contest on Sunday. With one eye on that fixture Hiddink rested Robin Van Persie who reported a slight injury, but named an otherwise strong side, but Mexico emerged victorious - unlike the dramatic finish to their World Cup last 16 game in Fortaleza. Last week Hiddink told a press conference he would quit if Holland fail to beat Latvia - just three months after succeeding Louis van Gaal as coach. Holland are third in their Euro 2016 qualifying Group A, six points behind joint group leaders Iceland and the Czech Republic.

"Freezing Britain's unusually harsh winter could have cost thousands of pensioners their lives. This month is on track to be the coldest March for 50 years – and as the bitter Arctic conditions caused blackouts and traffic chaos yesterday, experts warned of an 'horrendous' death toll among the elderly. About 2,000 extra deaths were registered in just the first two weeks of March compared with the average for the same period over the past five years. Whiteout: Blizzards caused huge snow drifts leaving these cars nearly completely covered in Hadfield, Derbyshire . Blizzards: The Peak District was one of the worst affected areas as blizzards swept the UK overnight . And for February, 3,057 extra deaths were registered in England and Wales compared with the five-year average for the month. Campaigners at Age UK, which says 26,000 people die needlessly in winter every year, said the current weather could prove deadly for thousands more. Director general Michelle Mitchell said: 'Colder, harsher winters tend to lead to an increase in life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks and strokes which in turn leads to a high rate of excess winter deaths. 'For every one degree drop in average temperature, there are around 8,000 extra deaths.' The Office for National Statistics said the extra death rate 'could be to do with the prolonged period of cold weather we've been experiencing.' But it cautioned that it was too early to make an absolute link. The March figures are still provisional. Malcolm Booth, chief executive of the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners, said that last month almost 700 of his members had died, compared with 250 last year. 'If our membership is a representative sample that was replicated across the general population, then we could be looking at a horrendous number when all the figures are in,' he said.

Tight squeeze: A motorist drives slowly past another vehicle that has been trapped in snow near Belfast . 'An increase in fuel costs and the extended winter means that more people are going to suffer, and more will be unable to afford to eat and heat their homes. It's a scary prospect.' It is not just pensioners who are at risk. The body of a 27-year-old man who went missing while walking home from a night out was found in deep snow in farmland near Burnley, Lancashire, yesterday afternoon. Police said the man would not be named until all family members had been informed. Chief Inspector Derry Crorken of Burnley Police said: 'Early indications suggest that it is a very tragic incident where a young man has been out with friends and has become caught up in the weather last night on his journey home.

A soldier stands on guard during a snow shower on the first day the soldiers are wearing their summer red tunics outside Buckingham Palace . 'I would urge people to only go out if it is necessary.' Blizzards and power cuts wreaked havoc across large parts of the country yesterday, leaving snowdrifts of up to 15ft in Cumbria and night-time temperatures plunging to -7C (19F) in the Pennines. Power lines were down in Northern Ireland, Scotland and North Wales, leaving 50,000 homes without electricity. Ulster was hardest-hit, with 29,000 properties without power and 1,000 without water. The transport network was also crippled. East Midlands, Leeds, Robin Hood (Doncaster) and Humberside Airports were all forced temporarily to close runways for snow and ice to be cleared. Train services in the North-West were severely hit and even major roads were treacherous. In Cumbria 70 people were put up in a school after being stranded in their cars on the A595. A woman walking in the snow in Birmingham city centre . In North Wales, the Red Cross was brought in to transport vital medical staff to hospitals in 4x4 vehicles because the snow had made roads off limits to normal cars. The M62 near Rochdale was closed for a time but gritters were out to ensure the route between Manchester and West Yorkshire remained open overnight. Yesterday's sporting programme was also badly hit, with Northern Ireland's football World Cup qualifier against Russia called off for the second time in 24 hours as Belfast's Windsor Park was unplayable. Elsewhere, seven Football League games in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the North were cancelled and race meetings at Doncaster and Newbury were abandoned. Theme parks at Alton Towers and Drayton Manor Park closed, too. The Environment Agency had 59 flood alerts in place last night, covering the Midlands, East Anglia, the south east and the south west. Hundreds of schools were forced to close on Friday and many were expected to remain closed tomorrow, causing headaches for parents. Weathermen forecast that the harsh conditions would gradually diminish over the coming week but a biting wind from the east would ensure temperatures remain at 4-6C (39-42F), well below the seasonal average of 11C (52F). Greg Dewhurst of the Met Office said: 'While the rain, sleet and snow will peter out, it will still feel very cold because of strong easterly winds. The signals are that temperatures will start to return to normal after Easter.' The weather is also taking its toll on retailers, especially fashion chains where spring lines are remaining on the racks. For DIY chains and garden centres, this is normally one of the most important months. But Mandy Murphy of the British Retail Consortium said: 'Bad weather could feed through to sales being poorer than hoped for over the big bank holiday weekend.' It is all in stark contrast to the  same time 12 months ago, when sunbathers swamped beaches as temperatures hit 22C (71F), sparking fears of a possible drought.","2,000 extra deaths registered in just the first two weeks of March .

"After six disappointingly damp years, 2013 finally saw the return of the Great British Summer. As we celebrated those long, hot days of July and August, the country’s  wildlife was thriving too. And no species took more advantage of the balmy weather than the butterfly – the real wildlife winner of the year. natures winners and losers in 2013 . Sightings increased by an average of 80 per cent during the summer’s three official counts. Matthew Oates, a wildlife specialist at the National Trust, said: ‘It has been a fantastic year for butterflies. ‘They are one of nature’s true opportunists and they will exploit good weather ferociously.’ The cabbage white was one species that did particularly well, and conservationists were excited to see the rare long-tailed blue nesting in Kent. The extended period of warm and dry weather also saw a boom in moths, bees, crickets and grasshoppers, despite the cold,  late spring. The tree bumblebee, which spread to the UK from Europe in 2001, expanded  considerably – crossing north of Hadrian’s Wall for the first time. Conditions were perfect for plants like orchids, which flowered successfully in the meadows of southern England and Wales. The cool spring provided a long flowering season for early bloomers such as snowdrops,  primroses and bluebells. Fluttering upwards: There was an increase in sightings of the cabbage white butterfly, pictured, as well as the long-tail blue . Later in the year, there was an explosion of berries, nuts and seeds, particularly mistletoe,  followed by huge numbers of mushroom varieties. However, the cold, late spring meant food was in short supply for migrant birds such as swallows and martins. It was one of the worst years on record for barn owls, with less than 1,000 breeding pairs compared with the usual 4,000. And lack of nourishment hit breeding frogs and toads and mammals coming out of hibernation. A slug population decimated by a triple whammy of a cold winter, long spring and hot summer was good news for gardeners, who faced an infestation of the pests last year. But it also cut the number of aphids, which are an important food source for seven-spot ladybirds, hoverflies and  birds like tits that feed on them. However, Mr Oates said 2013 was still ‘one of the most remarkable wildlife years in living memory’, with more winners than losers. ‘The way our butterflies and other sun-loving insects bounced back in July was utterly amazing, showing nature’s powers of recovery at their best,’ he said. ‘Great wildlife experiences make special places extra special. Best of all, this year has set up 2014 very nicely.’","Warm summer sees number of butterflies increase in Britain .

"So where does Bradford City’s shock 4-2 victory at Premier League leaders Chelsea rank in the history of FA Cup upsets? There is one man better placed than most to tell us. Here, Match of the Day’s John Motson – who has commentated on the competition since 1972 – runs Sportsmail though his 10 greatest FA Cup giant-killing acts... BBC commentator John Motson has been working on FA Cup games for more than 40 years . 10. York 1 Arsenal 0, Fourth Round, 1985 . There was snow on the pitch but York fancied their chances because manager Denis Smith got a load of volunteers in on the morning of the game to clear it. It was goalless with five minutes left when York got a penalty and Keith Houchen put it away. He then disappeared for a couple of years before popping up and scoring for Coventry in the 87 Final. 9. Bournemouth 2 Manchester United 0, Third Round, 1984 . Ron Atkinson’s United were holders but they got turned over good and proper by Third Division Bournemouth, whose manager was a young Harry Redknapp. United even had England captain Bryan Robson in their side, but Redknapp’s team were deserved winners and scored twice in five minutes after half-time through Milton Graham and Ian Thompson. Milton Graham cracks Manchester United's defence to score Bournemouth's first goal at Dean Court in 1984 . Graham lands and makes his way up off the turf to celebrate his memorable goal in the FA Cup third round . 8. Walsall 2 Arsenal 0, Third Round, 1933 . Herbert Chapman’s team were the outstanding side in the country and this is the greatest pre-war FA Cup upset. Arsenal were so humiliated by Third Division Walsall that, on the train home, Chapman sacked the defender who gave away one of the goals. 7. Wrexham 2 Arsenal 1, Third Round, 1992 . Arsenal were First Division champions at the time and this game had everything, brilliant goals, disallowed goals and drama until the last. Micky Thomas scored that belter of a free-kick into the top corner to equalise before Steve Watkin got the winner two minutes from the end – but there was still time for Arsenal to have a goal ruled out. Micky Thomas (centre), scorer of Wrexham's first, passes David Rowcastle  of Arsenal in 1992 . Steve Watkin (right) scores the winning goal to produce a miraculous FA Cup upset at the Racehorse Ground . 6. Burnley 0 Wimbledon 1, Third Round, 1975 . This was the first time in 55 years that a non-league team beat a First Division side on their own ground. Dave Bassett played for Wimbledon and Dickie Guy – who is club president to this day – was in goal. 5. Sunderland 1 Leeds 0, Final, 1973 . I was at the Leeds hotel on the morning of the game and they were awfully tense. Sunderland, on the other hand, were relaxed and laughing and joking. They were a Second Division side and no-one gave them a chance. But they gave Don Revie’s superstars a helluva game and, although Ian Porterfield got the goal, it’s Jim Montgomery’s double save which stands out in my memory. The late Ian Porterfield (fifth right) fires the winning goal past Leeds United goalkeeper David Harvey . Sunderland's captain Bobby Kerr holds the FA Cup trophy aloft at Wembley in May 1973 . 4. Yeovil 2 Sunderland 1, Fourth Round, 1949 . Sunderland weren’t just a First Division side, they were known as the “Bank of England Club” of that era for the huge sums of money they’d spent on the team. Yeovil, meanwhile, were in the Southern League. Player-manager Alec Stock was a real character, he scored for Yeovil and he went on to manage Fulham in the 1975 Cup Final. 3. Chelsea 2 Bradford 4, Fourth Round, 2015 . Now this would have still been a shock if Bradford had won at Valley Parade – but factor in Chelsea leading 2-0 at Stamford Bridge and it is quite remarkable. Jose Mourinho had never lost an FA cup match at home and, for me, this ranks as one of the greatest upsets of all time. Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Petr Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . Bradford's players celebrate their amazing comeback after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge . 2. Sutton 2 Coventry 1, Third Round, 1989 . I did this game and I remember Sutton had been practising corners all morning and hadn’t scored from one – then Tony Rains puts them ahead from a corner and Matthew Hanlan scores the winner from a corner. Their manager, Barrie Williams, was a character, a pipe-smoking and poetry-quoting old-school boss. And Coventry, don’t forget, had won the cup just 19 months earlier. Sutton's Matthew Hanlan (No 11) scores the winning goal against Coventry in the FA Cup third round in 1989 . Sutton goalscorers Tony Rains and Hanlan celebrate with champagne after the final whistle . 1. Hereford 2 Newcastle 1, Third Round, 1972 . People forget that non-league Hereford had already drawn 2-2 at Newcastle to earn a replay. Ronnie Radford scored his famous rocket and that has to be the most replayed goal in the history of the competition. I was there and this game is everything which is brilliant about the FA Cup, the pitch was a bog and Newcastle’s superstars such as Malcolm Macdonald had been spouting off in the press, but they got their comeuppance alright. Hereford United fans and players rush to Ronnie Radford after his screamer took the game to extra time .

"Sunderland fans have had to fight sleep more than any other supporters to catch their team on the main Match of the Day programme so far this season. Gus Poyet's team have occupied the bottom slot - which usually airs close to or just after midnight - seven times, once more than goal-shy Aston Villa and twice more than Crystal Palace and Swansea. The one time Black Cats fans did get to see their side in the prized opening slot was the 8-0 drubbing at Southampton on October 18. They also lost both times they were on second - at home to Arsenal on October 25 and at Manchester City on New Year's Day. Sunderland have featured in the final game of Match of the Day on seven occasions this season . Match of the Day's Gary Lineker is among a collection of people consulted before the running order is decided . BBC's legendary programme Match of the Day celebrated its 50th anniversary last season . Sunderland have topped the bill only once and that was when they were beaten 8-0 by Southampton . The BBC's head of football, Mark Cole, thinks the statistic could bode well for the 16th-placed Wearsiders. He said: 'It's not personal. We've got a couple of Sunderland fans in the office and the chap who does all our stats is a Sunderland fan so he's keeping a particular eye on it. 'If they're on last by the end of the season the most, then it means they'll still be in the Premier League, because they won't be drawn into those big relegation battles that feature highly in the programme.' League leaders Chelsea have been on first the most so far - seven times - when looking at every Saturday night Match of the Day Premier League highlights programme since the start of the season, plus the three festive editions on Boxing Day, December 28 and New Year's Day. We looked at every Saturday night Premier League highlights programme, plus the three festive editions on Boxing Day, December 28 and New Year's Day of Match of the Day this season to see how popular your team is... ARSENAL: Arsene's entertainers have featured in the top three on nine occasions, and have never been on last. ASTON VILLA: The Premier League's lowest scorers have been bottom of the bill six times - once less than Sunderland. They have not featured in the top match all season - only Stoke can match that - but have been in the top three five times. BURNLEY: Sean Dyche's men were first on in the last Saturday night highlights show on January 17 against Crystal Palace, with the reverse fixture at Selhurst Park bottom of the bill on September 13. CHELSEA: Jose Mourinho's men are top of the league and top of the bill more than anyone else - seven first-place appearances so far. CRYSTAL PALACE: The Eagles' win at Burnley on January 17 is their one and only appearance in top spot so far. They have been last on five times. EVERTON: Top of the bill twice in as many weeks in late August with a 2-2 draw against Arsenal and a 6-3 defeat against Chelsea, both at Goodison Park. They have not been back in top spot since. HULL: Three appearances in top spot for the Tigers - two in consecutive weekends on September 20 and 27 - but no wins. Three appearances in the bottom spot too. LEICESTER: The Foxes may be bottom of the table but curiously have been third on more than any other side - five times in total. LIVERPOOL: The Reds finished second in the Premier League last season but their comparative struggles this time around are reflected by the fact that they have been on last three times. MANCHESTER CITY: The Blues have featured first five times - second only to Chelsea - and in the top three 15 times, more than any other club. MANCHESTER UNITED: Louis van Gaal's men have only topped the bill twice, and have featured in the top three six times in their 11 appearances in the shows surveyed. NEWCASTLE: A very even spread for the Magpies - three times in top spot, including the day they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season on December 6, twice second, twice third and twice last. QPR: They may be 19th but their four appearances in the top slot is second only to the league's top two Chelsea and Manchester City. Only one appearance at the bottom of the bill. SOUTHAMPTON: Saints have been first on just once - the 8-0 hammering of Sunderland - and have made only two further appearances in the top three, despite being third in the league. STOKE: Along with Villa the only side yet to feature in the top match. Six top-three appearances and three bottom-of-the-bill showings for the Potters. SUNDERLAND: Appear to have drawn the short straw. Last on the programme a table-topping seven times, with one win and four defeats to show from their five top-three appearances, with one of those losses the pasting at St Mary's. SWANSEA: Garry Monk's men may be irked to discover that they have been bottom of the bill more than any other side in the top half - five times in total. It all started so well - they were first on with their win at Old Trafford on the opening day. TOTTENHAM: Spurs' appearances in the programmes covered by our survey have been limited to 11 this season, primarily caused by their Europa League involvement, but just four top-three appearances in total does still seem a rather slim return. WEST BROM: Despite their struggles this season, the Baggies have not featured in the bottom spot once. They have been on first three times so far, but all three matches were defeats. WEST HAM: The highest-placed side to feature at the bottom of the bill - their 0-0 draw with Villa at Upton Park on November 8. Chelsea have been top of the bill more than any club this season, with Manchester City up next and then QPR . Diego Costa's Chelsea top the Premier League table as well as the Match of the Day bill this season . Costa, who joined Chelsea from Atletcio Madrid in the summer, has scored 17 times for the league leaders . The running order for each week's Match of the Day is a hot topic amongst supporters and how it is decided is top on the list of 'Frequently Asked Questions' on the MOTD website. Explaining the process, Cole said: 'At the start of the week the editor will have a plan of how he expects it to pan out and the length of each individual match to make sure you can fit it in that BBC1 slot. Then it's constantly changing. 'At half-time you'll perhaps have another look, and then at full-time. There's also the added complication of a 5.30pm game most Saturdays so you'll have a plan and then it can be thrown out of the window by what happens in that game. 'It's a collective operation but essentially it's the editor's decision, so he'll make that decision after talking to the presenter, the pundits, some of the match directors. Manchester United and QPR have topped the Match of the Day bill on six occasions between them this term . Arsenal, in action during their recent win over Manchester City, have featured first on just two occasions . 'What you're trying to look at in a nutshell is what game do people sat at home at 10.30pm on a Saturday night want to watch most? 'There's a combination of factors that go into that. People want to see the teams at the top, there's interest in relegation battles, but also what the game's been like. Goals do have a massive impact in where you are in the running order for Match of the Day.' The rise of social media has enabled fans to interact directly with the programme, its main presenter, Gary Lineker, and pundits. The running order is now announced on Twitter ahead of the programme on a Saturday evening and flagged up throughout the broadcast. Cole said: 'Certainly the advent of Twitter and social media has made it even more hotly contested and fans aren't backward in coming forward to let us know their views. Crystal Palace, 13th in the Premier League table, have been last on Match of the Day five times . Peter Crouch celebrating for Stoke against QPR in September. The Potters have never been on first this year . 'But all we try and do is be honest and say that we're looking at it from people at home's point of view and what games they want to watch. 'We think it's important we take each programme on its merits. Across the course of the season, each team should have their time in the spotlight, certainly if they score some goals. Last season 19 out of the 20 clubs led the programme, and this season 18 have halfway through it. 'It's great to have people talking about your programme and we love social media. You have got to be careful not to take some of the comments personally. 'Match of the Day is an institution and it's absolutely phenomenal the way people still watch a highlights programme. It's when people aren't talking about you that you get worried.' Manchester City have been on first the second-most times (five) and have appeared in the top three games more than any other side - 15 times in total to Chelsea's 13. Manchester United have been first on only twice - two times fewer than second-bottom QPR - but along with Tottenham have been on the main programme the fewest times - with only 11 appearances.","Sunderland have occupied the bottom slot on seven occasions this term .

"A Wisconsin lawmaker plans to hand out Klu Klux Klan hoods at a Republican convention in his state this weekend in protest of what he believes are 'racist policies.' Democratic gubernatorial candidate and Wisconsin state representative Brett Hulsey tweeted a picture on Thursday night of the homemade white, cloth hats he plans to hand out. Hulsey said on twitter the hats were meant to bring attention to issues like racial profiling, which he says Republican Governor Scott Walker and the Republican Party of Wisconsin support.

Under parental rights laws, Miss Allman must send letters and photos of the five-year-olds to her attacker three times a year and will be held in contempt of court if she refuses. Miss Allman, who still bears the scars of her ordeal, said yesterday that she is being wrongly made to feel like a criminal. ‘We are the victims, not him,’ she said. ‘I thought he was going to kill me that night for no reason and my boys saw that. They were terrified,’ she added. A judge has ordered Ms Allman to send three letters a year to Hughes, updating him on their five-year-old boys, pictured in 2012,  and including photographs of the children every Easter, September and December . On February 3, 2011, as Ms Allman lay in bed, Hughes launched the terrifying seven-hour attack on his ex, attempting to smother her with a pillow before repeatedly bludgeoning her with a dumb bell . Ms Allman had suffered eight wounds to her head and five fractures to her face bones. She also needed cosmetic surgery to rebuild her throat . ‘I’m so angry that the law still defends his parental rights and that he is still being allowed to control us from behind bars.’ Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 deals with the arrangements for children after the break down of their parents' relationship. Should a disagreement arise between the parents, they can apply to the court for a residence or contact order to be drawn up in respect of their children. A contact order requires the parent, or other person, who the child lives with to allow a named individual to have contact with the child. It is usually used to maintain the child's links with both parents after the end of their relationship. This contact can be 'direct', meaning it is face-to-face, ‘indirect’, which may involve telephone calls, emails or letter; supervised by a third party; or the child may be able to stay overnight with the person named in the order. The order would usually define the frequency, duration, time and place of the visits, or the nature and frequency of contact by telephone, letter or other means. Sometimes the parent the child lives with may also be required to  provide school reports or other information on their son or daughter. If the order is breached, a court has the power to impose a fine of up to £2,50029 or a custodial sentence of up to two years. Hughes, 42, was jailed for nine years in 2012 following the brutal attack at the couple’s home in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, the year before. He had flown into a jealous rage when Miss Allman dumped him just two months before they planned to marry, telling Hughes that she was seeing somebody else. The former reservist, who had an alcohol addiction, attempted to smother her with a pillow before repeatedly bludgeoning her with a dumb bell and slashing her throat. Hughes, who was trained to use bayonets and knives in the Army, only let Miss Allman call an ambulance after seven hours. Officers arrived to find their terrified sons, then two, in bed with their mother covered in blood. Miss Allman suffered horrific wounds and needed cosmetic surgery on her throat, but later rebuilt her life and had another child with a new partner. But in January last year Hughes applied for a residence and contact order under the Children Act of 1989, demanding six letters a year as well as phone calls. Despite spending £3,000 fighting the order, a judge ordered Miss Allman to send three letters a year on the children’s school progress, health and emotional development or face a fine or jail. Hughes was given permission to send them one letter a year as well as cards at birthdays and Christmas. Miss Allman said she is sickened by letters she has already received from Hughes, which she says describe how he is allowed to play on an Xbox games console and work as a bee-keeper. She has been told to keep them in case the boys want to read them one day. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it. ‘I could end up being split up from my children and sent to prison when he was the one who attacked me. I’m the one being treated like a criminal.’ Although she is sickened by the letters,  Ms Allman has been told she must keep them in case her sons want to read them when they are older .","Natalie Allman, 29, was battered with a dumb-bell by Jason Hughes, 42 .

"Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's re-election campaign risked a Scrooge image last week with a Black Friday promotion asking parents to make campaign contributions instead of buying their children Christmas presents. 'Instead of electronics or toys that will . undoubtedly be outdated, broken, or lost by the next Holiday Season,' a Walker re-election campaign email instructed, 'help give your children the gift of a Wisconsin that we can all be proud . of.' It was 'a Black Friday special that is better than any deal . found in stores,' the campaign claimed: 'Donate $5, $10 or $25 to help Governor Walker get . reelected and save your children from a future of double-digit tax . increases and billion dollar budget deficits.' Walker is riding a wave of popularity in his home state that has political wags speculating about a presidential run in 2016. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's re-election campaign asked moms and dads to raid their children's Christmas gift funds for political contributions . Walker's deputy campaign finance director claimed Wisconsin children would be better off with a Republican governor than with 'electronics or toys' on Christmas Day . Taylor Palmisano, who has served as the campaign's deputy finance director since July, signed the email. She did not respond to requests for comment. The liberal blog Cognitive Dissonance first published the fundraising solicitation. It compared the effort to news reports about a Cleveland, Ohio Wal-Mart that asked its employees for food donations to benefit their lower-income coworkers, and a union-driven publicity stunt that advised low-wage McDonald's employees to return their Christmas gifts and pay off their debts instead. But another political campaign pioneered the tactic last year. Obama For America, the president's re-election campaign, introduced its Obama Gift Registry in June 2012. The organization asked Democratic voters to 'register with Obama 2012, and ask for a donation in lieu of a gift' for their birthdays, bar or bat mitzvahs, weddings and anniversaries. 'Instead of another gift card you’ll forget to use,' the campaign wrote on Obama's trailblazing e-commerce website, 'ask your friends and family for something that will go a little further: a donation to Obama for America.' Real: The president's 2012 re-election campaign asked supporters to decline birthday, wedding and anniversary gifts, and send Barack Obama the proceeds instead . Spoof: Conservatives mocked the Obama team in 2012 by circulating a fake campaign announcement asking Obama voters to opt for cremation instead of burial when they die ? and send the savings to the president's campaign . Not real: Anti-Obama forces responded in 2012 with a plea for expectant parents to name their kids 'Barack' or 'Michelle' -- and make a symbolic donation, in the tyke's name, of course . Obama's campaign organization was renamed 'Organizing For Action' in 2013, and still hosts the fundraising stunt on its website. The urban legend-debunking website Snopes confirmed in July 2012 that the Obama effort was the real thing. Conservatives were quick to mock it at the time, spoofing the Obama Gift Registry with a series of parodies that quickly went viral. One, an Obama Cremation Registry, appeared to ask Obama supporters to opt for cremation instead of a more expensive burial or their dearly departed loved ones – and send the savings to the Obama campaign. 'Your loved ones will thank you – from the grave,' the comedic piece joked. Another conservative skewering was a fictitious Obama Baby Name registry, asking expectant parents to name their new children 'Barack' or 'Michelle,' mark the occasion with a $100 donation to the president's campaign, and enter a drawing for $1,000. 'Your decision to terminate a pregnancy before the election does NOT affect your odds of winning the grand prize,' snarked the lampoon's authors. The fundraising email was signed by campaign deputy finance director Taylor Palmisano (L). Walker hopes to beat back a challenge from Democrat Mary Burke (R), a former mountain bike company executive . Gov. Walker's most likely Democratic opponent in 2014 has attracted her own share of scorn. Former Trek bicycle company executive Mary Burke got a PR black eye in November when the U.S. Department of Labor ruled that as many as 20 former Trek employees were eligible for federal aid because the company eliminated their jobs by outsourcing more of its work to China. Walker swept into power, and survived a union-bankrolled recall effort, on the strength of labor policies that Democrats opposed bitterly. The state's Republican Party has come down on the side of businesses that choose to outsource jobs to save money. The governor has made some pundits' short-lists of potential GOP presidential candidates, claiming during a book tour that the White House's next occupant should be a governor, not a member of Congress.. 'It’s got to be somebody who’s viewed as being exceptionally removed from Washington,' he told ABC News, adding that 'I don’t rule anything out' when it comes to his future political aspirations.","Scott Walker campaign fundraising email said his re-election would be a better gift to children than toys or electronic gadgets .

"Catherine Mayer’s controversial biography claims both Charles and Princess Diana had to be ‘coaxed to the altar’. The Prince and his fiancée had cold feet about the wedding and he reportedly told an adviser on the eve of the ceremony: ‘I can’t go through with it’. The Prince was worried he was rushing into a marriage and Lady Diana knew the Prince had feelings for Camilla Parker Bowles. The Prince and his fiancée had cold feet about the wedding and he reportedly told an adviser on the eve of the ceremony: ‘I can’t go through with it’ Mayer, whose unauthorised biography ‘Charles: Heart of a King’ is published on Thursday, quotes one of the Prince’s confidants as saying that on the eve of the wedding in 1982 he ‘was desperate’. The Telegraph reported last night how the Prince had been engaged to Lady Diana Spencer for five months after a brief courtship but she was ‘not the jolly country girl he had assumed’ but a complicated, vulnerable woman suffering from an eating disorder. He is said to have told his aide: ‘I can’t go through with it, I can’t do it’. The Prince was worried he was rushing into a marriage and Lady Diana knew the Prince had feelings for Camilla Parker Bowles (pictured with Charles) Diana found a bracelet meant for the Duchess of Cornwall which had the initials GF engraved – which she believed stood for the pet names ‘Gladys’ and ‘Fred’ they had given each other. An alternative suggestion was that it was another nickname he had for Camilla - ‘Girl Friday’. Her own pre-wedding wobbles have been well reported over the years. Diana told biographer, Andrew Morton, that she told her sisters: ‘I can’t marry him, I can’t do this, this is absolutely unbelievable.’ They said it was too late for her to change her mind as her ‘face is already on the tea towels’. Mayer said: ‘She had no idea her bridegroom also had to be coaxed to the altar’. Catherine Mayer, author of the controversial biography which is published on Thursday, said she hoped the first in line to the throne liked the book but said she thought it was 'unlikely.' 'There's a real substantial gap between the public perception of Prince Charles and who he is and what he has done,' she told This Morning. 'People often define him as against Diana but in many ways they resemble each other in their impulse to make things better.' Catherine Mayer told This Morning she hoped the Prince liked her biography but thought it was unlikely . Miss Mayer said she wrote the book after writing a cover piece for Time and had remarkably little access to the Prince for the piece, often speaking to contacts and his friends. She added: 'He is an extremely charitable entrepreneur with a most complex belief system and philosophy, which actually appears in his own book.' Miss Mayer said despite public belief the Prince was 'naive' at the time of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, having grown up in what she calls 'Planet Windsor' - 'a chilly planet.' She added: 'One of the reasons he is defined the way he is is because of his first marriage. 'One of the perceptions is that he was a cynical older man who lured an innocent girl into a relationship that was never going to be plausible.' Miss Mayer said she felt talk of Prince Charles' rise to the throne may be premature because he comes from a family that are incredibly long-lived. 'When he comes to the throne, or if he comes to the throne, we will know he is a man of strong beliefs.'","Prince and fiancée had cold feet about wedding, controversial book claims .

"Around 100 prehistoric 'cult sites,' containing phallic carvings have been found in the  Eilat Mountains in the Negev Desert in Israel. The sites date back around 8,000 years, and archaeologists were stunned to find a variety of stone structures and artifacts. They include stone circles that measure 1.5 to 2.5 meters across with penis-shaped installations pointing toward them. Researchers found a variety of stone structures and artifacts, including stone circles that measure 1.5 to 2.5 meters across with penis-shaped installations pointing toward them . In addition to the penis-shaped structures, researchers also found that some of the stones have vulva-shaped holes cut into them, which the team describe as 'pear shaped'. The researcher team say the sites were used by cults to worship fertility and death. It it believed animal sacrifices took place, and theat hundreds of the sites exist. 'While a comprehensive stylistic study of the stone objects is still ongoing, a preliminary interpretation suggests two symbolic aspects,' the team, led by Uzi Avner, a researcher with the Arava-Dead Sea Science Center and the Arava Institute, wrote. 'One is fertility, represented by the stones with elongated perforation (vulva-shape) and by the very combination of the elongated cell and the circle.' Death is 'signified by the burial of stone objects and by setting them upside down,' the team members wrote in their paper. In one, a humanlike stone carving was found buried with 'only the very top visible on the surface.' Other findings there include standing stones that reach up to 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) high, stone bowls and stone carvings that have a humanlike shape. These sites are often clustered together, and in one area the team discovered 44 cult sites in a spot encompassing only 0.8 square kilometers (less than 200 acres). 'Taking in[to] consideration the topography, environmental conditions and the small number of known Neolithic habitations in the general southern Negev, the density of cult sites in this region is phenomenal,' the team, led by  wrote in an article published recently in the Journal of the Israel Prehistoric Society. Archaeologists are working to decipher any meaning from the artifacts and structures, and say that both death and fertility seem to be symbolized at the sites. A pair of installations, where the elongated cell points to the stone circle. They also say similar sites are found throughout the area. 'Although the majority of these sites is currently recorded in the Eilat mountains, they were also found in other regions of the Negev and in southern Jordan, and therefore they represent a broad phenomenon. 'The many cult sites stand in contrast to the small number of Neolithic habitations known in the Negev and they offer a new insight into the spiritual culture of the desert Neolithic societies.' A survey of a larger area yielded to date 349 cult sites, Avner said, adding that researchers are preparing these finds for publication. 'The number of cult sites recorded to date suggests that many more still await discovery,' the researchers wrote. 'Many more may be found on the mountains of the Negev, southern Jordan and Sinai.' A survey of a larger area yielded to date 349 cult sites, Avner said, adding that researchers are preparing these finds for publication. One 'may think now of a vast phenomenon, of hundreds of mountain cult sites in the desert.' The sites also provide a good view. 'Commonly, a broad view is seen from the sites, so possibly, the scenery was one element in the selection of their location,' the archaeologists added. 'The fact that they are still visible today, thousands of years after being used, indicates that they were frequently visited, for short events, during a significant period of time and by many people. 'Since many sites contain several installations (up to eleven) and numerous stone objects, support the view that at least some sites were not just temporary.","Sites in the Eilat mountains contain phallic stone structures .

"ISIS has threatened to flood Europe with half a million migrants from Libya in a 'psychological' attack against the West, it was claimed today. Transcripts of telephone intercepts published in Italy claim to provide evidence that ISIS is threatening to send 500,000 migrants simultaneously out to sea in hundreds of boats in a 'psychological weapon' against Europe if there is military intervention against them in Libya. Many would be at risk of drowning with rescue services unable to cope. But authorities fear that if numbers on this scale arrived, European cities could witness riots. Separately, the militants hope to cement their control of Libya then cross the Mediterranean disguised as refugees, according to letters seen by Quilliam the anti-terror group, reported by the Telegraph. Breaking point: The officials at Lampedusa airport (pictured) are struggling to process the 1,200 newly arrived migrants in a reception centre built for a third of that number - and now Islamic State has threatened to send 500,000 to Europe's shores . Escape: Today, the spread of violence and extremism in Libya has forced thousands to flee to Italy (ferry port of Lampedusa pictured) where officials are struggling to deal with the sudden influx . Prophecy: Muammar Gaddafi predicts the Mediterranean would become a 'sea of chaos' four years before Islamic State beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya - prompting a swift and brutal response from the country who launched airstrikes on their locations . Violent coup: Muammar Gaddafi was deposed as Libya's leader in August 2011 and killed in October, when forces loyal to the government that overthrew him found him hiding in a drainage pipe in Sirte . Dangerous: Egypt's brutal airstrikes on the Libyan village of Derna - in retaliation for the mass murder of 21 of its countrymen - forced many to abandon their homes . Anxious: The Egyptians who fled their adopted home in Libya face a nervous wait before passing through the border village Sallum . Searching for safety: With militancy and violence spreading through Libya, many Egyptians living there are now returning to their home country (pictured on the border village Sallum) Italian Minister for the Interior Angelino Alfano said on Monday that Libya was the 'absolute priority' and insisted there was 'not a minute to lose' for the international community. He said: 'If the militias of the Caliphate advance faster than the decisions of the international community how can we put out the fire in Libya and stem the migration flows? We are at risk of an exodus without precedent.' More than 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year. Since last Friday  almost 4,000 have been rescued. The spread of militancy across Libya was predicted by the country's deceased leader Muammar Gaddafi, who warned the Mediterranean would become 'a sea of chaos'. ISIS had not yet made frightening inroads into Libya when he made this chilling prophecy during his last interview in March 2011. But the Arab Spring uprising that year sparked a civil war in Libya and opposition forces - backed by NATO - deposed Gaddafi in violent coup just five months after his ominous prediction. In October 2011, forces loyal to the country's transitional government found the ousted leader hiding in a culvert in Sirte and killed him. Four years later, Islamic State kidnapped 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Sirte - Gaddafi's birthplace - before releasing gruesome footage of their beheading on the shores of the Mediterranean, just 220 miles south of Italy. In it the terrorists warned that they 'will conquer Rome'. Fleeing terror: Over 170,000 migrants arrived in Italy by boat last year and since last Friday alone almost 4,000 have been rescued . Forced to leave: Migrants wait to board a plane at Lampedusa airport in Italy, bound for a detention center elsewhere in the country . Safe: The mainly African migrants were among some 3,800 would-be immigrants to Europe rescued in the Mediterranean since Friday, according to figures compiled by the International Organisation for Migration . Bloody realisation: Four years after Gaddafi's chilling prophecy that the Mediterranean would become 'a sea of chaos' ISIS murdered 21 Egyptian Christians on a beach in Libya . Total control: ISIS' have spread their brutal regime throughout Gaddafi's former home, with recent footage showing a fleet of brand new cars carrying its notorious black flag driving freely through Benghazi . In response, Italian security chiefs have approved plans to put 4,800 soldiers on the country's streets to help prevent terrorist attacks. The statement from the Interior Ministry said they would guard 'sensitive sites' until at least June and reports claim 500 will be deployed in Rome - where soldiers are already guarding diplomatic residences, synagogues and Jewish schools. The troops are also expected to be deployed at tourist venues such as archaeological sites and monuments. A treaty between Gaddafi and the Italian premier provided for joint boat patrols which curtailed the departure of migrant boats from Libya. But, as the Libyan despot predicted back in 2011, if the Gaddafis were brought down, Islamists would exploit the power vacuum. Still holding court in a Bedoin tent while holed up in the fortified citadel of Bab Al Azizya, Gaddafi warned: 'If, instead of a stable government that guarantees security, these militias linked to Bin Laden take control, the Africans will move en mass towards Europe.' He added: 'The Mediterranean will become a sea of chaos.' Insecurity: Four years later Lybian soldiers gather in the same square after an Islamist-led militia seized the capital . Military intervention: As Libyan soldiers protected the capital Tripoli (pictured on February 9), the elected parliament was forced to relocate in the eastern city of Tobruk . That very sea ran red with blood when Islamic State brutally executed 21 Egyptian Christians on its shores. The accompanying video, released on Sunday, showed the men dressed in orange jumpsuits and shackled - kneeling in the sand before the militants slit their throats and watched them bleed to death. Egypt retaliated furiously by launching coordinated airstrikes on ISIS targets in Libya. The European powers were putting their own security at risk by helping the rebels, Gaddafi pointed out. He told Il Giornale, the Italian newspaper owned by his former friend Silvio Berlusconi he was saddened by the attitude of his friend. They no longer spoke. 'I am shocked at the attitude of my European friends. They have endangered and damaged a series of great security treaties in their own interest.' Without his harsh, but effective, regime, the entire North African Mahgreb 'would become another Gaza,' he claimed. Power: The ominous show of discipline and wealth shows how the country has been overrun by extremism as efforts to suppress ISIS focus on Iraq and Syria . Chilling: Even young children salute the procession of cars as they pass undeterred through the streets of Benghazi . Support: The parade of Toyota Land Cruisers is welcomed by the locals in Benghazi. The video was posted by terrorist group Ansar Al-Sharia - who pledged allegiance to Islamic State last October . Overrun: The majority of Libya's coastal cities have surrendered control to Islamic State and other rebel extremist groups created to oppose the NATO-led invasion which removed Gaddafi from power . The telephone transcripts, seen by Il Messaggero newspaper claimed to provide evidence 'that IS will use the migrants as a ""psychological weapon"" against countries that say they want to intervene in Libya, in particular, against Italy.' 'As soon as our country mentioned armed intervention on Libya the jihadists suggested they let drift, bound for Italy, hundreds of boats full of migrants. The figure discussed is five hundred thousand, most of the 700,000 that are on the coast waiting to board,' the newspaper reported. Following the dire threat Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi immediately backtracked from his government's previous rhetoric saying that 'it was not the time for military intervention'. Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said this morning that Italy does not want to embark on 'adventures, never mind Crusades' in Libya. But former President Giorgio Napolitano said that the 'biggest error' in the post-Gaddafi's period was the European Unions 'lack of involvement' in the country. Meanwhile following direct threats on Rome, the commander of Vatican City's 110-man Swiss Guard said his forces are ready to defend Pope Francis if ISIS attempt a strike . Executed: On Sunday, ISIS released a video showing the brutal mass murder of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya . Horror: Blood is seen in the Mediterranean Sea four years after Muammar Gaddafi predicted it would become a 'sea of chaos' Colonel Christoph Graf said 'Following the terrorists' threats, we're asking the guards to be more attentive and observe peoples' movements closely. If something happens we're ready, as are the men of the Gendarmerie.'","Italian press today published claims that ISIS has threatened to release the huge wave of migrants to cause chaos in Europe if they are attacked .

"Three men wheeling the body of a brutally murdered 22-year-old man down a road in a wheelie bin were confronted by police - who told them to put it back before driving off, a court heard today. Two police officers in a patrol car allegedly failed to notice the lifeless body of Jamie Dack, who had been repeatedly stabbed and beaten with a rounders bat in Southampton, Hampshire, in April. Andrew Dwyer-Skeats, 26, Lee Nicholls, 28, and Ryan Woodmansey, 32, were told off for stealing the bin - and Mr Dack’s body was later doused with petrol and set alight in a skip, the court was told. Victim: Two police officers in a patrol car failed to notice the lifeless body of Jamie Dack (pictured), who had been repeatedly stabbed and beaten with a rounders bat in Southampton, Hampshire, in April, a court heard . His remains were found by firefighters . a short while later as they tackled the blaze in a nearby industrial estate . in the early hours of Easter Sunday, Winchester Crown Court was told. The group brutally attacked Jamie with . kitchen knives and broken bottles in a bid to get his bank card PIN, . before killing him to stop him going to the police, prosecutors claim. Their escape was revealed in a . prepared court statement by Dwyer-Skeats, who allegedly stepped into a . fight between Nicholls and Mr Dack after the young man ‘tried it on’ with Nicholls’s girlfriend. The pair separated and shook hands, . remaining in their friends’ Southampton flat. Dwyer-Skeats, Woodmansey . and friend Donna Chalk, 21, left to go on a night out in Bournemouth, . Dorset, he said. When Dwyer-Skeats and Chalk returned, . he said he found Nicholls in the flat with Mr Dack’s body lying on the . kitchen floor, covered by a duvet - and both Nicholls and the duvet were . blood stained. Police tape: Mr Dack's body was dumped in a wheelie bin, doused with petrol and set on fire, a court heard . There was also blood on the carpet and . walls. Dwyer-Skeats said he tried to find a pulse and Nicholls told . him: ‘I couldn’t let him grass me up.’ He suggested they called the . police but Nicholls refused. Investigation: Firefighters found Mr Dack's badly burned remains when they were called to put out a fire at the Southampton industrial estate . Dwyer-Skeats said he and Chalk were . panicking and Nicholls pleaded with them to ‘clean the place up or . you’re going to get the same’. Dwyer-Skeats said he took the threat . seriously. He said: ‘I knew he had murdered Jamie. I couldn’t think straight - it was like a dream.’ They decided to get rid of the body, . the court heard. Dwyer-Skeats and Woodmansey found two wheelie bins - . one for Mr Dack’s body and the other for the blood-stained carpet. They were said to have been on their way to the industrial estate when the police stopped them and told them to put the bins back. After the officers left, the trio . allegedly carried on to the estate, where Woodmansey helped Nicholls tip the body . into the skip. It was then covered with petrol and set on fire, the court heard. Dwyer-Skeats said: ‘I ran as soon as I . put the carpet in - straight back to the flat, followed by Lee and . Ryan. Donna was still there.’ Dwyer-Skeats told detectives that he . overheard Nicholls phoning his girlfriend, telling her: ‘I’ve done it . for you.’ His statement ended: ‘Myself, Ryan and Donna had no part in . the murder of Jamie Dack. ‘I greatly regret helping Lee after I saw the body. I was put under pressure.’ Dwyer-Skeats, Nicholls, Woodmansey and . Chalk all deny murdering Mr Dack. The three men have admitted . perverting the course of justice by disposing of and setting fire to his . body. Chalk denies that charge. The trial continues.

"THE curse of Tutankhamen is said to have claimed more than 20 lives. By contrast, the curse of Neb-Senu amounts to little more than an occasional inconvenience for museum curators. Over several days, the ten-inch Egyptian statuette gradually rotates to face the rear of the locked glass cabinet in which it is displayed, and has to be turned around again by hand. Those who like tales of haunted pyramids and walking mummies may regard the mystery of the 4,000-year-old relic – an offering to Osiris, god of the dead – as the strangest thing to hit Egyptology in decades. Scroll down for video . Egyptologist Campbell Price studies an ancient Egyptian statuette at the Manchester Museum, which appears to be moving on its own . Others, including TV physicist Professor Brian Cox, have a more down-to-earth explanation for its movement. Whatever the solution, the puzzle certainly won’t dent visitor numbers at its present home, Manchester Museum. The statuette’s slow about-turn has . been captured on film by a time-lapse camera, and curator Campbell . Price, 29, says he believes there may be a spiritual explanation. ‘I noticed one day that it had turned . around,’ he said. ‘I thought it was strange because it is in a case and . I am the only one who has a key. ‘I put it back, but then the next day it had moved again. The 10-inch tall relic, which dates back to 1800 BC, has been at the museum for 80 years but curators say it has recently starting rotating 180 degrees during the day . ‘In Ancient Egypt they believed that . if the mummy is destroyed then the statuette can act as an alternative . vessel for the spirit. Maybe that is what is causing the movement.’ The statue, made by one Neb-Senu in . about 1800BC, was donated to the museum in 1933, and had been . reassuringly immobile for most of that time.

Mr Price said: ‘Brian thinks it’s . “differential friction” where two surfaces, the stone of the statuette . and glass shelf it is on, cause a subtle vibration which is making the . statuette turn.

"In court, Magdelena Luczak portrayed herself as a fearful victim of her violent partner. In reality she was the driving force behind a cover-up . Mariusz Krezolek is a wanted criminal in his homeland, while Magdelena Luczak was a drug addicted prostitute, it emerged last night. They have both been found guilty of the horrific murder of Luczak's son Daniel, who resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’ when he died following an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of cruelty carried out by the evil pair. Krezolek moved to Britain in 2006 despite the fact that Polish police were hunting him after he violated the terms of his suspended sentence. ‘He is a wanted man,’ a police source said. ‘He breached the terms of his sentence.’ Krezolek’s sister also revealed that he was a violent criminal who was booted out of the army for attacking a fellow recruit. Speaking from their family home in a village near Wroclaw in South West Poland where she still lives, she also told the Mail that her brother terrorised her when she was growing up. Asking not to be named, she said: ‘My brother is on a wanted list in Poland. He has brought public shame on the family. ‘He was in the army and got into a fight and the person he beat up ended up in hospital and he ended up in a martial court. He was punished for it. ‘When I was 18 and he was 15 he used to beat me up. It is horrible for me to talk about this. Killer mother: Luczak, 27, seen (right) holding a baby put her use of cannabis and alcohol ahead of looking after her baby . ‘Nobody wants to hear their brother . was involved in the death of a child, but I’m not going to defend him. Never in my life would I ever leave my children with him.’ She added that he was a heavy drinker . who regularly used amphetamines and the police and local prosecutors . were regular visitors to the family home. Krezolek’s other sister, who lives nearby and also asked not to be named, said: ‘I have no brother.’ Luczak told the court that her partner Mariusz Krezolek (pictured with her) had hit Daniel around the head and then tried to strangle her . Krezolek met Luczak in England after . she left her life in a concrete housing estate in the run-down city of . Lodz in central Poland. Her mother Yolanta was described by neighbours as anxious and highly-strung. They added that she used to beat her daughter. Her father Witold – who was rarely at home – worked as a driver while her mother raised the children in the tiny flat. Neighbours told how the family of . seven had not paid rent for 24 years for their pokey three-bed council . apartment in a towering high-rise block. Luczak’s younger sister said her mother had been worried for her grandson’s safety when she visited two weeks before his death. The mother-of-two, who lives in Lodz . and asked not to be identified, said: ‘My mother went to England to . visit Magda two weeks before Daniel died and came back with terrible . stories. ‘She said “Something terrible is . happening in that house. Magda is being terrorised by Mariusz. Something . very bad is happening in that house”. ‘It’s my sister’s fault that she did not react when her son was in danger. She has responsibility for what happened.’ Luczak’s mother Yolanta told the Mail . her husband had died as a result of the stress of seeing his daughter . charged with the murder of his grandson. Death: Daniel Pelka (right) was murdered by his mother Magdelena Luczak (left) and her partner after being starved and subjected to unimaginable cruelty over a five-month period . She said: ‘Mariusz doesn’t deserve to walk on this earth. I’m in no state to talk about this, my life is full of tragedy.’ As a girl, blonde-haired Luczak dreamed of being the next Emma Bunton and belted out Spice Girls songs at the top of her voice. ‘But just a few years later, she was . caking her face in make-up, wearing expensive clothes and being picked . up by strange men late at night. 'My mother came back with terrible stories' Magdelena Luczak’s younger sister . One neighbour, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘The same car would drop her off in the morning and pick . her up at night and we thought the driver was probably her pimp.’ Another neighbour added: ‘Magda had a very difficult childhood because her mother was aggressive.’ Last night, Daniel’s natural father, . lorry driver Eryk Pelka, said: ‘I feel hate towards Magda. I hope she . will never come out of jail. I had very limited access to Daniel once I . returned to Poland.

"An Italian journalist and a Belgian writer who were held hostage in Syria for five months have claimed that they overheard a conversation suggesting that rebel forces were behind a chemical weapon attack on Damascus and not President Assad's army. Domenico Quirico and Pierre Piccinin de Prata were kidnapped while working in the war torn country in April. The pair were released on Sunday night and have now said that they heard a conversation between their captors in English on Skype in which they allegedly revealed that rebels launched the attack to prompt Western forces to intervene. Claims: Italian journalist Domenico Quirico, pictured after arriving in Italy on Sunday, claims to have overheard a conversation blaming rebel forces for chemical attacks in Damascus . Quirico, a veteran reporter for La Stampa daily with vast experience of reporting on conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, told the newspaper: 'In this conversation, they said that the gas attack on two neighborhoods of Damascus was launched by the rebels as a provocation to lead the West to intervene militarily. 'We were unaware of everything that was going on during our detention in Syria, and therefore also with the gas attack in Damascus.' Although Mr Quirico was quick to point out that he had no proof that the claims made in the conversation were genuine or who the men involved really were, he alleges that one of three men involved in the exchange identified himself as a Free Syria Army general. Badly treated: Pictured with Italian Foreign minister Emma Bonino, Quirico claims that he and his fellow captive were subjected to daily beatings . His fellow captive, Mr Piccinin de Prata told Belgian radio station RTL that he had a 'moral duty' to share what he heard. Since they were released on Sunday, the pair have spoken of their ordeal at the hands of their captors, who were thought to be from the Free Syria Army. The men told reporters that they were beaten on a daily basis and subjected to two mock executions. Piccinin said that they were treated as though they were 'subhuman'. Contradictory: Meanwhile a Western official told Foreign Policy magazine that the UN inspection team, pictured in Syria last month, has a 'weatlh' of evidence that President Assad was behind the chemical attacks . Question marks: A UN report to Ban Ki-Moon on Monday will not direct point the finger at President Assad, pictured, but will provide strong circumstantial evidence it has been alleged . But Foreign Policy magazine claims that UN inspectors will present a 'wealth' of evidence to Ban Ki-Moon on Monday that President Assad's regime was behind the August 21 attacks. According to the magazine, an unnamed Western official with knowledge of the inspection claims that the team's report will not directly point the finger at Assad, but will provide plenty of circumstantial evidence. The UN team has examined rocket casings, ammunition, tested soil and taken blood and urine samples from victims. The source told Foreign Policy: 'I know they have gotten very rich samples - biomedical and environmental - and they have interviewed victims, doctors and nurses. 'It seems they are very happy with the wealth of evidence they've got.' Both Syria and their Russian allies have previously claimed that the rebels were responsible for the attacks and that they have evidence to prove it.

"The elusive and mysterious Loch Ness monster may have a distant relative, living across the Atlantic. Dubbed Champ, there have been more than 600 sightings of the long, underwater sea creature in Vermont’s Lake Champlain since the 17th century - and now amateur zoologists claim to have found proof of its existence. Using a hydrophone system, the monster hunters captured loud clicking sounds thought to have been made by the echolocation of a giant creature. Scroll down for video . The audio recording (pictured) was made by cryptozoologists Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall on Lake Champlain, Vermont. It was captured using a hydrophone system that monitors echolocation. Ms Elizabeth claims the clicking sounds made in the recording are evidence of an underwater creature called Champ . The audio recording was made by 'cryptozoologists' Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall in July, near a region of the lake known as Scotch Bonnet. Ms Elizabeth captured a second recording in October, but the two sound so different she is convinced the first was made by the creature known as Champ. Lake Champlain is a freshwater lake, in Vermont that stretches north into Canada, and south towards New York. The 109-mile-long (175km) lake has been called the American Loch Ness because both are deep, freshwater lakes said to date back more than 10,000 years. The recording was made by cryptozoologists on Lake Champlain, Vermont. It was captured using a DolphinEar Hydrophone system that monitors echolocation. Echolocation, or biological sonar, is used by dolphins, bats, whales and other animals. Echolocating involves sending a call and listening to echoes to determine where various objects are around them. It is used for navigating and hunting and the calls are typically made using a series of clicks, as heard in the Champ video. At its deepest, Lake Champlain is 400 ft (121 metres) - compared to Loch Ness’ 744ft (227 metres). Since 1609, there have been more than 600 reported sightings of the creature, which became a tourist attraction during the 1970s and 1980s. It became so popular that a sign was erected in Port Henry listing the names of all people who claimed to have encountered the lake monster. Many of the sightings have reported a creature with a ‘long sinuous neck’ and a humped body measuring between 15ft (4.5 metres) to 25ft (7.62 metres) long. Ms Elizabeth and Mr Hall set up Champ Search to study, investigate and prove the existence of the monster. Both claim to have become fascinated with the monster as children and in 1973, Hall was elected President of the Vergennes Chapter of the Vermont Archaeological Society and tasked to write the laws that protect archaeological sites in Vermont. The noises were captured in July, near a region of the lake (pictured) known as Scotch Bonnet. Ms Elizabeth captured a second recording in October, but the two sound so different she is convinced the first was made by Champ and the second was of a beluga whale, or similar . Ms Elizabeth thinks believes Champ is a Tanystropheus, a dinosaur that lived 232 million years ago (skeleton pictured at the Paleontology Museum of Zurich) She said: ‘We don’t know if these reptiles could echolocate, it’s one of those things that no one really knows, but something [in the lake] is echolocating’ Ms Elizabeth believes Champ is a Tanystropheus, a dinosaur that lived 232 million years ago. She told Motherboard: ‘We don’t know if these reptiles could echolocate, it’s one of those things that no one really knows, but something [in the lake] is echolocating.’ She added that other creatures have been discovered that were thought to have been extinct, and given the depths of the lake, this could be the case with Champ. Mr Elizabeth has ruled out the fact that the loud clicking sound was made by a fish finder device, because the pair were alone on the lake at the time.

Other theories claim the creature is plesiosaur reptile.

Last week, footage of a shadowy figure briefly emerging from the depths of Loch Ness in Scotland that once again fuelled speculation its legendary resident is alive and well. The grainy footage shows a long and thin shape swaying in the water that bears a striking resemblance to Nessie’s fabled slender neck. Since 1609, there have been more than 600 reported sightings of the creature, which became a tourist attraction during the 1970s and 80s.It became so popular that a sign was erected in Port Henry listing the names of all people who claimed to have encountered the lake monster . Last week, footage of a shadowy figure briefly emerging from the depths of Loch Ness in Scotland that once again fuelled speculation its legendary resident is alive and well. Richard Collis appears to have captured the footage of Nessie's head and neck emerging from the loch (pictured) The video shows the object waving in the choppy water, around 500ft (152 metres) from the loch’s shore. It was captured by Richard Collis - who counts himself among the most ardent Nessie cynics after years of fishing on the waters without a sighting. But the tree planter was so taken aback by the mysterious shape he noticed while driving along the edge of the loch that he filmed it on his iPhone, and believes he might have stumbled upon the real deal. The footage appears to show a long thin neck and head emerging from 500ft (152 metres) away from the shore of Loch Ness . Mr Collis said he thought the figure in the water was about 500ft away from the shore in the choppy waters . ‘As I was watching, I was thinking what the hell is that?’ said Mr Collis, 58, who noticed the shape while travelling around a mile from Fort Augustus at the south-west end of Loch Ness. He added: ‘I don’t really believe in anything like that until I see it. ‘I’m not saying it was a fire breathing dragon and I never saw teeth or anything like that, but I must have thought there was something there if I stopped to take pictures.’ An online register lists 1067 total Nessie sightings. The list was created by Gary Campbell, the man behind the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club and is available at www.lochnesssightings.com . Mr Campbell said: 'Jonathon's photo bears an incredible similarity to Bob Rines series of pictures and will certainly further stimulate discussion about this enduring legend.' Among the most famous claimed sightings is a photograph taken in 1934 by Colonel Robert Kenneth Wilson (below). It was later exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling, who, on his deathbed, revealed that the pictures were staged. This famous photograph, produced in 1934, was exposed as a hoax by one of the participants, Chris Spurling . In 2001 semi-retired photographer James Gray and friend Peter Levings took this while they were out fishing . This picture, said to show the monster, was taken by Hugh Gray in 1933 and published in the Daily Express . A close-up of what could be the Loch Ness Monster. The photo was taken by William Jobes in 2011 . The footage, lasting two minutes in total, was taken last Thursday. Mr Collis’s wife Vibeke, 60, added: ‘I’ve been here 37 years and my husband has been here his whole life, so we are completely aware of how unique this is. I couldn’t believe it and laughed when he showed me because I knew he could never set that up. He’s not very technical.’ The image will now join hundreds of other possible sightings that have amassed over the years, some of which have been confirmed to be fakes. Only last week, paranormal investigator Jonathan Bright published an image taken three years ago appearing to show the head of a monster in the loch. But despite decades of speculation, the mysterious creature has so far proved little more than a myth. In 2013, this shadowy form measuring around 100ft long and seemingly having two giant flippers powering it through the waters of Loch Ness was photographed by Apple's satellite map app.The image was studied by experts at the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club, who concluded it is ‘likely’ to be the elusive beast.","Recording was made by cryptozoologists Katy Elizabeth and Dennis Hall .

"Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said his children feel persecuted just as Jewish families did in Nazi Germany because he is being hounded by the country's magistrates who want to eliminate him politically. Berlusconi's comments came from an advance excerpt of an interview with him by Italian television journalist Bruno Vespa for his latest book. Asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave Italy to escape his legal troubles, Berlusconi said: 'My children say that they feel like Jewish families in Germany under Hitler's regime. Truly, everyone is against us.' Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has three children with his ex-wife Veronica Lario . Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler murdered an estimated six million Jews during World War Two. Berlusconi, who protests his innocence in a series of court cases which he blames on left-wing magistrates, is well-known for making controversial remarks, such as calling President Barack Obama 'suntanned' after he was first elected in 2008. During a heated 2003 exchange in the European Parliament, Berlusconi compared Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat who is now president of the assembly, to a Nazi concentration camp guard.

Berlusconi, 77, and his family rank among the 200 wealthiest billionaires in the world, with an estimated fortune of 6.2 billion euros ($8.35 billion) according to Forbes magazine. His conviction for tax fraud earlier this year poses a serious threat to his decades-long political career because it comes with a ban from public office, though polls show millions of Italians would still vote for him. Berlusconi is also on trial on charges of having paid for sex with a minor and then abusing the powers of his office to have her released from jail after she was arrested for theft. Berlusconi has threatened repeatedly to bring down Prime Minister Enrico Letta's broad left-right coalition government if the Senate votes on Nov. 27 to expel the media magnate from parliament. With a litany of legal actions brought against him over the years, Silvio Berlusconi would be the first to tell you he’s had a rough time in the law courts. But the former Italian premier has finally found a court that is on his side- a judge in Monza has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £1.2million a month. He had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife Veronica Lario, whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage, a cool £2.5million a month.

The . playboy politician has complained bitterly about the payments which add . up to £82,000 a day or £30million a year stating that the 'ridiculous . settlement' was a scandal, decided by three 'feminist and communist' judges.

The politician's sons Luigi (left) and Piersilvio (right) reportedly face prejudice for their father's controversial behavior . She said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties. Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling a guest at a TV awards dinner that he wanted to marry her. 'If I wasn't married, I would marry you right away, ' he told showgirl turned politician Mara Carfagna. Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25. He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44. The controversial entrepreneur is now engaged to marry 28-year-old former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale.

'The local girls are far uglier than the ones back in Belgrade or Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, where I come from. 'Our women are much prettier.

"Hundreds of mysterious golden-coloured orbs have been found buried in a hidden chamber deep beneath the Temple of Feathered Serpent in Mexico. The discovery was made by archaeologists from the Mexico National Institute of Anthropology and History, who admit they have no idea what the spheres are for. A tiny robot called Tláloc II-TC, which has been scanning tunnels deep beneath the famous temple, found the orbs using infrared scanners. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of mysterious spheres have been discovered beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, in the pre-Hispanic city of Teotihuacan, just 30 miles from Mexico City . According to archaeologists from the Mexico National Institute of Anthropology and History, the spheres would have appeared to be made of gold because they are covered in jarosite - a bi-product of the oxidisation of pyrite, also known as Fool's Gold . Infrared scanners found the location of the chamber and the orbs. Archaeologists have no idea what the spheres would have been used for, although believe they may have been involved with religious rituals . The Tláloc II-TC is named after the Aztec god of rain. It is three-feet-long and can . squeeze through tight spaces and explore small, hidden areas. It is fitted with video cameras and a . mechanical arm used to clear obstacles out of its way. It is part of a robotic system called Tlaloque, which includes a large rover that carries the two smaller robots. Once the Tlaloque arrives at a chamber, the robots break off and scan the area using infrared scanners. A separate flying drone captures video footage. They were hiding in a previously unexplored ancient chamber at the end of a stretch of 2,000-year-old  unexplored tunnel on the Teotihuacan site, near the Pyramid of the Sun. Jorge Zavala, an archaeologist on the dig said: 'They look like yellow spheres, but we do not know their meaning. It’s an unprecedented discovery.' The spheres are made of clay and range from 1.5 to 5 inches in circumference. They get their yellow colour from a material called jarosite. Lead archaeologist Sergio Gomez explained that the spheres appear to be made of metal because jarosite is formed by the oxidation of pyrite, which is a metallic ore also known as Fool's Gold. The walls in the chamber were also found to be dusted in pyrite, which gave it an appearance of a gold room. The archaeologists therefore think that the orbs would have been used by 'high-ranking people, priests, or even rulers' to perform rituals within the tunnels. Although, the team admit what part they played in these rituals, and what these rituals meant remain a mystery. The team from the Mexican Institute have been using the robot for months to explore the tunnels under the celebrated temple, also known as the Temple of Quetzalcoatl. Explorer: This robot may have made a momentous discovery in a 2,000-year-old tunnel in Mexico . The was the first image transmitted by the robot deep under the ancient temple . Famous: The social structure of Teotihuacan remains a mystery after nearly 100 years of archaeological exploration at the site . Teotihuaca means 'the . place where men become gods'. The site is thought to be a burial ground. The . Teotihuacan people worshipped eight gods, and were known to carry out human sacrifices. The ancient city was . founded 2,500 years ago and was once one of the biggest cities on Earth . with over 100,000 residents - Earth at this time only house 200 million . people. The city was totally abandoned in 700 AD and very little is know about the civilisation, or what caused the mass exodus. The temple lies about 37 miles north of Mexico City and the site houses the remains of the pre-Hispanic city of Teotihuacan in the Basin of Mexico. It is best known for the towering Pyramids of the Moon and the . Sun. Earlier this year, the team and the remote-controlled robot found three unexplored passages. It was only expected to find one. The discovery of the hidden passages and golden orbs could be highly important. In 2010 experts said a tomb discovery . would be significant because the social structure of Teotihuacan remains . a mystery after nearly 100 years of archaeological exploration at the . site. When the civilisation was abandoned, almost 50,000 high-value objects including jade, stone, shell and pottery, such as ceramic beakers, were thrown into the tunnel because it was closed up. The remote control vehicle is equipped with a video cameras and a mechanical arm to clear obstacles out of its way as it maneuvers through the tight passageway . Tourists look on at the archaeological area of the Quetzalcoatl Temple about 37 miles north of Mexico City . This map shows the chambers of the tunnel, found beneath the Temple of the Feathers Serpent, as plotted by the laser scanner. Archaeologists were only expecting to find one chamber, but the robot discovered three hidden rooms . No depiction of a ruler, or the tomb of a monarch, has ever been found, setting the metropolis apart from other pre-Hispanic cultures that deified their rulers. Vertical excavations begun in 2009 to reach the mouth of the tunnel suggest this was a ruler's tomb, claims Gomez. 'I think the tunnel was the central . element, the main element around which the rest of the ceremonial center . was built,' Gomez said. 'This was the most sacred place.' 'There is a high possibility that in . this place, in the central chamber, we can find the remains of those who . ruled Teotihuacan,' he added. Archaeologist Sergio Gomez from the National Institute of Anthropology and History explains the developments to the media . The robot is seen near the entrance of a tunnel in the archaeological area. After months of exploration it might have made a momentous discovery .","Hundreds of yellow spheres have been found scattered in hidden chamber .
Mexican archaeologists admit they have no idea what the orbs are for .

"Americans are among the most satisfied people in the world - possibly in part due to their higher-than-average annual incomes, according to an OECD study released Tuesday. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used answers from a Gallup World Poll of some 1,000 responders in each of over 30 industrialized and developing economies, asking them to rate life satisfaction from 0 to 10. Compared with other OECD countries, the U.S. excelled in many of the 11 criteria that the OECD considers as essential to a good life, including income and wealth; jobs and earnings; housing conditions and governance. Life is good: The U.S. excelled in many of the 11 criteria that the OECD considers as essential to a good life, including income and wealth; jobs and earnings; housing conditions and governance . According to the survey, the U.S. ranked at the top in housing, income and wealth and above the OECD average in the dimensions of health status, jobs and earnings, subjective well-being, personal security, environmental quality, civic engagement and education and skills. In the U.S., people earn $54,450 a year on average, much more than the OECD average of $34,466 and the highest rate across the OECD. But there is a substantial gap between the richest . and poorest, with the top 20 per cent of the population earning eight . times as much as the bottom 20 per cent. But the country was in the bottom 20 per cent in categories of work-life balance and social connections. When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, people in the U.S. gave it a 7.0 grade, higher than the OECD average of 6.6. For comparison, Residents in the U.K. rated their life satisfaction at 6.8. Along with the U.S., Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland dominated the index in terms of a general sense of well-being. On the other end of the spectrum, Chile, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Portugal and Turkey had the lowest scores. Land of opportunity: In the U.S., the average household net-adjusted disposable income is $38,001 a year, more than the OECD average of $23,047 . It found life satisfaction scores dropped by more than 20 per cent in Greece over the five years to 2012, while Spain saw a fall of 12 per cent and Italy a drop of 10 per cent. The largest impact of the global economic crisis on Americans' well-being has come through higher unemployment, which increased by nearly 2 per cent compared to employment rate, which plunged more than 4 per cent between 2007 and 2012. During the same time period, the percentage of Americans describing themselves as very satisfied with their lives dropped from 78 per cent to 67 per cent.

"Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel has come out in defence of his firm following a serious security breach involving the app's Find Friend tool. In an interview with U.S-based Today, the 23-year-old admitted he was under the impression the company had done enough to resolve security issues with the app, but added: 'If you spend your time looking backwards, you're just going to kill yourself'. Security experts claim Spiegel was warned 'months ago' the app had a security hole, yet failed to respond effectively, which is being blamed for the leak of 4.6million user details on Wednesday. Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel, left, has come out in defence of his firm following a security breach involving the app's Find Friend tool, right. According to Spiegel, the tool was abused by hackers to obtain phone numbers . In response, the firm has announced plans to release an updated version of the app that lets users opt out of the feature. The Find Friend tool was developed to help Snapchatters find their friends' usernames by using their mobile numbers. According to Spiegel, this tool was abused by 'someone to find usernames of people that weren’t their friends'. He added that the person targeted had 4.6million friends in their address book, and the hackers used this to find phone numbers. Previous reports have claimed Spiegel was one of the users affected by the hack, and this recent statement adds weight to the rumours it may even been his friend's list that was compromised. However, this has not been confirmed. The tool is already optional, but the app update will make it possible for users to explicitly opt out of using the feature. On Christmas Day Australian security . research group, Gibson Security revealed details of a security hole . affecting the Snapchat site. Following news that millions of Snapchat accounts were hacked, developers have created an online tool that lets users check if their details have been compromised. Called GS Lookup - Snapchat, pictured, the tool lets users enter their username before scanning the leaked list for a match . A second tool, called Snapcheck.org, pictured, lets users enter either their username or phone number to check if their account details are on the list. The leaked list only featured details from U.S.-based accounts . Anonymous hackers released a database . of 4.6million Snapchat account details on New Year's Day. The leak came a week after Snapchat claimed it had . introduced measures to fix . a security glitch, which it was told could result in users' personal . information being put at risk. The group released the database via a website called SnapchatDB, giving people . the option to download the list of usernames and phone numbers as well . as their location. Hackers redacted the last two digits of each number, though, claiming . the stunt was designed to 'raise awareness' of the issue, not to . 'encourage abuse' for individual users. However, they added that they would release the original list in 'certain circumstances.' The . security group revealed how the vulnerability on the site could be . manipulated and added that Snapchat did not respond to their warnings . when they raised the issue months ago. After Gibson published its findings, Snapchat said it took user privacy seriously and replied in a blogpost. It said: 'Theoretically, if someone . were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an . area code, or every possible number in the U.S., they could create a . database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way. Yet on New Year's Day, anonymous hackers released a database of numbers of phone numbers they had obtained from the app. The database was released via a website called SnapchatDB, and hackers gave people . the option to download the list of usernames and phone numbers, as well . as their location.

'The . company was too reluctant at patching the exploit until they knew it . was too late and companies that we trust with our information should be . more careful when dealing with it. 'For now, we have censored the last two digits of the phone numbers in order to minimise spam and abuse.' The group said it would consider releasing the original database, without the redacted digits, 'under certain circumstances'. The hackers redacted the last two digits of each phone number on the list to avoid hacked account holders being abused. However, they later said in a statement they would consider releasing the original database 'under certain circumstances' Snapchat is a photo messaging app. It allows users to take photos, record videos and add messages and drawings.

"Hero: Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden, claims he is being held in total isolation in Pakistan's Peshawar prison . The heroic doctor who helped the United States pinpoint the location of Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden has been held in complete isolation in a Pakistani prison since September 2012 - without access to lawyers or family - as he waits for a court to decide his future, according to a letter smuggled out of the country by a supporter. Shakil Afridi, 49 - who worked with the CIA on a fake vaccination operation to confirm the presence of bin Laden in an Abbottobad compound, resulting in the fateful May 2011 SEAL mission that killed the terrorist mastermind - is regarded as a hero in the US but has been tried as a traitor in Pakistan. Originally sentenced by a court in a remote tribal area to 33 years jail for 'conspiring against the state', he now awaits a new verdict to be handed down on Dec. 18 on whether he will serve out the term or be granted a retrial. But, according to a one-and-a half page handwritten letter smuggled out of Peshawar prison, Afridi says he is being denied basic rights at a time that is crucial. 'My legal right to consult with my lawyers is being denied,' he wrote in the letter. 'What sort of justice system is this?' The authenticity of the letter - obtained by Fox News - has been verified by Afridi's cousin, Qamar Nadeem, who used previous correspondence to match the handwriting. Nadeem said the letter, written in the Hindustani language Urdu, also referred to the 'mental torture' the physician is forced to face with on a daily basis. Afridi was arrested soon after the unilateral raid by US commandos that killed Bin Laden. While he was arrested for running the fake vaccine operation, his 33-year sentence was for allegedly being a member of militant terror group Lashkar-e-Islam, which he has vehemently denied. Pinpointed: Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an attempt to verify Bin Laden's presence at a compound in the town of Abbottabad (pictured), prior to the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011 . The sentence was widely seen as punishment for assisting the United States in the capture and kill of Bin Laden, which came at a major international embarrassment to Pakistan. Dead: Osama bin Laden was killed during a covert US mission to Pakistan in May 2011 . In the almost-10 years between the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the mission, the country continually said it was not plausible for the Al Qaeda leader to be hiding in Pakistan, only for him to be located in one of their most affluent towns. The operation subsequently lead to suspicions Pakistan were harboring Bin Laden. In August, Afridi's conviction was overturned, with a court citing procedural errors and ordering a retrial. However the judge that overturned the sentence soon died in a suspicious gas explosion at his Islamabad apartment. The trail court has since to grant the new trail and, as the final nears, local authorities have gathered a host of other charges together in an attempt to keep Afridi imprisoned if the terrorist charges are dropped. One is the 'murder' of a teenage boy, who died after the doctor performed surgery on him for appendicitis in 2006. A three-member tribunal, which operates under the archaic tribal law system, heard arguments on the merits of a new trial at a court in Peshawar on Monday. The tribunal’s decision, which could force local authorities to launch a new trial, is expected to be handed down on Dec. 18. Behind bars: Afridi has remained jailed in Peshawar Central Jail (pictured in this file photo) since 2011. In a new letter smuggled out of the prison, the physician writes he has been denied access to his lawyers and family since September 2012 . 'We are confident that Dr. Shakeel Afridi would be freed after a free and fair trial,' said Afridi’s lawyer, Samiullah Afridi. But others from the defense team feel the case has been crafted on political rather legal grounds and a favorable verdict is unlikely. Another of Afridi’s lawyers fears the letter going public could hurt the doctor’s bid for freedom.","Shakil Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to pinpoint Osama bin Laden in Pakistan before the raid that killed him .

"Autopsies have determined that the two children discovered dead in a Detroit freezer earlier this week were beaten to death, and that the youngest child also suffered 'thermal injuries'. Mitchelle Blair, 35, has currently only been charged with child abuse, but that may change now that the deaths of her children Stoni Blair, 13, and Stephen Berry, 9, have been ruled a homicide. The autopsy comes just a day after child welfare officials said Blair's two surviving children had been terribly abused in a house of horrors. Mitchelle Blair stands during her video arraignment on Thursday. Her daughter told authorities that her mother killed two siblings and forced her to put one of the bodies in the freezer of their Detroit home . Details of death and extreme abuse emerged Thursday as Mitchelle Blair appeared in court, two days after the bodies of her 9-year-old son, Stephen Berry, and 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Blair, were discovered . Blair's daughter, Stoni (left) and son Stephen (right). Stoni's sister claimed Blair killed Stoni by strangling her with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag . The Michigan Department of Human Services is taking steps to end Blair's rights to her two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, who are currently with a relative. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home (pictured) opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horrors, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron . Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said. Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said. The bodies of the children were discovered on Tuesday while court officers were serving an eviction notice. The apartment was reportedly filled with food and trash and rendered almost 'unlivable', according to the report. Blair's 8-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said. While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states. The surviving children did not mention sexual abuse when they were interviewed by counselors, according to a juvenile court petition. A woman walks past notes left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday. The teenager said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years . Blair's teenage daughter said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home on Tuesday. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. Blair was referred to counseling and allowed to keep custody of her children. Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . The two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them, according to the state. Together they owe $50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.'","The deaths of Stoni Blair, 13, and Stephen Berry, 9, have been ruled a homicide .

"Arsenal completed a shock loan move for midfielder Kim Kallstrom, a player they first started watching in 2005. The move, which was first revealed by MailOnline on Friday morning, has been in the pipeline for many years as Arsene Wenger has monitored the Swede’s progress following his move to Lyon in 2006. Kallstrom jetted in from Spartak Moscow’s warm weather training base in Abu Dhabi to complete a medical on Friday. VIDEO  Scroll down to see a bicycle kick from Kallstrom in Sweden team training session . Getting shirty: Kallstrom poses in his new Arsenal kit after joining the club on loan . Shock: The move for Kallstrom was rushed through after Aaron Ramsey was ruled out . Experienced: Kallstrom has won 108 caps for Sweden and was successful during a six-year stint at Lyon . No go! Julian Draxler won't be joining Arsenal before the deadline - the club weren't prepared to pay £37m . Age: 31 . Position: Midfield . Clubs: Spartak Moscow, Lyon, Rennes, Djurgaardens . Honours: Ligue 1 title (2007 and 2008), Coupe de France (2008 and 2012) Nationality: Swedish . International caps: 108 . International goals: 16 . Kallstrom said: 'Arsenal is an amazing club with a lot of great players and a coach who has done really well here for a long time. I am so pleased to come here to learn as much as possible. 'I’m here to do my best for Arsenal and to help out the team, so we can achieve good results for the last part of the season.' Kallstrom will arrive on these shores with something of a muddled reputation.The name is familiar, it has been for the best part of a decade. Only now, however, will we be able to pass judgement on the left-footed playmaker with a fancy for free-kicks who, to the consternation of many Arsenal fans, turns 32 later this year. For despite his lingering presence in our psyche, Kallstrom remains something of a mystery. Late bid: Wenger's move for the ex-Lyon midfielder came out of the blue . Twice he has lined up for Sweden against England at major tournaments, first during the 2-2 draw in Cologne at World Cup 2006 and then again at Euro 2012 as the Three Lions emerged 3-2 victors in Kiev. He was also part of the Sweden side – inspired by four-goal Zlatan Ibrahimovic – who enjoyed a 4-2 friendly-match triumph over England in November 2012 and has appeared 108 times for his country.During six years at Lyon he regularly locked horns with British clubs in European competition and, just last season with Spartak Moscow, he was sent off during the closing stages of a 2-1 defeat at Celtic. Hammer time: Kallstrom possesses is famed for possessing a sweet left foot . Back in October while playing for Sweden against Germany, this photograph of the midfielder with young mascot Max went viral. It shows Kallstrom helping the young fan, who has Williams syndrome, before the game. Max’s father wrote a letter to Kallsrom saying: ‘I am writing to you because I’m not quite sure if you understand how much of a difference you’ve made to us. ‘Because of your actions my son was able to experience exactly the same feelings as everyone else: pride, a sense of being special.’ Then there is his association – . unfortunate or otherwise – with the Championship Manager series, the . computer game which forecast big things for Kallstrom during his . formative years with Djurgardens IF in his homeland. No team was complete without the bargain buy from Scandanavia who would go on to superstardom in this alternative universe. So when Kallstrom did leave Sweden in the direction of France aged just 21, it was seen as the natural progression on a journey destined for one of Europe’s top clubs. After two-and-a-half years with Stade Rennais and on the back of his four appearances at the World Cup in Germany, champions Lyon moved for the midfielder. There he would spend six seasons as a virtual ever-present, scoring 22 goals from 269 appearances and collecting two Ligue 1 winners’ medals and two Coupe de France trophies along the way. Never, though, did he scale the heights once expected and, when Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas admitted he was willing to let the player go, Spartak came in with a £3million bid in the summer of 2012. Kallstrom joined Aiden McGeady in the Russian capital but, like the Scot, never truly settled.McGeady . brought closure on his unhappy stay when he signed for Everton earlier . this month and the pair will be reunited when Arsenal travel to Goodison .

"A health spa has offered potential customers the chance to enjoy a ‘long romantic Kristallnacht’ - just days before the 75th anniversary of the Nazi atrocity with the same name. The astonishing error was made by Kristall Sauna-Wellnesspark in Bad Klosterlausnitz, Germany, in an advert on its website which was accompanied by a photograph of candles. The spa’s owners have apologised for their ‘insensitive naming of this event’ and admitted it was ‘extremely inappropriate’ - but claimed they often tagged part of their name, Kristall, onto events. Extraordinary error: The advert on the Kristall Sauna-Wellnesspark website had originally read in full: 'The long romantic Kristall-Nacht: Enjoy the evening hours in romantic candle light and relax' Apology: The shocking mistake was made by Kristall Sauna-Wellnesspark in Bad Klosterlausnitz, Germany . ‘We are extraordinarily regretful and of course this was unintentional - believe us, we are quite ashamed about our mistake,’ a statement by the owners said, according to The Times of Israel. The name of the promotion has been since changed by spa bosses to: ‘The long romantic night’. According to The Jerusalem Post, the advert on the website had originally read in full: ‘The long romantic Kristall-Nacht: Enjoy the evening hours in romantic candle light and relax.’ An employee at the spa told the newspaper the advert was a ‘misunderstanding and refers to the name of the firm’ and that officials had ‘apologised for the mistake and there was nothing political’. Kristallnacht, the 'night of broken glass', was when the Nazis coordinated a wave of attacks in 1938 in Germany and Austria - burning synagogues, ransacking homes and looting Jewish-owned stores.

It comes as Conservative MP Fiona Bruce said Christian persecution in the Middle East should provoke the same outrage as the Nazis' treatment of Jews during the Second World War. She told MPs that Christianity is the most persecuted faith in the world and the issues should result in people crying out with the same abhorrence and horror as for atrocities such as Kristallnacht.","Error by Kristall Sauna-Wellnesspark in Bad Klosterlausnitz, Germany .

"A care home has been fined just £5,000 after a vulnerable pensioner died after suffering from severe burns when nurses lowered her into a scalding hot bath. Former hospital matron Beatrice Morgan, 88, suffered the injuries while she was a resident at the Greencroft Care Home in Queensferry, Flintshire in August 2012. It had been expected that Greencroft Care Ltd could have faced a fine in the region of £100,000 for breaching health and safety rules. Scroll down for video . Beatrice Morgan, left, who died after suffering severe burns when she was lowered into a scalding hot bath by care workers. She has previously worked as a hospital matron, right, at the Wrexham Maelor Hosptial in north Wales . However, at Flintshire Magistrates Court on Thursday, the company was fined just £5,000 after the court heard how they had been in liquidation since last May. District Judge Gwyn Jones also said it was unlikely it would ever be collected. Despite the sanction, owner Timothy Ogunleye, 52, who lives in a £1.6million home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, and has combined assets of £5.7million, remains the director of seven other care homes which can house up to 336 residents. Two are being inspected by the care watchdog. Miss Morgan, from New Brighton near Mold, suffered from dementia and became a resident at the Greencroft Care Home, which specialised in care for the elderly. In September 2012 she died from pneumonia and a blood clot in her lungs caused by the burns at a specialist burns unit at Whiston Hospital, a month after she was lowered into the scalding hot bath. The court heard how the care home had no effective control over the temperature of the hot water at the home, no risk assessment had been carried out, and there had been little staff training. Prosecutor Simon Parrington said Miss Morgan suffered scald burns to her lower legs, trunk and left arm. After the incident thermostatic control mixer valves were fitted at the home. Yesterday Greencroft Care Ltd, pictured, was fined just £5,000 at Flintshire Magistrates Court after breaching health and safety rules . The court heard how the care home had no effective control over the temperature of the hot water at the home . The temperature of the water at the time of the incident was not known but tests on another bath which had not had the new values showed the temperature to be 50.7C. Health and Safety Executive inspector Katherine Walker said that the maximum safe level was 44C. An investigation also showed that there were old values present but they were behind wall panels, had not been maintained and the company did not know they were there. A new value control had been placed on the bath in which Miss Morgan was scalded before she arrived to start her investigation, the inspector added. Judge Jones said Miss Morgan was extremely vulnerable and frail and that the temperature of the bath was not controlled by a correctly adjusted thermostatic valve. Susan Laws, left, and Ann Elliot, Miss Morgan's nieces who said their aunt would have been shocked by the care she received . He added that it was 'a very, very basic requirement – in fact, a matter of common sense.' He explained: 'The company either did not care for the safety of its residents or it could not be bothered to bring the standards of the home to a minimum standard which would have prevented the potential risks. 'Members of staff were doing their best in difficult circumstances, there was little staff training and little if any staff support. 'There was very little if any staff supervision and no risk assessment. Even the most basic risk assessment did not come until after she was scalded.' The judge also added that there was no bathing policy and improvements had not been carried out because he said 'the company, to put it mildly, did not want to spend.' He said: 'Company directors and senior managers know and ignored the risks. 'It is clear that this company was running an establishment without understanding their responsibilities.' An inspection by the Care and Social Service Inspectorate for Wales raised serious concerns about the dignity and safety of the Greencroft home’s 26 residents, including poor staffing levels and training, cleanliness and security. It went to court to apply for the home’s immediate closure. Miss Morgan had never married and had been proud to work as a matron at the Wrexham Maelor Hospital in Wrexham, North Wales. After she retired, she continued to be active in her local community, where she was described as a feisty lady until she was 80. Miss Morgan's nieces Ann Elliot and Susan Laws travelled from Kent for the hearing and said their aunt would have been shocked at her treatment given the way she had cared for so many people during her nursing career. Mrs Elliot explained: 'It is shocking that she was scalded this way – it is such a basic caring procedure that everybody does every day. 'They said that they understood the way the judge had to deal with it because the company no longer existed. 'I hope it makes other care homes think of what they are doing. It was such a horrible way to spend her last days.'","Beatrice Morgan suffered burns at the Greencroft Care Home in Flintshire .

"A former LAPD detective who believes his father killed the Black Dahlia believes a cadaver dog's search of his old Hollywood home has turned up the scent of the woman who was killed 66 years ago. The shocking murder of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, is one of the oldest unsolved murder cases in Los Angeles history. On Jan. 15, 1947, Short's severely mutilated body was discovered in a vacant lot near the intersection of 39th Street and Norton Avenue in South Los Angeles. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Black Dahlia: A head shot of Elizabeth Short who had been an aspiring actress until her untimely murder . Black Dahlia: The body of Elizabeth Short had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood, her face had also been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears . The body of Elizabeth Short, 22, had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood. Her face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears, creating an effect known as a Glasgow smile. Short also had multiple cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been removed. The body had been washed and cleaned and had been ‘posed’ with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread. The gruesome murder generated masses of media interest at the time. The newspapers of the day, which had a habit of nicknaming colorful crimes, started referring to Short as the Black Dahlia after the then popular film The Blue Dahlia. To add to the case’s sense of mystery and intrigue, both LAPD officials and newspaper editors received taunting notes believed to be from Short's killer. Steve Hodel, right, with cadaver dog handler Paul Dostie, and Buster, searched the Sowden/Franklin House at 5121 Franklin Ave., Hollywood for evidence in November 2012 . Sowden House, the potential murder scene and Dr George Hodel, who was a suspect in the original investigation and who Steve Hodel believes is responsible for the murder of the Black Dahlia . The Los Angeles District Attorney office drew up a list of 25 people it considered viable suspects, although as many as 60 people have confessed to the murder at one time or another. In his 2003 book ‘Black Dahlia Avenger,’ Steve Hodel first made the claim that his father, a doctor, was responsible for the murder. George Hodel had been a suspect in the original case and investigators had even planted a bug in the house to listen for incriminating admissions. But before authorities brought charges, Dr. Hodel abruptly abandoned his family and relocated to Asia. He died in 1991. Steve Hodel believes his father killed the Black Dahlia at the family’s then home, the distinctive ‘Sowden House’ in Hollywood, which is largely unchanged and looks the same as it did at the time of the murder. Elizabeth Short's mutilated body was found in a vacant lot near a busy intersection on the southwest section of L.A. in 1947 . Not long before her death, Short was arrested in Santa Barbara for underage drinking and this police mugshot was taken . Hodel was also able to establish that he and his siblings had been away with their mother at that time. When the opportunity arose for Hodel to return to his childhood home, he jumped at the chance after producers of the SyFy Channel’s Ghost Hunters program arranged it with the current owners. Last November Hodel, together with retired police Sgt. Paul Dostie of Mammoth Lakes and Buster, a Labrador retriever trained to detect the unique smell of human composition, visited the property. Once let loose, Buster quickly established four locations in the basement where he could pick up a faint trace of human remains. The basement had never been finished and since the floor was still dirt, soil samples were taken.Hodel is awaiting the results of those samples, which might once and for all confirm who killed the Black Dahlia.

"Liverpool suffered a huge blow on Friday when Daniel Sturridge was ruled out for at least three more weeks after suffering another injury in training. Manager Brendan Rodgers had been hoping the striker’s return to fitness would be a boost to his faltering side. Now Sturridge, who injured his calf during a warm-up at Melwood on Thursday, will miss a number of crucial games, including home and away Champions League group games against mighty Real Madrid. Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is expected to be out of action for around three weeks . Sturridge has been sidelined since picking up a thigh injury while on international duty with England . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was hoping to welcome back Sturridge to his starting line-up . 1. QPR v Liverpool . 2. Liverpool v Real Madrid . 3. Liverpool v Hull . 4. Liverpool v Swansea . 5. Newcastle v Liverpool . 6. Real Madrid v Liverpool . 7. Liverpool v Chelsea . Liverpool have seven games in the next three weeks, including a last 16 Capital One Cup tie against Swansea on October 28 and a Barclays Premier League clash against Chelsea at Anfield on November 8. Sturridge was recovering from a thigh problem suffered on England duty in September. The injury led to a rift between Rodgers and England manager Roy Hodgson over the striker’s recovery schedule. Despite Rodgers doing his best to play it down on Friday, lingering bad feeling remains, after Hodgson suggested that the Liverpool manager’s practice of having a two-day recovery period for players after games is a waste of time. Ironically, Sturridge could be fit just as Hodgson is building up to England’s next Euro 2016 qualifying game against Slovenia on November 15. Sturridge, pictured scoring against Italy at the 2014 World Cup, could return to action against Slovenia . The fall-out from the last Euro 2016 tie continued on Friday with Rodgers suggesting that Hodgson failed Raheem Sterling by revealing publicly that the forward had admitted to feeling tired ahead of the Estonia game. According to the Anfield boss, Sterling, who is in Liverpool’s line-up to face Queens Park Rangers, returned to Merseyside this week shaken by the furore surrounding his omission from the England team. Rodgers believes Hodgson should have kept the conversation he had with Sterling in the build-up to the game private and hinted that he feels the England boss needs to learn a lesson. Rodgers said: ‘Every conversation you have with a player is private. ‘That’s how I work and I am sure Roy will probably look at this episode going forward and analyse where he can be better on it. ‘I’m sure when they [Sterling and Hodgson] meet up next they will speak on that and clear that up. ‘My only focus is getting Raheem’s confidence up. All this shook him a bit but he has been brilliant in training. This is a kid we bring up to be responsible and be honest.’ The Liverpool manager is incandescent that some people believe Sterling actually asked not to play for England last weekend. Rodgers has questioned Roy Hodgson's handling of Liverpool and England starlet Raheem Sterling . Asked if the FA should have clarified this, Rodgers said: ‘Maybe. I can’t control what he [Hodgson] says or thinks. ‘What has been disappointing and grossly unfair is how the kid has been on the back page for something he did not say. ‘He did not say he was not able to play. What he said was he felt tired, and what you do is take on board all the information and then make a decision. So you respect Roy’s decision not to play him. ‘Roy is a manager with great experience who has been around the game long enough and all managers deal with situations differently. ‘But I have one thing to clear up. I have seen a lot written about the second-day recovery. ‘People think Liverpool players are at home on day two with their feet up watching Sky Sports. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Liverpool boss Rodgers believes England manager Hodgson could have dealt with Sterling differently . Rodgers and Sterling shared a joke on Friday as Liverpool geared up for their league fixture against QPR . ‘My belief and training model is to make players better. Part of that is recovery as my game is about pressing and playing at a high physical level. Our second-day recovery is technically a session. The space we play in is very small to reduce the intensity. ‘That has worked for me all the way through my life and has kept players fit and fresh. ‘That has helped people here like Steven Gerrard to play as many games (as he has). Recovery is vital, physical and mental. I take great pride in it and give it a lot of focus. ‘I’m not waiting for a thesis to give me evidence. We’re at the edge of the game creating evidence ourselves.’ This week former Liverpool players Jamie Carragher and Michael Owen have suggested it was unusual for a player to give a manager an excuse to leave him out by admitting he was tired. Jamie Carragher (left) and Michael Owen (right) were both critical of Sterling's decision to admit he was tired . Rodgers said: ‘The speed of the game is different even to what it was five years ago. Players cannot play every game at the top level, in particular young players. If you put too many miles on the clock, you will break them and they will end up finished at 26 or 27. ‘What I’ve been really proud of in watching Raheem is his honesty and responsibility. Responsibility is for a 19-year-old boy to say he was tired. This is a kid who loves playing. He never misses a day’s training, the work ethic he puts in for his game is fantastic. He loves playing for England. ‘Around the time of getting the call-up I see the excitement in his eyes. This is a boy that felt a bit tired and if you asked half or three-quarters of the squad they will probably have said they felt a bit tired too.’ Rodgers also hinted he would have no problem with Sterling playing in next summer’s Under 21 European Championship. Rodgers hopes events of the last month will not sour his relationship with the FA or with Hodgson. He said: ‘We have served England well with the numbers of players we push through for the national team and the style of football we play.’","Liverpool ace Daniel Sturridge could miss Liverpool's next seven games .

"Forget wireless or portable phone chargers, a pair of engineering students have created a device that could charge a phone’s battery using Wi-Fi. The device uses so-called metamaterials that can capture energy waves and convert them into an electric current. The amount of voltage the device creates is also said to be more powerful than that produced through current USB chargers. Students from Duke University have created a device, pictured, that converts microwaves into an electric current. Having successfully tested their energy harvester, the researchers claim it could be modified, and one day, fitted to phones to charge batteries using Wi-Fi signals . Metamaterials are engineering structures capable of harvesting various forms of wave energy. By arranging certain materials, . including copper and fibreglass but also gold, in a particular shape and . pattern, the properties of those materials can combine to become an . almost ‘super’ material. Duke University's David Smith . explained: ‘Imagine a fabric woven of thread. In this fabric, light is . only allowed to flow over the threads. ‘If you punch a hole in the fabric . with a pin, light will go around the hole and resume its original course . of travel, since light can only travel over the thread. ‘ . He continued that because light waves can only travel in this way, the hole is practically ‘invisible’. Metamaterial arrays work in the same . way to control how waves move around the structure, making it possible . to capture and harvest them, and their energy. It was created by Allen Hawkes and Alexander Katko from Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering with help from professor of electrical and computer engineering, Steven Cummer. The team used five fibreglass and copper energy conductors wired together on a circuit board to create what's called a metamaterial array.

Having successfully tested their energy harvester with microwaves, the researchers claim it could be used to harvest the signal from other sources such as satellite signals, sound waves or Wi-Fi signals. ‘It’s possible to use this design for a lot of different frequencies and types of energy, including vibration and sound energy harvesting’ said Katko. ‘Until now, a lot of work with metamaterials has been theoretical. We are showing that with a little work, these materials can be useful for consumer applications.’ Katko continued that a metamaterial coating could also be applied to the ceiling of a room and used to redirect lost or dropped Wi-Fi signals. The researchers added that a similar device could one day be fitted to phones and other small electronic devices. This could make it possible to charge phones by connecting it to a Wi-Fi network, without the need for a charger or power point. ‘Our work demonstrates a simple and inexpensive approach to electromagnetic power harvesting,’ said Cummer. ‘The beauty of the design is that the basic building blocks are self-contained and additive. One can simply assemble more blocks to increase the scavenged power.’","Engineering students have created a device that captures wave signals .

"The shocking New York ‘catcalling’ video which went viral internationally last week has been recreated in New Zealand with extremely different . In a stark contrast, the model is mostly ignored by passers-by during her five hour experiment. In the original video, aspiring actress Shoshana Roberts was filmed walking through New York city for 10 hours, and was subjected to 108 catcalls and even followed by several overly-persistent men. She was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'sexy' and ‘damn, girl!’. It appears that Kiwis are far more polite, as model and yoga instructor Nicola Simpson was treated respectfully during her five-hour experiment on the streets of Auckland. Although she did received glances from admiring passers-by, who stopped or turned around to watch her, she was not confronted or harassed nearly as severely as the original video. In her social experiment, Ms Simpson did not receive the same wolf-whistles, nor were suggestive comments yelled at her, and she was only approached twice which were both in polite circumstances. Scroll down for video . Model Nicola Simpson recreated the New York experiment by walking through the streets of Auckland, New Zealand for five hours behind a hidden camera . Although the camera did capture people stopping to look at her, she did not receive the same contronting harassment that Ms Roberts was subjected to in New York . The New York video was filmed as part of a campaign for ‘Hollaback!’, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to ending street harassment. Whilst Ms Roberts, 24, had suggestive comments yelled at her while she walked around New York City, dressed modestly in jeans and a high-neck t-shirt, Ms Simpson, dressed in a tracksuit, was left to her own devices. New Zealand Herald were behind the latest experiment, filming Ms Simpson’s journey discreetly with a Go-Pro. Although she does attract glances, she is only disturbed twice; once by a man asking for directions and the second time by a man who apologises for interrupting her. The man who interrupts Ms Simpson is clearly taken with her, walking past her before turning around to introduce himself. Although she does attract glances, she is only disturbed twice; once by a man asking for directions and the second time by a man who apologises for interrupting her . The man, who ‘sounds European’ according to the subtitles, jogs down the street to tell Roberts that she ‘looks nice’. It may be interpreted as sinister, but the video makes it clear that he apologises for stopping her. In a stark contrast, Ms Roberts is followed down the street by a man for more than five minutes, pestering her with comments like ‘you don’t want to talk?’, ‘if I give you my number will you talk to me?’ When the video was posted, NY-based Roberts explained her involvement in the awareness campaign by saying, ‘everyone has a right to feel safe.’ 'This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?' The Herald explain that they shot the footage to try and measure the level of street harassment that women experience in Auckland. New Zealand Herald were behind the experiment, filming Ms Simpson’s journey discreetly with a Go-Pro . They define street harassment as ‘sexual comments, catcalls and whistles from male strangers’. Ms Simpson says that she found New Zealand men to be polite and that it was a refreshing change after her experiences living in New York for five years. ""It was nice, it was a change from New York. People were actually quite polite,"" she told New Zealand Herald. ""I didn't feel uncomfortable at all."" The New York experiment has received more than 33 million views. The New Zealand appropriation has had more than 600 thousand clicks in three days. The set off a storm of outrage since it was released Tuesday. Rape threats have since been directed toward Shosana Roberts, the woman in the video, according to multiple reports. The footage, which was shot and edited by Rob Bliss, was captured by a camera Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and walked silently along. Unwanted attention: Shoshana Roberts appeared in the original video, which showed the catcalling she experienced over a ten-hour period on the streets of New York . Speaking about the experience of making the video, Roberts told The Post 'I felt like crying and I have occurrences in my past of sexual assault, so I wasn’t even aware necessarily of all the times people were saying things to me. I was just going over in my head and reliving, unfortunately, these memories while I was walking. I wanted to break down in tears.' Emily May, executive director of Hollaback!, the anti-street harassment organization that put out the video, told The Washington Post 'It’s hitting a nerve. Certainly, people are coming out of the woodwork and saying some really offensive and misogynist things. 'We’ve had a number of rape threats and violent threats against Shoshana and we’re pulling those down as quickly as possible, but they exist. That’s scary and I think what they’re trying to do is scare her and scare us into not speaking out about this. And both of us are saying no, we need to talk about this because if we don’t talk about this, if we don’t get this story out, then none of this is going to change.' Hidden camera: The footage was captured by a camera Rob Bliss had in his backpack as he walked several feet of front of Roberts, who walked silently along . Bliss told The Post 'I’m getting some blowback, but not nearly as bad as Shoshana. Right now she’s getting a lot of threats and things like that and it’s just so sad. It’s like the video is now being echoed in real life.' At no point did Roberts make eye contact with any of the men she passed or talk to any of them. That didn't stop the comments from coming. When she didn't respond, one man told her, 'Somebody's acknowledging you for being beautiful. You should say thank you more!' Stalked: One man walked next to Roberts for five minutes as she walked through New York City . Another criticism was that some men's comments seemed innocuous: 'Good morning,' 'Have a nice day.' 'Some men could have been 'genuinely being nice,' Gerard Burke, a Brooklyn resident who readily acknowledged street harassment exists and has seen it happen to women in his family, told the AP. He said he thought the video shed light on a bigger problem, 'but some people just genuinely want to say hello.' That's the problem with street harassment, May told the wire service, because when there's a fear that a simple good morning could escalate into sexual comments or actions, there's a reluctance to engage at all. Everyday: Roberts said the number of comments she received on the streets the day the video was shot was nothing out of the ordinary for her .","The viral hidden camera 'catcall' video has been recreated in New Zealand .

"In a brave and shocking statement about the unobtainable beauty ideals perpetuated by modern media, an artist has allowed the Photoshop transformation of herself to be made into the music video to her first single. The haunting video sees Hungarian musician Boggie, real name Csemer Boglarka, singing her song Nouveau Parfum as she is altered through post-production in real time. Starting out make-up free, looking tired and with her hair unstyled, the singer is digitally retouched in front of our eyes, transformed in just a few minutes into a glamorous beauty. Scroll down for video . When they are placed next to each other, the difference between the retouched and real Boggie is startling . The digital remastering creates a woman (right) who, while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals, bears little resemblance to the real artist (left) The start of the simple video sees Boggie, simply dressed and wearing no make-up seen through a computer screen as her image starts to be manipulated . The skin tone is lightened and any imperfections are removed by the computer programs . The right eye is widened and its shape altered before it is copied, flipped, and used to replace the left eye . The colour and shape of her eyes, colour and style of her hair, skin tone and whiteness of her teeth are all completely altered, quite literally changing her identity. You can see skin imperfections wiped away at the click of a mouse, and artificial flattering lighting creates the kind of radiant and highlighted skin that women spend thousands trying to achieve, not realising that what they are trying to emulate does not exist in reality. Shockingly the facial shape is also altered in the video and her right eye is artificially widened before a mirror image of it is created and pasted over her real left eye to create perfect symmetry in the face. The teeth are whitened and the lips made fuller and more pink using a program specifically designed to alter parts of the face . The computer program can totally change eye colour- allowing the programer to pick from a vast colour palette . Similarly, hair style, length and colour are all easily manipulable, as if creating a doll . Once flawless eye make-up has been digitally applied and the hair 'perfected', we are left with a woman who, while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals, bears little resemblance to the real artist. Boggie chose to reveal the extent to which celebrities are altered as the video for her song which criticises modern consumerism and urges women to be themselves. The song, which is sung in French, starts with a list of brands and designers such as Prada, Hugo Boss, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, and  Lancome, before moving onto the refrain which states, ‘I am not a product.’ The chorus declares ‘Of beauty, preciousness; they cannot change me. Peerless, unparalleled. The new fragrance is myself’ while the third verse states ‘mascara, blush, lipstick, lipsticks, lip liners, eye shadow, foundation, nail, pressed powder and I do not want it.’ Flattering lighting and perfect eye make is applied . Under the new lighting, Boogie's hair colour is once again changed, scrolling through a range of colours until the perfect shade is found . As a final touch, Boogie's hair is swept to one side and digitally made to look much thicker . The video, which has exploded across the web since its release last week, is part of a trend attempting to lift the lid on the lack of reality in celebrity culture and advertising. In October, a 36-second clip, created by GlobalDemocracy.com, showing a relatively average-looking girl turned into a bombshell glamour model, went viral, adding fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding airbrushed models and how they can set unrealistic examples to impressionable young girls. A result of this is an increasing backlash against altering images, with American Eagle being the latest brand to release a totally un-airbrushed campaign for its new line of lingerie. The debate was reopened this week surrounding the digital retouching of Lena Dunham for her Vogue photoshoot (though it was, many thought, misjudged), and increasingly, brands who overuse Photoshop are being ‘shamed’ online, with the original images obtained and released as a comparison.","Music video is for Hungarian musician Boggie's song 'Nouveau Parfum'

"Long before man ventured into space, our canine companions were testing the water for us. To assess the then unknown effects of low gravity and forces during launch on living things, Russian scientists made these high-pressure suits to help keep dogs safe during experiments in the 1950s. They were strapped into what might be considered today as a rather crude contraption, put into a rocket and fired 80km to the edge of space before returning to Earth by parachute. Like a giant boot: This space suit was among the first made for dogs for experiments on the effects of low gravity and high-speed launches on living things . To boldly go: This picture taken in 1959 shows a dog preparing for launch from a Soviet base in Central Asia . The lessons learned paved the way for Laika's mission in 1957, when she became the first animal to orbit the Earth, and subsequently the first journeys into space by humans a few years later. Unfortunately, only a few suits have remained intact over the years. One, a brown, lace-up suit complete with a dog's head-shaped helmet and breathing apparatus, is currently on display at the National Space Centre in Leicester. Speaking when it first arrived at the centre in 2010, Kevin Yates, the Space Communications Manager, told the Guardian: 'At the beginning of the space race, no-one knew how the human body would respond to being in low gravity, high altitude and the forces exerted during launch. Pioneering pooch: Laika, who became the first animal to orbit the Earth in 1957, with her handler . Final frontier: For years, it had been reported that Laika (pictured on board the Sputnik 2 satellite) survived for six days until her oxygen ran out, but in 2002 it emerged that she likely perished within hours after launch . 'So animals were used to test the . reactions to these. Most of the dogs did survive. There were only a . couple of accidents where dogs died.' Russian scientists chose dogs, most of them strays from the streets of Moscow, because they felt they were better able to sit still for long periods than primates. The U.S., on the other hand, preferred chimpanzees because of their similarity to humans. Being enclosed in these suits that effectively wrapped them up like a giant boot must have been terrifying, but Mr Yates said many of the dogs seemed quite happy after they had landed back on Earth. Canine cosmonaut: Malyshka, a Russian space dog, poses here in its snug-fitting space suit with a transparent space helmet beside it in 1957 . One giant leap for canine kind: Two Russian 'spacedogs' Veterok (left) and Ugoloik wearing their space suits shortly after they were in orbit for 22 days in 1966 . He said: 'I've seen original footage of the dogs being collected when they parachute back down and they seem very excited to see their owners.' Laika, a stray Russian dog, became the first animal to orbit the earth in November 1957 aboard the Sputnik 2 satellite, but died during the mission. It had for years been reported that she survived for six days until her oxygen ran out, but in 2002 it emerged that she likely perished from overheating within hours after launch. Four years later, Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to orbit the Earth aboard Vostok 1, closely followed by American Alan Shepard a month after that.","High-pressure suits protected dogs during experiments in the 1950s .

"In a bid to urge the Federal Aviation Administration to lift a . ban currently preventing U.S. airlines from . flying to Israel, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has flown to Tel Aviv in an effort to prove it is safe. The ban was imposed after a Hamas rocket demolished a home near Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv and as airlines remain skittish following the downing of a passenger plane over Ukraine last week. Bloomberg, echoing comments made by the Israel Government, said the decision to impose a ban was a victory for the terrorists. Scroll down for video . Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is urging the Federal Aviation Administration to lift a ban imposed on Tuesday which is currently preventing U.S. airlines from flying to Israel . To re-enforce his point, he announced that he would fly on El Al to Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to ‘show solidarity with the Israeli people and to demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.' ‘Ben Gurion is the best protected airport in the world and El Al flights have been regularly flying in and out of it safely,’ said Bloomberg. ‘The flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately. I strongly urge the FAA to reverse course and permit US airlines to fly to Israel.’ When U.S. and European airlines quickly canceled flights to Israel on Tuesday, they showed both a skittishness and a new sense of urgency in dealing with global trouble spots following last week's downing of a passenger plane over Ukraine. Delta Flight 468 from New York to Tel Aviv carrying 290 passengers and crew was rerouted to Paris yesterday . Israeli airline El Al has maintained its regular flight schedule while U.S. and European airlines quickly canceled flights to Israel on Tuesday . Delta Air Lines turned around one of its jets mid-flight and indefinitely canceled all future flights between the U.S. and Israel after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near Ben-Gurion Airport. Other U.S. airlines quickly took similar action, and counterparts in Europe and Canada followed within hours, despite protests from the Israeli government. Israeli airline El Al maintained its regular flight schedule. The airlines were out ahead of aviation regulators in stopping service. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 24-hour ban on flights to Israel after the U.S. airlines acted. Germany's Lufthansa, Italian airline Alitalia and Air France all acted before the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory. How long the cessation of flights will last is unclear. U.S. airlines now must wait for the FAA, which said it will provide updated guidance by midday Wednesday. Aviation and legal experts said that airlines are now taking risk assessment into their own hands, both for the safety of passengers and to avoid claims of negligence, following last week's Malaysia Airlines disaster. Major airlines have moved quickly to cancel services to Israel’s main air hub – Ben Gurion International in Tel Aviv – in light of yesterday’s attack, with saw a rocket land a mile from the airport. The incident comes at a time of heightened tension within the air industry following last week’s downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine by an apparent missile strike. The latest information is as follows: . America’s Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a statement yesterday in response to the rocket attack, informing all American carriers that they are ‘prohibited from flying to or from Israel’s Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours… in response to a rocket attack which landed approximately one mile’ from the airport. The ban will run until 12:15 EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) today – 5.15pm UK time – but may be extended for a further period. Delta re-routed yesterday’s Flight 468 – which had been due to land in Tel Aviv – to Paris. The airline has announced that it ‘has suspended service until further notice to and from Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv and its New York-JFK hub. Delta, in coordination with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, is doing so to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees.’ British Airways is still operating to Ben Gurion International. Its two daily flights to Tel Aviv from London Heathrow are still on the schedule. Its 08:50 service took off late, and is currently en route. Its 22:30 service is still due to depart as listed. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) says it ‘strongly recommends’ that airlines should avoid operating in and out of Tel Aviv. Easyjet has announced that it ‘is suspending its services to and from Tel Aviv for 24 hours, and, as a result, will not be operating Luton/Tel Aviv/Luton and Basel/Tel Aviv/Basel flights on Wednesday 23 July.’ Air France and KLM have suspended flights to Israel. A statement says that ‘Air France has decided to suspend flights to Tel Aviv until further notice. Air France's security department is closely monitoring local developments in real time. The safety of our passengers and our crews remains our top priority.’ Lufthansa, Germanwings and Austrian Airlines yesterday announced two-day suspensions of flights to Israel. Air Canada and Alitalia have cancelled flights to Israel. Passengers near an information board featuring numerous cancelled flights from Ben Gurion Airport, in Lod, Israel, on Tuesday . 'Most airlines have security departments that try to evaluate those sorts of risk,' said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. 'Some do it better than others, but I would expect that everyone is on a very heightened sense of alert right now.' Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, said airlines might be more proactive about avoiding hot spots, although he noted that there are very few areas where non-government militaries have weapons sophisticated enough to shoot down a plane. The Israel government felt the airlines overreacted Tuesday. The Transportation Ministry called on the companies to reverse their decision, insisting Ben-Gurion Airport is safe and completely guarded and saying there is no reason to 'hand terror a prize,' by halting the flights. Palestinian militants have fired more than 2,000 rockets toward Israel, and several heading toward the area of the airport have been intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system, but police spokeswoman Luba Samri said Tuesday's landing was the closest to the airport since fighting began on July 8.

"Daniel Sturridge is in danger of missing the Merseyside derby after Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers confirmed the striker will be out for 'up to three weeks'. The 25-year-old returned home from international duty early having picked up a knock during a training session before England's trip to Switzerland. Now Sturridge could miss the rest of September - a period in which Liverpool play five matches.

'Emre Can could be out for up to six weeks with his ankle when they got 6-0 up. Joe Allen is also a doubt after playing on a dreadful pitch with Wales.' Rodgers also criticised England's medical staff for their handling of Sturridge's injury. Daniel Sturridge played in the friendly against Norway at Wembley, which England won 1-0 .

There is always good communication but I haven’t spoken to him after this round of games. 'I speak regularly with international managers. Roy has probably been led by sports science department. But you can’t throw a blanket over them. One recovery programme doesn’t fit them all. 'Luis Suarez, for instance, needed to do extra work on his second day of recovery.

'We played a game here and both Kenny Jackett (Wolves manager) and I were here. Both teams needed it. It was really competitive and Mario has been as good as gold since he has been in.' Rodgers added: 'We have planned out the team for the next five games. You have to rotate but also have to be consistent. There won’t be wholesale changes. 'We have had a great transfer window. Alberto Moreno was excellent against Tottenham and Javier Manquillo settled in straight away. We have been very specific with the type of players we have brought in.

"Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink returned to the English game as manager of League Two club Burton Albion  and admitted: ‘I can’t live without football.’ The 42-year-old former Chelsea striker has demonstrated his desire to start at the bottom by signing a deal until 2017 worth £40,000 a year — less than he earned each week in his heyday — to become only the third black manager in the Football League. ‘Money was not the motivation,’ said Hasselbaink. ‘The motivation was the club, the set-up, the beliefs, the players and the atmosphere. Football is everything for me. I’m not afraid of League Two. You don’t have to serve your time at the bottom, but when you are a young manager you don’t get much of the time you need. Expectancy is a lot higher at the top. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (left) alongside new assistant manager David Oldfield, who played for Man City . Former Chelsea striker Hasselbaink holds a Burton scarf aloft during his unveiling as their new manager . Hasselbaink celebrates scoring a goal for Chelsea, against Tottenham in April 2004 . ‘I applied for a few jobs but when Burton became available I jumped at it.’ Derby boss Steve McClaren, who gave the Dutchman his first coaching job at Nottingham Forest, approached neighbours Burton about appointing him as Gary Rowett’s successor. Hasselbaink managed Antwerp in the Belgian league last season but turned down a new contract there to pursue employment in England and be with his family in Surrey. He was on the phone to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers  after a tough first training session in which goalkeeper Dean Lyness suffered a suspected broken leg. ‘I spoke to a lot of people before coming here,’ he added. ‘Steve McClaren, Brendan Rodgers, Gustavo Poyet and also to Alan Pardew, who was very interesting and helpful. Everyone was very positive. I had 51 text messages this morning and yesterday something like 40 — I only have 120 contacts in my phone!’ Hasselbaink admitted that he cannot live without football as he spoke on his return to the English game . Pictured in 2004, Hasselbaink (left) battles with Arsenal's Ashley Cole at Highbury . Hasselbaink addressed the media at the Pirelli Stadium as he was unveiled as League Two's newest manager . Hasselbaink, who also played for Leeds, Charlton and Cardiff, retired in 2008 and spent time at Chelsea working on his coaching badges. ‘Luiz Felipe Scolari was there then, and after that Guus Hiddink,’ he said. ‘I didn’t come across Jose Mourinho that often. He’s very private.’ Even though he joins Huddersfield boss Chris Powell and Carlisle’s Keith Curle as the only black managers in the top four divisions, it is not an issue Hasselbaink is keen to dwell on. Nor would he like to see the introduction of the NFL’s Rooney Rule that requires teams to interview candidates from ethnic minorities. ‘It has nothing to do with being the third black manager, please, no,’ he said. ‘I’m proud to be black and give that back to my kids, but I don’t see myself as a role model for black people. ‘And I wouldn’t want to be interviewed because of the Rooney Rule. I would want somebody to call me because I’m the right person for the job.’","Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink took over at Burton manager on Thursday .

His superb strike was enough to send his side through to the last four for the first time in 24 years. Belgium, whose best World Cup run was in 1986 when they were knocked out by Diego Maradona's Argentina in the semi-finals, had a couple of chances but otherwise offered little in attack despite sustained late pressure that set nerves among the thousands of Argentines thronging the giant arena jangling. The Albiceleste remain unbeaten at the . tournament, but had failed to impress with their performances on the way . to the last eight. The win . came as it was revealed that Football great Alfredo Di Stefano was in . 'critical' condition in hospital after a heart attack, his Real Madrid . club said on Saturday. The . 88-year-old Di Stefano was in 'critical, serious' condition at Madrid's . Gregorio Maranon Hospital, club spokeswoman Marta Santisteban said. Alfredo Di Stefano, pictured, is in a 'critical' condition after suffering a heart attack . A . spokeswoman for Madrid's emergency service Samur told the AP that an . ambulance was called to attend Di Stefano at Juan Ramon Jimenez street, . just north of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, at 5 pm. She said paramedics found Di Stefano's heart had stopped beating and he . had stopped breathing, but they managed to resuscitate him after 18 . minutes. The . former Argentina forward helped Madrid win five straight European . Champions Cups from 1956-60 and eight Spanish league titles. He was . voted European player of the year in 1957 and 1959. He retired at the age . of 40 in 1966, ending a 21-year-long playing career. Madrid appointed Di Stefano honorary president in 2000 and named its new training complex after him six years later, with a statue erected in his honor in 2008. Di Stefano underwent a quadruple aorta-coronary bypass with a pacemaker implanted in December 2005 after suffering a myocardial infarction. And Diego Maradona, who captained the side to glory in 1986 and was coach in 2010, insisted before kick-off that they needed to improve. 'It seems to me that Argentina today has no idea,' he told AS. 'In the first half against Switzerland [in the round of 16] the team did not have one chance.' In the . second of tonight's clashes, Costa Rica take on Holland at the Arena .

Jorge Luis Pinto's side surprisingly blazed their way through Group D to make the last 16 for the first time since 1990, and a penalty shoot-out victory over Greece earned them the first quarter-final appearance in their history. Meanwhile, FIFA's disciplinary committee is studying the challenge that led to Brazil's star player Neymar suffering a fractured vertebra to decide on action against Colombia's Juan Zuniga. The Colombia defender caught Neymar with a knee in his back in a full-blooded challenge that went unpunished during Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win.","Tim Krul is brought on as a substitute with the game heading for penalties .

"Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been pictured enjoying a sunny holiday despite the spate of corruption charges levelled against him earlier this week. Although he faces 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine if found guilty of charges that include corruption and 'influence peddling', Sarkozy seemed happy to peddle his way across the picturesque coast of Southern France in his own private Tour de France. The 59-year-old could be seen with a friend cruising on his bike through the windy roads of Cap Negre, where temperatures today reached the early 20s. Nicolas Sarkozy was today photographed peddling his way through the streets of Cap Negre, Southern France . Clad in black lycra cycling shorts and a plain white T-shirt, he seemed happy to stop and chat along the way with locals. Sarkozy this week became the first ex-French president to be detained by police when he was questioned by investigators for 15 hours. And he has now accused investigators of ‘humiliating’ him after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'. He appeared on French television to say ‘the country of human rights and the rule of law (France)’ should not have to put up with left-wing judges who want to scupper his longed-for return to power. The Paris home Sarkozy shares with his wife was first raided by anti-corruption officers in 2012, within days of him losing that year’s presidential election to the Socialist Francois Hollande. There has been a steady stream of corruption allegations aimed at Sarkozy ever since, with Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and Azibert Gilbert, a judge implicated in the corruption case, also charged. The former French president also stopped to have photos taken with locals during his cycle . It was only on Wednesday that Sarkozy, left, was charged with corruption after being questioned for 15 hours . Sarkozy has accused investigators of trying to humiliate him and claimed left-wing judges want to scupper his long hoped for return to power . Sarkozy was the first ex-president in the history of modern France to be detained in custody by police . Sarkozy, who was president for five years from 2007, is suspected of having tried to pervert the course of justice through his contacts in the judiciary. He is said to have offered an attractive job in Monaco to Judge Azibert in return for inside information about the progress of the so-called Bettencourt affair. A photograph taken earlier in the week captured an unhappy looking Sarkozy travelling by car to be presented before a judge . This was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman, towards his election campaign in 2007. Investigators also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone was being tapped as part of investigations into another matter, the so-called Gaddafi Affair. This is said to have involved Sarkozy receiving millions more from the late Colonel Gaddafi – the former Libyan leader. Sarkozy, who was immune from prosecution while in office, insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing. Meanwhile, immediate family members have come to his aid with both his mother-in-law and son passionately defending him. However, his 46-year-old ex-supermodel wife has been noticeably absent, leading to speculation the couple are having problems in their relationship.","Former French president pictured out on cycle break in Southern France .

"Scientists are currently competing to create the best invisibility cloak, as imagined in films such as Harry Potter and Star Trek. As yet, no-one has managed to replicate a flexible cloak as worn by the boy wizard, or the cloaking device used by the Kingons to make their ships invisible to another starship's sensors, but two Canadian scientists have created an invisibility cloak that they say is thin and adaptive to different types and sizes of objects. Unlike other recent cloaks that rely on planes of glass simply bending light in a way that renders small objects temporarily invisible, the researchers have taken an electrical engineering approach, which makes objects undetectable to radar. This is the set up of the lab where Professor George Eleftheriades and Michael Selvanayagam have designed and tested a new approach to cloaking - by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field. The radiated field cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object . They said as the technology advances, it could also be adapted to make things invisible to the human eye too. Professor George Eleftheriades and PhD student Michael Selvanayagam have designed and tested a new approach to cloaking, by surrounding an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field. The radiated field cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object, rendering the object invisible to radar, explained the two researchers at the University of Toronto. ‘We've taken an electrical engineering approach, but that's what we are excited about,"" said Professor Eleftheriades. ‘It's very practical.’ When light hits an object, such as a postbox and bounces back into a person’s eyes, they can see it and similarly, when radio waves hit the object, they bounce back to a radar detector and reveal it is a postbox, in a certain location. The scientists’ system wraps the mailbox in a layer of tiny antennas that radiate a field away from the box, cancelling out any waves that would bounce back. In this way, the mailbox becomes undetectable to radar. Usually, when radio waves hit an object, they bounce back to a radar detector (illustrated) and reveal its location. The engineers surrounded an object with small antennas that collectively radiate an electromagnetic field, which cancels out any waves scattering off the cloaked object, rendering the object invisible to radar . While hiding post boxes might not have any immediate military applications, the technology could be used to create a next-generation devices to cloak vehicles. Professor Eleftheriades said he and Mr Selvanayagam have demonstrated a new way of cloaking objects. ‘It's very simple. Instead of surrounding what you're trying to cloak with a thick metamaterial shell, we surround it with one layer of tiny antennas, and this layer radiates back a field that cancels the reflections from the object.’ In their experiment, described in the journal Physical Review X, they effectively cloaked a metal cylinder from radio waves using one layer of loop antennas. The duo said their system can be scaled up to cloak larger objects using more loops, and the loops could become printed and flat, like a blanket or skin. Currently the antenna loops must be manually attuned to the electromagnetic frequency they need to cancel, but in future they could function both as sensors and active antennas, adjusting to different waves in real time, much like the technology behind noise-cancelling headphones. The ultimate camouflage? The engineers said their technology could be used to make military vehicles (pictured) undetectable to radar systems and the innovation could one day be applied to light, as well as radio waves, potentially making a tank invisible to the human eye . The pair began developing a functional invisibility cloak began around 2006, but their early systems were necessarily large and clunky –to cloak a car, an individual had to completely envelop the vehicle in many layers of metamaterials to ‘shield’ it from electromagnetic radiation. The size and inflexibility of the approach makes this technique impractical for real-world uses, while earlier attempts to craft thin cloaks were not adaptive and could only work for specific, small objects. Beyond obvious applications, such as hiding military vehicles or conducting surveillance operations, this cloaking technology could eliminate obstacles, such as structures interrupting signals from cellular base stations that could be cloaked to allow signals to pass by freely, the said. The system can also alter the signature of a cloaked object, making it appear bigger, smaller, or even shifting it in space. Their tests showed the cloaking system works with radio waves but could also work with light waves in the future, using the same principle as the antenna technology matures, which could mean objects could be invisible to the human eye. ‘There are more applications for radio than for light,’ Professor Eleftheriades said. ‘It's just a matter of technology - you can use the same principle for light and the corresponding antenna technology is a very hot area of research.’","Engineers have surrounded an object with small antennas that collectively .

"Police in Ferguson had mistakenly arrested a man before the Michael Brown shooting and, after realizing, proceeded to beat him up in a holding cell and then charge him with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms, it has been claimed. Henry Davis, 52, had missed his turn off for the Missouri city of St. Charles during heavy rain late at night on September 20, 2009, pulling over about 20 miles away in Ferguson. While waiting for the rain to clear about 3am, a patrol officer ran Davis' plates and arrested him on an outstanding warrant - however it was the wrong Henry Davis. The wanted man had a different middle name and Social Security number, but Davis, a welder, said the officer cuffed him and put him into a patrol car without explanation, The Daily Beast reported. 'Excessive force': Henry Davis, 52, said in a lawsuit that he was arrested by Ferguson in September 2009 for no reason, severely beaten in lock-up and then charged with 'property damage' for bleeding on the uniforms of four officers . Davis had protested his innocence, and said the cops realized their mistake at Ferguson police station, recalling a booking officer saying: 'We have a problem.' But Davis was placed in a one-man cell, which already had one man asleep on the only single bed. Being early morning and cold, he asked for a sleeping mat from a nearby pile, but was refused. Some time later, Davis said in a lawsuit file thereafter, the booking officer returned to the cell with three other officers. He said he was slammed against the back wall by one of them and told to lay down with his hands behind his back. Davis was straddled by a female officer, he said, and cuffed. Two officers then entered the cell, he said. 'They started hitting me,' Davis later said in court, according to The Daily Beast. 'I was getting hit and I just covered up' The two left and the female officer returned, holding up Davis' head. The officer that initially slammed him against the wall returned and kicked him in the head. 'I almost passed out at that point ... Paramedics came,' Davis said. 'They said it was too much blood, I had to go to the hospital.' Davis was taken to hospital in a police vehicle, however he refused treatment, demanding a witness and photo proof of what had happened. Afterwards, still under arrest, he was taken back to the police station and held in a cell for several days. Davis was eventually charged with four counts of property damage - having allegedly bled on the uniforms of four officers - and released on $1,500 bail. Auhtorities: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson is surrounded by his officers as he leaves a news conference in Forestwood Park on Friday, Aug. 15, 2014 . Police officers stand near a crowd that gathered by the scene where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police in Ferguson, Mo., near St. Louis on Saturday, Aug. 9, 2014 . Don't shoot: A crowd gathers near the scene where 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police in Ferguson, Mo., near St. Louis on Saturday, Aug. 9, 2014 . Davis subsequently filed a civil suit, and at least two of the officers involved said in court they did not get blood on their uniforms. There was no video of the alleged police attack to support Davis' claims of brutality, because the security cameras were VHS at the time and had been recorded at 32 times the normal speed. A federal magistrate ruled that if the officers had committed perjury about the bloody uniforms, the charges were too minor to press ahead with. The magistrate also concluded that Davis' injuries were too minor to constitute excessive force. However a CAT scan taken after the incident confirmed he had suffered a concussion. The property charges were dropped and the lawsuit was closed. Davis' lawyer, James Schottel, is currently preparing an appeal, he told The Daily Beast. Schottel claims that perjury is perjury however minor, and that a concussion is now considered a serious injury. Schottel also believes that Davis' chances of appealing have now gone up on the back of the Michael Brown outrage and the increasing scrutiny of the police in Ferguson. Davis' case surfaced as as Missouri state senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal, a Democrat representing parts of St. Louis County in the state Senate, attacked Governor Jay Nixon, as well as other Democrats, for their lack of involvement in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting. 'There hasn't been a single white Democrat down here,' Chappelle-Nadal said Wednesday, according to The Washington Post. 'Mark my words, the Republicans might start showing up before they do.' Chapelle-Nadal, who has been in Ferguson this week, has also been sending scathing Tweets about Nixon, including: 'You don’t know s--- bc you never communicate. F--- you, Governor!,'reads one tweet.'","Henry Davis, 52, was arrested in Ferguson, Missouri, on September 20, 2009 .

"Manuel Pellegrini savoured Manchester City’s Barclays Premier League title triumph, then vowed to start building on the club’s success immediately. A 2-0 win at home to West Ham saw City finish two points clear of Liverpool as they completed a league and Capital One Cup double, but Pellegrini admitted the club’s ambitions were larger. ‘Big teams cannot be satisfied with just one title,’ said the City manager. ‘It is very important to celebrate today and tomorrow, and start on Tuesday working for next season. Then we will start thinking where we can improve. The bumps: Pellegrini is thrown in the air after Manchester City secured the Premier League title . Rebuild: But the Chilean vowed to build on the success and come back stronger next season . ‘It was a beautiful, great season and in the future we will try to continue winning. I manage a great group of players and a great institution. We were the best team in the Premier League.’ City will mark their second title in three years with an open-top bus parade through Manchester city centre this evening before catching a flight to Abu Dhabi to celebrate with the club’s owners. They hired Pellegrini last summer to bring harmony after the rancour of Roberto Mancini’s final season in charge, and the Chilean admitted he had inherited an unhappy dressing room. Celebrations: Joe Hart leads the City party in the dressing room . ‘Maybe the relations were not the best,’ he said. ‘It was very important to have calm, to try to convince them how we can play and how important it was to be close, all of us. Maybe they were in a very difficult moment when I arrived here but they always believed what I told them.’ Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose slip-up against Chelsea two weeks ago proved crucial in the title outcome, couldn’t hide his pain at missing out on a first Premier League triumph. ‘I’m devastated,’ he said, after Brendan Rodgers’ team had come from behind to beat Newcastle 2-1 at Anfield and finish second on 84 points. ‘I can’t sugar-coat this. I’m gutted for the fans but we can’t be too down. It was a fantastic season. We need to bounce back and go one better. ‘It’s taken me until I’m 33 to have a proper title race so the experience for these young lads in the squad is going to be vital. There is a lot of ability and we can keep improving. Jubilant: Manchester City fans invade the Etihad turf as the final whistle blows . Rodgers said: ‘My over- riding feeling is pride we have finished the season winning 12 out of 14. The players have shown an incredible consistency and quality. We would prefer to finish top but we’ve finished just behind City. It wasn’t because of the past few games. It’s over 38 games.’ Pellegrini becomes the first coach from outside Europe to win the Premier League title. His team set a record of 156 goals in all competitions, even though they fell one short of Chelsea’s best of 103 Premier League goals. ‘If I am the first one (non-European) to win it, that is a reason to be proud but I don’t think I’m the most important person,’ he said. ‘Maybe if we didn’t win the title it would be a very good reason to say it was my first season, but I did not want to give an excuse. We won with 102 goals, with the record of goals in all competitions and it is the way the team must play with our quality.’ Delight: Samir Nasri opened the scoring with a well hit shot past West Ham goalkeeper Adrian . City players celebrated by throwing Pellegrini in the air after lifting the trophy. Captain Vincent Kompany, who claimed City’s second goal after Samir Nasri had calmly opened the scoring, said: ‘Forget about the money and everything. As a kid, you dream of lifting trophies, and I’m living that dream. ‘Next year we need to be even better. If you want to be a big club this must be one of so many.’ Improvement: City skipper Vincent Kompany said his team need to be even better next year . In contrast, West Ham boss Sam Allardyce contemplated an uncertain future. ‘It’s not a very secure industry to be in but it’s one we all love,’ said Allardyce. ‘We are established in the Premier League for the second season on the trot, exactly where I was asked to get us.’","Manuel Pellegrini has vowed to start building on Manchester City's title win .

"Arsenal might want to spend a little time with their noses buried in Nigel Pearson's book of on-field wrestling holds. They had Leicester by the throat on Tuesday night thanks to goals from Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott, but somehow relaxed their grip and turned what seemed like a procession into a nail-biter. Pearson would never make an elementary mistake like that as James McArthur can testify. Leicester replied through Andrej Kramaric, with his first goal since signing last month, and produced the aggression and spirit which will make their manager proud, and offer some hope for the relegation scrap ahead. Theo Walcott celebrates his first and Arsenal's second goal at the Emirates against Leicester on Tuesday night .

See our Match Zone for the calamitous lead-up to Leicester's goal and more great stats . They pushed for the equaliser, Kramaric missed a wonderful late chance and they probably deserved to take a point, but they left with none and remain rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League. Arsenal moved almost apologetically into the top four, for at a day at least, responding to defeat in the North London derby as Tottenham dropped points at Liverpool, but this made for uneasy viewing at times for Arsene Wenger. It was a seventh win in eight games since New Year's Day but not the first time this season his team has panicked at the first sign of trouble. They surrendered the lead at Spurs, not to mention Anderlecht and Liverpool. In fact, it has happened a little too often for a side with pretentions of challenging for major honours; a character flaw which remains despite the impressive win at Manchester City last month. There were added concerns with injuries to Alexis Sanchez, who returned after a hamstring injury but hurt his knee and was under-par until replaced, and Aaron Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign.

'I cannot say it is not a worry,' said Wenger; a double negative within the overall positive of clinging onto the lead. 'It is not good news.' Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as the manager claimed. On a night when Hull and QPR won, there was some encouragement for Pearson and his chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who is thought to have sacked the manager on Sunday before a change of heart. The manager said he had lunch with the owners but didn't offer to pay and sat just behind the Thai owner in the first-half before moving down to the touchline for the second-half revival. Pearson said he had spoken to McArthur on the eve of the game and apologised after a text message from the Crystal Palace midfielder and received a warm post-match handshake and words of support from Wenger.

'I am surprised they are bottom of league and they want to get rid of their manager,' said the Arsenal boss. 'If they keep quiet, don't panic and stick together, they will get out of that. They are one of better teams we've played.' Leicester's performance will have offered great satisfaction - certainly more appealing than the Canadian folk band he endured on Sunday as speculation raged about his future at the club. Playing well and losing is not a good habit to be in but the players are working hard for him, none more than Riyad Mahrez, who was outstanding on the right wing and gave the Arsenal problems all game with his energy and direct style. Mahrez opened with a dangerous low cross, almost deflected into his own net by Koscielny, and an effort which clipped David Ospina on the knee and flashed wide.

Pearson had tweaked his usual system to deploy wing-backs and three central defenders, including debuts for Robert Huth, signed on transfer deadline day, and Matthew Upson, signed last summer but absent until now with ankle problems. Unfortunately for Upson, he did not last the game and came soon after the break, although the manager claimed it was 'precautionary'. Wenger's team, however, were soon in control. Mark Schwarzer stood up to block with his chest from Walcott and Mesut Ozil danced through a crowded penalty box before forcing another save. Schwarzer tipped Ozil's effort wide and from the corner, taken by the German, Arsenal went ahead. Koscielny caught Wes Morgan napping and met the low, in-swinging set-piece on the half-volley, sweeping it inside the post from six yards. Before the break, Schwarzer was unable to hold a fierce drive by Ozil and parried the ball towards Walcott on the right, who adjusted superbly well to the rebound, arriving at pace to thump a first-time drive into the far corner.

Although not always in the thick of the action, he has made telling contributions in front of goal and his creative juices were flowing again. Arsenal looked capable of matching the five they put past Aston Villa in their previous home game but were forced back and wobbled under this pressure. Kramaric pulled one back as the home side claimed Esteban Cambiasso had handled as the ball was trapped under his body in a scramble following a corner they failed to clear, but no free-kick was given and the goal was fired through a crowd by the £9million Croatian, signed in January. Anxiety washed around the stadium and Wenger sent on substitutes and Pearson sent on the strikers he had left on the bench. Mahrez went close again and Kramaric was clean through and attempted to chip Ospina. It was an ambitious move – a bad decision - and he did not clear the goalkeeper. Pearson and his staff threw up their arms in collective dismay. It would be their last chance of the night.

"Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo! known for being one of Silicon Valley’s most stylish ladies, posed for the blockbuster September issue of Vogue magazine. It was the first extensive interview Mayer has given since her much ballyhooed—and highly paid—position at the tech giant in July 2012. And while the ‘unusually stylish geek,’ as the magazine describes her, says she struggles with her own shyness, Mayer wasn’t holding back when she posed for a stunning two-page photo for the article. Playing coy? Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer sat for a lengthy interview in Vogue in which she insists she's just a shy girl who loves to work . The former Google executive and spokesperson told Vogue the new job, for which she was paid a reported $6 million in her first year alone, is worth it for more than just the massive pay day. ‘I’m having the time of my life,’ she said. And investors are right there with her. Stock in the company, seen as a sort of has been in the tech world, has soared since she became its leader. Mayer has been a hot topic since she began at Yahoo!, and because of her work as CEO—notably, her acquisition of firms like Tumblr—she’s remained at the heart of the media’s tech talk. Beautiful couple: Mayer and her husband Zachary Bogue who says his wife 'she's not as shy as she thinks she is,' though Mayer refers to her habit of leaving parties unannounced as the 'CEO exit' Torn: The always stylish CEO insists 'I'm just geeky and shy and I like to code' more than attending lavish events . Lucky boy: Mayer and son Macallister, now nearly a year old, on their way to Yahoo's 2012 Halloween celebration, Yaboo! Mayer bought a 14-foot replica of a local diner for him to play in . But Mayer doesn’t consider herself the celebrity or the partying type. ‘I’m just geeky and shy and I like to code,’ said the fashionable millionaire. The . article’s author Jacob Weisberg, who calls Mayer a 'geek’s geek,' concurred. ‘She was animated and excited about technical issues,’ he . told USA Today. Mayer's playful side shines through in the article in addition to her wonkiness. She . and her husband purchased at auction a 15-foot model of a colorful . local diner as a playhouse for their not quite 1-year-old son . Macallister. It will be a while before he's old enough to play with structure, which they had lowered into their yard with a forklift. But that's okay for Mayer. 'Mayer seems to have bought it just as much for herself,' wrote Weisberg. Mayer also has 'happy art,' as she calls it--from the likes of such stars of the creative world as Jeff Koons and Roy Lichtenstein--throughout her home. And the walls of her dining room are lined with purple and gold signs that originally adorned tables at her wedding. They name some of her favorite things and range from the flavor 'peppermint,' to the paisley-loving Italian design house 'Etro.' But quirky isn’t the entire story, if judging just by her photo shoot. Thrifty: She's worth an estimated $300 million but according to Vogue she drives to and from work in an 18-year-old BMW . The self-proclaimed shy girl, known for her dazzling entrances and unannounced exits at Silicon Valley’s ritziest gatherings comes off as more than comfortable in the 3,000 word interview. In fashion: Marissa's extensive print interview appears in the massive September issue of Vogue . And the same could be said for the accompanying photo for which she’s donned a form-fitting Michael Kors dress and daring Ives Saint Laurent heels. ‘I think she’s not as shy as she thinks she is,’ revealed Mayer’s investor husband Zachary Bogue. Still, some signs do suggest that one of America’s most talked about CEOs shuns glamor as much as she says. Though worth an estimated $300 million, Mayer shuttles herself to work in an eighteen year old BMW. And work, more than galas or photo shoots, appears to be where she is most comfortable. ‘One . night I looked up and was like, “Oh, my God, it's midnight and I have a . husband and I'm, like, eight months pregnant. I need to leave!,”’ joked . the new mom. ‘I was just here working, having the best possible time.’ The article, titled Hail to the Chief, is in the September issue of Vogue and hits national news stands August 20.",Silicon Valley's biggest style icon insists she's more concerned with her work than with the glamor .
"A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis. The woman, known by the pseudonym Rehana, was celebrated as a symbol of hope for the embattled Syrian border town after a journalist tweeted a picture of her making a 'V-sign', claiming that she'd personally killed 100 Isis militants. The message was retweeted over 5,000 times, but there are now claims Rehana, who fought for the Kurdish YPJ, or Women's Defense Unit, may have been killed after gruesome pictures began circulating on Twitter of an Isis fighter purportedly holding aloft her head. Scroll down for video . A female Kurdish fighter who became a poster girl for the Kobane resistance movement after a picture of her making a peace sign was retweeted thousands of times on Twitter has reportedly been beheaded by Isis . Her death - reported on several sites including 9News.com - however, is unconfirmed and at the time of writing the YPG (People's Defense Unit) and YPJ have yet to respond to MailOnline's request for a comment. Perched on the other side of the Turkish border, the Syrian town of Kobane has been under an intense assault by Isis, or the so-called Islamic State, for more than a month. The town - surrounded on the east, south and west by Isis - is being defended by Kurdish forces in Syria. Among those fighters are thousands of women, an unusual phenomenon in the Muslim world in which warfare is often associated with manhood. In April, Kurdish fighters created all-female combat units that have grown to include more than 10,000 women. Isis launched a ferocious assault on Kobane in mid-September. Picture is an explosion from an allied air-strike on Sunday . Brave: Thousands of Kurdish women are fighting Isis in Syria . These female fighters have played a major role in battles against IS, said Nasser Haj Mansour, a defense official in Syria's Kurdish region. The Kurdish women now find themselves battling militants preaching an extreme form of Islam dictating that women only leave the house if absolutely necessary. One Kurdish female fighter, who uses the nom de guerre of Afshin Kobani, used to be a teacher. Now, the Kurdish Syrian woman has traded the classroom for the front lines in the battle for the town. A Kurdish Peshmerga female fighter takes up a position during combat skills training before being deployed to fight Isis militants . The 28-year-old Kurdish fighter said she decided to join the fight in her hometown when she saw Isis advances in Syria. 'I lost many friends to this, and I decided there was a need to join up,' said Kobani, who declined to reveal her birth name. 'This is our land - our own - and if we don't do it, who else will?' After more than a year of fighting, Kobani has risen through the ranks to become a commander of a mixed-gender unit. 'We are just the same as men; there's no difference,' she said. 'We can do any type of job, including armed mobilization.' There is nothing new about Kurdish women fighters. They have fought alongside men for years in a guerrilla war against Turkey, seeking an independent Kurdistan which would encompass parts of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran. Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women . The campaign for Kurdish independence has been pursued mainly by leftist militant groups that championed gender equality, such as the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey. Suicide bombings have long been part of the Kurdish women fighters' battleground repertory. Early this month, Deilar Kanj Khamis, better known by her military name Arin Mirkan, blew herself up outside Kobani, killing 10 IS fighters, according to Kurdish forces. Haj Mansour, the Kurdish defense official, recounted that Kurdish fighters were forced to withdraw from a strategic hill south of the besieged town. Khamis stayed behind, attacking IS fighters with gunfire and grenades as they moved in. Surrounded, she detonated explosives strapped to her body. The Kurds then recaptured the position - but lost it again on Wednesday. Earlier this month the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors events in Syria, reported Isis militants beheaded nine Kurdish fighters, including three women, captured in clashes near Turkish border.","Female Kurdish fighter whose picture became a web hit 'killed by Isis'

"Britain has been sucked into a second credit crunch that threatens the stability of the world’s banking system, Downing Street warned last night. Central banks from around the world – including the Bank of England and China’s equivalent – yesterday launched a dramatic rescue bid worth hundreds of billions of dollars. It was agreed to head off a repeat of the 2008 crash when banks simply stopped lending to each other, bringing the world economy to a halt. President of the European Parliamtn Jerzy Buzek (left), European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (centre) and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy (right) address a news conference in Brussels yesterday . The Bank of England has joined in the dramatic rescue bid to help prevent a repeat of 2008, when major banks simply stopped lending to each other . The operation, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, came amid fears that at least one major European bank . may be teetering on the brink of collapse and that the eurozone . countries could not be trusted to act swiftly enough to solve their . problems. Bank of England sources said last night the money being made available . to struggling banks under the new facility was ‘unlimited’. But a . similar scheme during the last credit crunch peaked at $583billion . (£365billion) in late 2008. ICAP, the world's top broker for foreign exchange and government bonds, said on Monday that it has tested its trading system to handle the collapse of the eurozone and re-emergence of national currencies. Meanwhile, a senior banker at a large investment bank said he had a team of 20 people globally running all kinds of scenarios all the time. That team was now spending a lot of its time on the possible break-up of the euro. They had simulated a weekend crisis by running through the different stages of Friday night, Saturday and Sunday in one full working day. They had even looked whether they would have enough people available and made sure they knew where to reach them. 'It's my job to assume the worst. You can test all kinds of benign scenarios, but if something really bad - let's say a sudden overnight default of Italy - were to happen and we hadn't tested that, I wouldn't be doing my job properly. If that latter scenario were to occur, things would look very ugly indeed. 'There simply wouldn't be enough time to sort out all the various trading positions and look at all the paperwork,' the banker said. Stock markets around the world rallied in response to the ‘pre-emptive . strike’, with the FTSE 100 index closing up more than three per cent. However, the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its . ratings on 15 global banks – including Barclays and HSBC – by one notch . yesterday. Last night John Higgins, . of the Capital Economics research consultancy, . said the central banks’ intervention would provide temporary relief for . Europe, but warned that it was ‘not a game changer’. He added: ‘Welcome . as the news was, we do not think it signals a turning point in the . crisis.’ The move was strikingly similar to action taken in the wake of the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which sparked a global recession. In a bleak assessment, Number 10 said: ‘We are experiencing a credit crunch.’ World leaders are terrified that if banks stop lending to each other the supply of mortgages and loans to all businesses could dry up overnight, wrecking the already fragile economic recovery. In Brussels, one of the EU’s most senior officials warned there were now just ten days left to save the euro from collapse. And Chancellor George Osborne said the survival of the euro was essential if Britain was to avoid another recession next year. European banks have already been frozen out of credit markets because of uncertainty about the survival of the euro. The new deal agreed yesterday will give them ‘unlimited’ access to cheaper dollars. Next week EU leaders, including David Cameron, will gather for last-ditch talks to find a solution to the euro crisis, amid growing fears the single currency could collapse before Christmas. One government minister suggested last night Britain was prepared to wave through EU treaty changes if they were needed to underpin a rescue package for the euro. Government sources insisted the financial crisis ‘is not Lehman’s yet’. But Mr Osborne, who attended crisis talks in Brussels yesterday, admitted the Government’s already dire economic predictions would be ‘very much worse’ if the eurozone ‘went belly-up’. He said: ‘In a way, what’s happening in . the eurozone is a reminder to Britain that if you don’t face up to your . problems you have very much worse problems. Britain has taken decisive . action. We now need the eurozone to do the same.’ The Chancellor repeated his warning . that Britain would find it ‘difficult to avoid a recession’ next year if . Europe is dragged into a fresh downturn because of the crisis in the . single currency. Forecasts by the independent Office . for Budget Responsibility predict growth of just 0.7 per cent next year – . along with six more years of spending cuts – even if the euro crisis is . resolved. Mr Osborne suggested trade links between Britain and the EU . meant the break-up of the euro would have a massive impact on the UK. ‘That’s where Britain makes a lot of its money, so we are very affected by what happens in the eurozone,’ he said. Italy's Prime Minister and Finance Minister Mario Monti (left) talks with Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels . Teetering: The break-up of the euro is looking increasingly likely . Last night it also emerged that the . Financial Services Authority has ordered Britain’s banks to step up . contingency plans for a ‘disorderly break-up of the euro’. Angela Merkel, pictured arriving at a cabinet meeting in Berlin yesterday, has reiterated her support for changes to European treaties . The watchdog confirmed that its chief . executive, Hector Sants, held talks with the bosses of all the major . banks, including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of . Scotland and Santander, about how they would cope with the exit of one . or more countries from the single currency. City sources said big insurance . companies were also urged to prepare for the exit of one or more . countries from the eurozone. It also emerged that Mr Osborne has held . talks on contingency plans for the collapse of the euro with Bank of . England governor Sir Mervyn King and FSA chairman Adair Turner in recent . weeks. A source at the FSA, denying there . was a sense of panic, said: ‘It would be more worrying if we were not . drawing up contingency plans.’ EU finance ministers gathering in . Brussels yesterday agreed to hand over the  latest instalment of bailout . money to Greece, which will enable it to limp into the New Year. But they were no closer to agreeing a long-term deal to save the single currency. The EU’s monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, said: ‘We are now entering the critical period of ten days to complete and conclude the crisis response of the European Union.’ He suggested the eurozone might need further assistance from the International Monetary Fund. EU leaders will gather in Brussels at the end of next week for a two-day summit that will be dominated by the euro crisis. Employment minister Chris Grayling suggested yesterday that Britain was ready to agree EU treaty changes if they were needed for a rescue deal. Germany and France are pressing for treaty changes so stricter budget controls can be imposed on the 17 eurozone countries. Mr Grayling said: ‘There needs to be rapid progress towards dealing with the eurozone problems. 'If treaty change is the means to that end, then we would recognise that as a necessity.’ Europe is facing an ‘existential crisis’ that could end in violent revolution and war, the French foreign minister warned last night. In the bleakest assessment yet of the euro crisis, Alain Juppe, a former French prime minister, said the spiralling debt crisis could trigger ‘the explosion of the European Union itself’. Mr Juppe told the French news magazine L’Express that the deepening crisis was creating a dangerous breeding ground for violent nationalism, reminiscent of the 1930s. He said: ‘This is an existential crisis for Europe that raises the spectre of a return to violent conflict on our continent. ‘This could call into question all that we have created, not only in the 20 years since the Maastricht Treaty, but since the foundation of the European community. Warning: French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the crisis could cause revolution and war . ‘In that eventuality, everything becomes possible, even the worst. It could be the explosion of the European Union itself. ‘We have flattered ourselves for decades that we have eradicated the danger of conflict inside our continent, but let’s not be too sure. We’ve gone too far to not go further.’ Mr Juppe’s dire warning came just days after one of France’s leading economists said the single European currency only had a ‘50-50 chance’ of surviving until Christmas. Jacques Attali, the former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said ‘instant and urgent’ action was needed to prevent the euro from collapsing within weeks. Last month the German Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned that failure to resolve the euro crisis was a potential threat to peace and stability in Europe. But despite numerous ‘crisis summits’ in recent months EU leaders have been unable to agree a package that will satisfy the financial markets they are serious about shoring up ailing countries like Greece, Portugal and Italy and saving the euro.","Just ten days left to save euro from collapse, warns senior EU official .

"The waiting game came to an end for Arsenal supporters at Wembley in May. Aaron Ramsey's extra-time goal saw the Gunners lift their first trophy since 2005. Thousands of supporters lined the streets of north London to hail Arsene Wenger's heroes 24 hours later during a triumphant open-top bus parade. There was a feeling of adulation on Upper Street that Sunday as fans celebrated the end of their much-hyped trophy drought, but there was another strong vibe in the air that day. Aaron Ramsey is mobbed by his Arsenal team-mates after scoring the winner against Hull in the FA Cup final . The streets of north London are lined by Arsenal fans as they celebrate their club's FA Cup triumph in 2014 . A sense that this was merely the beginning; the start of a period of dominance from another Wenger-led Arsenal team. But five months later, Gooners are again being asked to be patient. Everything is in place for a prosperous future at the Emirates Stadium. The club's self-sustainable financial structure is starting to have a significant impact in the new world of Financial Fair Play. But speaking ahead of Thursday's Annual General Meeting, chief executive Ivan Gazidis remained cautious. Speaking ahead of Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, Ivan Gazidis said the club are aiming to be held in the same esteem as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich and the rest of Europe's elite . 'Where we are currently is off the shoulder of the world's top teams. I think the best teams in the world are in Europe and you think about the great names in world football like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - I don't think we're at that level yet but that's where we're aiming to get to,' said the Gunners supremo. 'It's one thing to say that and it's another thing to be able to deliver it. It has been incredibly frustrating not being able to be where we want to be these last few years, so winning the FA Cup was a fantastic moment. '(But) I don't come out of that feeling satisfied like we've achieved what we need to achieve. The hunger for success is immediate. The moment you get away from that euphoria of the moment, the next question is, ""How do we have more of that?"" Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez arrived at Arsenal in the summer for a combined fee of £46million . 'That's what everybody at this club is focused on. There's no satisfaction in it - it's what do we do now.' When Gazidis' most recent comments were issued earlier this week, it must have felt like Groundhog Day for some fans; it's a message Arsenal supporters have become accustomed to in recent years. The message that the club are working hard to enter Europe's elite, but still not quite there. Recent big-money signings such as Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck have helped placate some disgruntled fans. But others remain doubtful that their club can replicate Wenger's glory years. Here, Sportsmail takes you on a trip down memory lane, looking at some of Gazidis' previous soundbites - and how they all have a similar theme: patience. Mesut Ozil joined the Gunners for a club record fee in the summer of 2013, but has failed to hit his top form . On the day Arsenal were due to meet Birmingham in the League Cup final - which they lost - Gazidis spoke of the sacrifices the club were making to ensure Arsenal's future success. FEBRUARY 2011: 'Some of the decisions we need to make looking forward will impact the manager adversely in the short term, but 10, 15 even 20 years from now, the decisions will make sure this club moves forward. 'Winning is important, but it's not the end objective of everything, the end objective is the emotional connection our fans have with this club. The end objective is the creation of pride, one of the aspects that creates pride is winning trophies and that's essential for a club our size, but the way we conduct ourselves, the way we play, all these things are important. 'It's right and proper that we are expected to win trophies regularly, and I welcome that pressure, that kind of pressure is good.' Arsenal were beaten by Birmingham in the 2011 League Cup final after Obafemi Martins scored the winner . In the aftermath of Arsenal's infamous 8-2 loss at Manchester United, Gazidis insisted the club would emerge stronger after a difficult few months which saw Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy quit the club. The belief that better days were ahead was a key theme. SEPTEMBER 2011: 'We are going through a difficult period like all clubs do, it's a cycle and we will work our way out of it. We understand some of the emotions the fans have been through, we understand the expectations are high and we share those expectations, that's where we are in the game - other clubs would be delighted to be in our overall position. 'We are in a healthy and strong position, we've had 14 years of success in the Champions League. When I came in two-and-a-half years ago I was told we were falling behind Aston Villa and Everton. The reality is we are in a strong position to look forward with confidence and standing on our own two feet, with a strong sustainable model built around youth development; we've got strong youth players coming through - not just Jack Wilshere. Arsene Wenger can't bring himself to watch the game as Arsenal are humiliated by Manchester United . The Old Trafford outfit ran out 8-2 winners against Arsenal. It was one of the club's worst-ever defeats . 'Our transfer strategy remains developing young players and turning them into star players, but we have sprinkled that with experienced players. It'll take a bit of time for those players to settle but we'll have a strong squad. You can't replace a Fabregas, one of the best players in the world and there's not an unlimited number of those. 'We are focused to continue to move forward as a club. If we spent every single penny we had in every transfer window, we would end up making some bad decisions.' Ahead of the 2012 season, Gazidis again spoke about the club's ability to compete with Europe's elite clubs… in the future, of course. JUNE 2012: 'We want to win major competitions. We want to win the Premier League. We want to compete to win the Champions League. That is our ambition. 'My message to our fans is that we are doing everything in our power to make sure that Arsenal can challenge for trophies next year. That is what this summer is about and that is what we are focused on for next year. 'We have a good team, we have a good young core of players and we need everybody involved to have belief so that we can push forward into next year and make a run at the Premier League trophy and for the Champions League. We believe we can do that.' Gazidis has spoken about Arsenal's ability to compete with some of Europe's best clubs, albeit in the future . And there was more of the same from Gazidis five months later. NOVEMBER 2012: 'As we look to the next two, three years we will have an outstanding platform on which to compete with any club in the world. Now we are in that stadium, the first part of our vision has been realised. Now we are at the stage where some of the commercial deals that were tied into the construction of the stadium, and enabled us to take that first big step, will be renegotiated. When that happens, we will take the second big step forward and that will be comparable in magnitude to moving to the stadium itself. 'At times it's been a challenging project, but we will have catapulted ourselves into the elite clubs on the European scale and that, for us, has been what the last 10 years has been about. 'Very clearly, it will push the club forward and put us into the top five clubs in the world in revenue terms, which will be a fantastic position to be in.' The Arsenal board addresses its audience at the 2011 Annual General Meeting at the Emirates Stadium . Still without a trophy, Gazidis returned with a familiar message at the end of the 2012/13 season. JUNE 2013: 'So obviously we have come to the end of the season and in the end we finished with 73 points and in fourth place which I would say was necessary for us. We want to be competing at the top of the game and in order to do that you have to be in the Champions League. So we are pleased to have qualified, or at least, for the qualification games. 'But it is not ultimately where we want to be with moving the club forward. We want to be a club that is competing at the very top end of the game and that means competing to win the Premier League and competing to win the Champions League. On that basis, we are not where we want to be yet. 'I think its not idle ambition when we talk about wanting to get there. I think we have a very solid plan that will give us the ability to be able to compete at that level provided we do things well. The critical thing now as we look ahead over the next season and the season after is our developing financial capability which will give us a lot more options than in recent years.' We wait with baited breath to see what Gazidis plans to say at Thursday's AGM. More of the same, perhaps?

"The World Cup is just 29 days away and excitement is building. Each week our man in Brazil, Joe Callaghan, brings us the latest news and views from South America - as well as traveller tips for those heading out there - and provides a flavour of exactly how the World Cup in Brazil is shaping up. If Zico's so worried, shouldn't England be a little bit concerned too? With all the focus on the World Cup opener against top seeds Italy in the Amazon a month from today, Uruguay are in danger of flying a little under Roy Hodgson's radar. Not Zico's though. We told you last week how the greatest never to win a World Cup insisted the one team he didn't want Brazil to meet in the knock-out stages was none other than England's second opponents next month. 'I would prefer to meet Argentina in the final. Not Uruguay,' he said. 'I think Uruguay could be the only team who could psychologically shake the Brazilian team.' VIDEO Scroll down to view inside the Arena Amazonia stadium and see England's training camp . Dangerous: Luis Suarez is expected to cause England problems in the Group D World Cup match in Brazil . Geographically, Uruguay sits beneath Brazil and citizens here like to think of their neighbours that way. But in the Brazilian sporting lexicon Uruguay is a dirty word. It might come as a surprise to some that no matter what way the tournament progresses, the hosts cannot play at the Maracana until the final. Wouldn't the sacred, spiritual home have been a helpful, inspirational staging point come the last 16 or quarter-finals? Not in a World Cup it wouldn't. The place is the graveyard of World Cup dreams here and the Maracanazo, when Brazil needing only a draw to win the 1950 cup on home soil imploded and handed glory to their noisy neighbours, still send shivers down spines in Rio de Janeiro. Hodgson might just have felt a slight chill over the past 48 hours too when he saw the 25-man squad assembled by his counterpart Oscar Tabarez. High on talent, high on tenure, high on terrifying attackers, it's a big tournament calibre squad from a country that just loves big tournaments. Fearful: Brazil legend Zico believes that Uruguay are the team best equipped to cause the hosts problems . Winners of two of the four previous World Cups to be played in their home continent, Uruguay have also been losing semi-finalists another three times. All in all, not too shabby a record for a country with an almost identical population to Wales. Hodgson's embraced the movement for change and called upon his young lions, but experience counts too. Uruguay have just three players with 10 caps or less in their panel and could have just one by the time the final squad cut is made. England on the other hand, will bring nine such inexperienced men to Brazil. Of course there are question marks, no country is immune from those. A lot of those centre on the skipper Diego Lugano, who endured a horror campaign in the Premier League with West Brom. But he has always been a different beast with the national team's armband strapped on. And around him, Benfica's Maxi Perreira, Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin and Martin Caceres of Juventus could join camp with league winners medals from three different countries. Goal getter: Uruguay's Edinson Cavani has proven himself to be a reliable frontman at the top level . Midfield is full of competition with three insiders based here in Brazil - Nicolas Lodeiro, Sebastien Eguren and Alvaro Pareira - joining Atletico's Cristian Rodriguez and a host of other European-based veterans and a couple of younger faces, among them Southampton's Gaston Ramirez. It is up front though where the chills really begin to kick in. The triumvirate of Luis Suarez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Forlan might not match Argentina's trio of Messi, Higuain and Aguero as the tournament's most ferocious front three. But they're a close runner-up. Between them they have scored 94 international goals. England's entire 23-man squad have scored just 15 more. For now, all roads may lead to Manaus but the trajectory will quickly shift to Sao Paulo and what will be the defining match of England's campaign. Uruguay may have been the last team to book their ticket to Brazil but it would be foolish to expect them to be the first going home. Even if it would make the hosts breathe a whole lot easier. Lots to think about: England's players face two tough group games against Italy and Uruguay in Brazil . The countdown clock has hit the 20s and still Brazil scrambles to welcome the world. Incredible though it may seem four weeks out from the kick-off, but three stadiums still remain unfinished. The venue for the opening ceremony will mercifully host its first proper match this weekend when Corinthians make their debut in their new home. Because they simply have to be, all arenas will be completed. But a report in yesterday's Sao Paulo newspaper Folha, laid bare just how little else will be ready. Of the public transport upgrades and projects promised when Brazil won the staging rights, an eye-wateringly low 10 per cent have been delivered. Fortaleza's airport might just be the most prime of all examples. The city which had the first stadium over the line, inexplicably none of the other 11 projects promised in Fortaleza are finished. And instead of a shiny new terminal to welcome the hundreds of thousands of fans pitching up for a whopping six games in the city, visitors will instead be herded through a temporary canvas structure. If you're thinking something along the lines of the opening credits of M.A.S.H. you're not alone. It's unlikely to be nearly as funny though. It's a crying shame. Way behind schedule: Construction workers frantically try to finish off the Arena de Sao Paulo Stadium on time . Not only did he welcome new plus one Gabriella Lenzi to Barcelona this week for a flying visit during which she hit the town with the WAGs but he might just feature in this weekend's title decider against Atletico Madrid. Expected not to play a competitive game again until the World Cup after picking up a foot injury last month, Brazil's talisman is ahead of schedule. 'I am in the home straight in terms of recovery and I’ll see if I am able to play (against Atletico),' he confirmed on Monday. And the nation breathes a sigh of relief. Introductions: Neymar's girlfriend Gabriella Lenzi joined the Brazil superstar briefly in Barcelona . The Brazilian championship is a full four rounds old. But that's more than enough time for the most trigger-happy league in the world to start catching up with the Premier League in the sack race. This Fred goal from a couple of inches out helped Fluminense to a 2-0 victory over arch rivals Flamengo in the Rio derby on Sunday. It led to Flamengo sacking Jayme de Almeida, who in the process became the sixth manager shown the door in the top tier already this season. Sixth...in less than a month. Makes England's top flight look like a pleasant place to work . Remember me? Diego Cavalieri (Fluminese and Brazil) The rejection felt by Liverpool duo Philippe Coutinho and Lucas last week as Big Phil ignored the merits of both when picking his final squad was also shared by a former Red. Diego Cavalieri once cost Liverpool £3million when he joined from Palmeiras in 2008. But after just two seasons at Anfield during which he never once featured in the league, in spite of a couple of impressive cup cameos, he was allowed to leave by Roy Hodgson. Back home with Fluminense he rediscovered his form and was part of the Confederations Cup-winning Brazil panel last summer. But he was the odd man out last week as Julio Cesar, Jefferson and Victor were picked for World Cup duty. That's kind of in keeping with how things have been going for everyone linked with Liverpool of late. Old face: Diego Cavalieri, formerly of Liverpool, narrowly missed out on the Brazil squad after a run of good form . Scurge: Mosquitos will be feasting on the many World Cup visitors . Travellers tip: Bring the bug spray . Not brave enough to venture up to Manaus? Then you don't have to worry about tropical diseases, right? Wrong. Dengue fever is alive and really kicking throughout Brazil, even in urban centres with 1.4million cases last year. Speaking from painful experience, native mosquitoes take a particular shine to pasty European skin. So pack the strongest bug spray lawmakers will let you bring on a plane.

"Britain's most famous models may soon be out of a job as a group of mini lookalikes have been giving them a run for their money by recreating their most iconic shoots. Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Twiggy look spritely thanks to a new campaign celebrating the launch of  The Withings Activité Pop watch. Delevingne and Moss's doppelgangers Harley Chapman, 10 and Maya Koski-Wood 12, both capture the essence of model predecessors from their 2014 black and white Mario Testino imagery for the My Burberry perfume campaign. Scroll down for video . Harley Chapman, 10 and Maya Koski-Wood 12 have helped to recreate Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss' iconic My Burberry campaign imagery as part of a series of photos recreating iconic fashion photography . Twiggy's influential 1962 black and white image of her legs crossed has also been recreated by 10-year-old model Edie Barfoot-Eva  to commemorate fashion throughout the ages. The image features Twiggy's cropped-like hairstyle and heavy eye make-up to emulate the style of the era. All the images have been reinvented with a 'fashion-meets-technology' twist - the shots feature the new generation of models as well as the Activité Pop, an analogue watch with a sophisticated activity and sleep tracker inside. The images were comissioned by Withings who wanted showcase the future of fashion . The two young girls have recreated the steamy campaign that Moss and Delevingne starred in shot by Italian Photographer Mario Testino last year . Harley Chapman who reenacts Cara Delevingne said that posing as the heavy browed model had been a great experience. 'It has been so much fun recreating such famous shots by one of the world's top models. Despite the fact she has already racked up several campaigns for Massimo Dutti, Primark, Clarks and Tammy Girl Harley added that she hopes to expand her modelling career even further. Maya Koski-Wood is styled in a lookalike Burberry mac for the watch campaign imagery . Harley Chapman says that she has been told she looks like the spitting image of Cara Delevingne .

"Britain is drawing up emergency plans for the collapse of the ‘creaking’ Eurozone amid warnings debt-stricken Italy will need a £500 billion bailout involving billions of pounds of UK taxpayers’ money. Chancellor George Osborne said the Treasury had ‘stepped up’ contingency planning and aimed to be ready for ‘whatever the Eurozone throws at us’. It emerged yesterday that the International Monetary Fund, in which Britain is a major shareholder, could be forced to offer Italy a €600 billion (£514bn) rescue package to give its unelected new prime minister Mario Monti 12 to 18 months’ breathing room to implement big tax rises and spending cuts. Chancellor George Osborne, left,  has ‘stepped up’ contingency planning while unelected Italian prime minister Mario Monti, right, could be given breathing room to implement big tax rises and spending cuts . And in another move, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy were revealed to be plotting a new pact on economic union without consulting Britain or other countries outside of the EU. They are determined not to give Britain the chance of insisting on powers being handed back from Brussels by negotiating a major new EU treaty. Germany's original plan was to try to secure agreement among all 27 EU countries for a limited change to the Lisbon Treaty by the end of 2012, making it possible to impose much tighter budget controls over the 17-member Eurozone. Countries will be forced to submit their budgets for EU approval before they go to national parliaments, will have to sign up to strict new rules on the size of debts and deficits and will be sued for any breach in the European Court of Justice. Plot: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, right, are plotting a new pact on economic union without consulting Britain or other countries outside of the EU . The Franco-German plan will effectively mean an end to national sovereignty over budgets for countries remaining in the euro. Source said it had become clear to Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy in recent weeks that it appears impossible to get all 27 EU countries on board for the plan. It could take years to secure the necessary changes, while a rapid loss of market faith in Italy, Spain and even France suggests urgent measures are required within weeks. EU sources said French and German civil servants have been exploring other ways of achieving the goal, either via an agreement among just the Eurozone countries. Alternatively, they could strike a separate agreement outside the EU treaty that could involve a core of around just eight to ten Eurozone countries, officials say. The move will infuriate British Eurosceptics, who have been urging David Cameron to insist on a repatriation of powers for the UK from Brussels in exchange for agreeing to let the Eurozone countries move towards fiscal and political union. In a sign of the deepening turmoil in the Eurozone, IMF officials were quoted by the Italian newspaper La Stampa as saying a bailout would be needed to give the country a window of 12 to 18 months to implement urgent budget cuts and growth-boosting reforms. The IMF would guarantee rates of 4.0 per cent or 5.0 perc ent on the loan -- far better than the borrowing costs on commercial debt markets, where the rate on two-year and five-year Italian government bonds has risen above 7.0 per cent. The size of the loan would make it difficult for the IMF to use its current resources so different options are being explored, including possible joint action with the European Central Bank in which the IMF would act as  guarantor. As a major shareholder in the IMF, billions of pounds of British cash would be put on the line under any deal, though it is not clear how much. Italy’s vast £1.6 trillion national debt and its low growth rate have caused deepening alarm on the international markets in recent weeks, and even a Brussels-inspired ‘coup’ which saw Silvio Berlusconi removed and a government without a single elected politician in it installed failed to stop the rot. Mr Osborne confirmed yesterday that Britain is preparing for a break-up of the Eurozone that would have cataclysmic effects for the British economy. ‘Well, of course countries like Germany and France have now openly asked the question whether countries like Greece can stay in the Euro. It is a very, very difficult and dangerous situation,’ the Chancellor said. ‘It is having a hugely chilling effect on the British economy at the moment. We have contingency plans for all situations. We have obviously stepped up that contingency planning in recent months. You would expect us to do that as the British government. But that doesn’t mean we are predicting any particular outcome. ‘We’re just ready for whatever the world, whatever the Eurozone throws at us. Adisorderly collapse of the Eurozone would have a massive impact on the UK. I mean, for example, one in seven pounds we export goes to Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece - just those countries. ‘So in other words, it’s a very important part of our economic strategy that we get the Eurozone moving as well.’",Rescue package to give Mario Monti 12 to 18 months' breathing room to implement spending cuts .
"When Roberto Di Matteo named his team at Turin’s luxurious Golden Palace Hotel on Tuesday lunchtime, it was a final act of defiance. Monday morning... Abramovich prepared to wield axe if results don't improve . Tuesday night... Guardiola and Benitez in frame to replace Di Matteo . Fernando Torres paid for his pitiful performance at West Bromwich on Saturday and Di Matteo knew the evening would end in yet another change in personnel. On this occasion, in the office of the Chelsea manager. But Di Matteo sensed the end was coming long before his 42nd and last game in charge. As early as last summer, when he dared question the strength of Torres’ ambition at Chelsea, the European Cup-winning coach was left in no doubt about who is actually in charge at Stamford Bridge. The beginning of a remarkable journey: Roberto Di Matteo clutches Branislav Ivanovic and Fernando Torres after seeing off the challenge of Napoli in last year's Champions League . He told you so: How Neil Ashton broke the story in Wednesday's Sportsmail . When he was finally appointed ‘manager and first-team coach’, 25 days after landing club football’s greatest prize in Munich’s Allianz Arena, Di Matteo presented Roman Abramovich with a list of summer transfer targets. Radamel Falcao, the free-scoring striker with 36 goals in 50 appearances for Atletico Madrid in his first season in Spain, was at the top of it. But before Chelsea’s manager could even make a case for the Colombian striker he was cut short. Abramovich told him he already had a world-class finisher and the message was clear: Torres was to play. It was a message that was repeated on an almost daily basis. That was life at Chelsea for Di Matteo, operating under almost intolerable conditions long before he axed Torres ahead of the shocking 3-0 defeat against Juventus. He knew he had to select Torres. It was the owner’s wish. But he also knew there were problems using Torres when the players Abramovich had brought in did not suit the Spaniard’s style of play. A round peg in a square hole: Torres is said to be unhappy and Chelsea and his attributes do not suit the club's style of play . Di Matteo had run the analysis on Torres, asking the club’s technical team for a breakdown of the 81 goals he scored for Liverpool before his move south to London. When Di Matteo went through the detail, a worrying pattern emerged that convinced him Chelsea did not have the personnel to accommodate his game. Were Chelsea right to sack Roberto Di Matteo? Were Chelsea right to sack Roberto Di Matteo? Now share your opinion . At Anfield, 56 of his goals (69 per cent) were engineered by defence-splitting passes, usually from  Steven Gerrard or Xabi Alonso. At Chelsea, players like Juan Mata, Frank Lampard, Ramires and John Mikel Obi — together with new arrivals Oscar and Eden Hazard – preferred to pass their way through the opposition. They did not spring opposition defences and Di Matteo was already beginning to doubt whether Torres was committed to the Chelsea project. Di Matteo’s relationship with technical director Michael Emenalo was already strained, but it was stretched to the limit by the pressure to get Torres among the goalscorers. Some sympathised, but others were openly questioning the motivation of a striker who was once regarded as the best finisher in world football. Over bar the shouting: Di Matteo patrols the touchline at the Juventus Stadium, aware that his time at Chelsea is up . Upstairs in his office at the club’s Cobham training centre and puffing on cigarettes out on the balcony, Di Matteo frequently discussed Torres’ form with assistants Eddie Newton and Steve Holland. It hardly helped that the £50million striker had confided in team-mates that he was unhappy at the club, even saying as much to a Spanish journalist on the night Chelsea lifted the European Cup. But a new season amounted to a new start for Di Matteo and Abramovich was quick to apply the same approval index rating he uses to judge every manager — Champions League progress. The day after Chelsea drew 2-2 with Juventus in the opening fixture in Group E, when goals from Arturo Vidal and Fabio Quagliarella secured a point for the Italians, Abramovich arrived unannounced at the training ground. He asked Di Matteo, his coaching staff and some of the players if they still had the desire for another crack at the competition after last season’s incredible triumph. By 3am on Wednesday, Di Matteo was clearing the decks of his spacious office after being sacked at the training ground by chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Ron Gourlay, just over an hour after they arrived back from defeat in Turin. The man of the moment: Six months ago, Di Matteo steered Chelsea to their first European Cup . He knew it was coming, saying farewell and shaking hands with the players in the dressing room at the Juventus Stadium. £86m: Chelsea have spent approximately £86million since 2004 in compensation for managers — more than Everton’s entire net spend since the Premier League began. 8 months: The average life span for a manager under Abramovich. Only Mourinho and Ancelotti lasted more than a year. 9: Abramovich has now had as many managers in his nine-year reign as United have had since 1937. 7: Chelsea have sacked seven managers since 2005 and won seven trophies. These were private moments and a significant number of the team apologised to Di Matteo for failing to recreate the spirit that led to FA Cup and European glory last season. Three days earlier, in the dressing room at The Hawthorns, the fingers had been pointed by the players in a post-match inquest following the 2-1 defeat. It sounded explosive. Holland, the assistant manager, had arrived at the ground with a black eye and a cut underneath his left cheek. After the fireworks that followed the final whistle, it is a wonder there were no further casualties. Chelsea’s season was beginning to fall apart and the situation was irretrievable even then. Abramovich had to be talked out of firing Di Matteo on Saturday by his close circle of advisors, but the Champions League clash with Juve was the tipping point. On Sunday the players came in for a warm-down at Cobham and flew on a delayed flight to Turin on Monday after Di Matteo held a short meeting with coaching staff. The impossible job: Di Matteo takes charge of his final Chelsea training session in Turin . In Turin, Chelsea’s players picked up on Di Matteo’s distress and it transmitted to the squad in a subdued and sometimes directionless training session at Juve’s stadium on Monday evening. They knew he was about to make a tactical switch, but the message was muddled and there was uncertainty among the players as they chatted in hushed tones over dinner in the team hotel. In the team meeting at lunchtime on Tuesday, when Di Matteo announced that Hazard would play up front instead of Torres, this was met with the tacit approval of many of the players. On the field they failed spectacularly, however, and Di Matteo, who spent 45 minutes talking to his Italian advisor in the tunnel after the defeat, knew the game was up. As they all got on the airport bus which delivered them to their Titan Airways flight — which finally took off at 1.45am from northern Italy — the atmosphere was tense. By that point Di Matteo and Newton, both in sharp, grey suits, were hanging on for grim life as the bus, with Buck and Gourlay in attendance, made the short trip to the aircraft steps. Ruthless: Roman Abramovich wielded the axe for the seventh time since 2005 . Ashley Cole giggled a couple of times. Petr Cech, a decent guy, made small talk with the kit men. Torres, who was reading a book entitled Leyenda (Legend) on the trip out to Turin, fiddled with his phone. Di Matteo knew that his number was up, unable to motivate a striker who has scored just four goals in the Barclays Premier League this season. Even Torres’ solitary Champions League strike was a fluke, a ricochet that somehow rebounded into the net of Andriy Pyatov in the 3-2 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk on November 7. Undoubtedly Di Matteo under-estimated the owner’s obsession with winning silverware. Abramovich has not forgotten Jose Mourinho gesturing to him at Wembley, counting the trophies with his fingers when Chelsea won the FA Cup in 2007. Chelsea started this season with a chance to win seven trophies, but the champions of Europe had already surrendered the Community Shield against Manchester City and were soundly beaten by Atletico Madrid in the Super Cup in Monaco. Abramovich, who rarely travels to away games because he does not like to conform to stuffy boardroom etiquette by wearing a suit, became increasingly agitated as Di Matteo’s summer target  finished them off with a hat-trick. Falcao was fantastic that night. Golden boot: Radamel Falcao was in sensational form as the Atletico Madrid striker hit a hat-trick in Monaco . Di Matteo’s team were also adjusting to a refined playing system as they encouraged Cech to throw the ball out to his back four instead of launching it forward from his penalty area. Off the field Di Matteo skilfully and diplomatically handled delicate situations, especially after John Terry was banned by the FA for four games and fined £220,000 for racially insulting Anton Ferdinand. The incident did not even happen on Di Matteo’s watch — Andre Villas-Boas was manager at the time — but the Italian attempted to protect the reputation of the club. Even last Sunday, his preparations for the trip to Turin were disrupted when Ashley Cole was unexpectedly called to an interview with the FA over the allegations against referee Mark Clattenburg. Suddenly the FA’s compliance team were swarming all over the training ground again, taking Mikel, Ramires and Juan Mata into neutralised zones for hours of taped interviews. Casting a shadow: Di Matteo felt the race row, involving referee Mark Clattenburg (centre) and John Mikel Obi (right) had an impact on recent results . Di Matteo has deep reservations about Chelsea’s complaint, and, naturally, believes that it has affected their recent results. They made the allegation two hours after they were beaten 3-2 at Stamford Bridge by Manchester United, finishing the game with nine men after the dismissals of Torres and Branislav Ivanovic. Since then they have picked up two points from the last 12 in the Premier League and require something of a miracle to avoid the humiliation of exiting the group stage of the Champions League. That brutal reality dawned on Di Matteo when Chelsea arrived back at the training ground in the dead of night after the Turin trip. Torres was one of the first off the bus, jumping straight into his car and slipping on his tracksuit top to beat the near-freezing temperatures.

"You might hope that every school would want pupils to work their very hardest – and pass any exams with flying colours. But one primary head has decided there is more to life than educational achievements, and has written to her final-year pupils to tell them not to worry about their results. Headmistress Rachel Tomlinson and her head of year six, Amy Birkett, told children that there are ‘many ways of being smart’ in the message, which was included with their Key Stage Two results. They asked the 11-year-old pupils to remember that the scores ‘will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything’. The letter, which was sent by Barrowford Primary School in Nelson, Lancashire, has been widely circulated on Twitter. Some users said it should be ‘the first thing the new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan should read’. Scroll down for video . 'We are very proud of you': The inspirational letter was sent out to all Year Six pupils at Barrowford Primary School in Nelson, Lancashire, along with their Key Stage 2 test results yesterday . But it emerged yesterday that the . school had copied most of the letter from a message sent to pupils at an . unidentified US elementary school – which was posted on the internet . last autumn. This is believed to be the first time the US letter has been used by a school in the UK. And the British version of the text includes a tell-tale Americanism – a mention of a trip to a ‘really neat place’. The letter, which was addressed to . individual pupils, said they had tried their ‘very best during this . tricky week’ and the school was ‘very proud’ of them. It said test . results ‘do not always assess all of what it is that make each of you . special and unique’. The note then went on to list all the other talents the children possess, outside of exam results and academic achievements. Headteacher: Rachel Tomlinson said it was 'lovely' to see so many positive comments about the letter . Praised: Barrowford Primary School (pictured) was last inspected in 2012 and awarded a 'good' rating . A spokeman for the 324-pupil school, . which was rated ‘good’ by Ofsted when it was last inspected in 2012, . wrote on Twitter yesterday: ‘Wow. There are posts all over the world . about this letter! ‘All we did was remind our Y6 how . amazing they are!’ But one Twitter user posted: ‘Delicious irony that a . template letter to kids celebrating uniqueness and individuality has . been ripped off the internet, complete with Americanisms.’ And Chris McGovern, a former . headmaster and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, last night . attacked the school for using the letter as a ‘political platform’ to . give an opinion about the quality of national curriculum tests. He said: ‘They’re undermining confidence that the children may have in the education system. ‘The message they’re sending is that . the examination results are in some way invalidated because there are . other matters at stake. It’s an indirect attack on the Government. The . message that the school is sending to the children is that somehow they . are being betrayed by the system. ‘But they are not being betrayed by the system, it’s actually the teachers who are letting the children down very badly.’ He added: ‘If there’s a fault with the tests, it’s that they’re too easy and they’re undemanding. ‘That’s why the Government is toughening them up. But it’s completely unacceptable to do this. ‘Schools should not be a platform for promoting political ideologies – they should be neutral. Most of the letter, reproduced above, was taken from a message sent to pupils at an unknown US school .

"Arsenal have been rocked by a potential double injury blow as Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey were forced off with injuries during Tuesday's 2-1 win at home to Leicester City. Sanchez started the midweek clash at the Emirates, after returning from a hamstring injury, but hurt his left knee and was under-par until he was replaced on 68 minuted by striker Olivier Giroud. The incident came following a tackle by Leicester defender Matthew Upson, that left the 26-year-old nursing his knee with ice once he was substituted.

Second-half replacement Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign - with Mathieu Flamini taking the 24-year-old's position. 'I cannot say it is not a worry,' said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger post-match; a double negative within the overall positive of clinging onto the lead. 'It is not good news.' After the game, Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as Wenger claimed. 'Sometimes the love for the game and anxiety to be on a football pitch works against you,' he tweeted.

Tuesday's win at home to the Foxes moves Arsenal up into fourth in the Premier League table with 45 points after 24 games.

"Turkey promised to respond 'determinedly' tonight after the Syrian military admitted shooting down a Turkish warplane over the Mediterranean Sea. Two Turkish pilots are still missing after their air force jet was downed by Syrian forces in an act which has escalated tensions between the neighbouring countries. Syria said it shot down the F4 phantom jet because it was flying 'over Syrian territorial waters'. Missing: An F4 Phantom Turkish fighter jet was shot down by Syrian security forces yesterday over 'Syrian territorial waters' Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan today led a two-hour security meeting on the crisis. In a statement issued after the meeting, the government said it 'will determinedly take necessary steps' in response, without saying what they would be. It comes after the Syrian military confirmed it had brought down the plane over the eastern part of the sea, southwest of the Turkish province of Hatay, which borders Syria. 'Our air defences confronted a target . that penetrated our air space over our territorial waters pre-afternoon . on Friday and shot it down,' a statement by the military circulated on state media said. 'It turned out to be a Turkish military . plane.' The incident threatens to worsen relations between the two countries, which have already become strained in recent months. Turkey has joined nations such as the US in saying that Syrian President Bashar Assad should step down because of the uprising in his country. Turkey also has set up refugee camps on its border for more than 32,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting. Erdogan confirmed that the plane went down some eight miles (13km) from the Syrian town of Latakia over the Mediterranean Sea. He said: 'Four of our gunboats and some Syrian gunboats are carrying out a joint search there.' A search and rescue operation was launched and Turkey's government has called an emergency security meeting. The jet had taken off from Erhac . airport in the eastern province of Malatya shortly before all contact . with the aircraft was lost. Turkey's military confirmed it lost contact with the aircraft over the sea close to the border . with Syria. Lebanon's Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar . television station claimed that Syrian security forces were . responsible after a source told the TV channel that Syrian air defences . shot down the Turkish military aircraft. Unclear: Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said there has been no confirmation of what happened to the two pilots . The station reported: 'Syrian . security sources confirmed to a Manar correspondent in Damascus that . Syrian defence forces shot down the Turkish fighter jet.' it's alleged the plane strayed one kilometre into Syrian airspace. Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University, told NTV that Syria's action was clearly 'hostile,' even if it violated its air space. 'They could have either sent their planes to confront it or force it to land, it is a hostile act by any standard,' Turan said. Turan, however, predicted that Syria will try to avoid escalating tensions further . This latest incident could further . threaten relations between the two countries already at bitter odds over . a 16-month-old revolt against Assad. Syria and Turkey have expelled each other's ambassadors and Syria has accused Turkey of supporting Syrian opposition and even allowing Syrian rebels to operate out of Turkish soil. Turkey strongly denies the allegations. After a cross-border shooting by Syrian forces in April, Turkey said it would not tolerate any action that it deemed violating its security. The firing had left two refugees dead at a camp near the town of Kilis just inside Turkey. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Selcuk Unal earlier on Friday rejected allegations that Turkey was sending arms and other equipment to Syrian rebels as baseless. Unal said Turkey was not sending weapons to any of its neighbors, including Syria. Turkey's military provided no details on the downed plane's mission Friday, but some Turkish TV reports said it was on a reconnaissance flight. Violence raged unabated in Syria yesterday, as the nation appears to be sliding toward a sectarian-tinged civil war pitting majority Sunni Muslims against Assad’s minority Alawite sect. Defection: The host of top Syrian army officials have turned up in Turkey . Left: The F4 Phantom jet had taken off from Erhac airport in the eastern province of Malatya shortly before all contact with the aircraft was lost last week (file picture) Four high-placed Syrian military . officials – two brigadier-generals and two colonels who are all brothers . – announced their defection from the army yesterday. The Turkish lira fell sharply . following news of the jet incident and analysts said it would be . vulnerable to further losses as more details of the incident emerged. 'The lira eased after reports saying . the Turkish jet was shot down by Syrian air forces. If this is . confirmed, we can see more of a sell-off in the lira,' said Suha Yaygin, . an emerging markets trader at TD Securities.

"They are the serious-minded protesters who have taken to the streets in outrage at the killings of black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown by the police. But many of the young demonstrators incensed by the perceived injustices are struggling to stay off their cell phones long enough to get their point across.

Closer: The protester leans to one side, holding his cell phone aloft while a man next to him also checks his . In some, a majority of participants at events in highly public places such as New York City's Grand Central Terminal, the White House or busy city intersections, are glued to their touchscreens. The die-ins are designed to raise awareness and express outrage at the cases of Michael Brown, who was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, by officer Darren Wilson in August. In November a grand jury declined to indict the officer, a decision which prompted a tide of outrage from civil rights activists, who made calls for legal reform. Eric Garner, a man killed on Staten Island, New York, by the NYPD, who put him in a choke-hold this summer, has also been incorporated in many of the protests. Playing 'dead': Three students in this corridor at one of Penyslvania State University's campuses didn't get the memo about laying still . Spotted: Two protesters on the ground can be seen bathed in the light of their devices, with the Washington Monument in the background . A grand jury decided Wednesday that no charges would be brought in relation to his death as well. The object of a die-in is to imitate a dead body, usually to raise awareness of people who have been killed.

"A soldier has told a court how he pulled an unconscious woman from a freezing river after seeing her lover and his friend allegedly beat her before rolling her body into the water 'like a log'. Army Captain Mark Gold, 43, was enjoying a Sunday stroll along the River Taff in Cardiff with his family when he saw Leanne Ware, 31, allegedly being drowned in the river. Ms Ware's boyfriend Martin Edwards, 43, and his friend Gary Pincott, 55, both deny attempted murder. Rescue mission: Capt Gold (right) performed CPR on Leanne Ware (left) after pulling her from the water . Accused: Miss Ware's boyfriend Martin Edwards, 43, (pictured) denies charges of attempted murder and assault at Cardiff Crown Court . Capt Gold told Cardiff Crown Court . that he had sprung into action after seeing Edwards and Pincott beat . Miss Ware, before rolling her body into the river. The . soldier from the Army Medical Corps then ran into the water to fight . off the alleged attackers, and performed life-saving CPR on Miss Ware . after hauling her from the river. Giving . evidence in the trial of Edwards and Pincott, Capt Gold said he had . been walking along the river bank with his family when he saw two men . attack Ms Ware. 'My wife and children looked over the railings of the bridge and started hysterically screaming,' he told the court yesterday. 'I looked over and saw two men viciously attacking a lady who was on the floor in the foetal position. 'She was unconscious, she wasn’t trying to defend herself from the kicks and punches, and she wasn't making any noise.' Action: Capt Gold had been walking along the River Taff in Cardiff when he rushed to rescue unconscious Miss Ware from the freezing water . The jury was told that Capt Gold then dragged his children away from the scene and rang 999 on his mobile phone. He said he saw two men pushing Miss Ware into the river - Edwards rolling her with his feet and Pincott pushing with his hands. 'She rolled into the river like a log,' he said. 'She didn’t even try to fight - she just disappeared under the water.' The . father-of-three, who has served as an Army medic for 21 years then ran . down to the river bank to try and save Miss Ware from drowning. 'A man I now know is Pincott ran past me away from the river,' he told the court. 'He wasn’t screaming for help - he was trying to get away.' Capt Gold said Miss Ware suddenly 'bobbed' to surface of the freezing river last February but was face down and wasn’t moving. He watched as Edwards swam toward her seemingly lifeless body. 'I thought he was going to rescue her but he didn’t,' he said. 'He pushed her beneath the water and she disappeared again. 'Not once did he try to bring her head out of the water.' Drowning: Capt Gold said Miss Ware suddenly 'bobbed' to surface of the freezing river last February but was face down and wasn't moving . When Miss Ware returned to the surface and became caught on the riverbank, Capt Gold said he fought off her attacker and pulled her to the bank. 'She was blue, not moving and had no pulse. She was dead,' he said. 'She had been under the water for close to three minutes and there were no signs of life.' He said he then began to perform CPR and with the help of a passing doctor who performed mouth-to-mouth they managed to revive her. When paramedics arrived, Miss Ware rushed to hospital and fortunately went on to make a full recovery. Captain Gold identified Edwards and Pincott to police officers at the scene and they were arrested following the incident in February. Earlier in the trial the court heard that Edwards had told police that Miss Ware had ended up in the water after the couple had argued, and that he had gone in to help her. Pincott said he had witnessed the argument and denied assaulting Miss Ware in any way. Edwards, of Butetown, Cardiff, denies attempting to murder Miss Ware and a charge of assaulting Mark Gold. Pincott, of Barry, near Cardiff, also denies attempted murder. The trial continues.

"Jack Wilshere is not a holding midfielder or a No 10, according to legendary Arsenal midfielder Liam Brady. Instead, Brady wants to see the England star shuttling between the two positions as a traditional midfield player. Wilshere starred in a holding role for England in European Championship qualifying wins over San Marino and Estonia.

Appearances: 307 (295 starts, 12 as a sub) Goals: 59 . Arsenal academy director: 1996 - 2014 . But Brady, who continued his association with the Gunners into an academy director role until May this year, wants to see more of Wilshere around the penalty area. 'I don't like Jack playing in the holding role,' Brady told talkSPORT. 'He's a much more valuable player when he's up around the box. 'I don't like him as a number ten, he's a midfield player you want to encourage to get forward where he can beat players with his dribbling.' Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes holds a different view to Brady. Speaking in his column for the Independent, Scholes hailed Wilshere as the best performing England player at present and believes the Gunner is flourishing in his deep-lying role for Roy Hodgson's men. 'I thought Jack Wilshere had two very good games for England during the last week,' Scholes said. 'I would go one step further than that and say that, at the moment, Wilshere is England’s best player. 'The penny has dropped and he has added another dimension to his game. He has always been capable of that intricate passing game. Now he can play the ball long, too. 'The quality of some of those passes into Wayne Rooney in Estonia was very high.

"A new collapsible coffee cup gives drinkers a chance to grab their caffeine fix on the go - and then store the empty mug in their pocket. Smash Cup is a portable, reusable and eco-friendly coffee cup which can collapse down when empty to fit in handbags, backpacks and even pockets. At full height it stands at five inches (12.7 cm), holding a capacity of 12 ounces (340 ml) of hot or cold beverages, but collapses down to just 1.75 inches (4.4 cm). Scroll down for video . A new collapsible coffee cup gives drinkers a chance to grab their caffeine fix on the go - and then store the empty mug in their pocket.  Smash Cup (shown) is a portable, reusable and eco-friendly coffee cup which can collapse down when empty to fit in handbags, backpacks and even pockets . With the average coffee drinker throwing away a total of 500 disposable cups every year, the reusable Smash Cup can apparently help to reduce waste. The collapsible cup is the brainchild of Ben Melinger, 34, who believed there was a need for the standard travel cup to become more convenient. His product combines an iconic design with a resuable body and a leak-proof lid - all of which promises to take up as little room as possible. It takes apparently as much energy as smashing an egg on a table with your hand to close the cup. 'When we first came up with the idea we were amazed there were no similar products on the market,' said Melinger, a management consultant from New York. 'Smash Cup is reminiscent of disposable coffee cups, but upgraded for a more robust and modern aesthetic. 'We strove to create an iconic look that city commuters, busy parents and students alike would be proud to own and display. 'It takes years of effort to develop a product and there was so much self-doubt, and so many little hurdles that popped up during the process. 'But whenever we took a step back and had a look at the Smash Cup with fresh eyes, we always felt we had a winner. 'This kept us pushing ahead - one step at a time.' The collapsible cup is the brainchild of Ben Melinger, 34, who believed there was a need for the standard travel cup to become more convenient. His product combines an iconic design with a resuable body and a leak-proof lid - all of which promises to take up as little room as possible . At full height (right) it stands at five inches (12.7 centimetres), holding a capacity of 12 ounces (340 millilitres) of hot or cold beverages (left).  But when empty, the simple looking design can collapse down to measure just one and three quarters of an inch in height . After two years developing the idea, Ben was surprised to see immediate success when he placed Smash Cup on crowdfunding site, Kickstarter. You may currently grab a coffee while filling up your car at a petrol station, but in the future you could be refuelling your vehicle with the aromatic brown liquid too. Scientists claim that a ‘green’ biofuel made from waste coffee grounds could power vehicles on our roads. Around 22 pounds (10 kilograms) of leftover grounds, generated by the average coffee shop, produces around two litres of the biofuel. The scientists believe that if this were scaled up nationally, popular high street coffee shops such as Starbucks, Café Nero and Costa Coffee could soon be rivalling oil giants like Shell, BP and Esso. Researchers at the University of Bath said  such waste coffee grounds could be a sustainable fuel source for powering vehicles. He set a goal of raising £6,000 ($10,000) in 30 days, enough to allow him to begin the production process in America. But amazingly he reached his target after just one day - and he is now well above his original goal. 'I am floored by the response,' he said. 'I was actually concerned that the low price of the product would make it a struggle to reach $2,000 [£1,200] on the first day - let alone $10,000 [£6,000] in 30. 'But it all happened on day one! My friends and family have been really supportive and I find it funny when they tell me they're addicted to watching the screen tick up and up. 'But more than any amounts of money, I'm just happy to know that we're going to be able to make Smash Cup a real thing and put it on the market. 'I love to create things and it's a great feeling to know other people appreciate what you've created.' Smash Cup has a water-tight seal, activated by closing the cup with a simple quarter turn. With three parts made from silicone and plastic, Melinger says the cup is easy to clean and it is also dishwasher safe. It comes in five different colours - red, green, blue, pink and orange - with the plastic lid available in white and dark grey. And as a special tribute to its humble beginnings, Ben has also designed a limited edition version for Kickstarter - in the website's signature light green. Smash Cup is currently only available to Kickstarter backers but Ben hopes to work with a UK or European distributor or team up with a coffee chain to reach customers worldwide.","New York-based inventor has unveiled his coffee cup that collapses .

"There can't be many social occasions that would cause Katie Hopkins and Katie Price to cross paths. And it is just as well, because The Apprentice star and professional loudmouth has put her foot in it again - insulting the former glamour model's latest baby name. After a six week wait, Katie Price finally announced that her fifth child - her second with current husband Kieran Hayler - would be called Bunny. Scroll down for video . 'BUNNY? Makes sense I guess, given your dad was going at it like a rabbit with all of mum's mates': Katie Hopkins (right) has taken a dig at Katie's Price (left) and her latest choice of baby name . The news was met with a typically acerbic tweet from Ms Hopkins, who wrote: 'Bunny? BUNNY? Makes sense I guess, given your dad was going at it like a rabbit with all of mum's mates.' The remarks are bound to sting Katie, who has spent the last few months battling to save her marriage to Kieran, 27. In June, the 36-year-old discovered he had cheated on her with her best friends Jane Pountney, 49 and Chrissy Thomas, 41. Katie Hopkins was quick to tweet her disgust at Katie Price's new baby name . But the couple has spent the last few months sorting through their problems and decided to give their relationship another try, with Kieran even present for the birth of Bunny in August. After the birth, Katie revealed it had been a struggle to find a name that both she and Kieran liked. She said: 'We’ve really struggled to decide on a name! I was totally set on Duchess Kate or just Duchess, but Kieran didn’t like that, so we’ve chosen Bunny, which we both like.' Although the name Bunny might leave a sour taste in Ms Hopkins' mouth, it isn't the first time she has has made derogatory comments about what parents call their children. Katie pictured with her offspring- India, nine, Poppy, seven, and Max, four, who she tries to deter from playing with ‘lower class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler . Last year, the TV commentator revealed that she refused to let her three offspring - India, nine, Poppy, seven, and Max, four, play with ‘lower class’ children with names like Chantelle, Charmaine, Chardonnay and Tyler. She said: 'I think you can tell a great deal from a name. 'For me, there’s certain names that I hear and I think “urgh”. ‘For me, a name is a shortcut of finding out what class a child comes from and makes me ask: “Do I want my children to play with them?” ‘When I hear screeched across the playground: “Tyler!

She added: ‘There’s a whole set of things that go with children like that, who are quite a disruptive influence in school and that’s why I don’t like those kind of children. ‘I tend to think that children who have intelligent names tend to have fairly intelligent parents and they make much better play-dates for my children. ‘We are really time short in this world and we need shortcuts to make decisions.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes striker Olivier Giroud has returned from injury a better and more focused player. The French striker starred on Sunday as he opened the scoring against Aston Villa before turning provider for Mesut Ozil as Arsenal cruised to victory. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud (left) lifts the ball over Aston Villa's  Brad Guzan for the opening goal . Mesut Ozil reels away in celebration as the German grabs a goal thanks to teammate Giroud's assist . Giroud has been in fine form since spending months on the sidelines recovering from an ankle injury picked up just two games in to the Premier League season. The severity of the forward's problem forced Wenger into the transfer window in the summer as the club lured England international Danny Welbeck to the club. Many suggested the 28-year-old's future in north London could be in doubt, but he has now scored five goals in his last six league games since making an early return from injury .

"The most senior Roman Catholic in England and Wales has lambasted the Prime Minister for his ‘un-democratic’ and ‘Orwellian’ plans to legalise gay marriage. Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said the proposals were a ‘shambles’, and accused David Cameron of pushing through the changes without a mandate. In his Christmas Eve sermon at Westminster Cathedral, he said that only marriage between a man and a woman shares in ‘the creative love of God’. Protest: The Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols wants Catholics to write to their MPs expressing their concerns about gay marriage plans . The criticism follows that of the Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, Mark Davies, who used his Christmas homily to liken moves to legalise same-sex marriage to the way Nazis and Communists tried to undermine religion. Mr Cameron wants to allow gay couples to get married in churches but he says religious organisations will be able to opt out. Archbishop Nichols criticised successive governments for failing to stand up for marriage and promoting sex before marriage instead. In an interview with the BBC, he attacked parties who were promoting same-sex marriage, saying the plan was ‘Orwellian’ because there was no mandate from the public. ‘From a democratic point of view, it’s a shambles,’ he said. ‘George Orwell would be proud of the manoeuvre. I think the process is shambolic.’ The Archbishop’s comments come despite the fact polls show the public is largely in favour of allowing gay couples to marry. Opposition: The most senior Catholic in England and Wales described the plans as 'Orwellian' Criticism: Catholics must act to try and change the minds of politicians throughout the UK . The Pope has sought to heal relations with China as he asked for blessings for the communist leadership for the first time in his Christmas Day message. But speaking in St Peter’s Square in Rome, Benedict XVI also urged the regime to respect religion. It follows a row two weeks ago when the Vatican refused to accept China’s decision to revoke the title of a Shanghai bishop. Asking for China’s leaders to ‘esteem the contribution of the religions’, the Pope said it would help build a ‘fraternal society for the benefit of that noble people’. He also spoke against the slaughter of the ‘defenceless’ in Syria, and urged Israelis and Palestinians to find the courage to negotiate. Turning to the nations of the  Arab Spring, he urged that they build just and respectful societies, especially Egypt. The 85-year-old also prayed for  peace in Mali and in Nigeria, where, he said ‘savage acts of terrorism continue to reap victims, particularly among Christians’. Civil partnerships – which come with most, but not all, of the legal safeguards of marriage – were introduced seven years ago. They allow gay couples to celebrate their unions in civil settings, but not in religious buildings. Now the Government wants to allow them to call their unions marriage and have the ceremony in civil and religious settings. Religious organisations such as the Quakers and the Unitarians have said they would like to be able to host gay marriages. But the Church of England and Roman Catholic Church are against it and the legislation says it would be illegal for any Anglican vicar to marry a gay couple. Ministers insist that churches will never be forced to carry out gay marriage, but opponents say homosexual couples could get the ban overturned under European human rights laws. Last week Pope Benedict XVI reiterated his opposition to gay marriage, saying that it was destroying the very ‘essence of the human creature’. Outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams admitted yesterday that the rejection of women bishops had damaged the Church of England. In his last Christmas Day sermon, he said last month’s Synod vote had been ‘deeply painful’. But he argued believers should take heart from the fact more than half the population – 59 per cent – describe themselves as Christian in the most recent census.","Archbishop of Westminster says Government has no mandate for law .

"Jon Corzine has admitted he has no idea where $1.2billion of missing customer’s money has gone since his brokerage firm collapsed. The former chief of MF Global has apologised to customers, employees and investors, saying ‘their plight weighs on my mind every hour’. But politicians and regulators have slammed the former New Jersey governor’s firm for operating as if the recession never happened. Sorry: MF Global's former chief Jon Corzine - pictured today - has apologised to customers, employees and investors, saying 'their plight weighs on my mind' ‘I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date,’ he told the House Agriculture Committee. ‘Their plight weighs on my mind every day - every hour,’ the former U.S. senator said in 21 pages of remarks prepared for delivery on Thursday. It is the first time Mr Corzine, 64, has spoken out since MF Global went bankrupt in October due to poor bets on European sovereign debt. He resigned just days later and the . search for the missing customer funds has sent reverberations through . the farm belt and trading floors. 'I simply do not know where the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date' Jon Corzine . It has also attracted the attention of the FBI and federal prosecutors, with thousands of customers having their money frozen. ‘It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here,’ said the Committee’s top Democrat, Collin Peterson. ‘Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened.’ Bankrupt: Politicians and regulators have slammed the former New Jersey governor's firm for operating as if the recession never happened . A top executive of futures exchange operator CME Group said claimed Global misused hundreds of millions of dollars of customer funds. In the strongest accusation yet against the bankrupt futures brokerage, the CME executive said MF Global moved the money to its own accounts. The biggest U.S. futures exchange operator was a hands-on regulator of MF Global. Its executive chairman Terrence Duffy also gave prepared remarks. ‘Transfers of customer funds for the benefit of the firm constitute serious violations of our rules and of the Commodity Exchange Act,’ he said. He said the brokerage admitted during a call with regulators that customer money was transferred out of segregation to the firm's own accounts. The court-appointed trustee has estimated . the shortfall of customer money at $1.2 billion, but CME has disputed . that figure as being too high. Fallen giant: It is the first time Mr Corzine has spoken out since MF Global went bankrupt in October due to poor bets on European sovereign debt . Mr Duffy indicated the shortfall was roughly half that amount. But neither MF Global nor any of its executives has been charged with wrongdoing. 'It appears to me that nobody has learned a thing from what's gone on here. Wall Street is operating as if 2008 never happened' Collin Peterson . Mr Corzine admitted in testimony that he mistakenly thought ‘investments in short-term European debt securities were prudent’. But he added that his ‘involvement in the firm's clearing, settlement and payment mechanisms and accounting was limited’. ‘I was stunned when I was told on Sunday, October 30, 2011, that MF Global could not account for many hundreds of millions of dollars,’ he said.","Former N.J. governor's firm went bankrupt in October .

"England qualified for the 2015 European Under 21 Championship with an impressive 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia - yet an astonishing eight players who did not feature in the second leg of that tie would makeSportsmail's strongest Three Lions XI. Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland started in goal, with Manchester United's Luke Shaw and West Bromwich Albion striker Saido Berahino up front for Gareth Southgate's men but there are eight eligible players who did not feature in Vinkovci who could start in the Czech Republic next June. Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, Everton's Ross Barkley and Arsenal's Jack Wilshere would be the star names in the England XI of players eligible for the tournament.

Wilshere will be 23 by the time of the tournament but is eligible to play for the Under 21 side as he was born after January 1, 1992. Any player who was born on or after this date is able to participate in the tournament because they were aged 21 or under when the qualification process began. Interestingly, Tuesday's goalscorers in England's 2-1 second-leg victory - Leicester City defender Liam Moore and Derby County's Will Hughes - would not feature in the side. With Butland in goal, the defence would be comprised of  Shaw at left back and United's Phil Jones at right back - with Arsenal's Calum Chambers partnering Everton's John Stones at centre back. A holding midfield duo of Wilshere and Southampton's James Ward-Prowse would help control the middle of the park. They would be able to set the platform for England's exciting attacking midfield trio of Sterling, Barkley and Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to provide the flair and pace. Berahino - one of only three survivors from Tuesday night in Sportsmail's team - would then be given the task of firing England through the group stages and to European glory. FORMATION: 4-3-3 .

Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Jerome Boateng, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil all started in Holland on June 29, 2009. Encouragingly, England U21 boss Southgate refused to rule out including some of the star youngsters in his squad for the tournament, meaning this XI could become a reality rather than a mere fantasy. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate is open to the idea of calling up the likes of Sterling and Barkley . Leicester City's Liam Moore scored one of England's two goals on Tuesday but he would not make the side . Germany U21s beat England U21s 4-0 in the 2009 European Championship final in Holland.

When asked if players such as Sterling or Chambers could play for his side, Southgate said: ‘I have been very careful throughout the (qualifying) campaign about who comes into the squad. They have to have a connection with the team and desire to come and play. I never worry about who I haven’t got and I’m not going to start now. ‘You can drive yourself to distraction. We could write a team sheet with illustrious names not involved here. The fact is, I believe we have such depth that we can challenge whoever we are playing with whatever players we put out on the pitch. ‘There may have been cases where some players haven’t fitted in to what we are doing. I certainly haven’t had a club pull out a player and thought, “That’s a bit off”.

"Feroz-ud-Din Mir claims to have a government certificate proving he was born on March 10, 1872 - which would make him the world's oldest person . An Kashmiri man claims he is 141 years old - which would make him the oldest person alive. Feroz-un-Din Mir, from Kashmir, says he has a government certificate proving he was born on March 10, 1872. Staff from Guinness World Records are thought to be investigating the claim, which would make him 26 years older than Misao Okawa, the 115-year-old current record holder. He would also overtake Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment as the oldest person to have ever lived. Ms Calment died in 1997 at the age of 122. Mr Mir is married to a woman in her eighties, Misra, and has outlived four other wives, reports Kashmir Life. He can still walk with help from his family, has some of his eyesight left, and can talk about his extraordinary life in his native tongue Pahari. Mr Mir followed in the footsteps of his father Matulli to become a fruit and nut trader and would often accompany him to Pakistan's capital Karachi. In the 1890s, he married his first wife and lived with her in Pakistan until her death in the early 1900s. 'There were no boundaries between India . and Pakistan at that time. It was easy to go to Muzaffarbad than to . Srinagar,' Mr Mir told the magazine. 'I used to work with a business family in Karachi who would buy . nuts from me. I would take nuts from Kashmir which were very famous in . Karachi.' Once he became a widower, he moved back to his birthplace in the village of Bihjama in Kashmir's Uri district, and went on to marry four more times. Misra, his fifth wife, told Kashmir Life: 'His experience of life is cruel. He used . to tell me stories of earthquake, which struck Sopore and Pattan area in . late 1880s and, while he on a trader trip to Karachi, he saved many . lives in Gadiduptata. 'He is witness to some of the most significant . events in history in the past century.' After the earthquake, Mr Mir was: 'so happy' to find his family alive and well. If Mr Mir's claims are true, they would see him overtake Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment as the oldest person to have ever lived. She died at the age of 122 years, 164 days in 1997 . Jiroemon Kimura held the title of the world's oldest living person until last month when he died aged 116 . He recalled when Pakistani raiders arrived in Kashmir in the late 19th century and said everyone had hid in the mountains while the raiders destroyed a power house in Mohra and killed the guard. Mr Mir also said life had become more complicated as modern life became more technologically advanced. 'As the life started becoming easy, people couldn’t live easily with each other,' he said. His grandson Abdul Rashid said Mr Mir's health and memory had suffered since an eye operation ten years ago. He told the magazine: 'We used to hear so many . stories from him when we were young that we would never get fed up. He . is an interesting man who has seen life very closely.' Before Mr Mir's story emerged, it was thought that the last man to have lived in the 19th century was Jiroemon Kimura, born on April 19, 1897. Mr Kimura died last month in Kyotango, Japan, at the age of 116, leaving behind seven children, 14 . grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and 15 great-great-grandchildren. The title of the world's oldest living person passed to 115-year-old Ms Okawa, from Osaka in Japan. Japan has more than 50,000 centenarians, 2011 government data showed, reinforcing its reputation for longevity.","Feroz-un-Dir Mir says a government certificate proves his March 1872 birth .

"A monster storm on the sun's surface has unleashed a solar flare in the direction of Earth - and there could be more to come. The event temporarily blacked out a few radio communication systems before weakening. The storm came from a large group of sunspots and hit Earth between 10 am and 11 am EDT (2pm and 3pm BST) yesterday. Scroll down for video . An X1.6 class flare erupted from the lower half of the sun today, as seen in the bright flash of light in this image from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This image shows extreme ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 131 Angstroms, which highlights the intense heat of a solar flare . 'It would seem to be just a matter of time before another strong explosion occurs,' said Spaceweather.com's Tony Phillips . Space Weather Prediction Center forecaster Christopher Balch, meanwhile, said the flare affected radio that uses part of the upper atmosphere. That includes some but not all radar and plane systems as well as amateur radio. Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. Mr Balch said the storm briefly was rated as strong for affecting Earth radio systems but then dropped to minor levels. The event followed months of near-silent activity on the sun before the huge flare erupted from a sunspot 14 times bigger than Earth. A spokesperson for the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre told MailOnline it may be the biggest sunspot for 25 years. But they said in the UK there had been 'no reports of any disruption at all. There may have been short periods of outage in radio communication but nothing has been repotred as causing problems.' Flares are massive explosions on the Sun associated with sunspots. Magnetic fields in sunspots can store vast amounts of energy, but looping magnetic field lines can get tangled up and snap, releasing their energy as explosions called flares. Sunspot AR12192 is 14 times larger than Earth and almost as big as Jupiter. The Met Office told MailOnline it might be the largest sunspot in 25 years. It is so big that it can be seen in images of the sun from Earth's surface (shown in this image from pilot Brian Whittaker) The light area in the centre of this image is the largest sunspot in this 11-year solar cycle, says the Met Office, and it may also have been the largest sunspot for 25 years . Yesterday's flare was an X1.6, which is a million times the combined yield of every single nuclear weapon on Earth. 'The sun erupted with another significant flare today, peaking at 10:28 a.m. EDT on Oct. 22, 2014,' revealed Nasa. 'Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory captured images of the event, which occurred in the lower half of the sun. 'This flare is classified as an X1.6 class flare. 'X-class flares denote the most extreme flares. 'This is the third substantial flare from the same region of the sun since Oct. 19.' Dr Young of Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center added: ‘It continues to grow in size and complexity.' The sunspot group - Active Region 2192 - has doubled in size to become one of the biggest groups in years, and has been described by astronomy experts as ‘menacing’. Up close: Monster Sunspot AR12192 taken by Karzaman Ahmad on October 21, 2014 from Langkawi Nagtional Observatory, Malaysia . Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Nasa says, ‘Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth’s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, but when intense enough - they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.’ An SDO/HMI view of the visible sun showing the largest sunspot of solar cycle 24, AR12192 - which is approaching the size of Earth. According to experts at thesuntoday.org, 'As of Oct. 22, 2014 (11 UT) the region’s trailing spots have an area of 2410 MH or millionths of a visible solar hemisphere. 'The largest up until now had been AR11967 on Feb. 5, 2014, measuring 1580 MH. MH is a standard measure used by astronomers for area. 'Just to provide some scale, the surface area of Earth is 169 MH - this means that AR12192 is 14 times larger than the surface area of Earth.' According to Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) team a single, dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 August. The two larger flares were M-class (moderate) flares and the others were smaller flares.

"Joao Magueijo, 47, has offered a dismal portrayal of English people, calling them 'unrestrained wild beasts who eat food so greasy it needs detergent' A best-selling book written by a Portuguese academic has offered a dismal portrayal of English people, calling them 'unrestrained wild beasts who eat food so greasy it needs detergent'. Joao Magueijo, 47, a physics professor at Imperial College London, has seen his book, Bifes Mal Passados (Undercooked Beef) sell more than 20,000 copies in his native country. Despite spending 25 years of his life on these shores, he describes England as 'one of the most rigid and rotten societies in Europe, possibly the world'. He says the English are 'always fighting' and claims 'I never met such a group of animals' - English culture is pathologically violent'. Describing a four-hour wait in a Blackpool hospital's A&E department one Sunday afternoon, he says 'it looked like a field hospital after battle'. The professor, who spent seven years as a fellow at St John's College, Cambridge, came to England in 1989 to do a master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics. He has written several books on the subject, with one, Faster Than The Speed Of Light, written in 2003, receiving ridicule after he challenged Einstein's theory of relativity. In his latest work, which has been in Portugal's top five best-sellers for the last five months, he writes despairingly about English drinking, eating and sexual habits. He moans: 'It is not unusual to drink 12 pints, or two huge buckets of beer per person. 'Even a horse would get drunk with this but in England it is standard practice. In England, real men have to drink like sponges, eat like skeletons and throw up everything at the end of the evening.' He labels the diet in the country as 'deplorable', with food 'based on greasy stuff and unspeakable artificial lard'. Scroll down for video . In his book, the university professor says it is normal for men in England to drink 12 pints of beer (picture posed by models) Even national favourite, fish and chips, does not escape his attack. He says that a standard meal will consist of 'a thin layer of the animal covered in many inches of batter, sometimes ten times bigger than the actual fish'. The fish is so greasy, he writes, that it 'makes you want to wash it with detergent before eating'. English women are not spared insult in his book as he goes into detail describing their shameful drinking habits and promiscuity. Mr Magueijo blasts England's health and hygiene standards, describing Blackpool beach as an ideal place to spot 'human whales' and 'men and women with three-metre waists made of fat and lard' He claims: 'Oral sex is not considered a sexual act among the English. It is something a woman can perform on a stranger whose name she doesn't even know...No one cares.' He recounts a damning anecdote from his Cambridge days where a young woman threw up during a formal dinner then resumed 'eating, drinking and shouting nonsense as if nothing had happened'. The scientist, who is currently single, blasts England's health and hygiene standards, describing Blackpool beach as an ideal place to see 'human whales'. He continues: 'They say ""it's grim up north""...and now I see why. 'People in the north are incredibly obese, men and women with three-metre waists made of fat and lard. 'When you visit English homes, or the toilets at schools or in student lodgings, they are all so disgusting that even my grandmother's poultry cage is cleaner.' The scientist has seen his book, Bifes Mal Passados (Undercooked Beef, pictured above) sell more than 20,000 copies in his native country . He refers to 'a distinguished professor' at Cambridge as 'Dr O' and claims he only washed on Saturdays. The authors talks resentfully about the British class system, saying: 'People of different classes don't talk to each other, or if they do they don't understand each other. It's reciprocal fear and hate.' Speaking to the MailOnline today, he said English people should laugh about the book. He added: 'And think of those poor sods down in Portugal, enduring a huge economic crisis, and who certainly need a laugh too'. The book is dedicated to the Queen and to his Portuguese grandparents. Mr Magueijo claims it will not be getting translated into English because 'much would be lost in translation'. But he insists he does 'not fear British backlash' as he trusts 'the British sense of humour. The book is not a serious book. It is humour, and meant to be taken that way'. Despite condemning the English for their 'food, class system and culture' he did have some positive things to say about the country. He said today: 'I love the tolerance, the creativity and the madness of the people. 'There is a certain incapacity for institutional repression, which I like.' He added: 'I'd had so many awful experiences attempting to have holidays in the UK that I thought they could serve as a good narrative backbone, Fawlty Towers-style. 'Monty Python is the inspiration.' In his book, he does offer some consolation to English readers, saying 'I am thankful to England for the working climate I was offered. But then there is all the rest'.","Joao Magueijo, 47, is a physics professor at Imperial College London .

"Ravel Morrison may have been cast into the shadows by West Ham but he's found a way to fill his free time while on loan at Cardiff. The controversial former Manchester United youngster posted a snap on Instagram as he did his French homework. Attacking midfielder Morrison has found his feet back in the Championship with the South Wales club after failing to break into Sam Allardyce's set-up at Upton Park. Ravel Morrison has been learning French when he hasn't been on the pitch for on-loan side Cardiff . Morrison advances with the ball for Cardiff in a narrow away defeat against Blackpool earlier this month . The 21-year-old is no stranger to the Championship after impressing during a loan spell at QPR last season, notching six goals as Rangers sealed promotion to the Premier League. Former Hammers boss Harry Redknapp believes Morrison is one of the most talented players he's seen, but has issues with his attitude. In his new book A Man Walks On To a Pitch, serialised in Sportsmail, Redknapp said of Morrison's loan spell at Loftus Road: 'There was one game last season when we'd lost confidence and were losing. I asked him to change his position, to play on the left. His face fell into a petulant pout. The 21-year-old looks to go on the attack during QPR's home clash with Blackpool last season . Morrison has the ball at his feet during his current loan spell with Cardiff and during a rare appearance for West Ham earlier this season . 'I pulled him away from the rest, took him outside and explained as patiently as the time allowed. ""Ravel, we are losing the f****** game,"" I said. ""I just want you to play there and do a job for the team. We have to win the game. It's not about you, OK? It's about the team. People look at your face in there when I've asked you to do something, and they will all go away and think you are a big-headed b******, because your attitude stinks. That's what people say about you"". 'Second half he was absolutely different class. He ran the game, everything good we did came from him and we were all watching it thinking, ""What a talent"". 'You looked at that performance and thought he could get us promoted on his own if he put his mind to it. It was like watching a player with Gareth Bale's class in the Championship.' West Ham co-owner David Sullivan says time is running out for Morrison if he wants a future at Upton Park . In a recent Q&A with the Evening Standard, West Ham co-owner David Sullivan echoed Redknapp's thoughts on the maverick playmaker, admitting time is running out for Morrison if he wants to forge a long-term future for himself at Upton Park. He said: 'The biggest disappointment is Ravel is such a talented individual. 'Thousands of kids would give anything to have his ability. Maybe the penny will drop eventually but his contract is up next summer. 'We all love him but we can't do it all for him. He has to do it himself.'","Ravel Morrison has been spending time learning French in his spare time .

"Most of the country may have awoken to a chilly but pleasant Autumnal morning today, but, in the middle of the Atlantic, a 300-mile wide hurricane is hurtling towards Britain. Hurricane Gonzalo is tearing through the Atlantic, with forecasters predicting two weeks of rainfall in just 24 hours when it strikes Britain tomorrow night. The storm, which left a trail of devastation in its wake in Bermuda, will bring 60mph winds and cause 'significant disruption' when it reaches the UK, the Met Office has predicted. Scroll down for videos . Calm before the storm: A London, Midland and Scottish Stanier class 5 steam locomotive powers across the Glenfinnan Viaduct, in Lochaber in the western Highlands . Magical: The bright image will look familiar to Harry Potter fans, as the Hogwarts Express was pictured travelling along viaduct in the children's fantasy book series .

It was nice morning for a row across Loch Achray, west of Stirling, as these two early birds found when they sailed past the former Tigh Mor hotel, which is surrounded by tall trees . The bright morning was perfect for punting along the River Cam, Cambridge, while people went for a stroll along the riverside . A member of Brighton Sea Swimmers did not seem to find the conditions too chilly as he marched out of the ocean after taking a dip . These men made the most of the weather and went for a swim in Brighton, which will be largely unaffected by Gonzalo . Amanda and Bob Gillatt strolled through Clumber Park, near Worksop, Nottinghamshire, with their dog, Alfie, this afternoon . Jane and Nigel Stock also went for a walk through the park with their dog, enjoying the good weather while it lasts . Temperatures hit 22C yesterday but the good weather will soon be replaced by fierce winds and driving rains as the tail end of Gonzalo lashes the nation. Bermuda was hit by 134mph winds, leaving most of the Caribbean country without power and tearing roofs off of buildings. The Midlands and the North will be the worst affected, with the possibility of 23ft waves in the North-West causing flash flooding, The Sun reported. Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: 'There is the possibility for significant disruption. Difficult driving conditions are expected thanks to large amounts of spray and potential for wind-blown debris.

This forecast from the U.S. National Hurricane Center shows Gonzalo's predicted route and where its winds are expected to be strongest, predicting that Scotland will be the worst-affected part of the UK . 'The strongest winds will fall in Tuesday morning rush hour. Trees risk being blown over, with a greater risk of branches coming down. Ferry sailings could be affected.' The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' warning for Northern Ireland, western and eastern Scotland, north Wales, the Midlands and the north of England ahead of the storm. RAC spokesman Simon Williams warned drivers to be aware of branches and debris left on the road by the powerful storm, which could bring gale force 10 winds. 'Motorists should be prepared and take extreme care, particularly with debris expected on roads which could cause accidents,' he said. An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'We're monitoring Gonzalo closely with the Met Office and may issue an alert for potential coastal flooding for part of the country.' It has already issued a flood alert for parts of East Anglia on Tuesday. Fast ferries between Holyhead, north-west Wales, and Ireland were cancelled because of high winds and big seas. Meanwhile Trafalgar Day celebrations in Llandudno were blasted by gusts of wind which blew wreathes from the war memorial and forced veterans to cling onto their berets. Bookies Coral today slashed odds from 33-1 to 20-1 on the UK facing its strongest ever winds when Gonzalo hits. The record is 173mph in the Highlands in 1986. Almost the entire island of Bermuda lost power after the hurricane hit, blowing roof tiles off houses and uprooting trees. Boats were dragged away from their moorings and some capsized as the storm planted a direct hit on the British territory. Nobody in Bermuda has been killed or seriously injured by the extreme weather. Residents were urged to stay indoors while the hurricane struck. Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm then weakened to Category 2 strength just before coming ashore with sustained winds of 110 mph. Even after beginning to move away, its fierce winds continued to hit the island for hours. Mr Partridge added: ‘The main reason for the warning is the timing, as strong winds will be coming through the Tuesday morning rush hour – it will be wet and windy and there will be spray on the roads. ‘Also the trees are still quite full of leaves at the moment and with those strong winds we could see a lot more leaves on the roads.' The clean-up in Bermuda has begun after 130mph winds broke boats free of their moorings and washed them ashore .

"More than 260 years after his death, his music is still known and adored by millions. According to a new analysis, however, some of Johann Sebastian Bach’s best-loved works may actually have been written by his wife. An expert claims that Anna Magdalena, Bach’s second wife, was the composer of some of his major pieces, including the cello suites. Johann Sebastian Bach's second wife, Anna Magdalena, may have composed some of his finest works, academics have claimed . Martin Jarvis, professor of music at Charles Darwin University in Australia, has spent years compiling evidence, with a comprehensive study of handwriting and manuscripts. He will present his findings in a documentary entitled Written By Mrs Bach, due to be screened at Bafta in London next week. The film will detail his analysis of ink and writing style, which he says suggests Mrs Bach did far more work on the pieces than previously thought. He argues that Anna also wrote the aria from the Goldberg Variations and the first prelude of The Well-Tempered Clavier: Book I. Presented by British composer Sally Beamish, the film will include evidence from an American scientist who analysed Bach’s signature and his scores. Heidi Harralson, a forensic document examiner, said she believed the composer was more likely to be Anna than Bach himself, saying she was as sure as possible ‘within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty’. Mrs Bach helped her husband write the Cello Suites because of his ailing health, but researchers have now claimed that she composed them herself . Anna is already known to have transcribed for Bach in his later years, but researchers found the handwriting did not have the ‘slowness or heaviness’ of someone who is merely copying. They concluded that the handwriting suggested she had composed the scores herself. The experts also pointed to numerous corrections to music written in her hand, signalling she is likely to have been composing it as she went along. Anna, an accomplished singer, married Bach in 1721 when she was 20 and he was 36. Many of her papers are said to have been destroyed after her death, leaving little trace of her legacy. Miss Beamish told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘What I found fascinating is the questions it raises about the assumptions we make: that music is always written by one person and all the great masters were male by definition.’","Bach's second wife composed some of his finest works, academics say .
Study of handwriting on Bach's work suggests she was behind the music .

"Manchester United must be kicking themselves after Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane revealed that he chose not to join the club in 2011 due to their purchase of Phil Jones. But United are not the first club to miss out on a big star due to a combination of bad luck and poor judgement. Sir Alex Ferguson was responsible for bringing in Jones and not Varane but at least he wasn't the manager who passed up on Diego Maradona in favour of, er, Alejandro Sabella. Read on for more details about that particular gaffe and other ones who got away in British football's biggest transfer misses. 1 Kenny Dalglish - West Ham, 1966 . The man hailed as King Kenny by the Kop could have been handed the same epithet by the Bobby Moore Stand instead had things turned out differently. Legend has it that West Ham boss Ron Greenwood thought Dalglish was too lightweight and so turned down the chance to sign the 15-year-old striker, but Harry Redknapp suggests in his new book, A Man Walks On to a Pitch, that Dalglish was always destined for Celtic. Dalglish went on to become both Liverpool and Scotland's greatest player. Kenny Dalgish's name is still sung at Anfield many years after he finished playing for Liverpool . 2 Diego Maradona - Sheffield United, 1978 . United boss Harry Haslam spotted a 17-year-old Maradona on a scouting trip to Argentina and was so impressed that he struck a £200,000 deal there and then. But when Argentinos Juniors demanded more cash the Blades board refused to cough up, and bought Maradona's countryman Alejandro Sabella instead. Sabella spent two years at Bramall Lane and went on to coach Argentina to last summer's World Cup final. Maradona inspired his side to win the trophy in 1986 and is perhaps the greatest footballer ever to live. Whoops. Diego Maradona is held aloft after Argentina defeated West Germany 3-2 in the World Cup final in 1986 . 3 Eric Cantona - Sheffield Wednesday, 1991 . 'Ooh Aah' - not just the sound of Manchester United fans singing Cantona's praises but probably also the mumbled response of Trevor Francis when asked why he didn't sign King Eric when he had the chance. Cantona was up for grabs after an epic tantrum at Nimes (when he threw a ball at a ref and called in turn each member of the French FA's disciplinary team an idiot) and went on trial at Wednesday after threatening to retire from the game. After a week of training indoors due to bad weather, Francis was somehow still not convinced and asked the striker to stay on for a further week to play on grass. Cantona refused and was snapped up by Leeds. He joined Manchester United a year later and became the first true star of the Premier League era (and the player who consequently transformed English football for two decades). Eric Cantona scores for Manchester United against local rivals City in 1993 . 4 Alan Shearer - Manchester United, 1992 . The Premier League's all-time record goalscorer could have ensured near total dominance for the top-flight's most successful club had he moved to Old Trafford from Southampton in 1992. Instead, Shearer chose to join Blackburn Rovers because United 'took too long' to seal the deal, which had been lined up. Shearer helped Blackburn pip United to the title in 1995 and became a thorn in their side for years as a world-class striker. Alan Shearer is the deadliest marksman in Premier League history, with a signature goal celebration . 5 Andriy Shevchenko - West Ham, 1995 . This one is best told in Harry Redknapp's own words: 'I was at West Ham and Frank Lampard Snr and I were approached by these two villains who said they were doing some business in the Ukraine, and we were so scared of them we agreed to have a look at a couple of these kids. 'One of them we played against Barnet Reserves and he scored the winner. They said they wanted a million quid for him, and Frank said it was too much — well I’m blaming Frank — and we let him go. His name was Andriy Shevchenko!' Andriy Shevchenko enjoyed a brilliant career at AC Milan... after failing to land a deal at West Ham . 6 Zinedine Zidane - Blackburn, 1995 . When offered the chance to sign Zinedine Zidane, what might you say? Probably not 'no thanks - we've got Tim Sherwood'. Unfortunately that is roughly what the late Jack Walker, then Rovers owner, said when he had the opportunity to bring the greatest player of his generation to Lancashire. Instead, Zidane left Bordeaux for Juventus a year later and went on to become a legend in Italy and then an original Galactico at Real Madrid. Zinedine Zidane holds up the World Cup after inspiring France to victory at at the Stade de France in 1998 . 7 Zlatan Ibrahimovic – Arsenal, 2000 . Not many 16-year-olds would turn down the chance to have a trial at Arsenal but Ibrahimovic was never your average player. 'Arsene (Wenger) gave me the famous red and white jersey - the No 9 shirt with Ibrahimovic on it and I was so pleased I even posed for a picture wearing it,' he said. 'He never actually made me a serious offer, it was more, ""I want to see how good you are, what kind of player you are. Have a trial"". 'I couldn't believe it. I was like, ""No way, Zlatan doesn't do auditions"". Fourteen years later, Ibrahimovic has won titles at Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, and is Sweden's greatest ever player. Zlatan Ibrahimovic wearing his Arsenal shirt (left) and celebrating a goal against the Gunners in 2010 (right) 8 Ronaldinho - St Mirren, 2001 . Yes, you read right. Just before moving to Paris Saint-Germain, Ronaldinho was lined up for a short spell at the Scottish outfit, with his advisers insisting that he could do with a stint in Europe to acclimatise to the style of football on the continent. Unfortunately for the Buddies  red tape scuppered the move. Ronaldinho, perhaps employing selective memory, said a few years later of the St Mirren move: 'I had a lot of offers from Europe. I can't remember where they were all from.' Ronaldinho was the most skilful forward in the world at Barcelona in the early part of the 21st century . 9 Cristiano Ronaldo - Arsenal, 2003 . Ibrahimovic wasn't the only player to have been seduced by an Arsenal shirt with their name and the No 9 on the back. Sadly for Wenger, the tactic failed with Cristiano Ronaldo too. The £80m Real Madrid superstar did what Zlatan would never do and took up a week's trial with the Gunners, but Wenger was gazumped by Manchester United, who used Carlos Queiroz to appeal to the Portugal starlet. Oh well, Arsene - at least you didn't miss out on Lionel Messi... Cristiano Ronaldo almost moved to Arsenal before Manchester United stepped in and lured him away . 10 Lionel Messi - Arsenal, 2003 . Ah. Right. Yes, unfortunately Wenger did also miss out on Messi, meaning the two greatest players on the planet both slipped through the Arsenal boss's fingertips. Wenger came within a whisker of signing Messi from Barcelona’s La Masia academy when he was just 16, along with Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas, promising the Barca trio first-team football. Messi was, remarkably, interested in moving to north London, but the deal was ruined because of issues over the Argentina forward’s work permit. And the rest, as they say, is history. Lionel Messi (centre) almost made a shock move to Arsenal from Barcelona as a teenager . AND HERE'S HOW THEY COULD HAVE LOOKED (SORT OF)...

"Ravel Morrison has returned to West Ham United training after having his loan spell at Cardiff City cut short. The former Manchester United midfielder was originally due to stay with the Championship side until Boxing Day but he is already back training at the Hammers. It is unclear whether or not Morrison has a first-team future at Upton Park, but he posted a picture on his Instagram showing himself in the West Ham gym on Sunday. Ravel Morrison posted a photo of himself on Instagram in West Ham United training kit during a gym session . Morrison has returned from his loan at Cardiff City (left) early and is now back with the Hammers .

The 21-year-old was also wearing his official Hammers training kit while lying on a training mat in the photo. During his two-and-a-half months in the Welsh capital, Morrison made just six appearances and failed to find the target for Cardiff. Morrison has persistently struggled with off-field disciplinary problems throughout his career, including making homophobic remarks on Twitter and being arrested - and subsequently cleared - on suspicion of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother. He has been at Upton Park for two-and-a-half seasons but he has already been loaned out to Birmingham City, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff during that time. West Ham are flying in the Premier League and sit fourth, meaning it will be difficult for Morrison to force his way back into manager Sam Allardyce's first-team plans.

"Rant: Claire Moloney was filmed having a screaming argument with an Asian man on a Tube carriage after going out drinking with colleagues . A commuter who told an Asian man to ‘f*** off back to your own country’ in a rant on a Tube train has been found not guilty of racial harassment . Accountant Claire Moloney was allowed to sit with her family while the verdict was announced. A gasp of relief was heard when she was pronounced not guilty, and her husband put his arms around her and gave her a hug. One family member was heard to say, 'About time.' Mrs Moloney said during her trial that she was embarrassed to watch film footage in which she screamed at an unidentified man, and which was later uploaded to YouTube, and shown to the court at her trial. The jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court also decided she did not intend her words to cause harassment, alarm or distress. In the video, Moloney told the commuter, an Asian-looking man: ‘I f****** respect . people in their countries, f*** you c***.’ She . stood up in her seat, saying: ‘You come in this country, you wanna have . f*****g everything on a plate. F*** off back to your own country if . your country is so good.’ Moloney, . who works in Central London, was travelling to her . home in Dagenham, Essex, on a District Line train after going for drinks with . colleagues, the court heard. When . the alleged victim told her that she was being racist, she replied: . ‘You c**** wanna take over our country, you racist c***, you wanna take . over the world.’ The man remonstrated but was taken aback when Moloney got out of her seat to hurl more abuse. By the end of the video, the victim had given up arguing and told her, ‘OK, I’ll go back to my country.’ Moloney, 40, sobbed and fell in to the arms of her husband in the public gallery as the jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court read out their verdicts. The mother-of-two denied she was racist, saying . she was upset at being told she had 'blood on my hands' and being . criticised because she had been drinking alcohol. ‘I’m not a racist in any shape or form,’ she told the court in her evidence. ‘I agree the language is horrific and I am mortified. ‘I was half asleep and he said something to do with my poppy and I wondered if it was about me. ‘He said something about blood on my hands for invading his country. ‘I know what he said was derogatory . and against women in general and he definitely used the word “Slag” because I was out drinking. ‘I was insulted and I lost it and I ranted; I was arguing my case.’ ‘I was in a rage, I lost control and I was ranting but he was goading me.’ It . was suggested to Moloney that the man was at a ‘point of surrender’ but . she said: ‘I do not think so. He was being sarcastic.’ Under cross-examination she claimed to regret not attempting to leave the train or reporting the abuse. However, . she did say she would have reacted had anybody of any race made . comments like the ones the unidentified Asian man had made. Footage: Moloney repeatedly swore at the man on a District Line train but insists she is not racist . Row: Moloney says she was provoked by the man and is now embarrassed by what she said at the time . The video was first uploaded to YouTube in November 2010, but Moloney was not arrested until April this year on suspicion of racially aggravated assault. Christoper Draycott, prosecuting, . said: ‘Quite clearly these words would cause harassment, alarm or . distress and so they did cause that. ‘The . defendant is up out of her chair and leans into his personal space and . he appears to lean back in his chair. Having argued back and . remonstrated with her, he says, “Alright I agree with you, I will go . back home."" ‘Despite . initially arguing back and not walking away he was caused harassment, . alarm or distress. At least in part this incident was racially motivated . and was put to him because of his membership of a particular racial . group.’ Moloney left court having pleaded not guilty to one count of . using racially aggravated words to cause harassment, alarm or distress . and one count of intentionally using words to cause harassment, alarm or . distress.","Claire Moloney, 40, was filmed during screaming argument on the Tube .

"West Ham's Ravel Morrison has joined Cardiff on a three-month loan deal, the player has announced on Twitter. The 21-year-old former Manchester United midfielder has been out of favour at West Ham in recent months amid well-documented personal issues. Morrison announced on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon: 'Happy to get a 3 month loan @CardiffCityFC time to start playing some football again.' Ravel Morrison (right), during a rare appearance for West Ham this season, has made a loan move to Cardiff . He added in another tweet about West Ham, which he later deleted: 'I got no ratings off people in the club not the club it's self (sic) just people in it.' The England Under-21 international is set to face trial in January over allegations he threatened to throw acid in his former girlfriend's face and have her killed. He is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house during an alleged four-year campaign of harassment against her and is alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27. Manchester-born Morrison was considered one of the most talented youngsters to have come out of United for many years during his time at Old Trafford, but he ended up making only three substitute appearances in the League Cup for Sir Alex Ferguson's side and joined West Ham in a £650,000 deal in January 2012. Morrison has started just 12 Premier League games for the Hammers in more than two-and-a-half years and has had loan spells at Birmingham and QPR during his time in east London. He has made just two appearances for West Ham this season, against Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup and Southampton in the Premier League. Morrison could make his debut for managerless Cardiff in the SkyBet Championship at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.

"Former President George W. Bush said  on Friday that he was baffled by a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer who put Eric Garner into a chokehold. 'I thought how sad. The verdict was hard to understand,' Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in a clip on an interview the network plans to air during Crowley's show on Sunday, adding that he 'hadn't seen all the details.' 'But it’s sad that race continues to play such....an emotional, divisive part of life,' he continued, reflecting on the race riots he witnessed growing up in the 1970s. 'I do think we've improved.' Scroll down for video . 'It’s sad that race continues to play such....an emotional, divisive part of life,' former President George W. Bush told CNN host Candy Crowley in an interview aired in part today by the network . In the segment of the interview that was released, Bush did not weigh in on whether the Department of Justice should proceed with a civil rights investigation into the killing nor did he list particular reforms that federal and enforcement officials should purse in order to prevent similar deaths. He did relay a conversation that he and his former secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, had over dinner after a grand jury declined to indict former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson for taking the life of Michael Brown. 'We talked about this subject, and ...she just said, ""You’ve got to understand that there are a lot of black folks around that are incredibly more and more distrusting of law enforcement."" 'Which is a shame, because law enforcement’s job is to protect everybody,' he said. President Barack Obama and the White House have been careful not to publicly comment on either of the grand jury decisions or potential federal actions, noting that it would be inappropriate for them to influence or interfere with Justice's probe. Instead, the president has spoken more vaguely about the effect that the court decisions had on minority communities, pointing out that 'too many' feel that 'law enforcement is not working with them and dealing with them in a fair way.' 'We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of trust and strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and our law enforcement,' he said after the verdict was announced on Wednesday. Black members of Congress said on Thursday that the White House could show its support for the African-American community by inviting the families of Brown and Garner to the president's annual State of the Union address next month, . 'Those families are symbols of an issue that needs to be urgently addressed in America,' Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson told the Hill. 'I think it would be an excellent idea.' 'It would be good that we put a face to the injustices that have occurred as a result of the criminal justice system that hasn't been lifted to a point of colorblindness,' New York Rep. Yvette Clark said. At least one Republican in Congress, New York Rep. Peter King, has come out swinging in favor of the white law enforcement officers in New York, saying, that had Garner not 'had asthma and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died' and that 'there’s not a hint there that anyone used any racial epithet.' King said he has 'no doubt' that a '350 pound white guy' would have faced the same treatment at the hands of police. A protester, demanding justice for Eric Garner, holds a placard featuring Garner's final words while staging a 'die-in' with dozens of others in downtown White Plains,  New York today. Protesters swarmed streets of Manhattan or a second night on Thursday to denounce a  grand jury's decision to spare a white police officer from criminal prosecution in the choking death of the unarmed black man . Kentucky Sen. and likely 2016 contestant Rand Paul said Wednesday that he blames the politicians who created the laws that led to what happened. Garner was first approached by police because he was hawking untaxed cigarettes on the street in Staten Island, which is illegal. 'Obviously, the individual circumstances are important, but I think it’s also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so they’ve driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive,' Paul told Hardball host Chris Matthews. 'But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, ""Hey, we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette."" ' he said. Paul said 'there really is no excuse for' anyone to die for breaking that type of law, and added, 'but I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws.' Other Republicans on Capitol Hill have mostly been quiet about the death this week, however, preferring to gripe instead about the president's executive actions on immigration. GOP conference chair Cathy McMorris Rogers said yesterday, however, that she 'absolutely' believes that Congress should hearings on Garner's death. House Speaker John Boehner didn't directly endorse hearings at a press conference on Thursday, telling reporters, 'I’m not going to rule that in or out,' but the GOP leader acknowledged that he does think 'that the American people deserve answers about what really happened here.'","'It’s sad that race continues to play such....an emotional, divisive part of life,' Bush said reflecting on the race riots he witnessed growing up .

"Marouane Chamakh is back in contention as Crystal Palace return their attentions to the Barclays Premier League against Leicester on Saturday. A Palace side showing a full 11 changes following the win at Everton lost 3-2 after extra-time to Newcastle on Wednesday night to exit the Capital One Cup at Selhurst Park. Chamakh missed the defeat and the 3-2 win at Goodison Park with a hamstring injury and may be selected among the substitutes against the Foxes, with manager Neil Warnock insisting the players which began at Everton would likely return to start. Neil Warnock will be able to call on the services of Marouane Chamakh for the first time as Palace boss . Chamakh will be in contention for the first time in a month this weekend against Leicester . 'Chamakh will be available,' Warnock said. 'He was very close to being available last weekend but we felt it was not worth the risk. 'There won't be many changes from Everton. At Everton we were fantastic, so I don't envisage many changes. 'But it's nice to look at the squad, the second group of players, knowing what you can bring into the squad. 'That was the pleasing thing last night, the way we played, we enjoyed it, we went forward whenever we could, we looked like we wanted to go out and play football in the cup. 'They all played really well against a strong Newcastle team. It showed we've got quite a good squad.' Warnock was less than happy with the stadium announcement, made while the match with Newcastle was ongoing, that Manchester City would be the opponents in the fourth round. 'I made an enquiry after the game, because I was disappointed, if I'm honest,' Warnock added. Chamakh gets up to head the ball during Crystal Palace's home defeat to West Ham . 'I don't think it should have been announced. I don't know why it was announced and who announced it. I'm sure there will be some enquiries today. 'I felt it was out of order for both sets of fans, who just wanted to get on with the game.' Asked if knowing City, 7-0 winners over Sheffield Wednesday, would be their next opponents with victory had affected his players, Warnock's response was sarcastic. Warnock, with a smile, said: 'I think that's why they threw the last goal in, so they didn't go to Man City away. We heard the score.' Leicester beat City's Manchester rivals Manchester United 5-3 last weekend and are seventh in the table with two wins and one loss in their five matches since promotion from the Championship. 'They've made the Premier League look quite easy, really,' Warnock added.

"Sinister: David Russell lured his 19-year-old victim to Harlestone Firs forest in Northampton and has been jailed for her attempted murder . She met him on Facebook, and was impressed enough to cross the Atlantic to meet him. But Maricar Benedicto’s naive trust was repaid in the most horrific way. The man who lured her to the UK, David Russell, took her to a forest and persuaded the 19-year-old to wear a blindfold, saying he had a gift for her. Russell then stood behind her and slit her throat. The terrified teenager tried to escape but the 20-year-old McDonald’s worker stabbed her several times, hit her in the face with a log and headbutted her. Miraculously, she survived. At Northampton Crown Court, Russell admitted kidnap and attempted murder and was jailed for life. The court was told he had posed as tattooed rocker Oliver Sykes, lead singer in the Sheffield-based metal band Bring Me The Horizon, currently touring the Americas. Prosecuting, Christopher Donnellan QC said that the day before Miss Benedicto arrived from California last April, Russell had searched the internet for ‘how to kill someone with bare hands’, ‘how to cut skin with a knife’ and ‘the best knife to kill’. After meeting Miss Benedicto at the town’s railway station, Russell took her to a nearby forest, claiming it held special childhood memories. Mr Donnellan said: ‘He asked her to sit down on a fallen tree trunk and said he was going to blindfold her. He said she would get a surprise or a present. He stood behind her, blindfolded her, asked her to put her head back, and her arms up. She did so with her palms up, entirely trusting him. ‘Although she did not see any implement because of the blindfold, the next thing she felt was her neck being sliced.’ Deceptive: David Russell pretended he was Oliver Sykes (left), frontman of heavy metal band, Bring Me The Horizon . The court heard that as Russell did it, he shouted: ‘Why won’t you die? You’ve ruined my life. It’s all your fault.’ The court was told she jumped up and . the blindfold fell off. She began to run away ‘but he caught up and . stabbed her in the back’. A serrated breadknife was found at the scene. He stopped the attack only when Miss Benedicto told him she had given his name and address to immigration on arrival in the UK. He ran home, where he took a suspected overdose, while she staggered to a nearby house for help. Deserted: Russell met his victim in Harlestone Firs Forest, Northampton where he blindfolded and attacked her . The pair had met on Facebook last year and ‘engaged in conversations using pseudonyms’. She went by the alias Ruby Townsend. They chatted online using Skype and . Miss Benedicto knew Russell was not who he initially claimed to be . before she flew to Britain. Steven Crouch, defending, said . Russell was ‘borderline autistic’ but had never offended before. ‘He is a . troubled young man, very young, who committed an act in bizarre . circumstances, never to be repeated.’ Jailing him on Tuesday, Judge Charles . Wide QC said Russell was ‘exceptionally dangerous’ and must serve at . least 17-and-a-half years in jail before being considered for release. He added: ‘The features of this case . are truly horrifying. When she was able to escape, you intended to kill . her and must have come very close.’","David Russell has been jailed for life for kidnap and attempted murder .

'I would go one step further than that and say that, at the moment, Wilshere is England's best player. 'The penny has dropped and he has added another dimension to his game.

Scholes said back in March: 'Jack Wilshere came on the scene and what a top young player he looked, but he's never really gone on. 'He needs characters like Vieira next to him to take him to the next level. 'Injuries haven't helped him, but he doesn't look any better a player now than when he was 17.' The pair subsequently cleared the air when Wilshere tracked down Scholes to question the United legend about his comments. 'It was a bit strange, out of the blue,' Wilshere said at the time. 'I remember watching it, he was having a go at Arsenal, and I was thinking ""Is he going to come for me?"" 'I actually spoke to him after. We had quite a good chat. He is entitled to his opinion but I just wanted to know. 'If it had come from a rubbish player I could say 'what are you talking about?' But it came from Paul Scholes. 'So I wanted to get to the bottom of it. I spoke to him, he explained it a bit better and told me what he thought I should work on. For me he was the best English midfielder of all time.'","Scholes had previously criticised Arsenal star for lack of development since bursting onto the scene in 2008 .

"Forget TfL workers and impatient bankers, London commuters have been joined by a surprisingly seductive group on their way to work. Travellers on the Northern Line were given an interesting wake up call when a lingerie brand launched its new collection at an Underground platform. Transport for London gave permission for the catwalk show to take place at the newly reopened Tottenham Court Road Tube station on Monday. Lingerie brand Bluebella gave morning commuters a shock when they showcased their latest collection on a platform of a London Tube station . Models from the brand Bluebella posed among travellers for the label's latest collection, and in true British style many commuters pretended not to notice. The brand chose the Underground to launch their new spring/summer creations to give commuters a pre-work pick-me-up. Bluebella founder Emily Bendell says that the idea was to share the brand's ethos with the weary travellers. 'Bluebella is all about confidence and enjoyment and we thought it would cheer up a few commuters on their way to work to watch a catwalk show with gorgeous models.' Three scantily clad models posed at Tottenham Court Road underground station . Founder of Bluebella Emily Bendell says that she wanted to give morning commuters a pick-me-up . Emily added that she wanted to demonstrated that luxury lingerie shouldn't be saved for best and can be worn at any time and any place .

'We believe in never saving anything for best so our lingerie is designed to make you feel fabulous every day. Why not make a grey day special by wearing beautiful lingerie under your clothes?' 'Great lingerie gives you an inner confidence - even if you are jammed against other travellers on the morning commute.'

"It has long been though that a comet struck Earth 12,800 years ago, bringing an end to the Ice Age. This event was thought to have not only sparked climate change, but also killed America's earliest people and caused a mass animal extinction. But a new study suggests this comet theory is false, as most supposed impact indicators at 29 sites are too old or too young to be remnants of an ancient comet. Theories that a comet struck Earth at the end of the Ice Age 12,800 years ago (artist's illustration shown) may be wrong, according to a new study. The researchers say evidence for dating at 29 impact sites across North America suggesting a comet sparked a brief period of cooling after the Ice Age is flawed . Controversy over what sparked the Younger Dryas, a brief return to near glacial conditions at the end of the Ice Age, includes a theory that it was caused by a comet hitting the Earth. As proof, proponents point to sediments containing deposits they believe could result only from a cosmic impact. One . theory is that the circulation of warm tropical weather in the North . Atlantic was shutdown by an influx of fresh water from Lake Agassiz in . in mid-North America and deglaciation. This, some scientists say, explains why the 1,300-year deep freeze occurred after the Ice Age ended. Another theory is the impact hypothesis, which suggests a comet slammed into the planet and led to widespread cooling. Volcanic activity has also been suggested as a cause. A . sizeable eruption, with one culprit potentially being the Laacher See . volcano in Germany, could have significantly changed temperatures in the . northern hemisphere. Now a new study disproves that theory, said archaeologist David Meltzer of the Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Meltzer is lead author on the study and an expert in the Clovis culture, the peoples who lived in North America at the end of the Ice Age. His research team found that nearly all sediment layers purported to be from the Ice Age at 29 sites in North America and on three other continents are actually either much younger or much older. Scientists agree that the brief episode at the end of the Ice Age - officially known as the Younger Dryas after a flower that flourished at that time - sparked widespread cooling of the Earth 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years. But theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous; they range from changes in ocean circulation patterns caused by glacial meltwater entering the ocean to the cosmic-impact theory. The cosmic-impact theory is said to be supported by the presence of geological indicators that are extraterrestrial in origin. However a review of the dating of the sediments at the 29 sites reported to have such indicators proves the cosmic-impact theory false, said Meltzer. Meltzer and his co-authors found that only three of 29 sites commonly referenced to support the cosmic-impact theory actually date to the window of time for the Ice Age. The findings, 'Chronological evidence fails to support claim of an isochronous widespread layer of cosmic impact indicators dated to 12,800 years ago,' were reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 'The supposed impact markers are undated or significantly older or younger than 12,800 years ago,' report the authors. 'Either there were many more impacts than supposed, including one as recently as five centuries ago, or, far more likely, these are not extraterrestrial impact markers.' In North America, the Ice Age was marked . by the mass extinction of several dozen genera of large mammals, . including mammoths, mastodons, American horses, Western camels, two . types of deer, ancient bison, giant beaver, giant bears, sabre-toothed . cats, giant bears, American cheetahs and many other animals, as well as . plants. Scientists agree that a brief episode at the end of the Ice Age sparked widespread cooling of the Earth 12,800 years ago and that this cool period lasted for 1,000 years. But theories about the cause of this abrupt climate change are numerous including the cosmic-impact theory based on sites in places like Quebec . The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis rests heavily on the claim that there is a Younger Dryas boundary layer at 29 sites in the Americas and elsewhere that contains deposits of supposed extraterrestrial origin that date to a 300-year span centered on 12,800 years ago. The Younger Dryas period is also known as the Big Freeze. It was a period of cold climatic conditions . and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 . years ago. Scientists believe this change in climate was caused by a . meteor impact, but another theory is that it was because of the collapse . of the North American ice sheets. During the period, forests in Scandinavia were replaced with a glacial tundra. There was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in Asia. The . drier conditions caused drought in the Levant, known as the region of . Syria or the Eastern Mediterranean, which led inhabitants to . agriculture. The change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation. The deposits include magnetic grains with iridium, magnetic microspherules (microscopic spherical particles), charcoal, soot, carbon spherules (small spheres), glass-like carbon containing nanodiamonds and fullerenes (molecules made entirely of carbon) with extraterrestrial helium, all said to result from a comet or other cosmic event hitting the Earth. Meltzer and his colleagues tested that hypothesis by investigating the existing rock layers (known as stratigraphy) and chronological data sets reported in the published scientific literature to determine if these markers dated to the onset of the Younger Dryas. They sorted the 29 sites by the availability of radiometric or numeric ages and then the type of age control, if available, and whether the age control is secure. The researchers found that three sites lack absolute age control: at Chobot, Alberta, the three Clovis points found lack stratigraphic context, and the majority of other diagnostic artifacts are younger than Clovis by thousands of years. At Morley, Alberta, ridges are assumed without evidence to be chronologically correlated with Ice Age hills 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) away, while at Paw Paw Cove, Maryland, horizontal integrity of the Clovis artifacts found is compromised, according to that site's principal archaeologist. The remaining 26 sites have radiometric or other potential numeric ages, but only three date to the Younger Dryas boundary layer. At Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico (pictured) Meltzer and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic-impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the Younger Dryas onset, suggesting the cosmic-impact theory is wrong . At eight of the sites, the ages are unrelated to the supposed Younger Dryas boundary layer, as for example at Gainey, Michigan, where extensive mixing of artifacts amongst the rock layers found at the site makes it impossible to know their position to the supposed Younger Dryas boundary layer. Where direct dating did occur, it was some time after the 16th century AD according to the researchers. At Wally's Beach, Alberta, a radiocarbon age of 10,980 purportedly dates extraterrestrial impact markers from sediment in the skull of an extinct horse. In actuality, the study claims the date is from an extinct musk ox, and the fossil yielding the supposed impact markers was not dated, nor is there evidence to suggest that the fossils from Wally's Beach are all of the same age or date to the Younger Dryas onset. At nearly a dozen other sites, the authors report, the chronological results are neither reliable nor valid as a result of significant statistical flaws in the analysis, the omission of ages from the models, and the disregard of statistical uncertainty that accompanies all radiometric dates. For example, at Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico, Meltzer and his team used the data of previous researchers but returned a different equation that put the cosmic-impact markers at a depth well above that which would mark the Younger Dryas onset. The authors go on to point out that inferences about the ages of supposed Younger Dryas boundary layers are unsupported by replication in more cases than not.","Scientists have previously suggested a comet hit Earth 12,800 years ago .
Evidence for this comes from 29 different sites across North America .
But new research suggests the dating methods used were flawed .
Study suggests the impact sites are too old or young to be from a comet .
Researchers conclude cooling period after Ice Age has another origin ."

"Mother-of-two Emma Taylor, from Henley-on-Thames, appeared on television to defend her right to take breastfeeding selfies, as they were named one of 2015's biggest parenting trends by parenting site Netmums. Like other brelfie advocates such as Ellie Gordon, founder of the Facebook group 'Pump in Public', Emma admitted to regularly posting pictures when she was breastfeeding her daughter, now five, and currently uploads images of herself feeding her six-month-old son. Yet a growing movement is forming among mothers against the 'brelfie' despite 88 per cent of mothers saying social media sites are wrong to delete the intimate shots. Scroll down for video . Breastfeeding selfies are on the rise in 2015, as demonstrated by mother-of-four Ellie Gordon, 34, from Hertford, pictured feeding her 14-week-old daughter Bluebelle Beatrice . 'Why not share a brelfie?' Emma told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning today. 'You can't see a lot as the baby is in the way. This morning I saw a half naked women with her legs akimbo in the newspaper so if that's okay, why isn't showing the top of my skin on my chest?' She added that breflies are a way for women to celebrate their bodies and what they can do. However, Angela Epstein, 46, from Manchester, disagreed. She appeared on the ITV show alongside Emma to argue the case against brelfies. She said: ‘This whole cult of the breflie smacks of naked exhibitionism.’ While Angela said she supports breastfeeding, she thinks the trend for sharing pictures is 'attention-seeking and using kids as a commodity, parading them around saying ""isn't it great I can breastfeed"" and rubbing it in the face of women who can't.' Mothers Emma Taylor, right, and Angela Epstein appeared on today's This Morning to debate the new trend for posting breastfeeding selfies aka 'brelfies' Emma, left, has posted pictures of herself breastfeeding online and says it celebrates what women's bodies can do. But Angela, right, think it should remain a private, bonding moment between mother and baby . The growing trend has seen one in five breastfeeding mothers (19 per cent) already take their own brelfie, with a further six per cent of new mothers claiming they plan to. They are following the lead of celebrities such as Miranda Kerr, Gisele Bundchen and Gwen Stefani who have all posted their own brelfies online. The craze was identified as part of the annual Netmums' Parenting Trends Report which predicts the ten key parenting fashions for the forthcoming year. But Angela argued on the programme, that  many women who share brelfies are 'deliberately militant in their approach' as if they are saying 'I can breastfeed and if you don't like seeing it, that's your problem'. Angela believes mothers should not be 'flaunting' themselves online breastfeeding because 'certain things are private, I endorse breastfeeding but it's an intimate, private, bonding moment, just you and your baby.' But Angela's views weren't supported by all This Morning viewers as many sent their own brelfies into the show. A poll carried out by the programme found that 68.53 per cent would post a brelfie online. Ellie, pictured feeding her daughter, has set up a Facebook page so other mothers can share their pictures and experiences of breastfeeding and gain support and advice . Another advocate of the trend is mother-of-four Ellie Gordon, 34, from Hertford, who has a 14-week-old daughter Bluebelle Beatrice as well as Lily-Grace, nine, Ronnie, seven, and Reuben, five. She's so passionate about the subject she has even set up her own Facebook group 'Pump In Public' to support breastfeeding mothers. Other parenting fads of 2015 identified by Netmums include post-baby body nude photoshoots, where women book a professional photographer to capture their figures just days after giving birth. The report revealed one in seven new mothers now think the photoshoots are a positive idea, claiming stretch marks and baby weight ‘celebrated them becoming a mum’. But one in 12 mums said they would only have a post-pregnancy photoshoot if they got their bodies back into shape. Pregnancy Test ‘Pee Parties’ - which see women trying to fall pregnant take their pregnancy test with a group of friends or family members - are also on the rise. Popular in America where the parties are often filmed for YouTube, the trend is starting to take off in the UK with one in 25 mums saying they had held one and a further 14 per cent admitting they would consider it. Miranda Kerr shared this picture of her breastfeeding son Flynn after he was born in 2011, now more new mothers are following suit . Gwen Stefani shared this picture on Instagram of herself breastfeeding her five-month-old son Apollo during a roadside stop in Switzerland in July 2014 . Gisele Bundchen posted this photo of herself breastfeeding her daughter as she had her hair and makeup done before a photo shoot in 2013 . Jaime King  shared this intimate photo of her breastfeeding eight-month-old son James in 2014 . Despite improving economic conditions, 'Family No-Spend Days' are one of the year's most popular trends. Over two thirds (68 per cent) of families now follow the craze which bans spending in any form for one day a week or each month. While 29 per cent of mums quizzed said they only held the days when money was tight, for 39 per cent of families they are a regular occurrence to teach children the value of money. And following the increasing use of foodbanks, Toybanks are also becoming more popular this year. The service, which offers toys to low-income and struggling families, is opening in locations around the UK with 54 per cent of parents saying they would use it if the need arose. However, one trend parents want to say goodbye to in 2015 is the Double-Barrelled First Name. Girls monikers including Georgia-May, Ellie-Rae and Lily-Rose were voted the most likely naming trend to disappear this year, with 69 per cent of parents saying they would ditch a double-barrelled name. Another American idea catching on in the UK is Baby Growth Photocards, where parents take monthly or weekly photos of their child against the same background object to show their growth. Some have even been edited into timelapse videos for YouTube, with almost half (46 per cent) of parents saying they are now keeping a regular photographic record of their child’s growth. Actress Alyssa Milano posted this picture of herself breastfeeding to Instagram in October 2014 . According to a Netmums poll, 88 per cent of mothers who say social media sites are wrong to delete breastfeeding selfies . Meanwhile after the success of smash-hit film Frozen, parents are wishing their children would 'Let It Go' – but Disney Princesses are one of the year’s most prominent trends. But possibly the most controversial trend of the year is 'Pay-ground Parties'. First highlighted in the media by a mother invoicing another parent over a no-show at a birthday party, then escalated by TV presenter Myleene Klass after she was asked to club together with other parents to buy birthday presents for two pupils at her daughters’ school, mums are feeling under pressure to pay up much more than they are comfortable with for parties and presents. Like Myleene, one in eight said they had been asked to contribute towards a bigger present for a child, but 53 per cent felt the request was 'inappropriate and cheeky'. Meanwhile one in 11 mums would now consider invoicing parents whose child did not turn up for a party they arranged. Commenting on the Annual Trends Report, Netmums spokeswoman Rachel Burrows said: 'Parents are more plugged into social media than ever before, so many of this year's trends are all about sharing. 'From pregnancy parties and baby growth photos, to posting Brelfies and post-baby body shoots, mums are openly showing some of the most intimate moments of their lives in a way that would have been impossible just a few years ago. 'While some people may see it as oversharing, it's actually very comforting to know others are going through the same situations. 'And trends like the return to retro parties, toybanks and no-spend days show mums are setting a sensible example to their children. 'Though the last few years have been tough for most families, parents are still ensuring their kids have the best childhood they can, however tight their family finances are.'","Breastfeeding selfies top new Netmums parenting trends report .

Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany and Liverpool’s flying winger Raheem Sterling are the two best value signings in the Premier League. Kompany, 28, joined City from Hamburg for £6.7million in 2008, but after firmly establishing himself as one of the best central defenders in the world, the Belgian’s transfer value has substantially increased to £29m. Liverpool’s teenage star Sterling, at the centre of an England controversy after manager Roy Hodgson revealed he was too tired to start against Estonia this week, has seen his transfer value rocket following a series of scintillating performances for the Anfield club since signing from QPR for just £500,000 in 2010 - the 19-year-old is now valued at £18m by German website transfermarkt. Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is the next best value signing in the Premier League. The Frenchman was snapped up by the Saints for a bargain £1.2m but is now worth £17.6m. Tottenham were willing to pay big money to entice him to White Hart Lane over the summer, but the Saints refused to let him go.

"Yugoslavia legend Dragan Stojkovic aims to follow his close friend Arsene Wenger from managing in Japan to taking charge in the Premier League. Stojkovic played under Arsenal's current manager at Nagoya Grampus in the nineties and went onto manage the Japanese side himself, winning their first ever J-League title in 2010. Wenger has admitted in the past he sees Stojkovic, who is currently out of work after his six-year spell in charge of Grampus ended last year, as a possible replacement at the Emirates when he eventually retires. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger shakes hands with former Nagoya Grampus boss Dragan Stojkovic in 2013 . Dragan Stojkovic, on the touchline during his time at Nagoya Grampus, aims to manage in the Premier League . 'I respect English football very much and the Premier League is an incredible league,' he told talkSPORT. 'Of course [I would like to manage in the Premier League]. Why not? I believe I have enough knowledge about modern football to be part of the development of English football. 'I have had a few meetings [with English clubs] but I am still waiting for a good offer.' Stojkovic is a Yugoslavia legend from his playing days, scoring 15 goals in 84 games, spanning over 18 years . The 49-year-old, back in his playing days, has been out of work since leaving Nagoya Grampus last year . The Serbian claims, having worked with Wenger, that he shares an almost identical footballing philosophy. 'Arsene Wenger is a friend of mine and that relationship and friendship exists from 1995,' added Stojkovic. 'If you remember how he changed Arsenal, the way they play, the style and the quality, this is the same style I used in the last six years, and Grampus became champions for the first time in their history thanks to that work. 'It is my objective to teach players to play in an attacking style and to give pleasure to the fans.'","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed a three-year deal in the summer .

"When Samir Nasri’s goal flew into the net on Sunday, the elderly couple sitting in the aisle seats in front of the media section rose quietly to their feet and hugged. Whoever you support, whichever league your club are in, no matter how much or little you have spent to be there, it still feels the same when you win. Football has changed in many ways, both in the way it is played and the way it is watched. Few football clubs embody that more than Manchester City. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini: I have changed desire to score and keep scoring . Blues sky high: Manchester City captain Kompany soars to celebrate scoring his side's second goal .

Special day: Fans storm the pitch following Man City's 2-0 victory over West Ham clinched the title . Special day: Man City fans showed their is much more to the club than just big bucks and foreign stars . The new Barclays Premier League champions are a very different club than the one flooded by money from the Middle East less than six years ago. Some things remain the same, though, and winning feels the same now as it did before  celebrations were expressed on Twitter and Facebook and before clubs had a ‘Season Finale Sponsor’, as City did here on Sunday. It was Dubai Expo 2020 if you are interested. FA chairman Greg Dyke suggested in print that the number of foreign players at City depressed him, as if the make-up of Manuel Pellegrini’s team somehow devalued the achievement. The old couple in the aisle seats yesterday are unlikely to agree. In all likelihood, they had season tickets at the old Maine Road, too. They will love their club now just as much as they did back then. Maybe even a little more. They, like many, have waited more than 40 years for their turn at the top to roll round again. A little over a decade ago they watched Andy Morrison and Kevin Horlock. These days it is Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure wearing those shirts. They have always embraced players from overseas at City, though. Georgi Kinkladze was here on Sunday, as was Shaun Goater. They are very much part of this club’s heritage. These days they just have better players with whom to share a dressing room and those  players have arrived at great cost. Thumbs up: Javi Garcia (centre) poses with Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri and some well-earned precious metal . Cheer: Manuel Pellegrini was all smiles as he was carried around the pitch by his players following the title win . Club legend: Georgi Kinkladze was back at Man City on Sunday and took to the pitch to acknowledge fans . Get in! Two City supporters celebrate on the pitch after the 2-0 win over West Ham . There will be those in the football community enjoying City’s current  tussle with UEFA over Financial Fair Play. It’s easy to label the champions as a heavy-spending club driven forwards at unnatural speed by foreign money. To tag City so clumsily, though, is to miss the point. Football clubs remain, more than anything, about the people who go to watch them and those who rushed on to the playing surface at full-time are no different, on the whole, to those who follow Barnet or Bristol Rovers or Birmingham City. Most of them will spend an inordinate amount of time watching, discussing and worrying about their team. Their team will dominate their conversations at home, at work, in the pub and on Greek Island beaches this summer. City care about their relatively small English numbers. They care about it in the boardroom and the dressing room. No club cares more about the make-up of its squad than it does about results, though. That is especially the case when the team plays football like this City one can. Pellegrini’s team have not been at their best for a while now. They have been functional rather than devastating. There is something to be said for that - just ask Liverpool - and it has been enough to get them through. They remain supremely gifted. Supremely gifted: Man City have been functional rather than devastating on their way to winning the title . On Sunday, towards the end of this one-sided game, West Ham’s Andy Carroll - a candidate for a place in England’s World Cup squad - attempted to control a ball at the far post. He failed dreadfully and the ball bounced behind the goal. Minutes later, City’s Brazilian substitute Fernandinho received a sharp pass with his back to goal. He controlled it instantly on the half volley, turned and - in the same movement - moved the ball onwards to a team-mate. It would be wrong to suggest an English player couldn’t have done that. It would also be wrong, however, to suggest players like Fernandinho, Toure and Kompany have not  contributed to the raising of standards in the Premier League. At City we can expect only that the standard will get higher over the years. The club will have some players to replace before long. Toure, for example, cannot go on at this rampaging level for ever. City’s current issue with UEFA over FFP - they have been fined £50m for breaching the regulations - will not affect their spending plans significantly over the summers to come. Forward thinking: City will soon have some players to replace as the likes of Yaya Toure can't go on forever . They are unlikely to go backwards again - as they did last season under Roberto Mancini - with Pellegrini in charge and it will be interesting now to see if their rivals can spend astutely enough to close the gap. This was a rather gentle party yesterday. Certainly it was by  the standards of 2012’s heart-stopping finale. Back then it felt like a dam was breaking. Winning still feels like winning, though, and at the end yesterday a man carried his young son away from the ground. If Dyke is depressed about the make-up of his team, that guy wasn’t. Looking at his son, he said: ‘He doesn’t know how lucky he is. He thinks this happens every year.’","Manchester City claim Premier League title with win over West Ham .

"If you're planning to go to the 2014 Annual Fall Meeting of the American Physical Society in Illinois this Saturday, you might be in for a bit of a surprise with the final talk of the day. Because that's when plasma physicist Dr John Brandenburg will present his theory that an ancient civilisation on Mars was wiped out by a nuclear attack from another alien race. In his bizarre theory, Dr Brandenburg says ancient Martians known as Cydonians and Utopians were massacred in the attack - and evidence of the genocide can still be seen today. Scroll down for video . A scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on Mars was massacred. Dr Brandenburg is giving a talk on his research tomorrow in Illinois at the American Physical Society. He says there is evidence for two nuclear explosions on Mars (image from his paper shown) Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion. 'The Martian surface is covered with a thin layer of radioactive substances including uranium, thorium and radioactive potassium - and this pattern radiates from a hot spot on Mars,' he told Fox News at the time. 'A nuclear explosion could have sent debris all around the planet.' Aside from this outlandish theory, Dr John Brandenburg has led a rather more normal, and prestigious, career. He has a PhD in Theoretical Plasma Physics from the University of California at Davis. Currently he works as a plasma physicist at Orbital Technologies in Madison Wisconsin. He has worked on a variety of propulsion technologies and previously was an independent consultant on Space Missile Defense and Directed Energy Weapons. Dr Brandenburg has authored a number of books with his latest, Death on Mars: The Discovery of a Planetary Nuclear Massacre, to be published in February 2015. But since then he has advanced his theory to the level that he now no longer thinks it was a naturally occurring explosion - but rather one planned by an intelligent alien race. According to Vice, the conclusion of his latest paper says that nuclear isotopes in the atmosphere resembling hydrogen bomb tests 'may present an example of civilisation wiped out by a nuclear attack from space.' His research centres around the 'high concentration' of Xenon-129 in the Martian atmosphere, and uranium and thorium on the surface, spotted by Nasa's Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Scientists have previously pointed about that the appearance of these elements is not surprising, as they are natural elements found everywhere. But Dr Brandenburg is adamant they are the remnants of two nuclear explosions on the surface. He will lay out his research tomorrow in his talk titled 'Evidence of Massive Thermonuclear Explosions in Mars Past, The Cydonian Hypothesis, and Fermi's Paradox'. And he is also apparently set to have a paper published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics. Dr Brandenburg says evidence for the explosions exists near two sites that apparently had life in the past, including Cydonia, the location of the famous 'face on Mars' spotted from orbit (left). However, later images showed it was just a chance alignment of shifting dust dunes (right) Back in 2011 the scientist first postulated that the red colour on Mars (pictured) could have been due to a naturally occurring thermonuclear explosion - but now he thinks it was caused by an intelligent alien race . He says Mars once had an Earth-like climate home to animal and plant life, and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient Egyptians on Earth. This is based on his analysis of two regions, one being Cydonia, where the infamous - and later discredited - 'face on Mars' was found. This, according to Dr Brandenburg, is an artefact from the ancient alien race. Here, one of the supposed nuclear explosions wiped out the civilisation at Cydonia Mensa and another, smaller one destroyed a civilisation at a region called Galaxias Chaos. 'Analysis of new images from Odyssey, MRO and Mars Express orbiters now show strong evidence of eroded archeological objects at these sites,' he writes in the abstract for his research to be presented tomorrow. 'Taken together, the data requires that the hypothesis of Mars as the site of an ancient planetary nuclear massacre, must now be considered.' Dr Brandenburg says Mars once had an Earth-like climate home to animal and plant life, and any intelligent life would have been about as advanced as the ancient Egyptians on Earth . Dr Brandenburg says his theory could explain the Fermi Paradox - namely why, if the universe is abundant with life, we haven't heard anything from anyone else yet. He warns, though, that we need to be fearful of an attack on our own planet, and should mount a manned mission to Mars to know what we're up against. 'Providentially, we are forewarned of this possible aspect of the cosmos,' he writes. 'The author therefore advocates that a human mission to Mars is mounted immediately to maximise knowledge of what occurred.' UFO expert Nigel Watson, author of the Haynes UFO Investigation Manual, told MailOnline that Dr Brandenburg is not the first to suggest Mars was 'murdered' by nuclear explosions. 'These stories and many variations of them present a view that our Solar System was the home of several nuclear battles raged between alien visitors and settlers,' he said. 'Much of the evidence is either channeled through automatic writing, psychic messages or the interpretation of ancient texts. 'Although Brandenburg's theory is on more solid ground, it still amounts to speculation based on our present day awareness of the power of nuclear weapons and our fear of its misuse. 'It is a warning that we could do the same to our own planet, and underlines the belief of many scientists that we have not detected intelligent life elsewhere in the universe because at some point civilisations will become extinct either through catastrophe or self-destruction.'","Scientist is to present his theory that ancient life on Mars was massacred .

"Charlie Nicholas was forced to apologise on Sky Sports News after he admitted he couldn’t tell the difference between Manchester City midfielders Fernandinho and Fernando because ‘they looked the same’. The presenter, 53, who made his name as a player at Arsenal, was providing the live analysis on the Premier League game between Everton and champions City at Goodison Park. And when Fernandinho netted an opener, Jeff Stelling tee’d up Nicholas to describe the action, who said: ‘Goal! Is it Fernandinho or is it Fernando? They both look the same to me.’ Charlie Nicholas apologised for the comments on Sky Sports News . Nicholas said that he couldn't tell the difference between Fernandinho (left) and Fernando (right) Fernandinho celebrates after opening the scoring for Manchester City against Everton . Age: 29 . Nationality: Brazilian . Height: 5ft 9in . Weight: 66kg . Position: Centre midfield . Age: 27 . Nationality: Brazilian . Height: 6ft . Weight: 74kg . Position: Centre midfield . The two players are both Brazilian, and started in central midfield during the 1-1 draw as Steven Naismith stole in to cancel out Fernandinho’s flicked header. Nicholas’ analysis lead to criticism on social media and when the 3pm games finished on Saturday and the dust settled at Sky Sports, Stelling apologised to viewers and the Scot explained his actions. ‘Jeff, they both physically look the same and if sometimes you don’t catch the number, you actually don’t quite know what one is what,’ he said. Fernandinho, 29, is a Brazil international and was a £34million signing from Shakhtar in 2013, while Fernando, 27, has never been capped for his country and was brought in for £12m from Porto last summer. According to the Manchester Evening News, City team-mates had taken to calling the pair ‘Dinho’ and ‘Nando’. Steven Naismith beat Joe Hart to the ball to head in Leighton Baines' free-kick . The equaliser from forward Naismith on Saturday saw Manchester City lose ground on league leaders Chelsea . Fernandinho, celebrating with Sergio Aguero, put Manchester City in front at Goodison Park n Saturday . The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner . And in August, Fernandinho admitted that he had never met Fernando before he arrived in Manchester. He said: ‘I didn’t know him before, but when he signed for City, I texted him and said ‘Welcome to Man City and I am here to help you. And he said ‘I need you to help me!’ ‘In the last two weeks we have worked and lived together. He is a good guy. He is a good professional, good player. And I’m sure he will be a good player for City. ‘We have done things socially. I tell him to try and enjoy the days off, we have spent some time together but also with the other players – we like go to the cinema or do something with the kids. ‘When he joined, I texted him and told him to try and find a house near me so it will make life easier for him and me as well.

"A couple were jailed yesterday for neglecting a boy of 12 so badly he went blind in one eye. Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick, both 34, kept the youngster and his sister, two, in a fly-infested house littered with nappies and old food. The boy lost sight in his left eye from cataracts because they failed to take him for hospital appointments that could have saved his sight. Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick, both 34, were jailed for a total of five years at Teesside Crown Court for child neglect after their son went blind in one eye . The boy, 12, and his half-sister, two, were kept in filthy conditions. The parents failed to take the boy to hospital appointments that could have saved his sight, and failed to treat his arthritis so he was left with a limp . He also became increasingly crippled with a form of juvenile arthritis until his doctors called in social services chiefs so they could give him the treatment he so desperately needed. When social workers went to the house in Thornaby, Stockton-on-Tees in August last year the couple would not let them inside. They returned with the police who were shocked by what they found, prosecutor David Crook told Teesside Crown Court. The couple, who were living on benefits, were unkempt and the boy said that he could not see out of one eye, which had turned white from a cataract. They claimed they were too busy to notice the boy’s plight. The judge was shown photographs that showed the house in an ‘appalling’ state of filth and mess. The staircase was littered with trodden-in food and bin bags stuffed with dirty nappies. The kitchen was infested with flies, and upstairs had a squalid toilet and a bath that was filled with cold, dirty water. One bedroom had been used as a toilet, and the children’s beds had no covers and filthy mattresses – which had turned damp and mouldy in the girl’s cot. By contrast, the couple’s bedroom was relatively tidy – although they said that they slept downstairs. The court heard that one bedroom was used as a toilet while the bathroom was strewn with litter and the toilet and sink were filthy . Social services were alerted to the couple by doctors who became concerned for the boy's health. When police forced their way into the house they found Hendry and Dick trying to clean up . The children were immediately taken into care. The boy now lives with his natural father, and the girl, who was fathered by Dick, is being put up for adoption. Lawyers for the couple said they were unlikely to have responsibility for any children again. Peter Wishlade, defending Hendry, said she ‘let everything slip’ because she claimed to be depressed. He said: ‘Other than that, I don’t know how this has happened, I cannot give any explanation.’ Jim Withyman, defending Dick, said he was a man who could not even take care of his own personal hygiene. He added: ‘There is a deficiency in him by allowing his children to live in such appalling conditions.’ Judge Howard Crowson, who earlier lifted court restrictions that would have made naming the couple impossible, told them: ‘The conditions we have seen in the photographs are appalling. ‘I feel this was inadequacy rather than a deliberate attempt to cause harm to either child.’ Hendry was jailed for two-and-a-half years and Dick for two years and two months after they admitted two charges of child neglect. The court heard that the parents' bedroom was kept in a better condition than the rest of the house (pictured) though they claimed they never slept there . Officers found bin bags strewn around the house filled with rotting food and used nappies . The court heard that the little girl's mattress was covered with mould while her room was also filthy . The kitchen was filled with flies (left) while the upstairs landing was covered with bin bags and dirty clothes . The bath tub was filled with cold, dirty water, while the sink was filled with rubbish and the toilet was unclean . The court was told that Hendry claimed she had neglected the children because she was depressed, but that there was no medical evidence to back this up .","Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick, both 34, jailed for keeping children in squalor .

"With coloured banners, saluting soldiers and the national anthem playing loud and clear, China threw a birthday party yesterday for its newest city - on a tiny island in the very middle of the disputed South China Sea. Sansha City is on Yongxing Island, less than a square mile in size and not big enough to accommodate its own airstrip - which extends into the sea either side. It has a small permanent population of fishermen - the rest of its 1,000 residents are police, soldiers and government workers who work on the island in 'tours of duty'. Scroll down for video . Establishment ceremony: Soldiers raise the national flag during a party introducing Sansha City on the island of Yongxing yesterday . There are few 'civilian' buildings - a supermarket here, a hospital there - and fresh water has to be shipped in from China's southernmost province in a 13-hour supply mission. But China is clearly proud of its new addition, and made a point that the world knew of its arrival. Unlike most birthday parties, though, the neighbours were not invited. That is because Sansha City represents China's expanding toehold in the world's most disputed waters, portions of which are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan. Flying high: The Chinese flag flutters above a government building in Sansha City. It is one of the few buildings on the island, which is less than a square mile . Disputed region: The tiny Yongxing Island, which is too small to accommodate its own runway, lies around 220 miles from mainland China in the middle of the South China Sea . Beijing has created the city administration to oversee hundreds of thousands of square miles of water where it wants to strengthen its control. The Philippines said it does not recognise the city or its jurisdiction, and Vietnam said China's actions violated international law. The U.S. has also voiced its concern over 'unilateral moves' in the South China Sea, where it says collective diplomacy is needed to resolve competing claims. Yongxing Island, formerly Woody Island, is 220 miles southeast from China's tropical Hainan Island. Proud moment: Fu Zhuang, the new mayor of Sansha City, will prteside over a band of local fishermen and a largely transient population of soldiers and government workers . Even the name of the island is disputed among its neighbours - Vietnam refers to it as Phu Lam Island. China approved Sansha City to 'consolidate administration' over the Paracel island chain, of which Yongxing is a part, and the nearby Spratly island chain and the Macclesfield Bank - a large, completely submerged atoll that boasts rich fishing grounds that is also claimed by Taiwan and the Philippines. Vietnam and China both claim the Paracels, and both would have to slug it out with the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan to claim all or parts of the Spratlys. China claims virtually the entire South China Sea and its island groups, and its disputes occasionally erupt into open confrontation. And it's not just for the good fishing. The sea is one of the world's busiest commercial shipping lanes, and sits on a potential mother load of oil and gas deposits. Official broadcaster China Central Television aired Tuesday morning's formal establishment ceremony live from Sansha, with speeches from the new mayor and other officials. Plaques for the Sansha Municipal Government and the Sansha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China were unveiled on a white-columned government building. Mayor Xiao Jie trumpeted Sansha's important role in protecting China's sovereignty. He said the designation of Sansha as a new city was 'a wise decision made by the party and the government of China to protect the sovereign rights of China, and to strengthen the protection and the development of natural resources'. The official Xinhua News Agency reported earlier that Sansha's jurisdiction covers just five square miles of land, including other islands and atolls in the South China Sea around Yongxing. Crucially, the jurisdiction also covers more than 750,000 square miles of surrounding waters. A few buildings... and little else: There are few 'civilian' buildings - a supermarket here, a hospital there - and fresh water has to be shipped in from China's southernmost province in a 13-hour supply mission . Harsh and isolated: A former army officer overseeing the island before Sansha City was established described it as 'pretty simple', hot and humid with no fresh water . Communications array: Despite the isolation, it is clear that China sees the strategic importance of Yongxing - a fact that has not been lost on neighbours Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan . Angry neighbours: Protesters hold banners during an anti-China protest at the weekend. The banner reads, 'Paracels and Spratlys belong to Vietnam' - a reference to the island chains of which Yongxing is a part . Yongxing translates to 'eternal prosperity', and Sansha means 'three sandbanks' - an apparent reference to the Chinese names for the disputed island chains and atoll - West, South and Middle Banks (or Xisha, Nansha and Zhongsha). A description from a former People's Liberation Army officer who was among the officials overseeing the island before Sansha was established paints a picture of a harsh and isolated post where officials rotate staffing for a month at a time. Tan Xiankun, director of the office in Hainan overseeing Xisha and other South China Sea territories, said: 'The living conditions are pretty simple. It's very humid and hot, more than 30 degrees, and there's salt everywhere. There's no fresh water, except for what's shipped in and what's collected from rain water.' Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said Manila had expressed its concern and registered a strong protest with Beijing over the decision to set up a military garrison on Yongxing. He said: 'The Philippines does not recognise the Sansha City and the extent of its jurisdiction, and considers recent measures taken by China as unacceptable. Vietnam's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Luong Thanh Nghi, said Vietnam had protested to the Chinese foreign ministry as well. A statement said: 'China's establishment of the so-called Sansha City violated international law, seriously violating Vietnam sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagos.' And U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said: 'We remain concerned should there be any unilateral moves of this kind that would seem to prejudge an issue that we have said repeatedly can only be solved by negotiations, by dialogue and by a collaborative diplomatic process among all the claimants.' As China was celebrating its new city, the International Crisis Group think tank released a report saying that the south China Sea was becoming an arena that could easily see armed conflict. Its report stated: 'South East Asian claimants, with Vietnam and the Philippines in the forefront, are now more forcefully defending their claims - and enlisting outside allies - with considerable energy.' The 'outside allies' is a clear reference to Washington's move to influence the Asian balance of power by supporting China's neighbours. The report ominously concluded that 'tensions in the South China Sea could all too easily be driven to irreversible levels'. Stuck in the middle: The Paracel Islands, of which Yongxing is a part, lie between Vietnam, China, Taiwan and the Philippines in the South China Sea .","Sansha City has jurisdiction over 750,000 miles of surrounding waters .

"The parents of a university polo player who was found dead at a doctor's house after a night out have paid tribute to their 'kind and caring' son. James Steen, 23, a trained huntsman, had been visiting friends at the house in Rugby, Warwickshire, after breaking up from university for the summer holidays. It is believed he had been on a night out and had returned to the property - only to be discovered dead hours later. Police have arrested three men on suspicion of murder - but the cause of Mr Steen's death is still unknown and is still being treated as unexplained. His parents - whose names have not been released by Warwickshire Police - have today released a statement which said: 'We have lost our darling son. Words simply can not convey the pain we are currently experiencing. Visit: James Steen, 23, (left) had been on a night out friends in Rugby, Warwickshire. He was found dead at the house of a doctor in the early hours of Sunday morning . Investigation: Three men have been arrested on suspicion of murdering trained huntsman James Steen (right). Neighbours said they heard banging inside the house in Rugby, Warwickshire shortly after midnight on Sunday . 'James enriched our lives, and the lives of others, in so many ways. 'He . was a kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a . generous spirit. He touched everyone he met with his positivity and his . sense of humour. 'We . are devastated by James’ untimely death, but we are comforted by . knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family, friends and . university colleagues. 'We are immensely proud of our son, and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth. 'As we come to terms with our loss, we would ask the media to respect our need for privacy at this difficult time.' The three local men were interviewed over the weekend and have since been bailed until September while investigations continue. Mr Steen, from Northern Ireland, was a keen skier, studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University and was President of the Polo Society. His close friend Steven Williams posted a picture of him on Facebook, with the message: ‘To a really fantastic friend, who only ever treated me with absolute kindness. An utter and complete gentleman. RIP James, I can’t believe this and would do anything to see you again.’ A friend said she had been ‘saddened’ to hear of his sudden death. Active: James Steen, from Northern Ireland, was a keen skier and had been studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University. He was also president of the university's polo society . She posted on the group’s Facebook: ‘James was a stalwart of the Polo Club from his earliest days at both Northumbria and Newcastle, where he latterly became Secretary then President. ‘In developing his game to become a useful and dependable team member, James became a role model to others. He was an outgoing and enthusiastic member of the team in all senses.’ She said he supported the club and its players to his utmost. She added: ‘He put his whole being into the running of the club, and I hope that in coming years we can continue to follow in his footsteps and make him proud. We will all miss James.’ Warwickshire Police arrested three men aged 31, 29, and 25 after an ambulance was called to the property on Saturday at 6am. The suspects have all now been released on bail and police say they are treating the death as ‘unexplained’. The cause of his death is not yet known. Background: James Steen, who had been living in Newcastle, was originally from Poyntzpass in Northern Ireland. His half-brother, Reverend Ivan Steen, is minister at Windsor Presbyterian Church in south Belfast . A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘A couple in their 30s live there and they went out with friends on Friday night. I just heard some banging about at around 12.45am.’ They said one of them was a doctor. A tribute was paid to Mr Steen by the university. Dr Liviu Popoviciu, on behalf of the university's school of arts and cultures, said: ‘This really sad news has come as an awful shock. ‘James was an extremely bright and ambitious young man... He was a pleasure to teach, always polite to staff and fellow students, and committed to his studies on the degree programme.' ‘We will remember him for his hard work, impressive academic ability and, most of all, his kindness to all. ‘Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.’ Mystery: James Steen's death at the home of a doctor in Rugby, Warwickshire in the early hours of Sunday morning is currently being treated as 'unexplained' by the police . Mr Steen, who had been living in Newcastle, was from Poyntzpass and his half-brother, Rev Ivan Steen, was the minister at Windsor Presbyterian Church in south Belfast. A neighbour of Mr Steen's family home in Northern Ireland said: 'The family is very, very upset, they can't believe it, can't take it in. 'They're not able to talk because it's just too hard to take in.' A spokeswoman for the force said: ‘Shortly after 6am on Saturday the Ambulance Service alerted police to the death of James Steen, a 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland, at a home in Wood Street. ‘His death is currently being treated as unexplained but as part of police enquiries three local men, aged 31, 29 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday morning.

"If anyone doubted the need for Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to splash out £25 million on Wilfried Bony, he would be happy to show them the opening 45 minutes at Goodison Park as exhibit A. Pellegrini was in tetchy mood despite watching his side stretch their unbeaten run to 14 games, and it had nothing to do with midfielder Frank Lampard and his ‘loan’ saga. City dominated Everton, particularly in the first half, and yet register just two efforts on target. When the home side were vulnerable, Stevan Jovetic and Jesus Navas missed the target horribly after being set up by David Silva. And they were not the only culprits.

City fans were glad to see Sergio Aguero reappear as a sub after his absence with a knee injury, and Edin Dzeko will also be back soon. But if Bony had played instead of Jovetic, City would surely have gained an important win to stay level on points with Chelsea at the top, rather than fall two points behind. Swansea want a lot of money for their Ivorian striker but Pellegrini would like his bosses to pay up. ‘We had big chances to score in the first half, but if you don’t score you don’t win,’ said the stony-faced City boss. ‘It’s our own fault. We pressed well, we created chances, but we finished in the wrong way. ‘Every team will drop points from now until the end of the season. We never thought this was an easy game and it is always difficult at Everton. Maybe it was a good draw but I can not forget about the first half, we had too many clear opportunities.’ City’s lack of accuracy did not seem to matter when Fernandinho headed in from close range after Silva’s shot had been parried by keeper Joel Robles. But Everton, belying a side that had lost their last four league games, deservedly levelled when Steven Naismith got in ahead of City skipper Joe Hart to head in a Leighton Baines free-kick. It was a 45th Premier League assist for Baines, a new record for a defender, and confirmed Naismith’s reputation as a scorer against the top teams. He has now netted against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and City. Spanish playmaker David Silva run at the Everton defense during the Premier League game on Saturday afternoon .

The rain swept down on Goodison Park during a dark January day on Merseyside . ‘It was an old-fashioned game,’ said Everton boss Roberto Martinez, after a match played in high winds and heavy rain. ‘We allowed Manchester City too much space in the first half but showed a lot of character and grit after we went behind.’ By the end, nobody could have knocked Everton for gaining a point. The better chances fell to them, mainly because Romelu Lukaku made £32 m defender Eliaquim Mangala look like a park player. Lukaku sprinted past Mangala in the first-half and forced a wonderful one-handed save from Hart, and Mangala later climbed all over Phil Jagielka as they contested a corner. ‘I’ve seen them given,’ said Martinez. Despite City’s recent form, the club had suffered a torrid week after having to admit they had misled people over the terms of Lampard’s spell at the club. It seems the former England midfielder had signed a 12-month contract with City even though it was believed he was on loan from Sheik Mansour’s other club in the MLS, New York. Here, though, it was Silva who set up the chances, only for his team-mates to miss. Jovetic, most vulnerable to Bony’s arrival, fired high over Robles’ goal after an incisive pass from his Spanish team-mate put him through. Navas did not do much better, scuffing an untidy finish wide from eight yards. Jagielka then had to stretch to block a Silva shot and after Jovetic had done the difficult work by dribbling past Mo Besic, he failed to convert the finish. Samir Nasri then took a heavy touch when put through by Silva, and even Silva did the same when set up by Navas. Stevan Jovetc had a good chance to put City in front in the first half as he looked to shine in Sergio Aguero's absence . Romelu Lukaku was denied by a Joe Hart's legs when he raced through down the right in the first half . Three City players (Fernandinho, Jesus Navas and Pablo Zabaleta) attempt to track down Ross Barkley . Everton were all at sea, with Aiden McGeady given catcalls from home fans, but whenever Lukaku got one-on-one with Mangala, Everton posed a real threat. The Belgian was denied at the near post by Hart ,with Seamus Coleman hitting the bar on the rebound. Yet Aguero’s introduction — unsurprisingly replacing Jovetic — seemed to inspire Everton. They had a goal disallowed when Jagielka tapped in after an offside Naismith had challenged Hart. But City then scored in a move started with some brilliant defensive work from Pablo Zabaleta. City burst up the right-hand side and when Nasri switched the ball inside to Silva, the Spaniard had a shot that looped up from Robles into the path of Fernandinho who headed in the 74th minute. Yet Everton showed tremendous character and bounced back to level just four minutes later. Once again, it was the left foot of Baines that created the danger. He curled in a free-kick following a foul by Zabaleta and Naismith timed his run to perfection to get in front of the City defence and ahead of Hart to head in before the England goalkeeper could punch the ball away. Pellegrini sent on Lampard for the final eight minutes and he got some pantomime boos from an increasingly involved Goodison crowd. This time, though, there was no fairy-tale ending for him, or City.

"Squatters refusing to leave a Palm Springs apartment at the centre of an Airbnb 'horror story' have complained THEY are the ones being harassed. Hiding his face with a hoodie and scarf, a man who claimed to be the brother of squatter Maksym Pashanin answered the door of the home in a gated community in Palm Springs. Videogame programmer Maksym is currently locked in a legal battle with Airbnb host Cory Tschogl, 39, who initially agreed to rent him her property for 44 days from May 25 to July 8. But now he refuses to leave. Hooded: A man claiming to be the brother of Airbnb renter Maksym Pashanin answers the door to San Bernadino County process server Sean Dacy - who left without handing over the eviction notice . 'Horror story': Pashanin is locked in the legal battle that could last for months and cost $5,000 because under California law he cannot just be kicked out for not paying his rent or overstaying his welcome . What Cory didn't realise is that under Californian law once someone has rented a property for more than 30 days they are treated as a tenant on a month-by-month lease. To get him out she now has to go through a legal process that could take between three and six months and cost between $3,000 and $5,000. In that time Maksym and his brother can continue to live rent-free. And the brothers don't seem to be giving up easily. San Bernadino County process server Sean Dacy arrived yesterday to serve Maksym with an eviction notice. Dacy couldn't serve the papers because he has to hand them to Maksym personally but the man answering the door claimed to be his brother. Instead, the man complained to Dacy: 'I can’t [take the scarf off] because these guys [the press] have been harassing me all day. I can’t even get to MY secure mailbox.' Dacy wasn't convinced. 'If he’s covering his face, that's probably him,’ he said as he walked away. After paying his initial 30 days rent, Maksym has not made any further payments, and ignored repeated requests to vacate the property by both Airbnb and Cory. Shortly after moving into the home, located on the Western side of the upmarket desert community, Maksym told Cory his brother had fallen ill from drinking the tap water and was now suffering a stomach ulcer. He demanded a refund. Cory, who lives in San Francisco and works as a therapist for blind people, was also met with an angry response when she threatened to cut off the utilities. Maksym texted her: 'Hi Cory, this is Maksym. I have consulted my attorney. As I said multiple times I am LEGALLY occupying the domicile. My nature of work from home is dependent on electricity, and my income while working averages $1,000 to $7,000 per day, involving over 2000 customers in the US alone. IF THE ELECTRICITY GETS CUT OFF I WILL BE LOSING MONEY EVERY DAY. 'I am pressing charges for blackmail and damages caused by your negligence and misconduct, including $3,800 PID Espresso machine as well as medical bills for my brother’s hospital visit after he got sick here drinking unfiltered tap water (ulcer). 'Not only what you do is illegal, it is also discriminatory in nature and had (sic) cause me and my brother a lot of stress and suffering.' Cory told the San Francisco Chronicle that the episode has been a 'horror story'. She bought the one-bedroom condo 18 months ago and she charged around $450 a week to renters. Squatter: Maksym Pashanin (seen here promoting his videogame) first complained to Cory that his brother had fallen ill from the water. Then when she threatened to turn off the utilities he said he had contacted a lawyer . When it became clear that Maksym was turning into a nightmare tenant Cory complained to Airbnb, but was angry at the response from the company. 'They were almost absent,' she said. 'There was no phone number or direct contact e-mail. I got e-mail responses only every 24 to 48 hours.' Airbnb eventually paid her the two weeks' missing rent and offered to pay for Maksym, who had a 'verified ID' with Airbnb saying he is from Austin, Texas, to stay at a hotel for 30 days. But he never answered emails and his phone was disconnected. Airbnb has since apologised and spokesman Nick Papas said: . 'Officials from our team have contacted this host and she has been paid . the full cost of the reservation and we're working with her to provide . additional legal support as we move forward. 'We're . also reviewing our procedures and making changes to our platform to . give hosts more information about long-term reservations.' Maksym was identified by KESQ.COM as a videogame programmer who created a computer game called Confederate Express. Maksym used kickstarter to raise $40,000 to fund the game but after eight months he has delivered nothing beyond a demo. KESQ said Maksym has claimed that the game will be released, but has said he has made some bad business decisions. The case echoes that of 'nightmare nanny' Diane Stretton, who moved in to work for Marcella Bracamonte and her family in Upland, California, earlier this year but quickly gave up all duties, and refused to leave despite being fired. Apology: Airbnb came under fire from the condo's . owner Cory Tschogl for not helping her quickly enough at first. The . firm has now apologised, paid her rent she was due and offered to help . with the legal fees involved . Mrs Bracamonte, 31, and her husband, Ralph, hired Stretton on March 4 using Craigslist to help with their three children, ages 11, four and one, but Stretton quickly stopped doing any work, claiming she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She also reportedly threatened to sue the family for wrongful dismissal and abuse of the elderly. Although the police were contacted they said there was nothing they could do, as it was a civil matter. After negotiations with the family she was thought to have left at the beginning of July. Attorney Robert Spitz told ABC News that the landlord tenant law in California is very specific in terms of eviction processes. 'If the guy's a deadbeat, what does he care? He paid one month and he gets three months,' Spitz added.","Cory Tschogl, 39, locked in 'horror story' after squatter who rented her Palm Springs home is refusing to leave .

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the atmosphere in the hotel's grand ballroom was so rough that one male attendee 'passed out' at his table. On Sunday, Vanity Fair claimed that the air conditioning at the hotel had been entirely shut down, ruining celebrities' expertly made-up faces and hair. However, the hotel later announced the system had been 'fully operational' and they had not been alerted to 'any issues with the temperature' by guests. Regardless, the combination of hundreds of people in one room and the array of harsh stage lights apparently led to a steamy atmosphere. Oprah Winfrey was seen wearing smudged eyeliner several hours into the evening, while a bearded Matthew McConaughey reportedly removed his suit jacket during the star-studded event.

"Mind control has reached new heights after a group of pilots were successfully able to fly a plane using nothing but their thoughts.

Scroll down for video . Mind control has reached new heights after a group of pilots were able to successfully fly a plane using nothing but their thoughts. German scientists showed how seven pilots – some with no previous experience of flying – used mind control to fly with ‘astonishing accuracy' Under the EU-funded project ‘Brainflight’ project, scientists hooked participants up to a cap containing dozens of electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. Researchers at the Technical University of Munich and the Technical University of Berlin then sat them down in a flight simulator and told them to steer the plane using just their thoughts . The cap was able to read the electrical signals from their brains and a specially-formulated algorithm then converted those signals into computer commands. In a simulation, several of the pilots managed the landing approach under poor visibility, while one was able to land a few metres from the runway’s central line. However, one problem with the system is lack of feedback . Seven people underwent the experiment and all were able to use mind control to control the plane well enough to meet some of the criteria for getting a pilot's license. The human brain is made up of billions of active neurons that have around 105,600 miles (170,000 km) of combined length. Every time you have a thought, your brain produces weak but distinct electrical signals corresponding to it. The electrical impulse is generated by the chemical reaction between neurons, which can be measured. Recording and deciphering those signals is called electroencephalography (EEG), and it has been medically possible since 1924. ‘A long-term vision of the project is to make flying accessible to more people,’ said aerospace engineer Tim Fricke, who heads the project at the Technical University of Munich. ‘With brain control, flying, in itself, could become easier. This would reduce the work load of pilots and thereby increase safety. ‘In addition, pilots would have more freedom of movement to manage other manual tasks in the cockpit.’ Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons, around 105,600 miles (170,000 km) of combined axon length. When these neurons interact, the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse, which can be measured using EEG. One of the problems with the system is lack of feedback. Normally, pilots feel resistance in steering and have to exert significant force when the loads on the aircraft become too large. Under the EU-funded project ‘Brainflight’ project, scientists hooked participants up to a cap containing dozens of electroencephalography  electrodes (left). The right image shows the computer display used in the simulation to help the pilots guide the plane to safety . This feedback is missing when using brain control. The researchers are now hoping to find alternative methods to simulate the process. But this isn’t the first time mind control has been used to fly an object. Last year a remote controlled helicopter was flown through a series of hoops using the power of the human mind. The feat was achieved by U.S. researchers who are hoping to develop future robots that can help restore the independence of paralysed victims and those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders. According to Professor Bin He, from the University of Minnesota, the achievement in 2013 was the first time that humans have been able to control the flight of flying robots using just their thoughts. ‘A long-term vision of the project is to make flying accessible to more people,’ said aerospace engineer Tim Fricke, who heads the project at the Technical University of Munich.‘With brain control, flying, in itself, could become easier.

"Canadian researchers have found that high-fructose corn syrup can cause behavioral reactions in rats 'similar to those produced by drugs of abuse, such as cocaine'. Professor Francesco Leri of the University of Guelph, who carried out the research, said it suggested there was an addictive quality to foods that contain high levels of high-fructose corn syrup which could explain, at least partly, the current global obesity epidemic. During the experiment, rats were fed foods containing varying levels of high-fructose corn syrup. They were then given access to a lever which controlled how much syrup they received. The more concentrated the syrup, the harder the rats worked to obtain it. Sweet temptation: New research has found that high-fructose corn syrup has similar effects on the brain as addictive drugs like cocaine . 'We have evidence in laboratory animals of a shared vulnerability to . develop preferences for sweet foods and for cocaine,' said Professor Leri, an addiction expert. 'There is now convincing neurobiological and behavioural evidence indicating that addiction to food is possible.' Professor Leri believes vulnerability to addiction could explain why some people are obese and some aren't, despite the widespread availability of high-fructose corn syrup. Ubiquitous: Corn products can be found in every element of a fast food meal, and high-fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients in everything from burger buns and sauces to soft drinks . The new findings are part of a growing field of investigation into the effects of high fructose corn syrup, which has been blamed for everything from the obesity epidemic to diabetes and liver disease. Research from Princeton University in 2010 found that rats fed on a sugary diet became nervous and anxious when the sugar was removed. They were thrown into a state of anxiety similar to the kind of stress that people feel during withdrawal from drugs like nicotine and even morphine. Professor Bart Hoebel and his team in the Department of Psychology and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute have been studying signs of sugar addiction in rats for years. Fat rats: Recent research shows that high-fructose corn syrup is highly addictive to rats . 'If bingeing on sugar is really a form of addiction, there should be long-lasting effects in the brains of sugar addicts,' Hoebel said. 'Craving and relapse are critical components of addiction, and we have been able to demonstrate these behaviors in sugar-bingeing rats in a number of ways.' The process: The USDA says that processed foods are the main source sugar in our diets - but that many food producers are reluctant to reveal just how much high-fructose corn syrup their products contain . Journalist and author Michael Pollan says that cheap industrial corn is such a huge crop in America that you're likely to find it in every section of the supermarket, not to mention every item in a fast food meal. 'Corn is the sweetener in the soda. It's in the corn-fed beef Big Mac patty, and in the high-fructose syrup in the bun, and in the secret sauce,' wrote Pollan in the New York Times Magazine. High fructose corn syrup was discovered in the 1950s, but it wasn't until the '70s that it became widely used. Excess: The U.S. government subsidizes corn farms - meaning there's huge quantities of excess corn being produced which is used for everything from cattle feed to ethanol to the addictive high-fructose corn syrup . The gloopy syrup is made from surplus corn crops, and can be found in sweet foods such as donuts, chocolate bars and soda. The danger lies in the places you don't expect to find it: loaves of bread, pizza, meat, savory snacks and salad dressing. Former head of the FDA David Kessler believes that sugar is extremely addictive, just like cigarettes or alcohol. He told the Guardian in 2012 that eating sugar it is 'highly pleasurable. It gives you this momentary bliss. When you're eating food that is highly hedonic, it sort of takes over your brain.' We all know that sweet confectionery and soft drinks are full of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), but could we be feeding our addictions with other foods and not knowing it? Here are some unexpected supermarket products that are full of high fructose corn syrup. Daily bread: You could be inadvertently eating high-fructose corn syrup in your lunchtime sandwich .","A new study by Canadian researchers has found that high-fructose corn syrup can cause reactions similar to those to cocaine .

"Real Madrid's misfiring striker Karim Benzema has been told by coach Carlo Ancelotti to forget Cristiano Ronaldo's scoring exploits and concentrate on helping the team. While Ronaldo has been scoring for fun with seven goals in his last two Madrid matches, it has been a very different story for Benzema who has just two from eight games so far. 'Benzema is fine and he has a lot of ability,' said Ancelotti ahead of his side's La Liga game at Villarreal on Saturday. Karim Benzema must score goals on a regular basis if he wants to remain in Real Madrid's starting line-up . The Frenchman has been told by his manager to not compare his goalscoring record to Cristiano Ronaldo's . Ronaldo has been on fire for Real Madrid - scoring 10 goals in his last five games for his club . Benzema, pictured in training, has scored two goals in eight games for Real Madrid so far this season . 'He needs to work as he always has done and not feel any pressure about scoring. There is no need for him to worry that Cristiano has scored four goals. The only thing that he needs to think about is helping the team to play better and give solutions in attack.' Benzema failed to score in the 8-2 destruction of Deportivo La Coruna last weekend when Ronaldo hit a hat-trick. He was then rested for the midweek clash against Elche, as the Portuguese got four in a 5-1 victory. Ancelotti showed his confidence in Benzema ahead of the season by not recruiting multiple striking reinforcements, which left the Frenchman as the only recognised centre forward at the club. Yet his poor goal record has caused alarm bells to ring at the Bernabeu. Javier Hernandez's early form for Real Madrid will put pressure on the former Lyon forward . Ancelotti restructured his team against Elche by putting Ronaldo and Gareth Bale together in the centre of the attack and they swept aside the visitors. Ronaldo showed he is back to his best after knee and hamstring injuries that had taken the edge off his game in recent months. 'I have faced Ronaldo when I was at Milan and he was at (Manchester) United and I don't think it is easy to stop him. If you are up against him then it is better not to think about it so that you are calmer,' joked Ancelotti. 'At the moment there is no doubt that he is the best in the world and it is not easy to mark the best in the world. We are lucky that we have him in our team and that he has plenty of desire and character. 'He is a leader and it is necessary to have him fine physically and mentally as he will win you titles.' Carlo Ancelotti has warned his players they must shore up their defence if they are to win the title . Ancelotti will be hoping for an improvement in defence against Villarreal, which has been Real's weak point in the opening five La Liga games. They are in fifth place in the table, four points off the lead. 'The teams with the best chance of winning trophies are those that are solid and concede few goals,' he said. 'Last year we were successful because we became more solid and we know that our team will never have problems to score.'","France international Karim Benzema has scored just one La Liga goal so far this season .

"For parents that have already up to £659 on the latest top of the range iPad, there is bad news. Experts say that toys that connect to iPads are being tipped as one of the 'must have' gifts for children this Christmas. From remote control helicopters and robots to toy cars that can be driven on the iPad's screen, they toys, costing up to £40 each, are set to cost parents dearly. Scroll down for video . Toy's such as Disney's AppMates cars, costing up to £40 per set, could be bestsellers this Christmas . As studies show rocketing numbers play games on their parents' tablets, manufacturers have begun to target children with a range of . 'real' toys such as cars that can interact with a tablet. Even Furby, one of the original electronic animal toys, is set to be re-released with an accompanying iPad app. The secret to many of the app toys is simple - conductive paint. Applied to small areas on the toys base, they allow the iPad to track each paint spot as if it were a finger, allowing developers to write games that can track the toys accurately. The toys, such as a car or an action figure, are placed on the tablet's screen and interact with an app, or can control a toy themselves, such a remote controlled helicopter. The move comes as iPads are increasingly used as children's toys. Recent research in the UK and the United States found 39 per cent of adults who own an iPad have downloaded an app for children aged six to 11. Parents are also increasingly downloading apps - another study said parents download an average of 6.8 apps for children aged three to eight every three months.Toys that connect to tablets are now tipped to be one of the top 10 Christmas toys this year, with giants like Disney and Mattel spearheading the move. Even the Furby, one of the original electronic toys, is set to be re-released with an iPad app. 'They are going to be very popular this Christmas,' said Stuart Miles of web site Pocket Lint. 'Luckily there aren't too expensive,' and they do use the tablet which a parent already has. 'I think with things like the cars people will see them as stocking fillers' Mr Miles also believes the toys will be just as popular with parents. 'Kids will feel its more a traditional toy, even though they're really just a bit of plastic, while the more advanced toys like remote control helicopters appeal to grown ups as well. 'Parents who are into technology want their kids to play as well - and they get to play with toys as well. 'I'm a dad, I want to be able to play on my iPad more, so my son can play with me, and we both have a great time.' Samantha Loveday, editor of Toy News, told the Independent: 'Christmas is obviously the toy industry's most important part of the year. 'There are a lot of good toys coming out, but I think Apptivity toys have the potential to be up there. It's very 'of the moment'.' The £40 app controlled Helo TC could also be a hit. App toys are expected to be huge hits this Christmas. Dr Amanda Gummer, a psychologist specialising in play and parenting, said: 'Today's children are growing up with technology and expect it in many of their playthings. 'Combining a physical toy with the excitement of an app and the contemporary appeal of an iPad is a completely new way for kids to play.' However, it's also set to give existing games a new lease of life, with add on toys for Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, both hugely popular iPad games, set to get a 'real life' upgrade before Christmas.","Rise of app toys could cost parents hundreds of pounds .

"By . Akash Vashishtha . Updated: . 19:34 EST, 5 February 2012 . Thousands of acres of fertile land in the floodplains of the Hindon River - an ecologically sensitive zone - has been usurped by the land mafia in Noida and illegally sold to buyers for constructing houses. Already, hundreds of concrete structures have mushroomed on these plots, some houses sitting only metres away from the river's course. The district administration is aware of the plunder of real estate in the Sorkha-Noida Extension area. Several buildings, including these, have mushroomed illegally on the floodplains of the Hindon River . 'It is illegal. No construction can be undertaken in the floodplains. I passed an order recently, warning potential buyers that they should not buy such plots,' district magistrate Hridesh Kumar said. 'While visiting the Chhajarsi village some time ago, I saw first-hand illegal houses along Hindon's embankment. We plan to crack down on the offenders in a harsh manner,' he said. Asked if criminals and gangsters were behind the land-grabbing, Kumar said: 'Of course, they are. No ordinary person would get involved in it.' The illegal houses not only pose a threat to the river ecology but to the area's mythological heritage as well. The illegal buildings, marked by the red dots, on Hindon's floodplains are two kilometres away from the land scam site . 'Hindon's original name is Harnandi in Shiv Mahapuran. This land is the taposthali (abode) of Rishi Vishwawa, the father of King Ravan. Several old temples, some dating back to a thousand years, still exist today in Bisrakh near the river. 'The river embankment is also a rich habitat of birds and peacocks. The illegal constructions are destroying the rich heritage and wildlife,' Dushyant Nagar of farmers' association Kisan Sanghrash Samiti said. The place where the mafia has usurped the plots is located barely 50m from Noida Extension, the address of another multicrore land scam that was uncovered in 2010. In Noida Extension, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) bought farmland at throwaway prices to set up SEZs but sold the real estate to private builders, who built flats and sold them to buyers. The fate of those flats is now locked in litigations in both the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court. Altogether, more than 2,500 acres of land in the floodplains of Hindon has been sold by the mafia over the past three years, helped by unscrupulous government officials. What's the scam?Thousands of acres of land in the floodplains of Hindon River havebeen sold by the land mafia, allegedly hand in glove with UPgovernment officials, to private buyers. Already, scores ofconcrete structures have  mushroomed on these plots, some as close as 20m from the river's course . Who sold the land to the mafia?Farmers of adjoining villages such as Sorkha and Sarfabad, who were the original owners of the plots. Land-use and jurisdiction, however,rests with the UP irrigation department . Can houses be built on these plots?River basin regulations stipulate that only farming can be  undertaken in the floodplains- and nothing else. In 'protected' floodplains, even farming is prohibited and needs the environment ministry's nod . The plots have been sold mostly to people from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and even illegal Bangladeshi migrants. Local real estate dealers put the value of the land at nearly Rs 1,000 crore, at Rs 1 crore per hectare. The encroached floodplain is enclosed by roads on two sides and slices the Gautam Budh Nagar district into Noida and Greater Noida. The plots sold by the mafia originally belonged to farmers residing in nearby villages such as Sorkha and Sarfabad, who undertook farming in these land holdings. The land-use and jurisdiction, however, rests with the irrigation department. Under river basin regulations, the floodplain can only be used for farming and not for any other purposes. Construction of any kind is not permitted. In a 'protected' floodplain, even farming is prohibited and requires the permission of the Union environment ministry. Sources said most land sharks operating in the stretch are hardened criminals and gangsters, linked to the ruling government and regional political parties. The land sharks are in cahoots with officials in the registrar's office. The mafia makes farmers sign blank stamp papers. Dishonest officials get the agreement registered without physically verifying the land in question and checking its land-use. The officials do it knowingly, well aware that plots with sizes 120 sqm and less that come up before them for registration are too less a holding size for agriculture purposes and would be used to build houses. Further, the registrar officials facilitate the registration without obtaining the mandatory SDM report on the land in question. Officials in the tehsildar's office are also in cahoots with the mafia. The tehsildars get the mutation (transfer of ownership) done merely on the basis of the patwari's report, who connives with the land mafia and submit their reports about the status of the said land. When this correspondent posed as a decoy customer before one of the property dealers, named Hira Lal Gupta, he offered plots in his colony named 'Khuaja City'. 'We have plots of all sizes. The plots are priced at Rs 5,500 to Rs 7,000 per square metre. There are two roads, one 20 feet wide and another 15 feet, connecting these plots,' Hira Lal said. 'The plots are very good, close to Noida and Noida Extension. The Phase-II industrial area is close by. You won't get such a premium plot for such a price anywhere in Noida,' he said. Will flooding pose a threat to the houses? Pat comes the reply: 'This is hardly a river now.'","Land sharks sell plots to unsuspecting buyers .

"A Bolivian man born in 1890 - and still going strong - has been revealed as the oldest living person ever recorded, it was reported today. Carmelo Flores Laura turned 123 last month, according to Bolivia's civil registry. Yet the herder, from the mountain village of Frasquicia, 50 miles outside the capital La Paz, is still healthy, walks without a stick and doesn't wear glasses, according to reports.

Evidence: A La Paz government photo  shows the identification document of Aimara Bolivian indigenous Carmelo Flores Laura who according Bolivian authorities is 123 years old . The native Aymara, who has three children, 16 grandchildren and 39 great-grandchildren, was 24 when World War I broke out and 62 when young Queen Elizabeth ascended to the throne. Mr Laura, who lost his wife ten years ago, told Bolivia's Rede Uno TV station that he believes the secret to a long life is taking daily long walks, and never eating pasta or sugar. Instead, he said he has spent his life eating cananhua, a wild species of quinoa which is rich in protein and amino acid.

He added:'I've never been lazy. I always shared the cooking with my wife. 'We would only eat what we could find growing wild. We ate mostly skunk meat. I still go on long walks every day.' The Bolivian's biblical age means he would easily overtake the current oldest living person, 115-year-old Japanese woman Misao Okawa.

"The three Samoan players dropped for Saturday's opening Four Nations Series match against England have each been fined £5,500 ($10,000 Australian dollars), the National Rugby League have announced. Reni Maitua, Tautau Moga and Sauaso Sue have been punished for their part in a nightclub incident in Brisbane last weekend.

"Women are just as likely to be abused online by other females as they are by men and call each other ‘sluts’ and ‘whores’, research has found. Analysis of more than six million tweets using the two derogatory references to women, and discovered men and women were equally likely to use the vile terms, known as trolling. The study, carried out by a University of Sussex think tank, worked out that 131,000 of the tweets came from UK accounts, and 18 per cent of those appear misogynistic. Researchers found thousands of British women use the words 'sluts' and 'whores' when tweeting other women . The team also analysed Twitter for 'rape' references, and found that a shocking 12 per cent of tweets using the word were threatening. Sample tweets, sent by women included: 'There is always that one annoying slut that acts innocent,' and 'I don't think it's fair that I'm not allowed to tell a rape joke just because you decided to be a slut one night 16 years ago'. Others have written: 'That's not modelling. That's being a whore in someone's basement.' One said: 'I hate when bitches don't say thank you after you hold the door open for them. F*** you slut,' while another said: 'I'm just gonna be his whore and not work because it's all I'm good at.' The study, published by Demos, found women are more likely to be subjected to abuse the men . Horrifically, one tweeter wrote: 'Slut you think I won't choke no whore til her vocal chords won't work in her throat no more.' Sofia Patel said: ‘Women are increasingly more inclined to engage in discourses using the same language that has been, and continues to be, used as derogatory against them.’ The study, published by think-tank Demos, also found a high proportion of ‘casual’ misogyny on the social network was carried out by women, as they made joking rape references or called friends bad names.

"Nearly half of us could be infected with a virus which makes us more stupid, scientists have found. The startling discovery suggests that millions may be carrying a long-lasting infection which dulls the brain. Scientists found the virus living in the throats of 44 per cent of patients tested in a small US study. A viral infection that could make more than half of us stupid has been discovered by scientists in America . Those who were carrying the infection performed worse in intelligence tests, even when education and age were taken into account. The virus - called chlorovirus ATCV-1 - was previously only known to appear in green algae in freshwater lakes. The researchers, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of Nebraska, have not established how the virus comes to infect humans. It does not seem to have infected just swimmers or watersports fans, probably ruling out a link to algae itself. Instead it could be that humans have long carried the virus, but it had not previously been looked for by doctors. Study author Professor Robert Yolken, of Johns Hopkins medical school, said the millions of viruses living in the human body are being investigated by experts for the first time. ‘We’re really just starting to find out what some of these agents that we’re carrying around might actually do,’ he told the Healthline website. ‘It’s the beginning, I think, of another way of looking at infectious agents — not agents that come in and do a lot of damage and then leave, like Ebola virus or influenza virus. ‘This is kind of the other end of the spectrum. These are agents that we carry around for a long time and that may have subtle effects on our cognition and behaviour.’ The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the ATCV-1 virus alters the genes in the brain. The team found the virus in throat swabs from 40 out of 92 volunteers, and discovered those with the virus performed measurably worse in cognitive testing. They then confirmed their findings in tests on mice. Giving the virus to mice resulted in a decrease in recognition memory and other brain functions, they found. Tests showed the virus had broken through the barrier between blood and tissue, altering the activity of genes in the brains of the mice. The genes affected including those producing dopamine - a vital hormone which influences memory, spatial awareness, emotion and pleasure. But the virus does not seem to have infected just swimmers or watersports fans, ruling out a link to algae itself . The virus - called chlorovirus ATCV-1 - was previously only known to appear in green algae in freshwater lakes . Professor James Van Etten, a biologist from the University of Nebraska who first identified the virus in algae 30 years ago, said: ‘There’s more and more studies showing that microorganisms in your body have a bigger influence than anything anyone would have predicted, and this could be something along those lines.’ Professor Yolken added: ‘The thing that’s different about what we found is that chlorovirus ATCV-1 is something that we wouldn’t have suspected would actually have any effect on humans or animals. ‘It points us in a direction of looking to see if we can improve people’s cognition, their behaviour, by changing the composition of their microbiome [the balance of bacteria and viruses in the body].’","The virus - called chlorovirus ATCV-1 - was only known to appear in algae .

The amateur singer said he didn't fancy standing up and telling jokes to a room full of people, so did what came naturally to him . But the singer still managed to drop in the obligatory best man insults, by reworking some of the songs' lyrics. His performance included humorous jibes at the groom's ginger hair and even a suggestion that the bride was marrying her husband out of pity. The medley began with Mr Imoldi's own version of Sex is on Fire by Kings of Leon, in which he replaced the lyrics with his 'hair is on fire' - a dig at Nathan's  hair. He then broke into 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers, before subgubg 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis and 'A Little Respect by' Erasure.

'The other best man gave his speech and then I stepped up. A normal speech just wouldn't have been me at all, but a year ago I wouldn't have had the confidence to sing like that either. He said: 'The reaction from everyone at the wedding was brilliant. It couldn't have gone better' 'But I joined a singing group last year where we did a production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and that kind of spurred me on to do more singing.

'I thought it would be the usual best man-type stuff.

'Next thing I knew a guitar came out and he did that with Gary. 'I even stayed at Jon's the night before the wedding with Gary as well, and they didn't let on at all. 'Laura loved it, she gets on well with both my best men so they were easy choices when it came to who to pick. 'The wedding was full of friends more than extended family and a lot of younger people were there so the songs went down brilliantly.

"A Stark Trek fan has a message for humanity: Can we boldly go where no man has gone before - and build a fully-functioning Starship Enterprise? Visit BuildTheEnterprise.org, and you may believe you have stumbled upon the blueprints of a NASA-funded project, so complete and fully-fledged are the blueprints. Every detail of the first Enterprise has been planned out to the smallest degree, from the inner workings of the 'gravity wheel' to the coverings on the exterior shielding, as well as the outline of the first ten missions and the political problems that will have to be overcome. Naturally, there are some differences: . Captain Kirk and his crew explored the universe in 2250 or thereabouts, . and the increase in technology advances gives Kirk and co a distinct . advantage, such as warp drives powered by anti-matter and teleportation . devices. Still, 'Dan' a systems engineer whose . job involves trialling new technologies, believes we can build his model . within the next 20 years  and it can then be a vessel for humanity, . using nuclear generators to take us to the moon in three days and to . Mars in 90 days. The Khan-do spirit: Systems engineer 'Dan' has methodically worked out any kinks to get the Enterprise in the skies . The ship - otherwise known as the NCC-1701 - is a faithful - and more . importantly, a technically possible, recreation of of the biggest shows . in Sci-Fi history. However, as creator 'Dan' points out, 'many changes are needed inside the Gen1 ship to make the ship . compatible with the technologies of the first half of the 21st . century. 'Keep in mind that the Star Trek adventures in the . NCC-1701-x Enterprise ships take place starting in the year 2245. Our . technology today is just not up to building a starship - that will have . to wait for a Gen4 ship or later. But this doesn’t mean that the Gen1 . Enterprise will not be awe-inspiring and similar in many fundamental . ways to the Enterprises of the future.' He added: 'The Gen1 Enterprise will be . the same size as future Enterprises or larger. It will have 1g gravity . like the future ships and ample comfortable living space. It will have a . bridge with 1g gravity where the captain and key crew members will . often work. 'It will have a huge number of sensors for probing . whatever the ship encounters in space. It can launch landers that . descend to a planet below and then return to the ship. It will move . beyond the brute-force rocket engines of the 20th century by using ion . propulsion engines powered by on-board nuclear reactors. 'Yes, this may still be a long way from warp drives powered by anti-matter, but it will be a respectable start.' Ready for construction: Build the Enterprise even goes into great detail about each area of the ship, breaking down what modern-day technology can be adapted to boldly go into space . More than an Eiffel, or a World Trade Centre: The Enterprise would be one of the most ambitious projects built on this planet (or off it) Bold plans: The full plans to build a real-life USS Enterprise is laid out online . Dan continued: 'Things . get moved around and reworked quite a bit inside the Gen1 Enterprise . compared to the Enterprises of Star Trek. For example, in the NCC-1701-x . ships the hanger deck is located in the back of the lower hull and this . serves as the launch and entry port for shuttlecrafts. 'But in the . Gen1 Enterprise this lower hull section instead houses the main engine . and main nuclear reactor. For the Gen1 ship, the spaceport entry doors . are on the underside of the saucer hull. 'The reason for this is that . in the Gen1 Enterprise every bit of the three hull sections to the rear . of the Enterprise are needed to house the three engines and nuclear . reactors that will be needed to provide enough power to move the massive . ship with the required .002g constant acceleration. 'Another example . of a change is that the bridge is not at the top center of the saucer . hull as it is shown in the figure above. If it was there in the Gen1 . Enterprise then there would be no gravity on the bridge. Having the . ship’s captain and crew floating around inside the bridge just makes no . sense. Thus, in the Gen1 Enterprise the bridge is in a dedicated section . of the gravity wheel so that they will work in 1g gravity. 'While . things get moved around quite a bit inside the Gen1 Enterprise when . compared to the ships from Star Trek, they are not moved around upon a . whim. They are moved around because the Gen1 ship’s technological . capabilities demand certain changes.' Boldly going forward: Captain James T Kirk (William Shatner) leads his Enterprise crew on another mission . Dan, . who is behind the project, seems qualified for the role, and hopes that . even if his project doesn't - excuse the pun - get off the ground, his . project will inspire The Next Generation. On . his website he states: 'In my day job I work as a systems engineer and . electrical engineer. For 30 years I have worked at the same Fortune 500 . company, a company that is a high-tech leader in the US and globally. 'I’m . lucky that in my role I often get to explore new ideas and new . technologies when working toward the development of new products. The . BuildTheEnterprise website just seems to flow out naturally from the . same approach I take in pondering and evaluating new ideas and . technologies in my day job. 'Personally, . I have found working as an engineer to be very rewarding. The work is . interesting, the pay is good, your co-workers are bright and . enthusiastic, and the unemployment rate in engineering typically runs . under 3 per cent – far below the national average for all workers. For . these reasons I hope that some young people find a bit of inspiration in . this website, and that this might even help motivate some to study . engineering in college. 'And . okay, for the record, while in grade school I watched the first Star . Trek series each week during the original season on TV in 1966 on my . family’s black and white TV. 'Captivated . by the image and idea of the USS Enterprise, I built a long lost model . of it from a kit I purchased at a store. I was around nine years old. So . I suppose the USS Enterprise has been burned into my brain for a long . time, just waiting for a chance to get out.'

"A young Syrian boy has been hailed a hero after a video showing him running through sniper fire to save a girl emerged online. The one-minute clip shows the boy running from the left side of the frame and coming under fire as he dashes towards a car-wreck. As he runs shots are fired at him and he appears to fake being shot in the chest and falling over. Stopped: More shots are fired as he runs and it looks like the young boy has been hit in the chest . Second of fear: The boy falls to the ground, and for a short moment, the men filming thinks he has been killed . A second later he gets up and disappears behind the car before emerging hand in hand with the terrified girl who has been hiding from fire. He appears to struggle to convince her to run to safety, but the girl, dressed in pink, eventually runs with him as more shots are fired. The video has not been independently verified, but it is believed to be from Yabroud, a countryside town 50 miles from Damascus. Survivor: Seconds later, the boy gets up again, having fooled the snipers, and runs towards the car . Hero: The boy emerges from behind the car, holding the hands of a girl who has been hiding in fear . Bravery: The pair are being fired at, but the heroic boy convinces the girl to run . Success: The two children run out of sight, and appears to have made it across . Yabroud was the last rebel stronghold held by the FSA on the Lebanese border before it fell to Assad's forces in March 2014 .

"No wonder they are smiling. On the sunny seafront at Folkestone, two African migrants look forward to a new life after a hazardous journey across the English Channel hidden in a refrigerated lorry and almost suffocating to death. Now, eight days after arriving, they live at the taxpayers’ expense in a Kent holiday hotel with a swimming pool and champagne on offer while Home Office officials search for UK homes for them. ‘We are so happy and our only worry is whether we will need coats for the cold weather in your winter,’ says Abrham Embaye, 30, in his good English as he puts his arm round his friend, Abel Teages, aged 20. Scroll down for video . Abel Teages (left) and Abrham Embaye (right) are living in a Kent hotel at the taxpayers' expense . ‘We are going to make our lives in your country and never go back to Africa. The Home Office officials say we will stay in this hotel, where we get three meals a day and nice rooms, until October 6 and then I go to Leeds and Abel is to live in Cardiff. Is Leeds colder than Cardiff?’ He produces a bunch of official papers in a brown envelope with a Home Office stamp on the top to show me he is telling the truth. The two migrants were among a group of 24 Eritrean men and women who paid £400 each to trafficking agents for the final leg of their journey to the UK – a place in a refrigerated lorry which arrived in Dover on a ferry from Calais, eight days ago. They were discovered after seven hours in the truck when the foreign driver parked near Dover. The migrants, frightened of being suffocated, had begun banging on the sides of the lorry. A mechanic from a nearby workshop broke the security seal to the vehicle and found them gasping for breath. The migrants get three meal a day and comfortable rooms at  The Grand Burstin Hotel with views of the White Cliffs of Folkestone . They survived a hazardous journey across the English Channel hidden in a refrigerated lorry and almost suffocating to death . The incident, filmed on mobile phones, made national headlines. It also raised questions over how hundreds of migrants from impoverished African and beleaguered Middle East countries still slip over the 22 miles of water from Calais each month despite Home Office promises that UK border controls at the French port have been tightened up. This week, as 1,500 migrants waited in Calais to try their chance of smuggling themselves to the UK, the Government pledged £4million a year until 2017 to counter organised trafficking gangs. Crucially, new technology at the port to look inside refrigerated lorries – the vehicles where migrants appear to routinely escape detection – is expected to be introduced too. Back in Folkestone, holiday makers at the Grand Burstin hotel where Abrham and Abel stay voiced disapproval over the new arrivals. Back in Folkestone, holiday makers at the Grand Burstin hotel where the asylum seekers stay voiced disapproval over the new arrivals . Around 130 migrants moved there by coach on Tuesday from the overcrowded Euro Queens’ hotel near Croydon, which was dubbed Hotel Asylum by locals and guests when they found 500 asylum seekers squashed into 98 rooms last weekend. Now the Grand Burstin is being called Hotel Asylum 2. It will cost taxpayers £72,000 to keep the migrants from Croydon there for two weeks in £40-a-night rooms. As Folkestone councillor Bob Neaves said: ‘A lot of residents and business people are disgusted the migrants have been sprung on us. They’re worried about tourism. ‘We don’t want this to become another Calais.’ Kath Mahon, a 52-year-old from Preston, who was last week enjoying a holiday at the Grand Burstin with her daughter Heather, 27, said: ‘It makes us feel uncomfortable. We don’t know who they are and whether they have criminal records. There’s old people staying here who are petrified.’ Another holidaymaker, a TripAdvisor user, Nicola from Worcester, left a review on Thursday of the experience at the hotel after being surprised to meet migrants there. She wrote: ‘We booked the weekend for our wedding anniversary, but as soon as we checked in we could see it was a lovely hotel, so we booked an extra night. However on the evening of our extra night, 130 asylum seekers arrived. ‘It worried the life out of me, with all that’s going on we didn’t know if we were in any danger. ‘We didn’t sleep, we went back to our room early as we were worried about our belongings and even worried about our car. ‘If my husband hadn’t had two glasses of wine with dinner we would [have] left that evening.’ However – oblivious to the hostility – the migrants, mainly from Eritrea but also from the Middle East troublespots, are delighted with their new abode. Both Abrham and Abel were housed temporarily at other hotels near Dover after being rescued from the lorry. They were then sent to Folkestone earlier this week to join the 130 from Croydon at the Grand Burstin. The migrants I met are claiming asylum and will be given free housing plus cash benefits of £150 a month while the Home Office decides if they can stay in the UK, a process which could take years. The Romanian driver of the refrigerated lorry carrying the Eritrean group, which included nine children, has been charged with assisting the entry of illegals and is due in court next week. The Eritreans are Christians who flee a dictatorship where every male over 18 is forced to serve in the Army – although Abrham claims he was forced into service at the age of 13. They start their journey to the West by paying trafficking agents to guide them in lorry convoys over the Sahara desert to Libya and, from there, by boat to Italy. A trickle of Eritreans smuggling themselves to the UK is now a torrent. Their asylum claims are often granted because of the oppression in their country. As I sit with Abrham on a harbour bench outside the Great Burstin, he explains: ‘I was made to serve in the Eritrean Army from when I was a young teenager. It is a frightening country and so we want to get to England. ‘My family paid £1,200 to a trafficking agent put me on a lorry across the Sahara to the Libyan seaport of Zwara. Then they paid £1,400 to another agent for my place on a small boat to the Italian coastline. ‘I made my way to Rome and stayed with a group of Eritreans there to rest. I then took a train through the Italian-French border to Nice in the south of France, before getting others to Paris and Calais. ‘I was in Calais for seven weeks trying to get on a lorry day and night. I hid my Christian cross under my T-shirt because I was afraid I would be attacked by the Muslim migrants there.’ He continued as the voice of Vera Lynn’s White Cliffs of Dover rang out from a nearby cafe: ‘A week ago I got my chance. My family paid more money to an agent for my place on the refrigerated lorry.’ The migrants say they were around seven hours inside the lorry before the doors opened and they could breathe properly again. ‘We were desperate, gasping for air,’ says Abrham. Then he gives another broad grin before adding: ‘But, at last I was in England.’","Abrham Embaye, 30, and Abel Teages, 20, are living in a Kent holiday hotel .

"You have to hand it to John Terry because he has certainly seen off some threats in his 16 years as a professional at Chelsea. Some, such as the France World Cup winner Marcel Desailly, William Gallas and Ricardo Carvalho, were more serious than others. Khalid Boulahrouz, Alex and Tal Ben Haim maybe not so much, but they were all brought in to the club under Terry’s watch. Better than ever: John Terry has been remarkable this season, featuring in all of Chelsea's Premier League games . Terry, in his 16th season as a professional footballer with Chelsea, remains. He is probably playing better than ever. Little wonder, then, that he is agitating for news of another contract at Stamford Bridge. They are certainly making him sweat. Marina Granovskaia, who is Roman Abramovich’s eyes and ears around the place, appears to have enjoyed the moment she told Terry that the club have a new policy in place. Out of nowhere, it appears any one by the name of John Terry will only be offered one year contracts now that he is over 30 years of age. He is panicking a bit, probably with good reason after putting himself in pole position to be Chelsea’s player of the year. Perhaps Granovskaia, who is a member of the football club board at Chelsea, remembers the last time she was involved in negotiations with Terry back in July 2009. More on that in a moment because the unsavoury slog through the media that summer put a few noses out of joint. Back to where it all matters, though, and his performances on the pitch. Football clubs will pretty much forgive anything - and there has been much to forgive in this case - so long as they perform out on the pitch. Terry is not only the best central defender in Chelsea’s history, but he is also unrivalled in two decades of the Barclays Premier League. He is the best there has been. It was only a couple of weeks ago when Terry’s 600th appearance in a Chelsea shirt was being commemorated before their Premier League clash with Manchester United. ‘An incredible achievement by a guy who has given everything for a club for many, many years and continues to do so,’ cooed his manager Jose Mourinho in his programme notes. Terry, 33, has played in all 22 Premier League fixtures for Chelsea this season and he will captain the team against West Ham on Wednesday. He has realigned his game, handing marking duties to his partner Gary Cahill and using his positioning, which has always been his best attribute, to dictate the game. He has been phenomenal. Colossus: Marcel Desailly was another robust Chelsea centre half and Stamford Bridge favourite . Another stalwart: Rio Ferdinand's game at Manchester United, West Ham and Leeds has been exceptional . Back to that £150,000 a week contract, which expires on June 30 this year: ‘I trust John and I think he trusts me,’ was Mourinho’s take on the situation last Friday. Last time round, when he was working off pay-as-you-go mobile phones to flirt with Manchester City in 2009, he tucked up one or two people on the way to securing a five year deal with Chelsea. Still, you live and learn. At the time he was so powerful at Chelsea it was untrue: he used to take his kids swimming at the club’s Surrey training base as if it was his own personal leisure centre. But over the years, with each lurid appearance on the front page of a tabloid newspaper, his authority at the club has slowly eroded. He remains captain, but he has had to keep his nose clean over the past couple of years. There has been the odd blip, such as the announcement that he was ready to play for England again on the flight home from Basle on April 25 last year, but that’s about it. To be fair to him, if he could put one or two personal issues with the FA to one side, he would play for England at this summer’s World Cup finals. Top man: Terry (right) has been a mainstay in Jose Mourinho's Chelsea teams while at Chelsea . Trophy hunter: Terry proudly holds the Europa League last season . Let’s face it, Roy Hodgson would take the country’s best central defender at the drop of a hat if he was available for selection. Still, the pressing issue for Terry at this moment is Chelsea’s failure to offer him the contract he believes he has earned. If he wants a bargaining chip the next time he knocks on Granovskaia’s door, it might be worth throwing in the name of Steven Gerrard. On July 15 last year, a couple of months after the Liverpool captain celebrated his 33rd birthday, he signed a new two year contract. Brick wall: Terry has found fine form this season since Mourinho's return at Stamford Bridge . Star in the making: Terry (left) holds the FA Cup trophy back in 2000 (left) and (right) was red-carded during an England Under 21 match against Greece . ‘It’s great news,’ admitted the Liverpool captain as he prepared for the start of his 16th season at Anfield. Good for him. Gerrard has had a stellar career, playing for the same team throughout and making more than 400 Premier League appearances. Like Terry, he has also lifted the European Cup. Still hope? If Terry put aside some differences with the FA, he may yet be on the plane to Brazil . Terry, who is the same age, has had a similar career, but can also point to three Premier League titles in the Abramovich era. He also remains the last player to successfully come through the youth ranks at the club, something which should not be overlooked in the final reckoning. At some stage his luck will finally run out, but it won’t be this summer. On the slide? Terry's career has been one marked with controversy... and success .

"Only rarely is it possible for spectators to watch John Terry in action for more than 90 minutes without having to go through a turnstile. Rarer still is to see the former England captain virtually motionless, speaking almost in a whisper at times, and standing with his hands clasped in front of him as if in silent prayer. But anyone at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday got a glimpse of the other John Terry. Not the Chelsea defender aggressively tackling his opponents on the pitch. Scroll down for video . Arriving at court: Chelsea captain John Terry pictured yesterday outside Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he is on trial for allegedly racially abusing fellow footballer Anton Ferdinand . Terry denied making the alleged slur during a Premier League game in October last year . This was Terry at his most humble, . giving evidence for the first time in defence of a charge that he . racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a four-letter tirade during a game . against QPR last October. Evidence: Anton Ferdinand leaves the court yesterday with friends . Terry, who denies the claim, arrived . at court on Monday looking as if he had just left a wedding in his . expensive grey suit and pink tie. Yesterday the outfit was bordering on . funereal – a midnight blue suit, black tie and highly polished black . shoes. To begin with, Mr Terry, as . prosecuting lawyer Duncan Penny addressed him, was asked to place the . various insults, banter and confrontations commonplace in top class . football into rank order. ‘Handbags’, the 31-year-old Chelsea . skipper agreed, was how commentators tended to define clashes that . didn’t result in fists, headbutts and outright violence. Then there were the insults. ‘You’re . ugly,’ was probably at the lower end of the scale and was commonplace, . Terry agreed. Ditto ‘You’re fat’. Comments about players’ wives and . girlfriends? ‘I’ve had that,’ Terry said. Mr Penny: ‘A player might say, “I had . your wife... I s****** your girlfriend, that sort of thing?”’ Terry: . ‘Yes.’ Terry allegedly made racist comments to Queens Park Rangers defender Ferdinand during a match on October 23 last year . But there were no-go areas. ‘How about, “Your mum’s a s***”? Have . you heard that said to other players?’ Mr Penny asked. Terry: ‘No, only to myself.’ What about insults concerning what Mr . Penny called his ‘domestic circumstances’ – Terry is alleged to have . reacted after Ferdinand accused him of ‘s******* Bridge’s missus’, a . reference to his relationship with model Vanessa Perroncel, who had been . dating his former colleague Wayne Bridge. Was that a no-go area? ‘Apparently not,’ said Terry, adding that fans had long heckled him over . it. Mr Penny: ‘So when someone enters a . no-go area, you strike back?’ Terry: ‘No, I don’t strike back.’ Mr . Penny: ‘You’re the innocent victim are you?’ Terry: ‘Yes.’ Mr Penny: . ‘Too right. You’ve been stitched up right and proper haven’t you?’ Terry: ‘Yeah.’ Former England soccer captain and Chelsea player John Terry, centre, arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Courts in London . Under further questioning, Terry denied he had ‘snapped’ when Ferdinand abused him, or that his ‘blood was up’. Terry told Mr Penny he had never been . accused on a football pitch of making racist remarks. ‘At the time I was . shocked and angry,’ he said. ‘Hindsight’s a wonderful thing. At the . time I was shocked, I was angry, you can’t control your emotions.’ The court heard that Terry had told . detectives that using racist terms was ‘completely unacceptable’. He had . also told police of his work with the African charities of two black . former Chelsea colleagues, Marcel Desailly and striker Didier Drogba, . adding: ‘My commitment to these projects further demonstrates that I am . not a racist.’ At one stage in confrontation with . Ferdinand, he admitted, he had waved his hand in front of his nose to . gesture that his opponent had ‘bad breath’ – but he had not intended to . humiliate him. Anton Ferdinand's mother Janice arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court for the second day of John Terry trial . In the dock: John Terry watches on as his alleged race abuse victim Anton Ferdinand gives evidence in this artist's impression of proceedings . Why not just tell him to calm down? ‘You wouldn’t see many footballers when they square up saying “Calm down”,’ Terry replied. Why did he gesture in the same game . that QPR goalkeeper Paddy Kenny was fat? Was that ‘handbags’ too? ‘Yes,’ said Terry, adding that his rivals sometimes called him fat. Mr Penny: ‘You’re not fat though are you? You’re a supreme athlete.’ Terry: ‘I used to be...’ Scandal: Terry's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team-mate's girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, pictured, the prosecution said . Had he thought about apologising to . Anton Ferdinand? ‘Why would I apologise to Anton?’ he replied. ‘He’s the . one who accused me.’ Terry told the court that it had . actually been Ferdinand who had first used racist terms during the . flare-up. As the pair traded insults, he claims to have heard Ferdinand . say: ‘Calling me a black c***?’ He said: ‘I thought he was accusing me . of calling him a black c***. I was very angry and I was upset. I . replied, “A black c***? You f****** k***head”.’ This second day of the hearing was played out to a packed court. Outside, passing van drivers . displaying Chelsea colours tooted support on their horns; inside, the . legal files, coincidentally, were coloured blue and white. Terry was in the witness box for a . total of two hours, which, even on his wages of £160,000 a week, almost . certainly worked out less in hourly rates than the collective fees of . the lawyers involved in the case. Earlier Terry told the court he shook Ferdinand’s hand in the dressing room after asking to see him after the match. ‘We’ve got a little bit of . superstition at Chelsea,’ he said. ‘Me, Ash [Ashley Cole], Frank Lampard . and [Daniel] Sturridge all get changed together – until we lose, then . we change sequence. ‘By this stage I’m already changed. I’m in the toilet doing my hair. As I come out, me and Anton passed.’ Terry said he asked the QPR defender if he was suggesting he had been racially abused. Ferdinand’s response? ‘No, no, no. We all say things we shouldn’t. That’s the end of it.’ This case is listed to run until the end of the week. If you don’t want to know the result, look away then.

"The parents of badly injured F1 driver Jules Bianchi have arrived by his bedside at the Japanese hospital where he is fighting for his life in intensive care. Philippe and Christine Bianchi arrived at the Mie General Hospital in Yokkaichi last night, a day after their son was badly hurt in a smash during the rain-soaked Japanese Grand Prix. 'When we have an update with Saillant, we will speak to you,' Philippe Bianchi told waiting reporters, referring to French brain injury specialist Professor Gerard Saillant, who has flown to Japan to assist in Bianchi's care. Scroll down for video . Worry: Philippe and Christine Bianchi leave the Mie General Medical Centre in Yokkaichi this evening . Stress: Mr and Mrs Bianchi arrived in Japan last night, but these are the first pictures of them at the hospital . Fears: They speak with Nicolas Todt (3rd L), Bianchi's manager, and assistant manager Alessandro Alunni Bravi (2nd L) at the entrance of the Mie General Medical Centre . Mie General Medical Centre: Hospital sources said Bianchi was breathing but only with the help of a ventilator . Prof Saillant, president of the FIA medical commission, arrived in Yokkaichi early this morning and went straight to the hospital where Bianchi is said to be in a 'critical' condition. On Sunday, the Marussia driver suffered a severe head injury when his car smashed into a tractor rescuing the crashed Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had spun off on the previous lap of the Japanese Grand Prix. Prof Saillant arrived at Mie General Hospital with Nicolas Todt, Bianchi's agent, and went straight in via the emergency entrance to avoid crowds of waiting reporters, Le Parisien reports. Top doctor: French brain injury specialist Professor Gerard Saillant, president of the FIA medical commission,  has flown in to assist in Bianchi's care . Bianchi, who is just 25, remains in intensive care today after emergency surgery on a severe head injury following his high speed crash on the rain-soaked Suzuka circuit. Sources at the hospital said Bianchi was breathing but only with the help of a ventilator, not on his own as was originally reported in the French media on Sunday night. Famous in the world of sport and one of France's leading neurologists, Prof Saillant is a brain and spinal injury expert with a particular specialism in motorsports. It was he who helped to treat Michael Schumacher after the retired F1 ace's devastating head injury while skiiing in December last year. He also oversaw Schumacher's medical care when he broke his leg in the 1999 British Grand Prix. A spokesman for the FIA, Formula One's governing body, said last night Bianchi's condition was ‘critical but stable’ and it is understood his family will finally see him on Tuesday. They had been delayed in getting to him due to Typhoon Phanfone. The first video of the horrific moment Bianchi crashed into the digger has now been distributed online. The clip was released as Jules Bianchi was revealed to be in a ‘critical but stable’ condition following the crash. An ambulance was sent to the scene straight after Bianchi's crash - which knocked him unconscious - and the 25-year-old Frenchman was taken to the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi. Last night Camille Marchetti, 24, the French girlfriend of Bianchi, sent up a prayer through Twitter for her 'champion' as he fought for his life in hospital. Bianchi's father, Philippe, told French TV that his son's condition was 'critical' and he had undergone surgery for serious head injuries. Miss Marchetti, who has dated Bianchi for a number of years, said: 'You are my champion! You are the strongest’.  She ended the tweet with emoticons of a heart and two hands locked in prayer. Crash: The clip was taken yesterday in the aftermath of another accident at the Japanese Grand Prix . Clip: The driver was severely injured when his car ploughed into the back of a tractor rescuing another vehicle . Girlfriend: Camilee Marchetti (pictured with Bianchi at an event) is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France and originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica . 'My champion'! Bianchi's long-term partner, Camille Marchetti, led prayers for the race ace's recovery as the world waited for news on his condition . Yesterday, Marussia issued a statement giving thanks for the support Bianchi had received. They also asked for ‘patience and understanding’ with regard to further medical updates. This was after an initial release was made by the FIA on Sunday confirming the driver suffered ‘a severe head injury’ and was to undergo surgery before being moved to intensive care. Marussia's statement read: ‘Following the accident involving Jules Bianchi during yesterday's 2014 Formula One Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, the Marussia F1 Team would like to acknowledge the huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time. ‘With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect, and be guided by, the wishes of the Bianchi family. Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority. ‘Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates, which will be communicated in conjunction with the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, where Jules is being treated, when they feel it is appropriate. ‘Representatives of the Marussia F1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari will remain at the hospital to support Jules and the Bianchi family.’ Unconscious but breathing for himself, Bianchi was taken to Mie University hospital, ten miles from the track in Suzuka, and the race was stopped nine laps early. Bianchi's father has since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he has undergone surgery for serious head injuries. The F1 season moves on to Sochi in Russia for next weekend's race and it remains to be seen whether or not Marussia will take part. Bianchi's crash saw Sunday's event halted at lap 44, with victory being awarded to Lewis Hamilton, who has opened up a ten-point lead in the championship over his second-placed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with four races remaining. The race had been under threat of cancellation in the build-up as Typhoon Phanfone headed towards Suzuka and the wet weather led to it being red-flagged after just two laps, despite starting under safety car conditions. Once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest, Briton Hamilton caught and passed Germany's Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance. The rain then came down again, driving conditions deteriorated and Bianchi crashed out, prompting the red flags to return and the race to be ended with nine laps to go. Williams driver Felipe Massa has said he had been ‘screaming’ over his radio during the race about the amount of water on the track, but former FIA president Max Mosley believes ‘everything was done as it should have been’ in relation to safety. Supportive: Miss Marchetti (far left) watches Bianchi prepare to take part in the Amber Lounge Fashion Show ahead of the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix at Circuit de Monaco last May . Asked if F1 is doing everything right to secure the safety of its drivers, Mosley told Sky Sports News HQ on Monday: ‘I think it is. I think what happened in Suzuka was very unfortunate, a freak accident. ‘But I can't really fault any of the people involved - the marshals or the race director, any of those people. I think everything was done as it should have been.’ Massa said he was trying his best to get the race called off in the run up to Sutil and Bianchi's accidents. ‘I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous,’ the Brazilian said on Sunday. A subdued Hamilton said: ‘Our first thoughts go to Jules. It overshadows everything else when one of our colleague is injured and we are praying for him. ‘Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all. Nico and I had a tough battle, we were pushing really hard... But like I said, that's not what matters - our thoughts are with Jules.’ Bianchi's long term partner, Miss Marchetti, is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France who originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica. She is well-known in the Formula 1 community and is often seen cheering Bianchi on from the pits as he races around the world. Known also for her glamorous attire and interest in fashion, she regularly accompanies him to F1 events and parties. Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital. It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.","Philippe and Christine Bianchi arrived at Mie General Hospital last night .

"John Terry will be allowed to continue as England captain, despite being told that he must appear in court next year to answer a criminal charge of using racist language on the field. To the fury of anti-racism campaigners, top officials at the Football Association stayed silent after the footballer was formally summonsed yesterday over an outburst against a black player during a Premier League clash. The multi-millionaire defender – who denies any racial abuse – also continued to enjoy the backing of his club, Chelsea. Scroll down for video . Race row: The moment Terry (in the black shirt) is accused of racially abusing QPR defender Ferdinand (centre left). He denies any wrong-doing . Family man: Father-of-two Terry with wife Toni . A spokesman for campaigning group Hope Not Hate said: ‘It seems . incredible that John Terry can continue as England captain while this . charge is hanging over him. ‘Most members of an organisation facing similar charges would find . themselves suspended until the matter is resolved. He is not even facing . a football-related matter – this is a serious criminal charge which has . attracted a huge amount of attention.’ Terry learned at the end of a damp training session at Chelsea’s . training ground near Cobham, Surrey, that he will be brought before a . district judge and charged. The order for Terry to appear before a district judge relates to a . penalty box clash with QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October. Prosecutors decided there was enough evidence, including TV images of . the incident that were beamed around the world, to put him on trial. He is accused of calling Ferdinand a ‘f****** black ****’ during the match at QPR’s Loftus Road stadium. But afterwards he told Ferdinand, whose brother Rio plays alongside . Terry for England, that the remarks had been taken out of context, . insisting he actually said: ‘Oi, Anton, do you think I called you a . black ****?’ Terry will first appear in court next February but the case is likely to . drag on for up to six months as lawyers prepare for a trial. The cloud . of suspicion will continue to hang over Terry during England’s next . clash against Holland on February 29, and may even run into England’s . preparations for next summer’s Euro 2012 tournament in Ukraine and . Poland. The maximum punishment Terry faces is a £2,500 fine, a sum he earns in . just two hours and 38 minutes on his £160,000-a-week salary. Last night, Terry, 31, said he was ‘disappointed’ with the decision and . that he hoped to clear his name ‘as quickly as possible’. He said: ‘I have never aimed a racist remark at anyone and count people from all races and creeds among my closest friends.

England boss Fabio Capello said he is innocent until proven guilty . ‘I will fight tooth and nail to prove my innocence. I have campaigned . against racism and believe there is no place for it in society.’ England manager Fabio Capello has kept Terry as England captain despite . the racism claims and said the defender should be presumed to be . innocent until proven guilty.

"These photographs show the new mansion built by Chelsea star John Terry in the garden of his former home, which has finally been sold, it was revealed today. Nestling behind a massive man-made lake, . the new house dwarfs Terry’s old house, which he reportedly had to re-mortgage four times. Three years after he first tried to sell the red-brick nine-bedroom Surrey mansion, it has been revealed that it has been sold for £5.25million. Big build: John Terry's new white mansion and man-made lake he had built in the garden of his old home . Gone: Terry has finally sold the red-brick mansion for £5.25million after three years on the market . In 2010 the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by three quarters of a million pounds. However, helped by the current burgeoning property market, he has finally sold it for more than the £5million asking price. The sale will help the 32-year-old finance the new mansion which he has had built in his back garden - a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham. John and Toni Terry's new home has eight dressing and bathrooms and a private cinema and sauna . Constructed at the end of a private road, the huge new home, which he shares with wife Toni, is hidden away from prying eyes and is only clearly visible from the air. It comprises eight dressing and bathrooms, nine bedrooms, a swimming pool and sauna. The mansion even has its own private cinema and sauna. The huge lake in the garden has been constructed over three months and still needs laying to grass and paving. Terry, a keen angler, was . given permission to build the fishing lake in April 2012 - despite . it being on green belt land. Terry’s agent confirmed that the old home - which he bought in 2003 - had finally been sold. The new buyers have not yet been identified. 'He always planned to sell it and is pleased to have made money on it,' said the agent. Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million pounds on the building of the new house. Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion is believed to include a 33x40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities. Staff are also reportedly accommodated in one wing and there is also a visitor annexe in the opposite wing.

"In 1852 he made history with his pioneering flight in a steam powered airship. By the time these photographs were taken in 1878, visionary inventor Henri Giffard was making the impossible possible for everyday men and women - the chance to see Paris from the air. Installed in the courtyard of the . Tuileries, Paris, and surrounded by tethering devices, large winches and ballast, this is one of the first passenger carrying air balloons. It has been well over a century since humans achieved the phenomenon of flight. But in the days of steam and horse power, the mammoth airship would have been an alien sight indeed. By the time these photographs of Paris were taken in 1878, it had been 26 years since Henri Giffard's pioneering powered flight in 1852 . Giffard then set about sharing his with the masses. He took every day people to the air for their first flight aboard his tethered balloon . His invention offered the unimaginable - a view of Paris from the air. In this picture taken by a passenger, the streets of the city can be seen winding their way between war damaged buildings . A view over the River Seine, taken in 1878. The concept of air travel would have been an alien one to ordinary Parisians . They may be a common sight today, but in the days of steam and horse power the passenger carrying balloon would have been a bizarre concept . The excited passengers took these photographs as they flew over Paris, seeing the city as they could only have ever imagined it before. The time worn pictures, given to the Library of Congress - the research library of the United States Congress - show a bird's eye view of the city. Born in 1825, Giffard became an engineer and carried out research into air balloons. Excited passengers - ready for the off - wave to onlookers.

Installed in the courtyard of the Tuileries, Paris, and surrounded by tethering devices, large winches and ballast, hundreds of men help control the balloon . Because unpowered balloons have little directional control, the airship is surrounded by tethering devices to provide a safe flight over the city and return . He eventually created the world's first passenger-carrying powered and steerable airship, called a dirigible. The hydrogen-filled . airship was equipped with a steam engine that drove a propeller, and a . vertical rudder for navigation. It made its first flight on . September 24, 1852, travelling from Paris to Trappes and covering 16.78 . miles at a speed of 5.6 mph. Giffard also invented an injector to . feed water into a steam-engine boiler to prevent it running out of steam . when not in motion and the money from this invention bankrolled the building of another airship in 1855. Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and crash-landed on its first flight.

"Former Liverpool manager Graeme Souness believes Nemanja Matic is better than retired Chelsea defensive midfielder Claude Makelele. Souness lists Matic's  hold-up play, sense of danger and 'constant threat' among the reasons why the 26-year-old is greater than the man that inspired the position to be dubbed the 'Makelele Role'. 'Maybe only when you play with him do you appreciate how good he is.

"'What a real mum looks like': Kate cradles her post-baby bump as she and William show off their newborn son outside St Mary's hospital yesterday . Her hair was perfectly styled, thanks to the attentions of her personal stylist. She had applied her customary black eyeliner, her cheeks glowed with good health – and her smile threatened to outshine the hundreds of flashbulbs on the pavement outside. But for the mothers watching around the world as the Duchess of Cambridge walked out on to the steps of the Lindo Wing yesterday, the real delight was her ‘mummy tummy’. That neat bump was the only thing which gave away the fact Kate had given birth to an 8lb 6oz boy just a day earlier. And the glowing duchess clearly felt no need to hide it, a decision praised immediately by mothers’ groups. Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said the duchess had dispelled the ‘myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum’. ‘In a couple of minutes on the steps of the Lindo Wing Kate has done more for new mums’ self-esteem than any other role model,’ she said. ‘Sadly, too many celebrities often have ultra-fast tummy tucks or strap themselves down to emerge in tiny size six jeans, leaving everyone else feeling inadequate. ‘Kate shows what a real mum looks like – and natural is beautiful.’ She continued: ‘Undoubtedly over the coming weeks the duchess will work hard to regain her figure, but tonight she’s proved herself a healthy role model for real mums around the world.’ Many mothers took to Mumsnet to share their delight, describing Kate as a ‘role model’ for showing off her mummy tummy. One user wrote: ‘Oh just so lovely … I think she is fantastically brave to not hide her post birth shape. What a great role model she is.’ A second wrote: ‘I loved that Kate didn’t hide her remaining bump. That is what a postnatal woman looks like folks!’ Another added: ‘They both looked fab, and I was also impressed that she didn’t hide the belly, good for her!’ A fourth wrote: ‘I’ve got tears in my eyes here. So glad Kate didn’t try to hide her bump like so many celebrities do. Good for her. ‘I think my own squishy belly was the first immediately post-natal one I’d ever seen. Well done Kate!’ A neat bump: Mothers' groups were delighted at the Duchess's decision not to hide her bump, with Netmums' founder Siobhan Freegard saying she had dispelled the 'myth that all mothers should be perfect postpartum' The sight of Kate still carrying a bump after childbirth will have gladdened the hearts of new mums under pressure to regain their figure. It takes around ten days for the womb to contract back to its normal size, and the Duchess looks ‘completely normal’, according to Clare Byam-Cook, a child care expert. Providing there is not excessive weight gain, most of the pounds gained during pregnancy disappear with the arrival of the baby. The shedding of the placenta – the baby’s life support and nutritional system in the womb – and amniotic fluid also help the body regain its shape. Breastfeeding further  helps weight loss and  assists the womb to contract more quickly. Miss Byam-Cook advised new mothers to relax and enjoy their baby. ‘The weight will, in most cases, take care of itself,’ she said. Twitter was also dominated by women praising Kate for refusing to hide her figure. Stacey Cook said: ‘Nice to see Kate still has a mummy tummy! Not like these skinny celebs who come out stick thin.’ Ju Lincoln wrote: ‘Beautiful royal baby and lovely to see that Kate still has a mummy tummy like all us normal women … I’m still trying to lose mine!’ Indeed, the general agreement last night was that the Duchess of Cambridge looked ‘utterly fabulous’ as she presented her new son to the world. Kate, whose style over the last nine . months has already become a by-word for pregnancy chic, did not . disappoint with her choice of dress. Her bespoke blue polka-dot Jenny . Packham frock looked cool and chic, its empire line cut perfectly . displaying her ‘mummy tummy’. Her . choice of print seemed to be a nod to the dress worn by Princess Diana . on the day she left hospital with Prince William in 1982. She posed on the same steps with her first-born son, wearing a green polka dot dress. 'Utterly fabulous': Women writing on Twitter also hailed the duchess for her choice of dress which revealed the bump . A nod to Diana? The late Princess of Wales posed on the same steps with her first-born son, Kate's husband Prince William wearing a green dress with similar polka dots to the one worn by Kate yesterday . But where Diana appeared nervous and bewildered by the attention – and was said to have burst into tears as soon as she got in the car – the radiant duchess smiled broadly and spoke assuredly to the ranks of camera crews. And while Charles wore a formal pinstripe suit and tie, William opted for a casual shirt, the blue perfectly matching his wife’s dress. And, naturally for this very hands-on new father, the sleeves were rolled up.","Netmum's founder hails Duchess for dispelling myth that new mothers 'should be perfect post-partum'

"It was the quick-fire game show that never gave you a second chance to get it right. But now Fifteen to One is making a comeback some of its old contestants have finally been given another shot at victory. The classic teatime quiz will return to Channel 4 tomorrow afternoon after a break of 11 years. Fifteen to one is set to make a comeback. The show, which originally ran from 1988 to 2003, was seen as one of the most difficult on TV and gathered a loyal following among students and pensioners . While its former host William G. Stewart, 78, has been replaced with Sandi Toksvig, 55, fans of the original show will recognise the same knockout format and fiendish questions. The show, which originally ran from 1988 to 2003, was seen as one of the most difficult on TV and gathered a loyal following among students and pensioners. The most eagle eyed among them may spot a few familiar faces on the new series. Among the new line up of hopefuls are two contestants who were knocked out first time round and are hoping to redeem themselves. Margaret Burton, 68, first appeared in 2000 and made the final three before crashing out. Since then her husband Jon, who watched her performance from the green room, has died. After six years as a widow she found love on an internet dating site and remarried. The retired pub landlady from Lancing, West Sussex said she remembered Mr Stewart as being ‘a little forbidding’. She added: ‘It had always been my idea of a proper quiz show with lots of questions and no gimmicks. I liked the idea of being able to have another go.’ Also hoping for a second shot at the top prize is solicitor David Stainer, 35, from Hertford. When he first competed on Fifteen to One, he was a 20-year-old student at Oriel College, Oxford, making his first TV quiz appearance. While its former host William G. Stewart, 78, has been replaced with Sandi Toksvig, 55, fans of the original show will recognise the same knockout format and fiendish questions . Since then, he has married and had a son, and become a game show veteran. He has appeared on University Challenge, Only Connect and won £64,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? in 2001. He said: ‘I will never forget the question that knocked me out of Fifteen to One. It was “What is the common name of myastotis, the romantic woodland plant?” ‘I now know the answer is Forget-me-not, but my general knowledge is much better now.’ He added: ‘Fifteen To One was always my favourite game show. It is a show for purists because it is so difficult and they don’t waste time. The no-frills set of the new series is similar to the original, and it has the same format in which 15 contestants answer questions on each episode until there is a winner . ‘If anything, it has got harder now because there are more popular culture questions. People may think they are easy, but they require a much broader general knowledge.’ Mr Stewart, who has retired, once claimed he asked 350,000 questions in his 35 series run on Fifteen to One. The no-frills set of the new series is similar to the original, and it has the same format in which 15 contestants answer questions on each episode until there is a winner. The top fifteen scorers of the series will compete in a grand final for a £40,000 top prize. Fifteen to One will start tomorrow at 5.30pm and continue on weekdays at 4.30pm.","The classic teatime quiz will return to Channel 4 tomorrow afternoon .

"The law professor who was shot dead earlier this month, was talking on the phone when his killer followed him into his garage, it has been revealed. As Florida State university professor Dan Markel pulled up to his Tallahassee suburban home in his black Honda Accord, he told the person on the line that someone was in the driveway, sources told ABC News. Just moments later, the killer followed Markel into the garage and hit him with a single gunshot to the jaw and the 41-year-old was pronounced dead just a few hours later. A neighbor heard the gunshot and called 911, telling authorities about a silver Toyota Prius seen fleeing the scene. Out of the blue: It has been revealed that law professor Dan Markel was talking on his phone when he was shot in the head earlier this month . Touota Prius seen nearby: The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . Markel's murder has so far baffled police and surprised family and friends who claim the loving father-of-two had no enemies to speak of and had just begun a new relationship after a painful divorce. However, the targeted nature of his killing has led to some speculation about whether he was the target of a contract killing. The scholar, who was buried in his hometown of Toronto on Thursday, had his critics. Thirty-six . hours before he met his killer, 41-year-old Markel's thoughts were . firmly fixed on his most passionate cause, the death penalty, posting an . essay on the subject to his legal blog. Questioning . the acceptable rate of errors in death penalty cases, Markel's piece . was posted to his widely read PrawfsBlawg on the evening of July 16. Shot dead: Detectives say Florida State University law school professor Daniel Markel was shot in the head inside his garage at home in Tallahassee, Florida on July 18 . It was on this blog that Market was the subject of a threatening post a few years ago . According to the Miami Herald, . Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post, that taken out . of context can seem ominous, but in fact was only a small part of a . wider academic argument. 'Bullies . like this need to be made radioactive,' writes the poster, annoyed at . perceived deletion of posts by Markel on PrawfsBlawg. 'Their arrogance and imperiousness speaks for itself. All means necessary must be employed.' According to the Miami Herald, a Florida State spokeswoman would not confirm or deny whether Markel reported this to the university. Described . as a devoted father to his two sons, Benjamin, five, and Lincoln, four, . Markel was called 'Abba' by them, Hebrew for father. 'The house was like a playpen,' said one of his students, Ryan Wechsler to the Miami Herald. Indeed, by all accounts, the fiercely . intelligent scholar's most important struggle to date was no different . from many others - that of a father trying to keep his family together. Markel's happy home was turned upside down in September 2012 when Adelson filed for divorce. Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father . Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013 . As . the case moved through the courts, Markel's attorney's claimed that . their client was stunned and that Adelson had upped and left the home . with their children while he was away for a short business trip. According to the Miami Herald, Adelson tried to move south from her job as a professor, also at Florida State University, to a private law firm. A judge denied this and their custody issues were still ongoing at the time of his death. For her part, Adelson, through her attorney's has spoken of her total and absolute shock at the death of her ex-husband. Indeed, . the unexplained and clinical nature of the murder has reportedly left . her frightened for her safety and that of her children. Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies . according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by . their friends death . Her . attorney, Jimmy Judkins has said Adelson is in 'shock' and reiterated . that she knew nothing of the killing and had spoken to police already. 'She . is probably more curious about what happened than anybody because while . the police said he was targeted, at one time, it was her house, too,' he said to the Miami Herald. 'It’s just discomforting to her. She’s worried for her children.' New York University law professor Rick Hills told the Toronto Star that he last saw Markel when he came to stay in Manhattan two weeks before his death. Hills . revealed that the Markel was moving on in his life and was now happy in . a new relationship with a woman after going through his divorce. 'He was rebuilding his life after a really, really difficult period,' Hills said.

"British families on a trip to Disneyland Paris had a lucky escape when their coach caught fire in a motorway crash. The 39 passengers had to flee the National Holidays bus after it collided with a tanker and a lorry on the A1 near the French capital on Friday. Moments after the last Briton left the bus the tanker exploded and set it on fire. Firefighters work to extinguish the blaze after a National Holidays coach burst into flames after colliding with a tanker and a lorry near Paris . The 39 passengers had to flee the National Holidays bus after the collision and managed to escape from the explosion . Although none of the passengers was hurt two French people died. Most passengers lost their luggage and passports in the blaze that gutted the coach. Kayleigh Wilkinson and her daughter Amelie-Jayde, four, were among 39 people on board the coach. The 27-year-old, from Stockton, was asleep at the time of the crash on the A1 near Paris. She told the BBC: ‘The next thing I knew was hearing a really loud crash and the bus jolted forward. ‘Bags were going everywhere and people were shouting.’ Kayleigh, who was also travelling with her sister, said the driver had to smash the emergency door as the tanker had come to rest against one side of the coach. Although none of the British passengers, who were on their way to Disneyland Paris were injured, two French people died . She said: ‘A passenger behind us said ‘Everyone needs to get off right now because that tanker is on fire’. ‘Everyone flew to the front of the bus and a gentleman and I were passing children between each other before the adults got off. ‘We were shouting ‘Give me the kids!’ We were throwing children over the door to them to safety.” Moments after all passengers were off, the tanker exploded and engulfed the coach in flames, destroying everyone’s luggage, including many passports. Kayleigh said: ‘Everything’s gone, we literally only have the clothes on our back and our handbags, which had our passports in.” She said National Holidays was providing people with money and supporting all the passengers while arranging trips home. Moments after all passengers were off, the tanker exploded and engulfed the coach in flames, pictured, destroying everyone’s luggage, including many passports . Kayleigh said she had remained determined to get to Disneyland Paris and the family arrived at the park on Saturday. ‘We will try and salvage what we can from this holiday. We are staying; my little girl has been looking forward to this,’ she said. A spokesman for National Holidays said: ‘Our team has worked through the night to get passengers to their destination at Disneyland Paris and provide options for them to return home or continue with their holiday, providing funds and helping to supply replacement clothing for those families whose luggage was damaged. ‘At the moment, the majority of the 39 passengers have opted to stay in Disneyland. ‘Such incidents are, thankfully, rare and we will be working closely with French investigators to establish the facts over the coming days.'","National Holidays coach collided with a tanker and a lorry near Paris .

"A former Las Vegas police officer who was fired for shooting dead an unarmed war veteran will still receive a disability pension totaling around $1 million, it was revealed this week. Jesus Arevalo, 36, is getting thousands of dollars each month from Nevada's Public Employees Retirement System because he was granted a full retirement for a 'stress-related' disability just before he finished up with the department. According to the Las Vegas Review Journal, the disability pension allows Arevalo to collect benefits equaling about 31 per cent of his highest annual pay while on the force. Disability: Jesus Arevalo, 36, pictured last March at a seprate court hearing, is getting thousands of dollars each month from Nevada's Public Employees Retirement System because he was granted a full retirement for a 'stress-related' disability just before he finished up with the department . PERS would not specify the amount, however, the newspaper reports that Arevalo's annual pay averaged $90,275 in his last three years with the department. As such, he can expect between $23,000 and $28,000 per year, with cost-of-living increases, depending on whether his retirement benefits were calculated using his base pay or with overtime. This equates to at least $1 million if he lives to the age of 80. On December 12, 2011, Arevalo fired his AR-15 rifle into Stanley Gibson's barricaded car after mistaking another officer's gunfire as coming from that direction. Gibson was hit four times and died at the scene. The wife of the Gulf War veteran, who suffered from delusions and post-traumatic stress since returning home, received a $1.5 million settlement from the department. The department's internal Use of Force Board recommended Arevalo's firing in May, according to the Review Journal. Arevalo submitted his disability retirement paperwork to the department on July 9, 2012, more than a year-and-a-half after the shooting. Victim: This undated file photo shows Rondha and Stanley Gibson. Stanley Gibson was shot to death by Arevalo on December, 12, 2011, and his wife, left, received $1.5 million compensation from the department . He said he initially wanted to remain with the force, but, with the case against him, it became 'too much.' Arevalo told the newspaper: 'When you're gonna (expletive) lose everything, and there are medical issues stress-wise, and a lot of people are saying, ""Hey, it's not worth it. You need to work on you,"" toward the end, it was just too much.' On September 18, PERS retirement board members, unanimously approved Arevalo's permanent and total disability based on recommendations from his employer, supervisor and doctor. Two weeks later, the department's pre-termination board heard Arevalo's shooting case and agreed he should be fired. He was finally terminated by Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie on October 15. If he had lost his job a month earlier, he wouldn't have been eligible for the disability pension. A member of the PERS board, Chris Collins, executive director of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, said he didn't believe Arevalo was trying to avoid punishment. 'I don't think he ran from discipline,' Collins told the Review Journal. 'Both letters from doctors were saying that this is a gentleman who, from the events in his life, put him in the predicament that he probably shouldn't be a policeman anymore. It made perfect sense to me.' Collins added that knowing the department was planning to fire him may have pushed his stress levels over the edge. Unfair? While Arevalo, pictured making a hand signal, didn't appeal his termination, he said he doesn't believe the department had enough cause to fire him . 'Maybe that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't know,' Collins said. 'Whatever it was that finally pushed him over, his doctor didn't believe he could have worked as a police officer again.' The Review Journal cited a senior officer with knowledge of the disciplinary process as saying that officers facing discipline will retire for a questionable health problem about once a year. 'The whole medical retirement thing, for a lot of people, is a joke,' another officer said, according to the newspaper. While Arevalo didn't appeal his termination, he said he doesn't believe the department had enough cause to fire him. He believes his colleague, Lt. David Dockendorf, who was demoted two ranks, bore as much responsibility for Gibson's death as he did, and the department's radio system, which officials acknowledged wasn't working that night, was also to blame. 'The department tried to paint me as an out-of-control cop, a rogue cop,' Arevalo said. 'It's all Gillespie. He wanted to take heat off a $42 million radio system that failed that night. He wanted to take heat off his lieutenant.' Despite what happened, he said he feels terrible about Gibson's death. 'Someone died because of what I did,' Arevalo said. 'As a Christian, I have to live with that the rest of my life. That should have never happened.'","Jesus Arevalo, 36, is getting thousands of dollars a month from Nevada's Public Employees Retirement System .
The Las Vegas man was granted a full retirement for a 'stress-related' disability just one month before he was fired by the department for shooting dead Stanley Gibson in 2011 .

Now Judy Lewis - the secret love child of film stars Clark Gable and Loretta Young, who conceived her on the set of The Call of the Wild in the 1930s - has died of cancer aged 76. Lewis sensationally revealed in her 1994 memoir Uncommon Knowledge that she was conceived in 1935 when Young, 22, and the married Gable, 34, were shooting the classic movie. Young, a single Catholic woman, concealed her pregnancy and placed her daughter in an orphanage at eight months. She brought her into public view at 19 months, saying she was her adopted child. Terrified her secret would come out, Young did all she could to cover up clues about her daughter's origins. There are no photographs of Lewis up to two. Up to seven they show her wearing a bonnet. Lewis recalled: 'My ears stuck out, just like my father's did. So I had plastic surgery when I was seven. My surgeon had told my mother that an operation of this nature was extremely painful. ‘He suggested it should wait until I was older. But she insisted.' Lewis saw her father, who died in 1960, only once, when she was 15. She said of the encounter: 'As he left, he gave me a kiss on my forehead, but I didn't know he was my father. I cry when I watch his films. Why didn't he ride up on a white horse and rescue me?' Scroll down for video . Old Hollywood: Lewis sensationally revealed in her 1994 memoir that she was conceived in 1935 when Loretta Young, 22, and the married Clark Gable, 34, were shooting The Call of the Wild . Secret: Loretta Young is pictured with Judy Lewis in 1944, who did not know for years who her father was . There is a Gone With The Wind scene where Gable plays affectionately with his fictional daughter. 'I like to imagine that he was thinking of me when he was playing those scenes,’ Lewis said. She added that perhaps the famous 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn' was a truer reflection of his feelings towards her. ‘At the time, what Loretta Young did was completely successful,’ said Leonard Maltin, a film critic and Hollywood historian. ‘The general public never had any inkling that she had done this. It protected her stardom and her image as a wholesome young woman.’ In 1940, Young married Thomas Lewis, and Judy Lewis took his surname - but she was never formally adopted by her stepfather. Mother and child: Loretta Young is pictured centre with Judy Lewis, left, and a grand-daughter, in 1982 . Disguised: There are no photographs of Judy Lewis up to two. Up to seven they show her wearing a bonnet . Mummy: Her parenthood was an open secret in Hollywood but Lewis's friends were told not to tell her . 'It was very difficult for me as a little girl not to be accepted ... by my mother, who to this day will not publicly acknowledge that I am her biological child,' Lewis said in 1994. 'As he left, he gave me a kiss on my forehead, but I didn't know he was my father. I cry when I watch his films. Why didn't he ride up on a white horse and rescue me?' Judy Lewis . Her parenthood was an open secret in Hollywood but Lewis's friends had been instructed not to tell her. It wasn't until Judy's wedding that her groom Joseph Tinney finally told her that Gable was her father. She was 23. She explained: 'I grew up surrounded by rumours that Clark Gable was my father. Everyone knew who my parents were, even my closest friends, but no one dared tell me. 'It wasn't until the night before I was to get married that my future husband told me who my father was. I had told him my suspicions about my mother being my real mother and that I didn't know who my father was. One meeting: Judy Lewis saw her father Clark Gable, who died in 1960, only once, when she was 15 . No father: Terrified her secret would come out, Young tried to cover up clues about her daughter's origins . ‘He then said: “I know everything. It's common knowledge, Judy. Your father is Clark Gable”.’ 'Twenty-three years of my life had passed and everyone in the world knew about me - but me. I cried then. And I have been crying for most of my life,' said Judy, who had years of therapy. 'Twenty-three years of my life had passed and everyone in the world knew about me - but me. I cried then. And I have been crying for most of my life' Judy Lewis . She was born in Venice, California, and went on to perform on Broadway and TV in her own career. Lewis also produced the soap opera ‘Texas,’ a spinoff of ‘Another World.’ In the 1980s, she earned psychology degrees, advocating for children's rights and counselling teenagers. She later became a psychotherapist in Los Angeles, something she pursued until her illness. In 1994, she wrote ‘Uncommon Knowledge,’ acknowledging her parentage publicly for the first time. ‘The situation in which they found themselves in 1935 would not have posed such a problem in the Hollywood of today,’ Lewis wrote in the book.

Party time: Loretta Young is pictured centre with her daughter Judy Lewis, right, in an undated photo . Before her memoir was published, the identity of her parents had long been rumoured. However Mr Maltin said the truth was never truly public until the memoir, in which Lewis describes her mother telling her the truth in 1966. 'Well, he was your father. He was darling. Sweet and very gentle. He . was married, so when I discovered I was pregnant with you, I was . frantic and terrified. It would have ruined both our careers, a scandal . like that' What Judy Lewis remembers being told by Loretta Young . In the book, Lewis said Young told her then: 'Well, he was your father. He was darling. Sweet and very gentle. ‘He was married, so when I discovered I was pregnant with you, I was frantic and terrified. It would have ruined both our careers, a scandal like that.’ Young, one of Hollywood's most glamorous screen goddesses of the Thirties and Forties, died in 2000 aged 87. Gable died in 1960 aged 59. Lewis, a psychotherapist and actress, of Palm Springs, California, died in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, on Friday. Her survivors include her daughter, three half-brothers and her partner, Steve Rowland.

"Out of work: Chris Hansen, the longtime host of Dateline and To Catch a Predator, has not had his contract renewed by NBC . The host of 'To Catch a Predator' has been dropped by NBC after working for the network for 20 years. It was announced on Monday that Chris Hansen will not have his contract renewed by NBC and the network gave no explanation for the decision. The move comes just three weeks after his mistress released photos to RadarOnline of her kissing the married TV host, which she said she made public to counter his dismissal of the relationship. Hansen previously said reports of the affair had been 'full of hurtful lies' but 32-year-old Kristyn Caddell proved otherwise with the photo of them kissing. Miss Caddell met 54-year-old Hansen in Palm Beach, Florida, when she was a news reporter for NBC affiliate WPTV. She claimed he led her to believe his 20-year marriage to Mary Joan was ending and he was therefore able to date. The affair was initially reported two years ago by The National Enquirer, but it was not until Friday when any action was taken on part of the network. In his two-decade career at NBC, Hansen has won seven Emmys for his work, as well as a number of awards for excellence in journalism. 'Chris has been a valued member of the team and we thank him for his many contributions to Dateline and NBC News over the last 20 years. We wish him the very best,' NBC said in a statement. Caught on camera: Kristyn Caddell says this photo, allegedly showing Chris Hansen and her kissing, proves their relationship . He already alluded to his future plans, putting out a statement at the same time as the NBC release and saying that he is looking into 'hosting and executive producing projects that will be announced in the coming months'. Hansen, a father of two sons who is best known for his show that worked to arrest sex predators, had previously claimed evidence showing his alleged affair was just a picture of him going out to dinner. 'I understand the perceived irony of the, you know, so-called ""gotcha guy"" getting gotcha-ed,' he said in March last year. 'But what the ""gotcha guy"" got gotcha-ed doing was going out to dinner.' The National Enquirer had revealed the affair after the pair were recorded enjoying a romantic dinner at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Manalapan, before spending the night at Miss Caddell's Palm Beach apartment. Marital woes: Hansen, seen here with his wife Mary Joan in 2007, initially denied the claims of his affair when they came out two years ago . However, in images Miss Caddell has released, Hansen is shown kissing her. She claims he did not try to hide their relationship at the time, and she believed it was public knowledge before the Enquirer exposed it. 'Chris was flying me all over the country; putting us up in the finest hotels; having dinner and mingling with many of his colleagues; having our photographs taken together in public places ... Chris gave me no reason at all to believe our relationship was a secret and I trusted him explicitly,' she said in an open letter to the Enquirer earlier this month. Miss Caddell said she decided to release the images because the affair was still affecting her ability to find work. She told the National Enquirer that potential employers told her they were put off because of the negative publicity surrounding her. His work: Hansen was best known for his 'gotcha' show To Catch a Predator . 'For the past two years, I was told that it would be in my best interests not to say anything. Let it blow over. Just keep trying to truck along and keep trying to get jobs. “But we are here two years later and I probably don’t go a day without an employer tell me they do not want to hire me because of the situation involving Chris Hansen.' She added: “I thought by not saying anything, and Chris advised me that it would be in my best interest not to say anything, that I would continue to go and and my life would go back to normal. My life has been the exact opposite of that.'

"More than a dozen men who survived the worst sea disaster in U.S. naval history - the World War II sinking of the USS Indianapolis - have gathered in the cruiser's namesake city for the final large-scale reunion of the famed ship's dwindling number of survivors. Thirty-eight of the 317 men who survived the ship's July 1945 sinking and five days in the Pacific's shark-infested waters are still alive, but they're now in their late 80s and early 90s and many use wheelchairs. Harold Bray, an 86-year-old from Benicia, Calif., said he and the 14 other survivors attending this year's reunion decided Friday that any future gatherings will be smaller and less frequent because so many of the survivors are in poor health. Doomed: The USS Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in the South Pacific in 1945. Many crewman survived the blast only to be eaten by sharks . 'We decided to stay together until the last guy's standing, but the goal is to continue at a smaller scale,' said Bray, chairman of the USS Indianapolis Survivors Organization. 'Some of the guys are in wheelchairs now and travel is pretty tough for them.' Bray said the survivors will nonetheless keep telling the story of the ship's sinking, their survival and the role they played in helping bring the war to a close. The USS Indianapolis was halfway between Guam and the Philippines in shark-filled waters when a Japanese submarine sank it with torpedoes on July 30, 1945, in the war's closing weeks. 'Whoom. Up in the air I went,' Loel Dean Cox, who was just 19 when the ship was torpedo, told the BBC about the first explosion. 'There was water, debris, fire, everything . just coming up and we were 81ft (25m) from the water line. It was a . tremendous explosion. Then, about the time I got to my knees, another . one hit. Whoom' The second torpedo nearly tore the ship in half. Cox said fires raged below deck as the ship began listing onto its side. Rescue: Of the 1,197 men aboard the Indianapolis when it sank, only 317 survived after nearly a week lost at sea . 'I turned and looked back. The ship was headed straight down. You . could see the men jumping from the stern, and you could see the four . propellers still turning. 'Twelve minutes. Can you imagine a ship 610ft long, that's . two football fields in length, sinking in 12 minutes? It just rolled . over and went under.' Just days earlier, the Indianapolis had visited the island of Tinian in a secret mission to deliver the uranium-235 and other components for the atomic bomb later dropped on Hiroshima by the Enola Gay, which took off from the remote island. The Indianapolis' mission was so secret she sailed alone, unescorted by ships better equipped to detect and fight Japanese submarines. The ship's commander had even requested an escort but was denied by Navy officials. Additionally, the Navy failed to pass on information that Japanese submarines were still active in the area. Survivors: The crew of USS Ohio salute during a special burial ceremony at sea for Indianapolis survivor Eugene Morgan . 'I never saw a life raft. I finally heard some moans and groans and . yelling and swam over and got with a group of 30 men and that's where I . stayed,' Cox said. 'We figured that if we could just hold out for a couple of days they'd pick us up.' The Indianapolis sent several SOS signals before it became submerged, but the message wasn't taken seriously. Nor did Navy officials take much notice when the ship failed to arrive at its destination on time. An estimated 900 of the ship's servicemen survived the vessel's nighttime sinking, but before rescuers arrived five days later, drowning, delirium, dehydration and shark attacks had claimed all but 317 of the men. The Indianapolis' death toll - 880 members out of a crew of 1,197 died - is the U.S. Navy's worst single at-sea loss of life. But reports of the tragedy were buried by the news of the Japanese surrender, and interest in the ship's story was not revived until the 1975 movie ""Jaws"" featured a character who told of the sinking and the survivors' days of agony. The sharks came from miles away to feast on the carnage from the wreck. They then started eating those who had survived the explosions. 'We were sunk at midnight, I saw [a shark] the first . morning after daylight. They were big. Some of them I swear were 15ft . long,' Cox said. Justin Wray, left, a Navy recruiter in Indianapolis, speaks to USS Indianapolis survivor Clarence Hershberger . 'They were continually there, mostly feeding off the dead . bodies. Thank goodness, there were lots of dead people floating in the . area. 'We were losing three or four each night and day,' Cox said. 'You were constantly in fear because you'd see 'em all the time. Every . few minutes you'd see their fins - a dozen to two dozen fins in the . water. 'They would come up and bump you. I was bumped a few times - you never know when they are going to attack you.' As the sharks continued to attack, clouds of blood in the water grew and attracted more to the area, leading to even more attacks. 'In that clear water you could see the sharks circling. Then every now . and then, like lightning, one would come straight up and take a sailor . and take him straight down. One came up and took the sailor next to me. It was just somebody screaming, yelling or getting bit,' Cox said. Edgar Harrell, an 89-year-old from Clarksville, Tenn., who is one of only two ex-Marines among the remaining survivors, said the horrors he witnessed - including sharks devouring men around him - became too much for him to bear after he returned home. Reunion: 38 of the Indianapolis' 317 survivors are still alive. In their 80s and 90s, many are now in poor health . While many survivors kept what they saw and heard to themselves, Harrell said the lingering trauma he'd suffered left him unable to focus on the college courses he enrolled in immediately after the war. 'I learned early on that you had to get it out, you had to tell others what happened,' he said. 'Once I did it was a relief.' Clarence Hershberger, an 87-year-old survivor from De Leon Springs, Fla., who uses a wheelchair, hadn't planned on attending the reunion, which ends Sunday. He'd been feeling poorly but decided Monday to make the trip to Indianapolis, where a black granite memorial honors the ship and its crew. He said that when all of the survivors are gone he hopes the survivors' relatives and others keep reminding the public about the ship and its crew's sacrifice. 'Somebody's got to keep the story alive,' Hershberger said. Among the roughly 250 friends and relatives of the survivors attending the reunion is Hunter Scott, whose seventh-grade history project as a 12-year-old from Pensacola, Fla., helped lead to a reassessment of the court-martial of the ship's commanding officer, Rear Admiral Charles B. McVay III. McVay was court-martialed for not sailing a zigzag course to evade submarines, but his men believed he was made a scapegoat. In 2000, 32 years after McVay committed suicide, Congress passed an act clearing his name. Scott is now a 28-year-old Navy helicopter pilot based in California and he said the men's incredible story of survival convinced him to enlist in the Navy. 'There's 38 of them left and I really wanted to see these guys and catch up. They're like grandfathers to me, it's like seeing family,' he said.

"Muslim preacher Robert 'Musa' Cerantonio has taken to the internet to post a string of new extremist messages assuring would-be Islamic State fighters that even if they are killed by a woman they will still go to paradise. The self-styled 'fake sheik' from Melbourne, who  has an online cult following, was deported from the Philippines in July and has been under close police surveillance since his return to Australia. The 29-year-old has taken to his account to post his new rants in response to reports  that ISIS fighters fear they will not meet 72 virgins in paradise if they are killed by Kurdish female fighters. Extremist preacher Robert 'Musa' Cerantonio has taken to a new blog to express his latest set of views . Taken from the Turkish city of Mursitpinar this shows the fighting going on in Kobane, Syria . A rocket fired by Islamic State militants to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters' positions from Kobane . Turkey is pursuing a delicate but potentially dangerous strategy over the besieged Syrian town of Kobane . This is one of the latest pictures of war-torn West Aleppo, Syria after a reported US led air strike . Mr Cerantonio says in his latest post on an online blog that is 'utter nonsense'. He said: 'There is absolutely nothing in Islam which teaches that a person cannot go to Paradise if killed by a woman. 'In fact the opposite is more likely to be true, that a person who is killed and dies as a martyr who fought for the sake of Allah is guaranteed a place in Paradise regardless of the gender of the one who kills him.' He explains it is 'well known' Prophet Mohammed died after being poisoned by a woman. A picture of female Kurdish fighter only known as 'Rehana' went viral earlier this year after it was reported she had killed 'scores' of IS fighters. The photo of the young girl, wearing military gear and holding a gun, and showing a victory salute went viral, it was reported she had been beheaded by IS but the rumours turned out to be false. Cerantonio (pictured) talks about how jihadi fighters will still go to Paradise if they are killed by a woman, Kurdish fighter 'Rehana' (pictured right) was supposedly beheaded by IS but the reports were incorrect . Police say that although his social media postings are 'considered offensive and disturbing' but have not breached Australian law . Cerantonio was arrested in central Filipino city of Cebu and later released back to Australia in July . Mr Cerantonio added: 'So rather than being a barrier to entering Paradise it is proven that the best of mankind who is promised Paradise was a martyr who died due to the attack of a woman.' Professor Greg Barton, an expert in radicalisation from Monash University told the Herald Sun that Certantonio's 'charisma and communication skills' were a dangerous threat rather than his intellectual skills. Cerantonio was born in Melbourne and converted to Islam when he was 17. His Twitter account, which boasted around 6000 followers, was closed down in September. A spokesman for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'We do not discuss individuals who may or may not be of interest to Victoria Police. 'In saying this we would also like to advise that the safety of all Victorians is of the highest priority for Victoria Police. 'We remain committed to working collaboratively with the community and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety and security of the Victorian public.'","Muslim preacher Robert 'Musa' Cerantonio has re-appeared online .

"Details have emerged of a regime of 'enforced happiness' at Pret A Manger, where staff earning little more than the minimum wage are monitored to ensure they are relentlessly cheerful behind the counter. The bizarre 'emotional labour' rules mean employees of the popular sandwich chain are expected to be 'charming', to 'have presence', and to 'care about other people's happiness', and should never be 'moody', or 'just here for the money'. Mystery shoppers visit branches every week to ensure all staff are displaying 'Pret perfect' behaviour. Pret perfect! The ideal employee 'cares about other people's happiness' and is not 'just here for the money', according to a list of Pret 'behaviours' that has been removed from the chain's website . While 'friendly' and tactile employees who high-five colleagues as encouragement and 'create a sense of fun' would be welcomed by the chain, Pret does not want to see a team-member who doesn't interact with others or 'minces words'. The firm's chief executive, Clive Schee, has previously said that whenever he visits a Pret branch the first thing he checks is whether staff are touching one another, declaring: 'I can almost predict sales on body language alone'. CEO: Clive Schee has said he checks to see whether staff are touching each other when he visits Pret branches . If staff at a Pret branch get a positive report after a visit from a mystery shopper, the whole team gets a bonus. But should the visitor encounter an employee who is insufficiently 'enthusiastic', or worse, 'bad-tempered', everybody misses out. Details of the chain's list of 'Pret perfect' behaviours emerged online after an essay in the London Review of Books exposed its reliance on 'affective' or emotional labour, a term used to describe work carried out with the aim of producing a - usually positive - emotional response in a person. It flagged up the list of more than 50 'behaviours' drawn up by the chain as part of its efforts to ensure its staff make customers feel good when they visit a store. It appears the list, which included 17 things Pret 'don't want to see', 18 they 'want to see', and 17 under the heading 'Pret perfect!', has since been taken down from the firm's website. Pret said its guidelines are for internal use only. A spokesman for Pret said: 'The reason guidelines are not published on the website is that they are for internal use for staff and the website is an external facing platform for communications with customers.' Pret's policy also raised eyebrows in the U.S., where another blog post on Newrepublic.com said of the list: 'Pret doesn't merely want its employees to lend their minds and bodies; it wants their souls too.' Pret came under scrutiny after an employee who was sacked from the branch at York Way, near St Pancras Station, towards the end of last year, for making homophobic comments towards a colleague. Andrej Stopa appealed, claiming the real reason he was fired was because he had spearheaded the establishment of an independent union for Pret workers. 'This member of staff was dismissed for bullying and homophobic behaviour,' said Pret spokesman Keith Beech. 'He went through the appeals process and it was decided in Pret's favour.' Mr Beech pointed out that the independent union for Pret workers, Pamsu, had fewer than ten members, and added that employees were free to join any union they chose. He said the practice of sending mystery shoppers to visit Pret branches was well-established. 'They send people to go into each shop and make sure that customers are being looked after,' he said. He added that it was a way of giving Pret staff cash incentives to provide good customer service.","Pret staff must 'be charming', 'have presence', and create a 'sense of fun'

"For more than a decade her identity has been a mystery. But new technology could mean that 'Jane Doe', a woman who was found burned and beaten to death, would finally be identified. Forensic investigators have exhumed the body of the unidentified murder victim, who was discovered in a Milwaukee cornfield in July 1999. A computer generated image of Jane Doe, the murdered woman who has never been identified . Using state-of-the-art technology, researchers could find out vital information about her life in the months and even years leading to her death, the Milwaukee Winsconsin Journal Sentinel said. Her body has been transferred to the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office, where tests will be carried out. This could lead to authorities finally tracking down those behind her brutal death, the Journal Times reported. In December the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an updated photo of the victim, but police have still not been able to identify her and no relatives have come forward.

'Anytime you cannot identify a victim your back is literally against a wall,' Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said in December. 'This is someone's loved one. It's important for us to provide closure to that family. We don't even know who she is at this point.' 'We determined with our forensic artist to do another rendering of a composite to try to make it as accurate as possible to how this child would've appeared,' said Bob Hoever of the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Jane Doe was 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 120 pounds. She had reddish brown, collar-length curly hair with highlights and most likely had brown eyes. She had double pierced ears and her left ear had a deformation consistent with 'cauliflower ear'. Her teeth were in poor condition, with her front teeth slightly protruding. She was found wearing black sweatpants and a man's grey country western-style shirt.

"Children at a Jewish primary school have told of their terror at being threatened in the street as fears grow of another Paris-style Jihadist attack. Teachers have stepped up security measures after pupils aged ten were told they would be ‘beaten up’ during a school trip. Now children at the North London school are practising how to hide under their desks if a terrorist breaks into their classroom and opens fire. A police officer waves to a child as members of the Jewish community wait to cross a road in north London - Police have been working closely with Jewish organisations to step up security arrangements after Paris . The drill, called ‘sleeping lions’ shows the children how to cover their heads with their hands and remain silent so as not to give away their hiding place. The school has also installed CCTV and drafted in police to give training to staff on what to do if a gunman storms the building. The primary, which is not being named for security reasons, said the new measures were necessary in the wake of the terrorist atrocities in France. And the head teacher said that other Jewish schools were adopting similar plans after being contacted by worried parents. A school leader who asked to be known simply as Rabbi Jacob told the Daily Mail: ‘There have been two incidents of verbal abuse in the last year. ‘That’s what brought me to understand that we might now be living in a different environment compared with previous years. ‘The fear is that those people who are making nasty comments might decide to take it one step further and harm a child.’ The Rabbi said teachers were shocked when several 10-year-old pupils were targeted while on a school trip in July. A group of men in their early 20s approached the children and told them they would be ‘beaten up’ unless Israel freed Palestine. In October, antisemitic abuse was shouted at an 11-year-old boy while he rode the tube to school. In the wake of the incidents, children have been ordered to wear baseball caps rather than their traditional skullcaps so that they cannot be identified as Jewish. The primary school, which is not being named for security reasons, said the new measures were necessary in the wake of the terrorist atrocitiy at a Kosher deli in Paris earlier this month when four hostages were killed . He added: ‘The children didn’t even understand why they were being shouted at. They’re too young to know about the politics of the Middle East. It was very sad. ‘The fact that someone feels that they have the right to treat a 10-year-old like that is appalling. ‘The idea that every Jew in the world should be responsible for the Middle East is outrageous. ‘Some of the older children are upset about not wearing their skullcaps. They’ve been brought up to be proud of who they are. ‘But we don’t want to take any risks when it comes to their safety.’ One of the pupils told BBC Radio 4: ‘Sometimes I’m very worried about the current situation because after Paris, it could happen to England.’ It comes after four Jewish hostages were killed by Amedy Coulibaly when he targeted a kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this month. Reports claimed that Coulibaly’s intended target had been a Jewish school in the south of Paris. Security agencies on both sides of the Channel warned this week that future attacks were ‘highly likely’. Many Jewish schools in the UK already have robust security thanks to around £1.6 million a year in contributions from parents to help keep pupils safe. New York city mayor Bill de Blasio lays a wreath of flowers at memorial flowers and candles at the kosher grocery where jihadist Amedy Coulibaly killed four people in a terror attack in Paris earlier this month . The Government contributes £2 million per year towards security, while the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors anti-Semitism in Britain, adds about £500,000 each year. A CST spokesman said: ‘We spend an inordinate amount of money on security, particularly on our schools – as we should. ‘Obviously there’s a change in the threat level [after last week’s attacks] as there could be people who might be perversely inspired by what they saw happen.’ In France, 5,000 police officers and army troops have already been stationed outside Jewish schools. Although its figures will not be released until next month, the CST has predicted that the number of anti-Semitic attacks in 2014 will be the highest recorded in the past 30 years in the UK. Earlier this week, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said she was ‘open to conversations’ about toughening up security at Jewish schools amid heightened fear of a terror attack. She said: ‘I think it is truly shocking as the Home Secretary said today that in our lifetimes we are seeing a rise of anti-Semitism in this country and in particular in relation to my role in Government that Jewish schools are having to worry ever more about their security.’ Describing the new drill, one child told BBC Radio 4: ‘When an alarm goes off we do a thing called sleeping lions. ‘We all go under our desks and cover our heads with our hands. ‘Luckily it hasn’t been real yet.’ Another said: ‘You always feel like you have to pretend it’s a real situation and be as silent as possible even though you probably know that there’s no-one there. It’s very important. ‘You know that you are Jewish and lots of people don’t respect that.’","Children at North London Jewish primary school were verbally abused .

"Anyone who has visited a medium, and been astounded by their psychic abilities, will go away wondering the same question: How on earth did they know that? Well, it’s bad news for believers, as one man has gone to extreme lengths to lift the lid on ‘psychics,’ revealing the tricks they use to con innocent people out of thousands of pounds and give them false hope. In his book, Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium, Mark Edward, 62, from Los Angeles, explains how he became a spirit medium and psychic entertainer, then later used these skills to ‘scam the scammers.’ Scroll down for video . Mark Edward appeared on This Morning to reveal the scams and tricks that 'psychic' healers use on innocent people . 'I saw how easy it was and saw it happening. I thought; ""If they can do it I can,""' says Mark Edward of his book Psychic Blues: Confessions of a Conflicted Medium . Mark started his 25-year career in the 'magic of the mind industry', performing in clubs, theatres, and at many corporate events. He says his act was entertainment-based and that he never promised he had genuine magical or spiritual powers. Talking to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield on This Morning, Edward explained how he used his skills to infiltrate those that did claim to have these gifts. He said: ‘People want answers. I saw how easy it was and saw it happening. I thought; “If they can do it, I can.”’ Philip Schofield questions Mark Edward on his expose of psychics and mediums on This Morning, as part of their Supernatural Week . ‘So that’s where the ideas came to get in, to infiltrate and write the book to expose it. ‘I realised the power of charisma and suggestion. I learned about giving readings.’ Edward . unveils the scams that thousands of psychics use, including ‘Cold . Reading,’ where mediums claim to have superior psychic knowledge but . it’s actually based on nothing at all. By . examining their client’s body language and observing what Edward says . are their, ‘random generalities,’ the mediums can quite easily find that . person’s vulnerability. ‘Once you get the hook, everything else falls . into place,’ he said. ‘It’s all pretty standard stuff.’ The more recent trend of seeing a psychic over Skype throws up another common scam that many people aren’t aware of. In . the US the customer will pay in advance by credit card for the psychic . session, upon which the ‘psychic’ on the other end will not only receive . the money but be able to see the payer’s itemised credit card history. They can use this information to make themselves seem more credible. If someone tells you they know exactly . where you brought that new pair of shoes last week, you’d be forgiven . for thinking they were genuine. Fortunately for Brits, whilst the scam is . common practice and perfectly legitimate in the US, using credit card . details in this way is illegal in the UK. Fraud? By examining their client's body language, Mark Edward says medium's can assess their personality and 'hook' them in . ‘It’s not a gift,’ says Edward. ‘It’s maybe a skill. I call it fraud. ‘I have met people who are very intuitive and sensitive but there is nothing supernatural about them. They just assess information that most people don’t think about.’ He also explained how he held séances for purposes of the book, to prove how easy they are to create the illusion that there are supernatural powers. ‘It’s a lot about darkness,’ he said. ‘In pitch black you can suggest all sorts of things. ‘Linking hands creates incredible tension. People want stuff to happen. It’s easy to feel a cold breeze or tap on the shoulder and think no one is in the room. It’s a simple but traditional con.’ Edward justified what he did, saying that performing at an event or children’s birthday party and charging money for the entertainment was one thing, but giving people false hope and leading them to believe things that they actually had no claim over was very different. ‘It’s ok to go to a party and get a palm reading, you don’t expect them to get a hook in you,’ he said. ‘But you’re told that you need another reading, you need to buys this candle, it’s a scam.’","Mark Edward, 62, from Los Angeles, lifts lid on scams used by psychics .

"It takes your eyes, and your brain, a moment to adjust as you move from the dazzling Tanzanian sun into the dusty, dimly lit warehouse. Workers stand by a pile of elephant tusks, systematically weighing each one on a large red Avery scale. Behind them, rows of tall metal shelves recede into the gloom. They are stacked solid with tusks, each pair the sole remnant of a once-magnificent elephant. Cruel trade: Martin Fletcher visits the world's largest ivory stockpile in Tanzania, containing more than 34,000 tusks which would be worth about £150million on China's black market . More tusks lie in sacks on the concrete floor. It is an appalling, sickening sight. This . is the world’s largest ivory stockpile. More than 34,000 tusks weighing . roughly 125 tons are stored in the warehouse behind  the Ministry of . Natural Resources and Tourism in Dar es Salaam. They would be worth . about £150 million on China’s black market. Some were taken from elephants that died naturally or turned rogue. Many thousands were seized from poachers or their middlemen and cannot be sold because international trade in ivory is banned. They are black, brown and dirty white. A few bear the marks of the machetes used to hack them from the elephants. Others were sawn off. The biggest is nearly 7ft long, weighs 191 lb and takes three people to lift. The shortest measure scarcely a foot and were ripped from babies – testimony to the indiscriminate slaughter of the poachers who kill 30 Tanzanian elephants a day and have destroyed half the country’s 110,000 elephants since 2009. Elephant graveyard: Emilian Mhelela, a game scout at the Selous game reserve where the number of elephants have been reduced from 70,000 elephants in 2006 to 13,000 . The stockpile is a shrine to human greed. Its only redeeming feature is that the tusks were intercepted before they were smuggled to Asia, but  the amount of ivory that passes  undetected though Tanzania’s ports  is far greater. The country is easily the world’s biggest exporter of this illicit ‘white gold’. The Mail on Sunday was given exclusive access to the warehouse after publishing an article, just before last month’s London summit on the illegal wildlife trade, that asked how the Prince of Wales and Prime Minister could shake the hand of Jakaya Kikwete, the Tanzanian leader who has presided over such a slaughter. We reported that many politicians, . officials and well-connected businessmen were active accomplices in the . illegal ivory trade, and that there was corruption from top to bottom. The article caused uproar in  Tanzania. A well-placed source said President Kikwete was ‘hopping mad’. His . office denounced the article as ‘malicious, preposterous and . contemptible’. His government consulted British public relations . advisers. But the article had a dramatic effect. Before leaving for the London summit, Mr Kikwete summoned senior wildlife officials, tearing up his prepared notes as he angrily demanded that they do better. Then, at the summit, he astounded the conservation world by announcing that Tanzania would put its vast stockpile ‘beyond economic use’ and support a continued ban on international trade in ivory. That was an astonishing U-turn. Three times in eight years Tanzania had unsuccessfully sought approval from the 180-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to sell its stockpile – despite overwhelming evidence that one-off sales merely fuel China’s appetite for ivory. ‘The article shamed the president in front of the world,’ said one source. ‘He really had to come and say something concrete at the  summit,’ said another. There was one more surprise. Lazaro Nyalandu, the Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, invited The Mail on Sunday to Tanzania. ‘We have nothing to hide,’ he said. My visit included a trip to the Selous game reserve, a spectacularly beautiful wilderness and Unesco World Heritage Site double the size of Wales, where the shocking scale of Tanzania’s poaching frenzy became clear. Selous had 70,000 elephants in 2006. Barely 13,000 survive. At the peak of the onslaught rotting carcasses defiled the reserve’s woodlands, savannahs and swamps, and tourists could hear shooting from their lodges. For the better part of two days,  Benson Kibonde, the reserve’s chief warden, and I jolted  along in a Toyota Land Cruiser, scattering giraffes and impalas, zebras and warthogs, baboons and waterbuck. Countless hippos wallowed  in the swollen brown waters of the Rufiji river. My visit coincided with the rainy season, so the elephants had wandered far from their usual watering holes, but during those two days we saw just  one, a bull who retreated into the bush. Only from the air did we spot more – three here, six there – sad remnants of once abundant herds. Even carcasses are becoming rarer as poachers seek richer pickings elsewhere in Tanzania. The . only one we saw was a month old – a scattering of hefty white bones . picked clean by hyenas and jackals. That is what Selous has become: an . elephant graveyard. ‘It’s a . tragedy,’ Mr Kibonde said. Mr Nyalandu is young, engaging, smartly . dressed and US-educated. He visits the University of Buckingham one . weekend a month to pursue a  Master’s degree in international relations. He is also a good talker. He acknowledged that corruption was ‘huge’ and that The Mail on Sunday article ‘really got a lot of people  thinking’. He . said poaching was the country’s ‘number one national  security problem’ and insisted the president was determined to defeat it. Questioning power: The original Mail on Sunday article that left Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete 'hopping mad', published last month . Not so long ago the Tanzanian government denied there was even a problem. Mr Nyalandu declared that Operation Tokomeza, a very effective military-led crackdown on poachers which was suspended after a month last autumn because of human rights abuses, would soon be relaunched with strict safeguards. He added that his ministry’s wildlife division would be relaunched this year as an autonomous wildlife authority with greater powers. He promised more game scouts with better equipment, tougher penalties for poaching and a crackdown on corrupt port officials, customs officers and police. ‘We are serious about doing everything, and I mean everything, to save the elephants,’ he said. Well, almost everything. What Mr Nyalandu failed to address was the crucial issue of high-level complicity in Tanzania’s illegal ivory trade. Nobody seriously contends that 11,000 elephants a year can be killed in a one-party state with a strong security apparatus, or that their tusks can be spirited across the country and out of its ports, without the help of powerful patrons. Mr Nyalandu himself told the BBC last month that he ‘had the names of politicians, senior people’. The Mail on Sunday has been told that Mr Kikwete received a dossier from his intelligence services last year listing the names and roles of nearly 50 senior politicians, officials and businessmen involved in the ivory trade, most with links to his Chama Cha Mapinduzi party. None has been arrested and convicted. Under threat: Poachers kill 30 Tanzanian elephants a day and have destroyed half the country's 110,000 elephants since 2009 . Nobody accuses Mr Kikwete of involvement in smuggling, but one authoritative source said: ‘He finds it very difficult to go after anybody related to him or his friends.’ Mr Nyalandu also revealed that the destruction of Tanzania’s stockpile was far from certain, despite Mr Kikwete’s London pledge. He said the president was willing to burn it, but in return Tanzania wanted roughly £30 million from the international community for an elephant conservation fund. Potential Western donors scoff at that unrealistically high figure. The warehouse, I discover, is hardly Fort Knox. It has two sliding steel doors with five heavy padlocks whose keys are divided between two chief storemen, but the doors were wide open when I arrived. Each tusk is marked and catalogued, and the warehouse has internal security cameras, but I saw no armed guards outside. Ivory has allegedly been stolen from the stockpile in the past and in 2009 the inventory was destroyed in a mysterious fire. In Selous, at least, there is now a glimmer of hope for the elephants thanks to Mr Kibonde, an ebullient character whose energy and drive belie his 62 years. He is short of weapons, vehicles and manpower, but has started moulding his scouts into a force capable of fighting the poaching gangs. He has imported 220 hand-picked volunteers to boost the 250 existing scouts and has formed 75 six-man patrols. As a result, Mr Kibonde believes the poaching frenzy in Selous is finally starting to abate. ‘Our children will curse us if we don’t do what were supposed to do,’ he says. Now Tanzania desperately needs at national level what Mr Kibonde brings to Selous: strong leadership willing to tackle a corrupt elite. But nobody is holding their breath.","Mail on Sunday's Martin Fletcher goes inside the warehouse in Tanzania .

"Fired: Oxford University graduate Calypso Nash was sacked as a librarian at St Hilda's College for not stopping 30 students performing the internet dance sensation the Harlem Shake . An Oxford University librarian has lost her job after students filmed themselves doing the latest dance craze on her watch. Calypso Nash, 23, was dismissed from St Hilda’s College after a video that shows students noisily performing a ‘Harlem Shake’ in the college library appeared on YouTube. The dance became an internet sensation last month when five Australian teenagers posted online footage of themselves gyrating to a song of the same name, by US artist DJ Baauer. A petition has now been started by students, and the culprits, to have the librarian reinstated as she was 'not in the position to stop it'. Ms Nash was working there that night but had nothing to do with organising the event and had not been asked if it could go ahead. In the video, posted on YouTube, a group of around 30 students are shown studying quietly in the grand surroundings of St Hilda's. Then a youngster dressed as an American footballer is seen dancing before the film cuts to all the students doing the Harlem Shake craze in fancy dress. Another is dressed as a member of the jailed Russian pop group Pussy Riot, while others donned horses heads, a furry badger costume or appeared as weight lifters and a skier. Some were seen dancing in the library aisles, while others were seen standing on chairs and on tables. However, the 30-second long video clip, which has had more than 5,000 views, has sparked outrage amongst the senior staff members of the 120-year-old Oxford University College. All the students who had been identified as taking part in the video have been fined by the Dean. Scroll down for video . Prank: A group of students sit quietly in the library as a person in an American Football helmet dances alone . Change: The YouTube video then cuts to the whole group dancing, but the innocent fun has cost Calypso her job . Librarian and graduate student Calypso Nash was sacked for not preventing the Harlem Shake taking place. Oxford University said: 'This is a matter for St Hilda’s College, they say they do not wish to make a comment at this time.' Today students want Miss Nash back in her job as she just happened to be there at the time and are also calling for the fines to be rescinded as they shot the video late at night as not to disturb anyone studying. At St Hilda's Junior Common Room weekly meeting, students passed a motion calling for the immediate reinstatement of the librarian. As a result of the vote the JCR president Esther Gosling is to 'ask for a written reason for the decision from the Head Librarian, and also to bring the matter to the attention of the governing body, calling in the strongest terms for Calypso to be rehired.' Battle: Students at St Hilda's (pictured) have started a petition to have Miss Nash reinstated as she was powerless to stop it . Miss Gosling will also be writing to the Dean to seek the fines imposed being overturned because 'the Harlem shake did not cause a disturbance coming as it did at 11:30 pm on a Sunday evening - and that the event - only lasted roughly seven minutes.' Ellen Gibson, a student at St Hilda's, said: 'The situation seems ridiculous. 'The Librarian had nothing to do with the protest; she just happened to be there at the time.' Another Hilda's student said of Calypso's sacking: 'She was not in a position to stop them at the time' JCR Secretary Katie Meadon said: 'We are not trying to deliberately undermine any decisions made by college authorities, but we, and the rest of the JCR, believe that the dismissal of the librarian in question was unfair. We hope that the college will take the JCR's opinions into account regarding this matter.' Sacked Miss Nash studied Classics, Ancient Greek and Roman literature, history and philosophyfrom 2008 until 2012. She is now a graduate at St Hilda's College after being awarded an academic scholarship. She was also instrumental as part of a 12-man team that raised over £100,000 pounds as bursaries for prospective St. Hilda's College students in 2011. A member of The Society of Young Publishers she is active in the Oxford University Orchestra and Sinfonietta. She lists her interests as publishing, customer communication, equal opportunities, moral philosophy, literature, classical and contemporary music. Miss Nash has also worked as a customer services officer at Buckingham Palace when one of the Queen's official residents is open to the public.","Calypso Nash has lost her job at St Hilda's College, and students are furious .

"If the soggy start to autumn is getting you down, spare a thought for these poor souls living in the WETTEST place on Earth. Torrents of water turn the streets of Mawsynram in north east India into waterfalls and the constant deluge leaves families plugging leaking homes. Power lines topple under the weight of the cascading rivers, animals seek shelter where they can and locals have learned never to leave home without a brolly. Downpours: Mawsynram in north east India is the wettest place in the world. Villagers have created turtle shell-like covers to protect them from the deluge while they work in the fields . Wettest place on Earth: The village, which lies close to the border with Bangladesh, is battered by an average of 11,871mm, nearly 12metres, of rain a year . Drenched: Locals in the village have learned never to leave home without an umbrella . In a bid to shelter from the downpours villagers have even created specially made reed-turtle shell-like baskets to protect them as they work in the fields. But no-one in the mountainous village, close to the border with Bangladesh, is heard complaining as the monsoons bring a welcome boost as tourists flock to the area and the dry season leaves many facing a desperate hunt for water. While the UK has suffered a wash out in the last week, the hapless villagers in Mawsynram cope with the chaos caused by 11metres or 467ins of rain each year - more than 20 times the average rainfall in London. And neighbouring Cherrapunji - dubbed the second wettest place on earth - does not escape the violent weather. Waterfalls: Torrents of water immerse the village's streets . Boost: The severe downpours do provide locals with a welcome income boost as tourists flock to the area to witness the spectacle . Monsoon: While India's wet season runs from June to September, northern areas like Mawsynram experience an extended monsoon period . In June 1995 the village was hit by the greatest rainful in a 24-hour period when more than 5ft of rain fell. Photographer Johnny Haglund, 47, explained how the villages live under these extreme conditions. 'For the last few years, the streams of tourist to visit Cherrapunji and Mawsynram have increased,' he said. 'They come here to see the rain during the wet season which gives the inhabitants a well needed extra income. 'The locals told me that the dry season is worse than the wet in many ways, because they actually have problems to find water for drinking and washing.' The area of north east India is so wet . because rainclouds, which form in the summer, are trapped from escaping . north into Tibet by the world's highest mountain range, the Himalayas. No complaints: Locals say the dry season, from December to February, is worse, leaving many struggling to find water . Chaos: The violent downpours cause chaos, pulling down power lines and creating treacherous conditions on the roads . India's . main monsoon season runs from June to September, but Mawsynram . experiences a longer rainy season that other parts of the country. It seldom gets hot in the region with average monthly temperatures ranging from 10C in January to just over 20C in August. The noticeably drier months run from December through to February, where monthly precipitation reaches a meager 60mm. 'I always try to catch the daily life as it is when I am not there. I like to show people how a place looks like and how people who live there go by,' Mr Haglund added. 'I try to be a 'fly on the wall', because people often change their behavior when they have guests and know they are being photographer. 'People find these photographs very interesting, we love talking about how bad the weather is here in England, but here we see how people actually cope with extreme weather.' The driest place on Earth, South America's Atacana desert, fails to see even half-an-inch of rainfall each year and some parts of the desert have not seen a rain shower in the last 500 years. How London compares - 558mm .","Himalayas prevent heavy rainclouds escaping north into Tibet .
