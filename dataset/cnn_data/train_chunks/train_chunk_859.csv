"By . Ryan Kisiel . With her aristocratic roots and royal connections, she could have been expected to insist on one of Glastonbury’s more luxurious accommodation options. But that never really was Cressida Bonas’s style. With a mystery man in tow, Prince Harry’s famously bohemian ex-girlfriend arrived at the festival yesterday ready to bed down in the mud with tens of thousands of other campers. Scroll down for video . Joining the party: Cressida Bonas arrives with a mystery man. The 25-year-old later entered through the exclusive hospitality turnstile just in time to see Lily Allen perform . Roughing it: Cressie enjoys a drink with her friends. After pulling up at the site¿s VIP car park at 4.30pm she spent half an hour in her car plaiting her long blonde hair into an easy-to-manage festival style . Casual: Cressie, who rejected claims that she would be 'glamping' completed her relaxed look with an army-style green canvas rucksack slung over her shoulder and blue beanie . Given her determination to rough it, though, she should perhaps have given a little more thought to her outfit – turning up in immaculate white dungarees that were unlikely to fare well in the mudbath. Miss Bonas completed her look with a black zip-up Adidas top and Dr Martens boots, and after pulling up at the site’s VIP car park at 4.30pm she spent half an hour in her car plaiting her long blonde hair. She then entered through the exclusive hospitality turnstile just in time to see Lily Allen perform. With an army-style green canvas rucksack slung over her shoulder, she strolled into Worthy Farm with her unidentified companion, who was rather more sensibly attired in wellies and a thick coat. Miss Bonas, who split from Prince Harry in April after a two-year relationship, chatted and laughed with her friend and was seen sipping on cider as she made herself at home on the site. The 25-year-old rejected claims that she would be ‘glamping’, or staying in luxury camping facilities, and said she was looking forward to camping with friends who had already arrived. Girly giggles: Miss Bonas, who split from Prince Harry in April after a two-year relationship, chatted and laughed with her friend as they joined festival-goers in the field . Fresh-faced: Miss Bonas, daughter of four times married and divorced Sixties socialite Lady Mary Curzon, said that she will be staying with friends who pitched up a tent . Cheers! Cressie sips cider with a friend, dressed in a casual black and white zip-up jumper. The festival was plunged into silence for two hours yesterday after a lightning storm struck . ‘It’s my third Glastonbury,’  added Miss Bonas, daughter of four times married and divorced Sixties socialite Lady Mary Curzon. ‘I’m staying with some friends who have pitched up a tent.’ But whether she will regret that decision remains to be seen. The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours today – making the mudbath on the 900-acre site even worse. And the festival was plunged into silence for two hours yesterday after a lightning storm struck. Organisers cut the power to all stages over fears the structures could be hit by lightning – leaving Rudimental’s performance on the Pyramid Stage cut short. In the mudbath: Their waterproof gear doesn't keep these girls dry. The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours on Saturday . While Miss Bonas was getting into the swing of things in Somerset, her ex-boyfriend was beginning a tour of Chile – and receiving marriage proposals from a woman by the name of Middleton. Harry, 29, was on a walkabout when he was ambushed by TV presenter Bernardita Middleton, who was wearing a  tiara. She said: ‘I am a Middleton – just like Princess Kate. I can be your next wife Harry?’ But unfortunately for this particular Miss Middleton, the prince simply smiled, laughed and moved on. A 26-year-old man who was hospitalised after taking horse tranquilliser ketamine at the festival died yesterday.","Cressida Bonas joins tens of thousands of other campers at Glastonbury .

"By . Paul Hirst . Roy Hodgson touched down in Rio and issued a calming message to those who were unimpressed by England's back-to-back draws against Ecuador and Honduras. England rounded off their week-long stay in Miami with a storm-affected goalless stalemate against Honduras. That draw came three days after England failed to beat Ecuador, who exposed England's defensive frailties on the counter-attack. Scroll down for videos... Keep calm: Roy Hodgson is not concerned by England's results in their warm-up friendlies . Much harder opposition lie in wait for Hodgson's men in Brazil. Next Saturday they face four-time world champions Italy and they then tackle Uruguay before a final game against Costa Rica.Hodgson insists very little should be read in to the friendlies. 'I have to say these warm-up games, I don't know that they necessarily answer many questions,' the England manager said. 'You answer your questions over a long period of time. 'When I look at the other warm-up games I am pretty certain I am not alone in thinking it's just a way of getting yourself to Rio where the real tournament begins.' Referee Ricardo Salazar handed Honduras five yellow cards on Saturday, including two for Brayan Beckeles, who was sent off in the 66th minute for a flying elbow on Leighton Baines. It was therefore something of a surprise that England did not pick up any injuries. There were more plus points too. Danny Welbeck silenced his critics with a good performance. Ross Barkley, Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana did their selection chances no harm either. Below the belt: England  were fortunate not to pick up any injuries during a 0-0 draw with Honduras . Weather or not: The game against Honduras was delayed for 40minutes after an electrical storm in Miami . Four years ago, England arrived at the World Cup in the eye of a storm created by injuries to key players, Fabio Capello's contract negotiations and the embarrassment caused by the Capello Index. This time the squad appears united and their only injury concern is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has travelled to Brazil despite suffering medial knee ligament damage against Ecuador. 'It has been three excellent weeks of preparation,' Hodgson added. 'The squad is growing stronger, they are bonding together very well and the mood is one of quiet optimism and a reasonable degree of confidence. That is all you can hope for. Pick me! Danny Welbeck staked his claim for a starting place against Italy with a decent performance in Miami . 'Now is when the real football begins and I am happy that we are in good spirits and the players have really done as much as we could ask of them.' Jon Flanagan and John Stones have now left after spending the last three weeks with the squad. The standby duo have been told they could be called up at any time though if Oxlade-Chamberlain does not demonstrate sufficient progress in his recovery from the injury to his right knee. Hodgson has until Friday to decide whether he will replace Oxlade-Chamberlain, and for now he is positive about the midfielder's chances of playing some part in the tournament. Waiting game: Hodgson is confident that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will return to fitness for the tournament . 'That is what we are hoping for,' he said. 'But there are still a few assessments to be made on him so I wouldn't want to suggest that is a stone-wall certainty.' After their overnight flight from Miami, England were due to check into their hotel near Ipanema beach on Sunday afternoon. Preparation for the Italy game will begin in earnest on Monday, when England will hold a fully-open session at their training centre at the Urca military base in the shadow of Rio landmark Sugar Loaf mountain. Will Rooney start? Hodgson claims he knows his starting XI for the opening game against Italy on June 14 . o after three weeks together, does Hodgson have a firm idea of his starting XI for the Italy game? 'Pretty much, yeah,' he said. 'In these three games certain players have performed better than others. Now we will have to start thinking about (the group) games. 'Whatever team I decide to use against Italy will be very, very competitive and I am sure we will show the discipline and organisation we showed (against Honduras).","Roy Hodgson is not concerned by England's results in their World Cup warm-up friendlies .

"By . Lizzie Parry . The first cream to treat erectile dysfunction is now available on prescription in the UK, giving hope to those unable to take Viagra and other treatments. The new cream, called Vitaros, comes in a single use, disposable applicator and is suitable for the 2.3million men over the age of 18 facing sexual function problems. The pre-prescribed amount of cream is applied to the tip of the penis, and once absorbed into the skin claims to produce an erection within five to 30 minutes. Men in the UK are the first in the world to have access to the new cream, which contains the drug alprostadil. The first cream to treat erectile dysfunction is available on prescription in the UK, giving hope to the millions of men suffering sexual function issues across the country . Oral drugs are also often not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack. They may also cause a number of generalised side effects, such as severe headaches, blurred vision and dizziness. In a recent survey of 250 men in the UK diagnosed with ED, 35 per cent suffered side effects from their taking a pill. However the majority of those men, 68 per cent, continued with their treatment just so they can continue to achieve an erection. As the cream is applied directly to the genitals these generalised side effects are considered unlikey, experts say. They say any side effects from using Vitaros are localised to the site of application and tend to be mild and short-lived. Dr David Edwards, a GP in Chipping . Norton, and President of the British Society for Sexual Medicine, said: . 'The availabilty of Vitaros is an exciting milestone in erectile . dysfunction treatment. 'Many . men miss out on the chance of treatment because they either cannot . tolerate a pill or simply do not want to take one, or are put off by the . existing forms of alprostadil, such as an injection into the penis or a . pellet inserted into the uretha. 'The importance of finding the right treatment for the right person cannot be underestimated. The cream is only available on prescription and is self-administered after verbal instructions from a healthcare professional. Many men suffering erectile dysfunction and prescribed oral treatment, such as Viagra, experience side effects including dizziness, severe headaches and blurred vision. Experts say the new cream is likely to have far fewer side effects . Many ED treatments, including Vitaros, are currently restricted on the NHS, meaning not all men will be deemed eligible for the treatment. However those who do require treatment for ED but fall outside the requirements for a free NHS prescriptions may still be able to receive private prescriptions for the cream. Erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect half of all men between the ages of 40 and 70 at some point. In some cases the condition can lead to relationship issues, poor self-esteem, anxiety and depression, all of which can exacerbate the original problem. Despite the negative impact ED can have on a man's life, another recent UK study revealed 80 per cent of the 250 men questioned had problems for longer than a year before seeking help. Experts advise seeking help from a healthcare professional as ED can be an early warning sign for serious conditions such as cardiovascular disease, indicating a man could be at risk of angina or heart attack in the next three to five years.","Vitaros comes in a single use, disposable applicator prescribed by GPs .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A second-time mother gave birth to her daughter while sitting on the toilet, hearing a splash before discovering her newborn in the water. Tracey Fryer, from Rotherham in Yorkshire, felt no pain, contractions or any signs of labour when she delivered tiny Peyton two weeks before her due date. The 26-year-old mistakenly thought she needed to go to the loo, before retrieving her daughter from the toilet bowl. 'I was in complete shock, I heard a big splash so I looked down in between my legs and could see my baby,' said Mrs Fryer. Tracey Pryer was shocked when she gave birth to her daughter Peyton while on the toilet at her Rotherham home. She shouted for husband Karl, who rushed to clear the newborn's airways . 'My mum shouted up and asked if I was okay - but all I could reply with was, ""no I’ve had her"". 'My husband, Karl, came running straight in and was acted so quickly - he was like a real life super daddy. 'I don’t know what I would’ve done without him. 'He . grabbed Peyton out of the toilet - I was panicking as she wasn’t crying . but Karl cleared her airways and she let out a huge scream, it was such . a relief.' Baby Peyton was due on Saturday, but because Mrs Fryer is a diabetic she was booked in to be induced on May 19. But two days before she was due to go to hospital, Mrs Fryer unexpectedly gave birth at home. She said: 'I couldn’t wait to give birth to my baby, I knew she was a girl since finding out her sex when we went for our 20-week scan. 'On May 17, I woke up and it was like any other day - I was in no pain whatsoever. 'But when I went to the toilet, I sat down and gave one little push and I felt something come flying straight out of me. Mrs Pryer, 26, said she heard a splash and looked down to see Peyton in the water . 'Luckily I live with my mum and she phoned 999 while Karl was seeing to me and Payton. 'The paramedics came and we were whisked off to the hospital and stayed in overnight so we could be monitored. 'Fortunately we were both fine - Peyton was a healthy baby girl weighing 6lbs 11oz. 'I was in complete shock for a while and prayed for Peyton to be healthy - now I can see the funny side though but I just can’t believe my baby was born in the loo.' The full time mum and carer married her childhood sweetheart Karl, 25, - who suffers from epilepsy - back in 2008. The couple already have 14-month-old baby girl Midina and couldn’t wait for the extra addition to arrive to complete their family. Mrs Fryer, said: 'When I gave birth to Midina the whole ordeal was completely different - I was in labour for over nine hours and was in so much pain. 'That’s why Peyton was such a shock - I was expecting to go through a similar experience but instead she couldn’t wait and slipped straight out within seconds. 'She’s our little miracle toilet baby - the doctors were amazed and found it hilarious. 'Our baby girl is one week old and despite her unexpected arrival in the toilet she never stops smiling.'","Tracey Fryer was due to give birth to her daughter on Saturday, May 31 .

"By . Carol Driver . It’s the type of job most youngsters can only dream about. But now No Man’s Land Fort is searching for a manager - who will count sailing, fishing and sabrage in their skills set. A day at the office will start with a commute to the middle of the Solent - arriving by speedboat or helicopter to the venue – which looks like a hideout for a James Bond villain. Scroll down for video . No a bad office: No Man's Land Fort in the Solent is looking for a new manager . Out to sea: The private island, which is opening as a resort in the autumn, was built between 1867 and 1880 . The chosen candidate will be looking after the AmaZing Venues property – one of three 19th-century Grade II-listed buildings in the Solent. The luxury ‘citadel in the sea’ boasts 22 bedrooms, a museum, gym, nightclub, pool room, two helicopter pads, a lighthouse, rooftop hot pool and even a street complete with cobbles. The job also includes arranging grandiose get-togethers – including hosting laser fort parties. Traits the ideal candidate must possess include being able to work on their own initiative – as the nearest neighbours are separated by more than a mile of sea. The post, which starts before the fort - between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight - opens its doors as a holiday venue in the autumn, is billed as ‘the envy of every sailor in the Solent’. Luxury resort: How No Man's Land Fort will look based on its sister property Spitbank . No Man's Land: The fort lies in the Solent between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight . Reporting to the general manager of Solent Forts, the position, according to AmaZing Venues, is: ‘Suited to a luxury hospitality expert, with a keen eye for detail, exceptional customer service skills, experience of managing large venues and teams and hosting grandiose get-togethers.’ Duties include: Clearing the seagulls from the fort’s two helicopter pads; Testing the guns in the laser tag playground; Going to the top of the lighthouse tower to check the bulb; and Testing the temperature is suitable for guests in the rooftop hot pool. And applications can be submitted online via the holiday company's website, although the company has not revealed what the salary is for the position. Mark Watts, General Manager of Solent Forts, said: 'We are looking for someone as special as the venue itself – someone who can really rule without being a tyrant! 'No Man’s Land is the second fort we’re opening to the public in our collection and we need someone who will take care of the day-to-day running of the fort and provide the excellent customer service that our wider collection of properties is known for. 'A sturdy pair of sea legs is essential for the commute too.' Boasting armour-plated granite and steel walls, the Victorian sea fort off the coast of Portsmouth was originally built to house nearly 80 soldiers to fend off an attack from the French navy. More than a century later, it has spent its life as a luxury hotel and was sold again in 2008 – expected to fetch up to £4m. Morning commute: The chosen candidate will get to work by boat or helicopter . Luxury interior: Inside the fort's sister property Spitbank Fork - which is how the new resort will look . The . imposing fort was one of a string of fortifications along the south . coast ordered by Victorian Prime Minister Lord Palmerston who feared an . attack from Napoleon III. Built between 1861 and 1880 it needed a huge engineering effort to cut vast blocks of granite and transport them by barge to the building site, before they were lowered onto the sea bed for its foundations. It was built complete with lighthouse and emplacements for 49 cannon. The fort is nearly 200 feet across and rises 60 feet from the sea. Its water supply comes from a borehole sunk into the seabed and it has its own electricity generators. Its sunken inner centre is screened from the elements by a glass roof and its interior now contains all modern luxuries. As well as the themed bedrooms such as the history of Concorde room, it boasts jacuzzis, a gym, a roof garden and two restaurants. The exotic location is well known to passengers on the Isle of Wight ferry and has also featured as a backdrop to a 1971 Dr Who adventure called The Sea Devils starring Jon Pertwee. During the Second World War the fort housed anti-aircraft guns but was decommissioned in 1957. It was turned into a private residence in the 1990s before its reinvention as a luxury hotel and an events and hospitality venue to be used by businessmen to entertain their clients.","Candidate must count sailing fishing and sabrage in skills set .

"By . Helen Pow . and Associated Press . Near save: The family of the LAX gunman, Paul Ciancia, pictured, might have averted Friday's deadly shooting but they warned authorities moments too late, it has emerged . The LAX gunman's family might have averted Friday's deadly shooting but they warned authorities about their suicidal son just minutes too late, it has emerged. Paul Ciancia's father contacted police in his hometown of Pennsville, New Jersey, after receiving troubling text messages from his son, including one that suggested something bad would happen. The New Jersey police then asked their Los Angeles counterparts to check on the 23-year-old, but officers arrived at his apartment just 45 minutes after he'd left for the airport, where he opened fire, shooting dead a TSA employee, injuring others and terrorizing travelers. News of the near save comes as it's revealed Ciancia had penned a letter stating that he made the conscious decision to try to kill multiple TSA officers and 'instill fear in your traitorous minds.' He accomplished both those goals, though he only killed one worker, and also showed how easy it is to get a gun into an airport. The deadly rampage left investigators to piece together what motivated Paul Ciancia's hatred toward the agency formed to make air travel safer after the September 11 terrorist attack, but could ultimately lead to changes in the way airports are patrolled. Ciancia was shot four times by airport police, including in the mouth, and remains heavily sedated and under 24-hour armed guard at the hospital, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Sunday. The official was not authorized to speak publicly on the case and requested anonymity. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic who recently moved to Los Angeles from the small, blue-collar town of Pennsville had one of his three roommates drop him at LAX on Friday just moments before he pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle from his duffel bag and opened fire, killing one TSA officer and wounding three other people, including two more TSA workers. Apartment: Police arrived at Ciancia's Los Angeles apartment, pictured, to check on him just 45 minutes after he'd left for the airport . Officials do not believe that the friend knew of the shooter's plans. According to CNN, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before he shooting. He claimed he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, a source told the network. On Friday, Ciancia reportedly burst into a roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately and the roommate obliged. Police arrived less than an hour later, but his other two roommates didn't know where Ciancia and the fourth friend had gone. Speaking to . Ciancia arrived at the airport in a black Hyundai and was not a ticketed passenger. Ciancia is facing charges of murder of a federal officer and committing violence at an international airport. The charges could qualify him for the death penalty. It was not immediately clear when he would make a first court appearance given his medical condition. In court documents and interviews, authorities spelled out a chilling chain of events, saying Ciancia walked into the airport's Terminal 3, pulled the assault rifle from his duffel bag and fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo I. Hernandez. He went up an escalator, turned back to see Hernandez move and returned to shoot him again, according to surveillance video reviewed by investigators. Fear: Terrified travellers run from gunshots at Los Angeles International airport on Fridya, where Paul Ciancia is accused of opening fire at TSA agents . Instagram: Ciancia's gun was seen laying on the floor of the airport and Instagrammed by a witness . Concerned: Ciancia's family had received a number of concerning text messages from their son, pictured, which suggested he was suicidal and was planning something bad . He then fired on two other uniformed TSA employees and an airline passenger, who all were wounded, as he moved methodically through the security checkpoint to the passenger gate area before airport police shot him as panicked travelers hid in stores and restaurants. Witnesses told CNN, the gunman went from person to person, asking, 'Are you TSA?' 'I just shook my head,' traveler Leon Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 'And he kept going.' It wasn't clear why Ciancia targeted TSA officers, but what he left behind indicated he was willing to kill any of them that crossed his path, authorities revealed. The letter in his duffel bag refers . to how Ciancia believed his constitutional rights were being violated by . TSA searches and that he's a 'pissed-off patriot' upset at former . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. Victim: Ciancia allegedly fired repeatedly at 39-year-old TSA officer Gerardo I. Hernandez, pictured, killing him . 'Black, white, yellow, brown, I don't discriminate,' the note read, according to a paraphrase by a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The screed also mentioned 'fiat currency' and 'NWO,' possible references to the New World Order, a conspiracy theory that foresees a totalitarian one-world government. The letter also talked about 'how easy it is to get a gun into the airport,' the law enforcement official said. When searched, the suspect had five 30-round magazines, and his bag contained hundreds more rounds in boxes. Texas Republican Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN's State of the Union on Sunday that Ciancia's actions show how difficult it is to protect travelers at a massive airport such as LAX. The terminals are open and easily accessible to thousands of people who arrive at large sliding glass doors via a broad ring road that fronts the facility and is designed to move people along quickly. 'It's like a shopping mall outside the perimeter, it's almost like an open shopping mall,' McCaul said. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the agency will need to work with each airport's police agency 'to see how we'll go about in providing the best possible security.' The shooting temporarily halted . traffic at the nation's third-busiest airport, stranding thousands of . passengers and causing dozens of flights to be diverted to other . airports. More than 1,500 flights and 167,000 passengers were affected . nationwide, according to the Los Angeles Times. On . Sunday, flights at the airport were back on schedule and regular . operations had resumed, LAX spokesman Marshall Lowe told the newspaper. The FBI has served a search warrant . on a Sun Valley residence where Ciancia lived, Ari Dekofsky, a . spokeswoman for the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said Sunday. Agents . are still interviewing people, she said. Security: Transportation Security Administration workers stood in front of the blocked off Terminal 3 entrance on Saturday as law enforcement officials continued to investigate the shooting scene . Sniffer dogs: A couple of Los Angeles Police Department officers with their K9 patrolled Terminal 2 a day after a shooting that killed one Transportation Safety Administration worker and injured several others at Los Angeles International Airport . Authorities believe the rifle used in the shooting was purchased in Los Angeles. Ciancia also had two additional handguns that he purchased in Los Angeles, but which weren't at the crime scene, a law enforcement official said. The official, who has been briefed on the investigation, was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity. The purchases themselves appeared legal, although authorities were still tracing them, and it's unclear if the shooter used his own identification or someone else's, the official said. 'He didn't buy them on the street. He didn't buy them on the Internet,' the official said. 'He bought them from a licensed gun dealer — the rifle and the two handguns.' Hernandez, a three-year veteran of the TSA, moved to the U.S. from El Salvador at age 15, married his sweetheart, Ana, on Valentine's Day in 1998 and had two children. The TSA said the other two officers wounded in the attack — James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 — were released from the hospital. Brian Ludmer, a Calabasas High School teacher, remained in fair condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and will need surgery for a gunshot wound to the leg. Two other people suffered injuries trying to evade the gunman, but weren't shot. The FBI was still looking into Ciancia's past, but investigators said they had not found evidence of previous crimes or any run-ins with the TSA. They said he had never applied for a job with the agency.","Paul Ciancia's father contacted police after receiving troubling text messages from his son, including one that suggested something bad would happen .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ignore the champagne and crack open a bottle of White Cliffs or Sussex instead. That’s the future hoped for by drinks industry chiefs, who are looking to give English sparkling wine a name that’s, well, a little more sparkling. Although our award-winning bubbly tastes, looks and smells like champagne, European rules say only sparkling wine made around the French city of Reims can use the name. Less 'wordy' name suggestions for English sparkling wine include Merret, Albion or Britagne . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has said the term ‘sparkling wine’, is too wordy. The Duchess of Cornwall claimed last year that  the name should ‘have something with depth’. One idea is Merret, after the 17th Century scientist Christopher Merret, who made champagne decades before the Benedictine monk Dom Perignon. Albion, the ancient name for Great Britain, and Britagne have also been suggested. But Mark Driver, of the Rathfinny Estate in Alfriston, East Sussex, said: ‘We intend to stick to the geographical designation. 'In 10 years’ time, people will ask  for a glass of Sussex not champagne. I want people to ask for Rathfinny like they ask for a Bollinger.’","Only sparkling wine made in Reims, France can be called champagne .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is bad news for budding athletes - all the practice in the world will not make you a world class sprinter if you aren't quick to begin with. Researchers say the best sprinters in the world were exceptionally fast prior to beginning formal training. The finding contradicts the popular theory that 10,000 hours practice can make you an expert in anything - including sports. Researchers say sprinters such as Usain Bolt (pictured) are exceptionally fast even before they begin formal training. The popular 'practice' model of expertise has been championed by social scientists including Malcom Gladwell. According to this model, there is no such thing as innate talent. Instead, 10 years of deliberate practice (roughly 10,000 hours) are necessary and sufficient for anyone to become an expert in any field, including sports. The researchers say they hope their work will 'finally put an end to the debate' and prove the theory is wrong - for sports, at least. Published in the online journal PeerJ,  Grand Valley State University researchers studied biographies of 26 world-class sprinters, including 15 Olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in U.S. history. The research, conducted by Michael Lombardo, professor of biology, and Robert Deaner, associate professor of psychology, shows that the developmental histories of elite sprinters contradict the popular 'practice' model of expertise championed by Malcom Gladwell. According to this model, there is no such thing as innate talent. Instead, 10 years of deliberate practice (roughly 10,000 hours) are necessary and sufficient for anyone to become an expert in any field, including sports. The researchers studied biographies of 26 world-class sprinters, including 15 Olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in U.S. history. The first major finding was that every expert sprinter, male or female, was recognized as exceptionally fast prior to beginning formal training. This contradicts the deliberate practice model, which assumes that initial performance and final performance in a domain will be unrelated. A second key finding was that, contrary to the 10-year rule, most sprinters achieved world class performances in less than five years, and more than half of the Olympic champions reached this level in three years or fewer. 'We expected that most sprint champions’ biographies would indicate that they were always the fastest kid in their neighborhood, even before they did any formal training or received any coaching,' said Lombardo. 'But the consistency of the pattern was surprising – from Helen Stephens, a 1936 Olympian, to Usain Bolt, there were no exceptions. 'Gathering the data systematically allowed us to see how strong the patterns were. 'It also allowed us to test and rule out alternative explanations.' Researchers studied 26 world-class sprinters, including 15 Olympic gold medalists and the eight fastest men in U.S. history. In addition, Lombardo and Deaner surveyed 64 sprinters and throwers (i.e., shot put, javelin, discus) who qualified for the 2012 NCAA collegiate track and field outdoor championships. Sprinters recalled being faster as children, while throwers recalled greater strength and overhand throwing ability. Another key finding was that the collegiate sprinters’ best performances in their first season of high school competition, generally the beginning of formal training or deliberate practice, were consistently faster than 95-99 percent of their peers. 'Our results won’t come as a surprise to most biologists, sports scientists, or coaches—all of the previous data pointed to this conclusion,' said Deaner. 'But our results are important because the deliberate practice model and its ‘10-year rule’ remains enormously popular among many social scientists and intellectuals. 'Our results are clear-cut and should require no scientific training to understand. 'So we hope they will finally put an end to the debate. 'In sports, innate talent is required too.","Contradicts theory that 10,000 hours practice can make you an expert in anything .

'This was a horrific collision. The impact was heard throughout the communities. People a quarter of a mile away heard this horrendous impact, and right after that impact there was a tremendous fire with very high temperatures.' Investigators are now looking at whether the crash was caused by a mechanical failure on the FedEx truck, whether the driver fell asleep or if there could have been another cause. Earlier, investigators had suggested that the van might have been trying to avoid a passenger car. 'There . was a small white sedan in front of the truck,' CHP spokeswoman Lacey . Heitman said.

"By . Associated Press . A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court’s ruling that a disgraced Detroit judge cannot be sued by a defendant in a child support case he presided over. The decision dated Monday by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati cites existing U.S. Supreme Court law that Wade McCree is immune from lawsuits stemming from judicial actions. Robert King had claimed that the former Wayne County Circuit Court judge violated his civil rights. Shielded: A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's ruling that disgraced judge Wade McCree cannot be sued by a defendant in a child support case he presided over . Illicit affair: Geniene La'Shay Mott had a child-support case pending in McCree's court and disclosed their affair in December 2013 . The married McCree had a sexual relationship with Geniene La’Shay Mott while presiding over a 2012 child support case between her and King. Some of the trysts took place in McCree’s chambers. According to the Detroit Free Press, McCree sexted Mott from the bench and gave her thousands of dollars. Courts have long prevented judges being sued by litigants for their decisions, but King's attorney Joel Sklar says McCree used his judicial immunity 'as a shield for self interest.' 'There should be no immunity for what happened here,' said Sklar. He is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court for help in challenging the doctrine that judges can't be sued for their court decisions. Sexting scandal: McCree allegedly sexted Mott from the bench during the proceedings . Brian Einhorn, McCree's attorney, says his client's decision to tether King and order him to pay child support was the appropriate one.'In our system, people are going to be unhappy when a judge renders a decision. And if a judge can be sued because the decision they made — in someone’s opinion — was right, wrong or unfair, then our system of justice doesn’t work,' Einhorn said, reports the Detroit Free Press.King says McCree found favorably for his ex-wife because of his 'desires for sexual gratifications.'THe court, while ruling that McCree cannot be sued by King, called McCree's actions 'often reprehensible.'Michigan’s Supreme Court in March ordered McCree removed from office and suspended him for six more years if he’s re-elected in November.The Detroit Free Press reports that McCree's father, Wade Hampton McCree, Jr was the first black person appointed to the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appleals and the second black solicitor general in the U.S.","Judge Wade McCree cannot be sued by the defendant of a child support case he presided over .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The use of colour in photography was a readily available - albeit expensive - practice in Europe and the U.S. by the 1890s, but it wasn't until 30 years later that the method really caught on in Russia. Now a new exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery in London explores the emergence and development of colour photography in the country in the years before and after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The Primrose exhibition - which takes its name for the Russian word for 'first colour' - shows how the earliest efforts to move away from black and white images came in the form of 'hand colouring' techniques, which saw water-colours, paints or dyes manually added to the monochrome images. The next development was invented by photographer Sergei Produkin-Gorsky, who exposed black and white printing plates through red, green and blue filters three times in quick succession. This technique produced misty but atmospheric images that looked almost as if they were paintings. The method caught on and was widely used until the mid-1960s, when a cheap colour film was finally made available to the public - 10 years after the government created a version that was restricted for state use only. Even this film sparked photographs seemingly unique to Russia, as it was mass produced in the form of reversal film designed to be used in projectors, rather than creating negatives or prints. Incredible: This 1953 photograph of Stalin's funeral was taken by Dmitri Baltermants in Moscow. Surrounded by a sea of brightly-coloured flowers and a near-forest of palms, Baltermants' clever use of colour and light gives the brutal dictator's final public appearance a suitably atmospheric feel . Impression: This image - another by the photojournalist Dmitri Baltermants - is titled 'Rain' and shows Moscow commuters waiting at a bus stop during a heavy downpour in the mid-1960s. The image - with open umbrellas taking on the appearance of lilies, the shimmering street looking like water and the overall soft pastel colouring - looks almost like a painting by Claude Monet . Human spirit: Although these photographs were taken more than 50 years apart, the vivid use of colour makes them appear contemporaneous. In Yelena Mrozovskaya's 'Portrait of girl in Little Russia costume' (left) - which was taken in Saint Petersburg in the 1900s - colour is introduced manually by applying paint or dye to a monochrome image. Meanwhile in Ivan Shagin's 'Student' (right) colour reversal film of the sort normally meant for a projector is used . Technique: Yakov Khalip's photograph of young sea cadets at the end of the 1940s is a colour image made using Sergei Produkin-Gorsky's innovative method of exposing black and white printing plates through red, green and blue filters three times in quick succession . Design: Both P.T. Ivanovs' 1911 image 'First year of the military service' (left) and Varvara Stepanova's 1932 photomontage 'Beready!'  appear in the Primrose exhibition, which takes its name for the Russian word for 'first colour'. The project explores the emergence and development of colour photography since the late 19th Century . Red is the colour: Work by the photojournalist Dmitri Baltermants - such as this atmospheric untitled image of a Soviet flag in the 1960s - makes up a large part of the Photographers' Gallery exhibition. Warsaw-born Baltermants graduated from Moscow State University to become a maths teacher in a Military Academy, but fell in love with photography and began a career in photojournalism in 1939 .","New exhibition at Photographers' Gallery in London explores development of colour photography in Russia .

"U.S. actor David Duchovny was caught in the Russian conflict with Ukraine last night after appearing in a Siberian beer commercial. The 53-year-old star of X-Files and Californication has been praised and criticised in equal measure after backing the Russian-made beer despite admitting he has Ukrainian origins. 'There is another country, where I got my family name from, and sometimes I wonder, what if things turned out differently, what if I were Russian?' the actor says in the video ad posted Friday on YouTube. Advocate: David Duchovny, of X-Files fame, has been attacked for plugging a Russian beer in a TV advert . What if? The advert imagines Duchovny's life if he grew up in Russia rather than the United States . 'Being Russian, I'd have many things to be proud of,' he concludes as he promotes popular Russian beer Sibirskaya Korona - or Siberian Crown - brewed in Omsk. He is evidently confused over his roots since in April he tweeted: 'I grew up thinking I was Russian only to find recently that I've been Ukrainian all along. Never too late to change.' The two sides are locked in a fierce dispute, with Moscow backing rebels demanding separation in the east of Ukraine. But there was also Western criticism of his backing for a Russian brand after the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight in which 298 people died. Video Source YouTube . On another planet? High-ranking Russian politicians have praised the advert for the 'love' it shows . Bizarre: The advert puts Duchovny in a variety of odd guises, which critics say is inappropriate given the political situation Russia is in . Yesterday 13 children including two children were killed in fighting which derailed hopes by the West to send its own police force to the site of the shot-down jet, to secure the site as a crime scene. The move comes amid accusations - strongly denied - that Russia is behind tampering of evidence at the site. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian deputy prime minister who is also in charge of the Russian defence industry, said of the Duchovny ad: 'If you forget about what it is advertising, as a whole it's made with love.' Yet a Rusisan newsreader rebuked him for appearing in the ad to be of Russian roots after his claim about being partly Ukrainian. Out in the cold: Duchovny, who recently discovered Ukrainian roots, has had a frosty reception for the ad . A U.S. news site attacked his 'poorly timed, nationalistic ad' released soon after the plane was downed allegedly by pro-Russian rebels using missiles provided by Moscow. A Ukrainian comment read: 'He should make up his mind which side he's on in this conflict.' 'Has David Duchovny gone completely mad? Maybe he'll be next to get a (Russian) passport after Gerard Depardieu,' added Twitter user, Tatyana Samosudova. Depardieu gained Russian citizenship last year from 'friend' Vladimir Putin and has since promoted a bank and a kitchen chain . On his paternal side Duchovny is Jewish from a family that previously lived in Ukraine and Poland. His mother hailed from Scotland.","Star, 53, appeared in TV advert imagining himself if he were Russian .

Firefighters in Northern California made progress on Sunday against a wildfire that has destroyed 13 homes and forced hundreds of evacuations in the Sierra Nevada foothills, while a fire near Yosemite National Park that destroyed one home grew significantly overnight. East of Sacramento, the Sand Fire in the Sierra foothills has burned roughly 6 square miles of steep, rugged terrain near wine-growing regions in Amador and El Dorado counties since Friday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

"By . Associated Press . The US government is hiding evidence of AK-47 shell casings that could suggest Blackwater security forces were fired on before returning fire in Nisoor Square in Baghdad, killing 14, lawyers for the security contractors are claiming. Four Blackwater guards are on trial for the massacre on September 16, 2007, that raised questions about the private security firm's involvement in the Iraq war. Their lawyers are claiming that the government has suppressed photographs showing eight spent shell casings commonly used by an AK-47 — the weapon of choice used by insurgents as well as Iraqi authorities — in the area of Nisoor Square, where the Iraqis were killed. Tragedy: four Blackwater security guards are on trial for the 2007 shooting at Nisoor Square that killed 14 Iraqis . Live fire: Photos of AK-47 shell casings found at site of Nisoor Square massacre were suppressed by the government, lawyers for Blackwater security contractors claim (stock image) This evidence could contradict some witness accounts that contractors opened fire on civilians unprovoked. A court filing by the defense attorneys says the photographs were taken by a U.S. Army captain and that they never saw the light of day until federal prosecutors turned them over last Wednesday. The photos could become an important part of the case. They could bolster the accounts of the security guards, who say they were being fired upon by insurgents and that the guards were simply returning fire. 'The government has suppressed, for seven years, evidence in its possession that is plainly exculpatory on the central disputed issue' in the case, the defense lawyers said in a court filing. 'Had they possessed these photos, defendants would have made them a central focus during opening statements as evidence of incoming fire. Defendants also would have used this evidence to cross-examine at least four witnesses who have already testified' and who are not subject to being recalled because they have returned to Iraq. The defense attorneys are asking that they be allowed to explain to the jurors in the case why they are just hearing now about the new evidence.",Blackwater security guards are on trial for the killing of 14 civilians in Baghdad in September 2007 .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Soul diva Aretha Franklin has lashed out at the Johnny Rockets server who showed D-I-S-R-E-S-P-E-C-T by telling her she wasn't allowed to eat her takeout inside the restaurant. The 72-year-old said she was 'screamed at' in an Ontario, Canada franchise on Tuesday after performing a sold-out show. 'I got up and walked out. I said, ‘You should eat it yourself and you pay for it',' the Queen of Soul told New York Daily News about the experience. 'My nephew mentioned to her who I was and she said she didn’t care who I was... She’s a public servant and she shouldn’t speak that way to anybody, celebrities or non-celebrities.' Scroll down for video . Furious: Soul diva Aretha Franklin has blasted a Johnny Rockets server who she said 'screamed at' her for eating a burger she had originally ordered to take away . Speaking for the first time since the incident, Franklin recalled she ordered her usual -  a hamburger and cherry coke to go - before sitting at an empty table while she waited. She said a worker in her mid-30s then blasted her, saying: 'You can’t sit there.' 'I said, ‘Excuse me, what do you mean I can’t sit here?' recalled Franklin, who was with her nephew. The worker told Franklin, who released her smash hit Respect in 1967, that the seating area was only for people eating in. The Natural Woman singer said she calmly replied that she would eat-in and was shocked when the server told her she couldn't because she'd ordered takeout. 'I got up and walked out,' the musician said. 'I said, ‘You should eat it yourself and you pay for it'.' Bad service: The employee at the Johnny Rockets was 'very rude, unprofessional and nasty,' said Franklin .

The boy was running on the pavement beside the leading Kenyan competitors in the women's marathon in Glasgow.

Scroll down for video . The little boy, who can be seen on the right running along the pavement, tried to keep up with the runners . The Kenyan duo - Flomena Cheyech Daniel and Caroline Kilel - did not notice the embarrassing stumble and continued through the streets of Glasgow.

James Frost, 45, who was at the race, said the child’s father had to pick him off the ground. The IT worker added: ‘It was kind of funny as it happened, the kid was so excited when he ran with the Kenyans. ‘But all of a sudden he was on the ground.

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . GCSEs are the ‘new 11-plus’ as top universities are increasingly using them as a way to weed out candidates for degree courses, according to an Oxford don. Dr Peter Claus warned that the approach disadvantages late bloomers in the same way as the 11-plus, which determines entrants to grammar schools. Dr Claus, a historian based at Pembroke College, admitted that Oxford was ‘as guilty as anybody else in that’. Exams: GCSEs are increasingly used by top universities to weed out degree candidates, claims an Oxford don . Advice to candidates from the university states that it ‘could not be optimistic of an applicant’s chances of gaining a place at Oxford without a high percentage of A* and A grades at GCSE’. Dr Claus admitted that, as a late starter, he would have failed to reach Oxford’s high GCSE standards himself. Many of the most sought-after courses at other competitive universities use high GCSE grades as a filter to decide which candidates to shortlist. But critics are concerned that this approach could harm the chances of students who blossom post-16, particularly those from less well-off backgrounds or lower-performing schools, who may be unaware of the high GCSE entry requirements needed for the top universities. Warning: Dr Peter Claus (pictured) warned that the approach disadvantages late bloomers in the same way as the 11-plus, which determines entrants to grammar schools . The GCSE is turning into a kind of the new grammar school 11-plus type of qualification,’ Dr Claus told a conference held last week by The Brilliant Club, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to get bright pupils from non-selective schools into leading universities. ‘Oxford, I suspect, is as guilty as anybody else in that. Certainly some, not necessarily Oxford’s, of our university programmes are setting a very high bar for young people trying to get GCSEs. 'They’ve got GCSEs but perhaps not high enough GCSEs at that particular stage. I would have been counted among those. 'The trouble is…that you’re stymied if you don’t get that first rung through the GCSE process.’ Dr Claus, an ‘access’ fellow at Pembroke who champions initiatives to broaden the mix of undergraduates, said he originally achieved three O-levels but went ‘back into the education system’ to gain more qualifications. ‘You can’t really do that now,' he said. But Dr Claus rejected a controversial proposal from a fellow speaker at the conference, Professor Patrick McGhee, who called for leading universities to apply a ‘systematic or blanket’ approach to admissions to increase their intake of disadvantaged pupils. It would raise the prospect of applicants’ results being adjusted upwards according to various contextual factors, such as the overall performance of their school. Professor McGhee, assistant vice-chancellor of the University of Bolton, said contextual data should be used ‘systematically despite the Russell Group saying that a systematic or blanket approach to the use of contextual data is problematic’. But Dr Claus said the tactic could lead to ‘the barbarians…dancing on the table’. University: Dr Claus, of Pembroke College (pictured), admitted that Oxford was 'as guilty as anybody else in that'. He added: 'The trouble is... that you're stymied if you don't get that first rung through the GCSE process' ‘The reason a systematic access weighting is problematic is it takes away autonomy from the academics,’ he said. ‘I’m not in favour of that because if you start down that road the barbarians will soon be dancing on the table, I’m really not interested in that.’ In advice to applicants on its website, Oxford says: ‘There is no absolute requirement for particular grades at GCSE, as there are no fixed examination results that must be attained for admission to Oxford University. 'Each application is considered carefully on its individual merits. 'When we look at GCSE results, we look at them in the context of the overall performance of the school or college where you studied. So if, for example, you didn’t get all A* and A grades, but your results were among the best in your year group, that will be taken into account. ‘However, competition for places is strong and many applicants have all A* and A grades at GCSE. Unless there are particular extenuating circumstances, we could not be optimistic of an applicant’s chances of gaining a place at Oxford without a high percentage of A* and A grades at GCSE.’","GCSEs are 'new 11-plus increasingly used to weed out degree candidates'

"By . Australian Associated Press . Katie Foreman was burnt to death in her home in 2011 . Wollongong lawyer Katie Foreman died an 'excruciating' death in a blaze that was lit in her bedroom at the behest of her calculating boyfriend. But exactly why Ms Foreman was killed remains puzzling, the sentencing judge says. The 31-year-old solicitor died in a blaze that engulfed her home in Corrimal in Wollongong's north on October 27, 2011. She had tried to flee but was overcome by smoke and heat. In sentencing the trio for her murder on Monday, Justice Ian Harrison said 'it is difficult to contemplate a more frightening and excruciating way' to die. 'She died alone with no possible chance of escape.' Ms Foreman's one-time friend Wendy Anne Evans pleaded guilty in June 2013 to her role in the murder. The solicitor's sometime boyfriend Bradley Max Rawlinson and a third accused, Michelle Sharon Proud, were found guilty in April. During this trial, the Supreme Court heard Evans' friendship with Ms Foreman turned sour after the 31-year-old solicitor had been intimate with her former lover and convicted criminal Scott Field. But it took the 'cold and calculating' Rawlinson to push Evans' dislike to the next level, Justice Harrison said. From August 2011 Rawlinson sparked an affair with the insecure Evans and began feeding her lies and saying they could never be together while Ms Foreman was alive. The judge said in sentencing: 'She died alone with no possible chance of escape' The 31-year-old had tried to get out of her bedroom, where the inferno was lit, but had collapsed after being overcome by smoke and heat . Evans in turn recruited Proud to assist in the murder scheme. While text messages and evidence reveal how the solicitor was killed, Justice Harrison said he remained at 'a complete loss to understand' why. Whatever 'so-called issues' Rawlinson had with Ms Foreman, they were 'hardly the stuff of revenge or retribution,' he said. 'Scurrilous gossip and meaningless banter can never justify the taking of any person's life,' Justice Harrison said. None of the allegations levelled by Evans at Ms Foreman was ever substantiated, the court heard. And Rawlinson's drive to kill Ms Foreman appeared to be based on 'cold indifference to her right to live her own way, on her own terms'. Katie Foreman's mother Ann told the court earlier this month that she was still haunted by nightmares of her daughter dying . Neil Foreman (centre), father of murdered solicitor Katie Foreman, is pictured outside the NSW Supreme Court at today's sentencing . He gave Rawlinson, who has shown no remorse, the heaviest sentence, setting a minimum of 27 years and a maximum of 36 years. Despite the fact Evans went to Ms Foreman's home to light the fire, Justice Harrison said she was less morally culpable, owing to Rawlinson's manipulation, and he sentenced her to a minimum of 18 years and a maximum of 24. Meanwhile Proud, who Justice Harrison found played a 'passive role' in the murder, was sentenced to at least 14 years. Ms Foreman's family was in court as the sentences were handed down.

"By . Australian Associated Press . Harrowing footage of the moments after Sydney police officer Bill Crews was fatally shot has been played at an inquest into his death. Constable Crews was 26 and a new recruit to the NSW Police Middle Eastern Organised Crime squad when he was shot during a 2010 drugs raid in the basement car park of a western Sydney unit block. Small-time drug dealer Philip Nguyen was last year jailed for his manslaughter. Nguyen had taken a hit of heroin or ice on the night of September 8, 2010, and was the first to open fire as police officers descended the stairs to the car park. But it was Detective Senior Constable Dave Roberts who fired the fatal shot, Const Crews' inquest has heard. Scroll down for video . Sydney police officer Bill Crews was a new recruit when he was shot dead during a drugs raid in 2010 . The inquest found that Constable Crews was actually shot dead by one of his own colleagues . 'Tragically, the shot fired by Detective Senior Constable Roberts was the shot that killed Constable Crews,' counsel assisting Dean Jordan SC said at Glebe Coroner's Court. Footage aired on the opening day of the inquest did not capture the moment a bullet hit Const Crews in the neck but did record gunshots ringing out in quick succession. Officers can then be seen taking cover, yelling: 'Get back ... Get down, get on the ground'. For five excruciating minutes, police can be seen pleading for an unseen gunman to 'throw the gun out and surrender'. 'We need to help our mate,' one officer is heard to yell out, as others call for an ambulance. But Mr Jordan said that for most of the time Const Crews lay injured on the basement floor, Nguyen was in a unit upstairs - though the officers mistakenly believed he was still inside one of the basement garages. 'Under that mistaken belief, the officers could not attend to Constable Crews without placing themselves and their colleagues in danger,' Mr Jordan said. Video reveals five excruciating minutes where police officers begged for the gunman's surrender so they could try to save their colleague's life . It was standing room only on Monday as Mr Jordan delivered his opening address to NSW State Coroner Michael Barnes. He said the inquest would investigate whether police search procedures in 2010 were adequate, whether they were adhered to on the night of Const Crews' death and whether plain-clothes detectives properly identified themselves as police. Among the witnesses slated to give evidence is Nguyen, who is expected to tell the inquest he did not realise the men advancing toward him on the night of the raid were police officers. The inquest continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Constable Crews was a new recruit when he was shot dead in 2010 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Doctors treating survivors of the San Francisco air crash have called for the use of seatbelts on planes to be reviewed after passengers suffered spinal injuries even though they were buckled up. Two Chinese students died and 181 people were injured when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 from Seoul crashed during landing on Saturday. Dr Geoffrey Manley, neurosurgery chief at San Francisco General Hospital, said several survivors needed surgery to stabilise their spines after their upper bodies were flung forward and then backwards over their lap belts – which did keep them seated and saved their lives. Fireball: A total of 307 people were on board the plane when it crash-landed. Most managed to walk away from the crash . Aftermath: This chilling picture of the interior of the crashed jetliner was released by the National Transportation Safety Board . Some passengers also had ligaments so . torn that they cannot hold neck and back joints in place. Dr Manley . said one option to prevent this was three-point seatbelts, although he . admitted that they ‘might just move the injuries up further’. The airline industry says introducing such belts would increase fares and lessen comfort. Experts said the survival of 305 people on board Flight 214 is a testament to the advance of airline safety. Still, Manley said even among those who suffered mild spine trauma, he is struck by a pattern that shows how their upper bodies were flung forward and then backward over the lap belts that kept them in their seats and undoubtedly saved their lives. The injuries are somewhat reminiscent of the days before shoulder belts in cars, although much more severe, said Dr. David Okonkwo of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, who is not involved with the survivors' care. Does that mean shoulder belts in airplanes would prevent such injuries? Okonkwo said that's simplistic considering how much more speed and force are involved in a plane crash. Shoulder belts might just transfer that force to the neck, he cautioned. Victims: Left, 16-year-old schoolgirls Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, pose for photos in Jiangshan city. Right, Wang Linjia is pictured on the right, and Ye Mengyuan on the left. The two girls were killed in the Asiana Airlines plane crash on Saturday and one may have been hit by an emergency responder vehicle . Passengers aboard the stricken Asiana Flight 214 'grabbed their luggage before their children' it has today been revealed, as video footage showing the dramatic moment they scrambled to safety has emerged . 'If you put in the shoulder belt, it might just move the injuries up further. Your head weighs a tremendous amount,' agreed Manley. He hopes to study the issue, comparing survivors' injuries to where they sat. The airline industry says adding three-point seatbelts to airplanes would require major changes to seat design that would mean higher airfares and less comfort. Some business class seats have added a type of shoulder restraint, but those seats are more like beds and often don't face forward. Meanwhile, Okonkwo said assuming the 'crash position' - leaning forward with the head as far down as possible and arms over it - can limit the spine jolting back and forth and offer some protection. It's not clear if any survivors of Saturday's crash had time to do so.

So when . the 23-year-old started suffering dizzy spells up to three times a day, . doctors were baffled. 'The first happened when I was shopping - I suddenly felt faint,' says Chrissy, a charity fundraiser from Swindon, Wiltshire. 'My . legs went weak and my friend had to hold me up then get me home in a . taxi. I thought perhaps I just needed a sugar boost, such as a bar of . chocolate. 'But the dizzy spells kept occurring - sometimes I'd get . them up to three times a day, then I wouldn't get them for a few weeks . and think I was getting better. 'I'd feel sick for 20 minutes . afterwards and my vision would go slightly blurry. Sometimes I'd feel . just a bit lightheaded, but once I had to crouch down in a corner . holding on to the carpet because I felt I was falling.' Chrissy . visited her GP a few days after the first attack and over the course of . the next month saw half a dozen specialists, including an eye expert. Each suggested a different diagnosis, ranging from iron deficiency to an . inner ear infection. She was referred to a psychiatrist when a neurologist insisted her symptoms were stress-related. 'I . was working as a social worker for a mental health charity and loved my . job and wasn't stressed at all, but the psychiatrist suggested I give . it up and  work as a fisherman, perhaps because he thought it was a . relaxing profession. 'My mum and I just laughed, though when someone tells you the problem is in your subconscious you believe them.' She was prescribed antidepressants  and beta-blockers, which control anxiety by slowing down the heart rate. But . these didn't make her better and she decided to quit her job and move . in with her mother - by then her legs would shake so uncontrollably she . was terrified  of falling and was forced to use  a wheelchair. Then . in October 2010, six months after her first symptoms, she started to . experience chest pains and her eyes became swollen. A few weeks later, . she woke up one morning hallucinating. Her mother rang 999. She was . rushed to A&E, where she drifted in and out of consciousness while . doctors carried out a scan. This revealed the cause of her problems: her . lungs were filled with blood clots. The clots had blocked the artery . carrying blood from the heart to the lungs, starving her body of oxygen - . a condition known as a pulmonary embolism. The fact Chrissy was . young and had no underlying health problems meant that the . life-threatening problem had gone undetected until nearly too late, . despite her having classic symptoms, such as dizziness and chest pain. Scroll down for video . Her lungs were filled with blood clots - she had a condition known as a pulmonary embolism . While . it is not clear where the clots in Chrissy's lungs had originated, . typically they form in the leg vein (where they are known  as a deep . vein thrombosis, or DVT), causing redness, swelling or pain. If the . clot breaks off, it can travel up the vein to the heart and get stuck in . an artery in the lungs, starving the body of oxygen. Every year . blood clots cause 30,000 deaths - official estimates suggest as many as . 25,000 people die from preventable blood clots that develop in hospital. This is partly because lying immobile in a hospital bed or on an . operating table causes the blood to pool and thicken. Surgery can . also lead to clots - patients considered at risk are given . blood-thinning drugs and compression stockings for their hospital stay. The clots can take some time to form - more than half occur up to 90 days after a stay in hospital. While clots can happen to anyone, the risk increases if you're overweight, which slows down the blood flow. And pregnant women are more at risk, partly because of the increase in blood-clotting cells. The drop in your blood flow after sitting for 90 minutes . Blood clots are often regarded as a disease of ageing - rates increase sharply after 45 until 80, though it's not clear why. Another . risk factor is the combined oral contraceptive Pill, taken by two . million women in Britain aged 16 to 49. It contains oestrogen, which . causes the blood to clot more easily. Chrissy's doctors told her it was the Pill, which she'd been taking since the age of 18, which had triggered the blood clots. The . problem is that many doctors and nurses do not realise that blood clots . can affect  adults of all ages, not just those over 45, says Professor . Beverley Hunt, medical director of the charity Lifeblood.Another issue is that many health professionals are unaware a patient can have a blood clot even if their leg isn't swollen. The . warning signs include unexplained pain in the leg muscle, such as a . sharp or achy cramp, but sometimes there are  no symptoms. 'I run a . clinic for young people and teenagers who have had blood clots and what I . often hear from them, including those in their 20s, is: “I had a pain . in my leg and went to a health professional, but they said I was too . young to have a blood clot,” ' says Professor Hunt. 'Many people are . under the impression that thrombosis (blood clots) is an older person's . illness. Yet we have evidence to show this isn't the case. 'We need . to break the myth that thrombosis is an old people's condition or that . you're only likely to suffer from blood clots after a long-haul flight. The Pill is also a risk factor, for instance. We've learned a lot about . blood clots in the past five to ten years, but most GPs attended medical . school before that. The clots had blocked the artery carrying blood from the heart to the lungs, starving her body of oxygen . 'In old-fashioned textbooks you see someone and . they have a huge swollen leg, but 80 per cent of leg clots don't cause . swelling. 'They just cause pain in part of the leg and a lot of doctors are unaware of that. 'More . education needs to be done to make sure that frontline staff recognise . the symptoms of thrombosis which, if not treated early, is an . indiscriminate and devastating killer.' After Chrissy's condition was . diagnosed, she spent four days in intensive care, where she was given . the clot-busting drug heparin. She was then put on warfarin to prevent . new clots. After ten days in hospital she went home, but it took two . years for her to recover fully. She has been switched to the mini Pill, . which doesn't contain oestrogen. Four years since the pulmonary . embolism, she feels lucky to be alive. She is fundraising and . campaigning for Lifeblood to raise awareness to ensure other young . people get diagnosed quickly.'A clot can happen to anyone and it . only takes one on the lung to kill you. If my mum hadn't been home that . day I'd have died,' she says. 'It was only later I discovered the . hospital had told my friends and family to say goodbye because they . didn't think I'd survive. 'I'm one of the lucky ones, so I'm passionate about raising awareness to prevent misdiagnosis among younger people.' What she finds frustrating is that doctors and nurses don't realise that clots can affect young people.'When . I was on warfarin, I'd get doctors at the clinic in hospital and nurses . at the GP surgery telling me I shouldn't be taking it because I wasn't . at risk of clots at my age, even after being diagnosed. It was so . frustrating. 'People still think it's just a problem that affects older people or long-haul passengers.' But as she knows from terrifying experience, that's a potentially life-threatening mistake. lifeblood.org .","Chrissy Perkins, 23, from Swindon, suffered recurring dizzy spells .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . The Millennial generation is often believed to be more chilled out than Baby Boomers - especially when it comes to travel. But a new infographic by Chase Card Services suggests otherwise - indicating that luxury and its perks are more important to younger holidaymakers than older ones. A survey of 1,000 people aged 18-67 reveals that Millennials are more likely than older travellers to seek out hotels with luxury services such as dry cleaning (32 per cent), massage or spa services (30 per cent) and pet-friendliness (23 per cent). Furthermore, the survey shows Millennial travelers are more likely to say it’s a ‘deal breaker’ if a hotel is not near public transportation (19 per cent). Sisy Vicente, general manager, Chase Card Services, said: 'Millennials are a tech savvy generation that values social connections, convenience and opportunities to indulge in luxuries.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Texas has sent up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border as it tries to crack down on drug and human trafficking, officials said Friday. The surge, announced last month and recently implemented, will cost the state's Department for Public Safety an extra $1.3 million a week. Governor Rick Perry, a potential Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential election, has blamed the Obama administration for not doing enough to halt a surge in children from Central America crossing the border. Patrol: U.S. border agents detain immigrants on the Texas side of the U.S.-Mexico border. The state has increased patrols . Perry said the influx of children has diverted U.S. Border Patrol attention from cracking down on criminal syndicates. 'Mexican cartels and criminal elements are taking advantage of this situation by further exploiting these gaps along the border to commit heinous crimes that will further their business,' Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said. During the nine months ending June 30, more than 57,000 children, many of them from Central America, were detained at the U.S.-Mexico border, double last year's count, according to U.S. government data. The White House and others have called the influx a humanitarian crisis. The Obama administration has requested an additional $3.7 billion from Congress to address the situation. On Thursday, the department took media out to the Rio Grande to show how its fleet of gunboats is patrolling the waterway that divides Mexico and the U.S. Patrol: Helicopters survey scrub near the border, where an extra 1,000 National Guard troops have been sent .

'We know the enemy, the cartel, on the other side they have cover, they have concealment, they have the element of surprise. 'But what we enjoy is superior training, superior tactics, speed and overwhelming firepower,' Department of Public Safety Lieutenant Charlie Goble told Reuters. Perry has won praise for his moves among Republicans and criticism from Democrats who say he is spending millions on deployments that are more about politics than border protection.","Surge in agents comes after rise in drug gangs and people smuggling .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A bill that would make it a criminal offense for first responders to take and share photographs of crime scenes passed the Massachusetts House Thursday and is now on its way to the state senate. The bill is known as Amanda's Law after Chicopee girl Amanda Plasse who inspired it when she was murdered in 2011. The 20-year-old was stabbed to death and found in her kitchen in a pool of blood, according to MassLive. A bill inspired by the 2011 murder case of Amanda Plasse would make it illegal for first responders to take pictures of crime scenes and share them with people not involved in the case . It was later revealed by an internal . investigation that Chicopee police officers on the scene took pictures . of the body and shared them among people with no involvement in the . investigation. Her mother, Michelle Mathieson, has been fighting for legislation ever since. 'It's a common sense law. I am very pleased to hear what happened today,' Mathieson told CBS Springfield. State Rep. Joseph Wagner was at the forefront of the legislation. saying he looked to similar legislation across the country. Amanda's mother Michelle Mathieson, has been fighting for legislation ever since officers devastated her family by sharing pics of her daughter's death . 'There are other states that have similar legislation and we looked . at those to fashion the piece that we did,' he said. 'Certainly we had an example . here in Chicopee.' 'I think from a public safety standpoint it makes sense,' he said. Should the law pass the Senate and be signed by the governor, it would impose fines of up to $2,000 or up to a year in prison if a first responder is convicted. Mathieson said she was grateful as her family felt betrayed by the incident. The new law would make sharing crime scene images punishable by up to a year in prison or a $2,000 fine . 'Oh my gosh it was shock,' she said. 'The people that were there to protect her, . to uphold her dignity, disgraced her, myself and my family.' While the shadow of those officer's actions still hangs over her, she believes that it is her duty to help prevent another family from feeling this pain. 'I will keep pushing to the end to let others know this is not OK,' she said.","Amanda Plasse, 20, was found dead in her kitchen in 2011 having been stabbed to death .

"By . Associated Press . The Obama administration is considering creating a pilot program giving refugee status to young people from Honduras as part of a plan to slow the influx of unaccompanied minors arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, White House officials said Thursday. The plan would involve screening youths in their home country to determine whether they qualify for refugee status. The program would be limited in scope and would start in Honduras, one of the world's most violent nations, but if successful could be expanded to include other Central American countries. No final decision on the matter has been made and said the proposal is among a range of ideas the White House is considering, officials said. President Barack Obama further cautioned on Friday that the U.S. accepts refugees based on 'fairly narrow criteria' and the proposed screening process would in no way change that. Scroll down for video . Flood of unaccompanied minors: In this June 25, 2014 file photo, a group of immigrants from Honduras and El Salvador who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally are stopped in Granjeno, Texas . Screening process: The Obama administration is considering a program to give immigrant children from Honduras refugee status . 'There may be some narrow circumstances . in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be . eligible for,' Obama said Friday afternoon after a meeting with the presidents of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. 'If that were the case it would be better for them to . apply in-country rather than take a very dangerous journey up to Texas . to make those same claims,' he said. 'But I think it’s important to recognize that . that would not necessarily accommodate a large number of additional . migrants.' Similar in-country screening programs were set up in East Asia after the Vietnam War and in Haiti in the 1990s. Under the current proposal, the legal standard to qualify for refugee status would remain the same as it is for those who seek the status after arriving in the U.S., officials said, adding that the goal is to deter children who would not ultimately qualify for refugee status from attempting the dangerous trek to the U.S. Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina did not take questions from the press after the meeting with the president, but speaking Thursday in Washington, he said the three Central American nations have sought to pursue a unified approach. 'We expect that the solution to this problem also is equal for the three countries,' he said. The United Nations has been pushing the U.S. to treat children arriving at the southern border from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as refugees displaced by armed conflict. The trio of nations has become one of the most violent regions in the world in recent years, with swathes of all three countries under the control of drug traffickers and street gangs who rob, rape and extort ordinary citizens with impunity. Crisis: Tens of thousands of immigrant families and unaccompanied minors have crossed illegally into the United States this year and presented themselves to federal agents, causing a humanitarian crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border . Since last fall, the U.S. has seen a dramatic increase in the number of migrants from these three countries arriving at the southern border, particularly children traveling without any adult guardian. Since October 1, more than 16,000 unaccompanied children from Honduras have been caught crossing the Mexican border illegally. At the same time, more than 30,300 Hondurans traveling as families have also been arrested. The U.S. has resisted calling the situation a refugee crisis, though Obama and top officials have called it a 'humanitarian crisis.' The refugee proposal was floated as Congress looked to be deadlocked on reaching any solution of its own on the border crisis with a five-week recess beginning at the end of next week. Obama's $3.7 billion emergency spending request looked to be going nowhere amid an impasse over whether to change a 2008 anti-trafficking law to make it easier to return the Central American kids back home. Democrats reject such changes; Republicans insist on them. House Republicans were to meet on the issue Friday morning. 'I think it needs to be resolved. That's why we're continuing to talk to our members about how to resolve . it,' House Speaker John Boehner said. 'But as I said before, the White . House needs to get its act together or it's not going to get resolved.' Boehner . complained that the White House initially pushed for changes in the . 2008 law but, after a backlash from immigration advocacy groups, backed . off its support. Advocates say changes to the law would be a violation . of the migrant youths' due process. President Obama speaks to students and guests at the Los Angeles Trade and Technical College in, Los Angeles, California, USA, 24 July 2014 after White House officials announced the administration is considering a new plan to slow undocumented immigrants arriving from Mexico . Program: The screening will take place in Honduras and if successful may be expanded to other Central American nations . Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who authored the original provisions in the 2008 law to give additional protections to unaccompanied minors, said the administration now believes it needs more flexibility and has given her legislative language to consider. She said she is still reviewing it and hasn't made any decisions. Kevin Appleby, director of migration policy for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the refugee proposal would be welcomed by the advocacy community as long as there was no attempt by the administration to pair it to changes to the trafficking law. 'It cannot substitute for providing full asylum rights for kids who have arrived in the United States,' he said. 'There is no quid pro quo.' It is unclear what would happen to children and families who have already made the dangerous trek to the United States if the refugee plan is implemented. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has repeatedly said that there is no free pass for immigrants who come to the United States illegally and that those who are caught crossing the border would be sent home. The administration would also have to outline what the refugee proposal would mean for Honduran immigrants already in the United States. In 1999, the U.S. government granted Temporary Protective Status to Hondurans living in the country illegally in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. The status has been renewed several times since then, and according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services about 60,000 Honduran living in the United States have received the protective status. Immigrants from El Salvador received the protection in 2001 and USCIS says about 202,000 Salvadorans remain the U.S. under TPS. Newly arriving immigrants from countries granted TPS are not eligible for the protection from deportation. TPS is used from time to time by the government to stop deportations to specific countries when authorities deem it is unsafe to return immigrants. The New York Times first reported that the White House was considering the refugee program.","The government is considering a program to give refugee status to young people from Honduras .

"By . Darren Boyle . A hospital chief executive on a £170,000 salary, who dressed as Superman to impress his staff, spent £50,000 on his NHS credit card over a three-year period, it has emerged. Phil Morley made the headlines last year when he dressed as Superman and sent a cringeworthy video of him dancing around a hospital to his staff to boost morale. Dubbed the 'real life David Brent' due to the video, Phil Morley’s credit card statements show he has spent £50,000 of tax payers’ money on fine dining and luxury hotel stays during his time as chief executive of Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. Former hospital chief executive Phil Morley shot a video dressed as Superman as a morale building exercise . In 2012, he even spent £4,454.31 on hotels and car hire during a controversial trip to Florida with fellow hospital bosses Jayne Adamson Amanda Pye - which even included a sunset cruise on a luxury yacht. The former hospital boss frittered £50,000 on his NHS card at a time when staff at Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital were under intense pressure to make savings of £95m. His statement shows he paid £817.50 to stay at the five-star Royal Horseguards Hotel in London and £1,284.05 to stay at the four-star Montague in London as well as a Greggs bakery bill for £17.88. Interim chief executive John Saxby who has taken over from Phil Morley after he resigned in April, has ordered staff to hand back their cards and has condemned the way staff have been spending. John Saxby said: 'Almost all of the cards have been withdrawn and we will end up with two, one held by IT and one held as a corporate card for when tickets need to be bought for, say, someone travelling to London.' Mr Morley, left, stood down as chief executive of the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital trust, right, in April . John Saxby, who does not hold an NHS credit card, said the trust had been 'less than careful' about signing off credit card purchases but rules had now been tightened up and staff have been asked to stop travelling first class and to use budget hotels if staying overnight on NHS business. John said: 'My rule of thumb is Travelodge. 'I want people to restrict themselves to spending no more than it would cost in Travelodge. 'All I’m asking is for people to be sensible, as this is public money at the end of the day. I encourage staff to think, if they could do it cheaper, then that’s what they should do.' Bumbling 'Superman' boss Phil Morley joined the trust in October 2010 and he rejected a salary of £190,000, claiming it was 'too high'- taking home a £170,000 salary instead. However, his NHS credit card was used to pay for meals at some of East Yorkshire’s finest restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Pipe and Glass in South Dalton. Following his resignation in April, £1,343.23 was refunded to the credit card after a booking on getaroom.com made on March 8 was cancelled, Mr Morley's interim replacement John Saxby does not use an NHS card . 2011: £6,376.02 . Among the transactions were: . * £26.72 to Holiday Inn Blooms (February 2, 2011) * £37.50 to Tiger Tiger, the self-proclaimed 'ultimate party venue in Manchester' (July 7, 2011) * £338.15 to the Mill House, Skidby (August 11, 2011) * £281.43 to Waitrose (November 30, 2011) 2012: £11,068.32 .

While Mr Morley left the trust in April, his credit card shows a refund in the May statement of £1,343.23 from getaroom.com, relating to a booking made on March 8 this year. In 2011, his credit card was used to pay for hotel bills of £3,898.20, and £1,605.14 on restaurant bills, including ten visits to the Mill House in Skidby. His credit card was also used to pay for £281.43 of shopping at Waitrose and his overall bill for his first year as chief executive was £6,376.02. Morley’s credit card was also used to pay online retailer Amazon £495.05, including a £14.50 digital download. Last year, Phil Morley’s credit card was used to foot hotel bills of £6,818.49, including the stay at the Royal Horseguards Hotel. John Saxby said: 'There are lots of NHS organisations that use credit cards but we didn’t have credit cards in my last two organisations. I have never had a credit card and that is a moral position you take. 'For some reason, a number of credit cards were approved for use by people.. Most of them had pretty small amounts of money on them. In some cases, it was to do with purchasing around IT. 'People had been less than careful about the signing off. That has now been introduced. I just think too many had been issued. My advice is we do need to be careful about how this is perceived.' John Saxby said credit cards had been used in the past to make it 'quicker and easier' for staff to purchase goods, including software for tablets and educational courses at external venues. He pointed out although credit cards had been used to pay restaurant bills, the cost was claimed back from professional bodies, such as the Royal College of Physicians, and did not come out of the NHS or trust budgets in 'many instances'. He said: 'It is not possible for me to comment on why my predecessor paid for certain items with a credit card. 'What I am clear about, however, is my view that we should not be using credit cards unless it is absolutely necessary and we have taken steps to significantly reduce the number of cards the trust holds. 'Furthermore, when we are spending public money and using credit cards, we must take every step possible to ensure we are getting the best value for money. 'Our processes are far more robust now than they were previously. All chief executive spending is now countersigned by the chairman and chief finance officer.' Mr Morley said his £190,000 proposed salary when he joined in October 2010 was too high and cut it by £20,000, however he used his NHS credit card to eat in five star hotels and Michelin star restaurants . The trust said Mr Morley has given assurance to auditors that his credit card was used for legitimate expenses. Phil Morley was approached about the transactions but declined to comment. Ray Gray, regional officer of trade union Unison, said he was alarmed by the amount of money spent on all the trust credit cards. He said: 'I think the amount spent on hospitality is ridiculous. 'Staff are struggling to pay their own bills when they go to the supermarkets and I can’t see them being happy about this.' Mr Gray said reducing the amount of people holding trust credit cards was 'the right way forward'. Andy Silvester, from the Tax Payers’ Alliance, said: 'This is a disgrace, and taxpayers will be outraged. 'Money doesn’t grow on trees, and every penny frittered away on swanky meals and upmarket hotels is a penny that can’t be spent on doctors and nurses. 'Mr Morley - and the NHS officials who signed off the spending - have serious questions to answer.'","Phil Morley dined in Michelin star restaurants and five star hotels .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . and Nicola Rowe . Rabbits, piglets and mice are being killed when heavily . pregnant, injected with deadly bacteria and bled to death by food firms testing . fashionable superfoods, it has emerged. The experiments involve food giants including KitKat maker Nestle, Unilever - the owners of PG tips - Knorr, Hellmann’s and Yakult, the maker of probiotic drinks. Food companies stress that animals are used as little as . possible and are cared for to the highest standard. According to the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) animals including rabbits, rats, mice and piglets suffered as a result of the growing fascination with so-called 'superfoods' But the campaign group that uncovered details of the . experiments, which were carried out over the past two years, claim that most . were not done to assess the safety of the food. Instead, they say the tests appear to have been carried out to allow the . companies make health claims about their products. Examples given by the BUAV include a Unilever experiment in which piglets were given an . extract of Lipton’s tea to see if it could counter diarrhoea caused by the Ecoli . stomach bug. Eight of the month-old animals died, with severe diarrhoea . to blame in at least seven of the cases. Rabbits were historically used to test new medical treatments such as anesthetics . In another paper, also published in a scientific journal, . Nestle scientists investigating the health benefits of goji berries, a . vitamin-rich ‘superfood’, gave mice a powder based on the sweet red . fruit. The animals were then injected with acid to produce the . symptoms of bowel disease before being killed and dissected. And in experiments into whether the ‘friendly bacteria’ found in Yakult’s probiotic drinks can help ease the effects of a bad diet, . mice bled to death after having their hearts punctured. Unilever is also named by the BUAV for experiments involving . Hoodia gordonii (CORR), a spiny cactus used by tribesmen of the Kalahari desert . to stave off hunger pangs and seen as a potential appetite suppressant in the . weight-conscious western world. To test the safety of the plant in pregnancy, it was fed to . pregnant rabbits, which were then killed just before they were due to give . birth. The BUAV says that obesity should be tackled through . lifestyle changes, rather than ‘quick fixes’ such as pills and supplements. Animal testing is common for food and beauty companies, yet many claim it is for safety reasons. This image was taken in 1996 in Maryland and shows a macaque being subjected to tests at the Poolesville Primate Center . It says that other products that are already in use, such as . tea, or probiotic yoghurt, could be tested by on the people who regularly eat . or drink them. A spokesman said: ‘This type of research is not only cruel . but it is also unnecessary. ‘As well as preventing the suffering of thousands of . animals, human studies can provide a more realistic and human-relevant approach . to assessing the health benefits of food.’ Dr Katy Taylor, the BUAV’s head of science, said: 'The . public will be shocked to learn these well-known and familiar high street . brands are involved in sickening experiments on animals. ‘It is unacceptable that animals should be made to suffer by . companies in an effort to make “health benefit” claims about their products. Major names including Unilever, Nestle, Yakult and Danone have allegedly been involved in 'sickening' tests on animals . ‘The BUAV is calling on such food giants to stop testing . their food products and ingredients on animals.' A spokesman for Nestle said that one of the firm’s focuses . of research is foods that help people with medical conditions including bowel . problems. He added: ‘Nestlé does not use animal testing to develop . conventional foods and drinks, such as coffee, tea, cereal and chocolate. ‘However, animal studies are critically important to make . advances in fundamental nutrition and health science. ‘This research helps to provide the scientific basis for . developing novel ingredients, or new nutritional strategies for improving . health and wellness. ‘This includes medical foods that help people with acute and . chronic medical conditions.’ Unilever said it does not test tea or tea-based products on . animals.  If tests are required by law for safety reasons, they are kept . to a minimum and carried out by third parties. The firm said it is ‘committed to the elimination of animal . testing’.","Nestle, Unilever, Knorr, Hellmann's and Yakult accused of animal testing .

"By . Jack Doyle . The Government's NHS reforms have seen bosses handed nearly £1.6billion in redundancy payments over the past four years, the Mail reveals today . Nearly £1.6billion in redundancy payments has been given to NHS bureaucrats in the past four years, including thousands who have since been rehired. In the past 12 months alone, at least £8million was spent paying off 40 managers, handed cheques for £200,000 or more. A revolving door in the NHS means 4,000 managers paid off since the last election later returned to the health payroll. Labour said it amounted to mismanagement of the health service. A government spokesman said the cost in redundancies as a result of NHS reforms was much lower than anticipated, adding there were thousands fewer managers. Official figures published yesterday showed that in the last full financial year, 2013-14, a total of 6,330 exit payoffs were signed off for NHS staff, at a cost of £197million. Added to figures from earlier years, this took the total to 38,419 individual deals totalling £1.588billion. The figures also showed that in the same period, a total of 237 managers were given payoffs totalling between £100,000 and £150,000. Another 83 were handed cheques of between £150,000 and £200,000, and 40 walked away with more than £200,000. Since 2010-11, payouts to NHS managers have included 1,693 of between £100,000 and £150,000, and 596 worth £150,000 to £200,000. At least £74million was spent on 370 payouts worth more than £200,000. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour had predicted David Cameron’s reorganisation of the health service would cost at least £3billion and ‘this shows we were right – it explains why the NHS is now in such a financial mess’. He added: ‘This scandalous waste cannot be justified when older people are being denied essential hip and cataract operations and when cancer patients are waiting longer for treatment. ‘Nurses denied a modest pay rise will find it galling to see millions wasted on six-figure payoffs for managers who were then rehired. It amounts to mismanagement of the NHS on a mammoth scale.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, left, said the payouts constituted 'scandalous waste'. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, has said restructuring of the health service should cost no more than £1.5billion . Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the restructuring of the health service should cost no more than £1.5billion, and save an annual £1.5billion from this year onwards. Last week government auditors revealed that growing numbers of health trusts are getting into financial problems. The Department of Health said the total cost of redundancy payments directly resulting from NHS reforms was £456million – less than half the figure originally predicted. A spokesman said: ‘There are now nearly 7,000 fewer managers and over 16,450 more clinicians than in 2010.’","NHS revolving door has seen 4,000 paid-off bosses returning to the payroll .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Texas woman Lanie Brown was only hoping to find some good deals at her nearby flea market when she came across a message to a fallen hero. Brown says she was visiting the flea market in Hemphill, Texas when she found the flag. While every other flag was selling for $15 or $30, this one was had no price tag because people had written on it. Among the two dozen odd messages on the flag: 'We'll always remember the sacrifice you made,' and 'Thank you for being who you were...Rest in peace.' This tribute flag to a fallen Marine was discovered in a Texas flea market at a discount price because of the writing on it . The flag was in memory of Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel, who's mother Patsy Maciel said she had no idea that such a thing existed or how it found its way to flea market . Hope Dorris gets a painting presented by Ken Pridgeon Sr. of her grandson Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel during the flag's unveiling . While the seller thought the writing devalued it, Brown recognized the true meaning immediately. 'We realized it was a flag intended for a fallen Marine,' she told Click2Houston. 'We knew we had to take it home with us. 'She . said because it had writing on it we could have it for $5. We'd have paid whatever she asked for it. It's priceless.' The messages revealed that the flag was in memory of Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel. Hope Dorris, left, is comforted by her daughter, Patsy Maciel, the mother of Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel . The flag is covered with messages honoring Maciel's service overseas . The Brown family was able to track down the flag's rightful owners thanks to the writing on the stripes . They were able to track his family down in Houston, just two hours away. The marine's mother, Patsy Maciel, says she had no idea there was a flag. 'I never knew it existed and here is this flag, in . a flea market over two hours away from me,' Patsy Maciel said. 'Nobody . knows how it got there.' She said he son died in a 2005 helicopter crash in Fallujah at the age of 20. 'He told me he was born to be a marine,' Maciel said. 'He died doing what he loved. I finally had to accept that.' A flag that once belonged to Lance Cpl. Fred Maciel is unveiled at Calvary Hill Cemetery on Saturday in Humble, Texas . Lanie Brown, who discovered the flag, was familiar with marine custom as both her son and son-in-law are marines . The Brown's immediately had a connection to the Maciel family as their own son-in-law and son are Marine's, with their son-in-law serving in Iraq at the same time as Maciel's son. At the time the story broke, Maciel and the Browns had yet to meet in person speaking only on the phone. They planned to meet Saturday at the young Maciel's gavesite where his mother will finally receive the flag that should have been presented to her nearly a decade ago.","Lanie Brown understood the flag's significance because of the memorial writing on it .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A father in Colorado has won praise by local police after helping an officer take down a crazed gunman following a two-hour crime spree. The incident occurred in broad day light on Wednesday on Interstate-70 near Lookout Mountain in Golden. The suspect, Christopher Sullivan, 37, and his juvenile female passenger had been pulled over by police for a random record check, but fled the scene. The pair then embarked on a case in which they stole three vehicles, burglarized two homes, menaced 12 bystanders and left at least six separate crime scenes in their wake. Dramatic: John McLaughlin (green shirt) races to help a sheriff's deputy subdue an armed men following a two-hour crime spree . A dramatic video taken from a TV news helicopter . has captured the moment a brazen carjacker pointed a semi-automatic . weapon at passing cars, before he was finally arrested by a brave cop . and a motorist, pictured . Brace: John McLaughlin (left) has spoken about the moment he helped a deputy take down carjacking suspect Christopher Sullivan (right) ABC 7 Denver's helicopter captured part of the chase. The female juvenile was eventually captured on a mountainside. However Sullivan made it to the freeway and was pointing a rifle at passers-by, allegedly attempting to jack another car. A Jefferson County sheriff's deputy came past on a motorcycle and immediately drew his gun. 'He was out right away with his handgun drawn yelling, 'Get down. Get down!' said John McLaughlin, who watched it all unfold from his Hyundai. 'The guy had his hands up and he said, 'Don't shoot. Don't shoot!' The chase continued, and Sullivan ran toward McLaughlin's car. He had thrown his weapon away moments earlier. The manhunt for Sullivan (right) and his female . accomplice (left) first began after an armed carjacking was reported . on Lookout Mountain, west of Golden, Colorado, on Wednesday . The girl - who is underage - became separated from Sullivan and was arrested around 4.15pm. She is seen here with a police officer . Sullivan then entered this nearby home, stole an SUV and crashed it through the garage door . The suspect drove the SUV for a short time but ended up at a dead end. He fled the vehicle on foot . This is the moment a Jefferson County sheriff's deputy found Sullivan and drew his weapon . Sullivan attempted to highjack another car by pointing his rifle at motorists . He was not successful and appeared to surrender, only to run again . The deputy then grabbed hold of Sullivan's shirt as McLaughlin watches the scene from his car (front left) 'I could've reached out and grabbed the guy, he was that close,' McLaughlin said. As the deputy managed to grab Sullivan, McLaughlin figured he should help. He could not see any other officers nearby. 'I was just concerned that he might be able to get up with just one officer on him so I thought, well I can assist and hold his legs down.' Authorities said it was a crucial move that may have saved lives. '[A deputy] said I wish there were more people out there that would respond to things like that like you did. So that was very rewarding and nice to hear,' McLaughlin said. 'One police officer said ... you could've saved a couple of lives.' Sullivan is being held on a $1 million bond at the Jefferson County Jail and is facing 13 possible charges including criminal attempt first-degree murder of a police officer, aggravated robbery, first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft and criminal attempt first-degree aggravated motor vehicle theft, identity theft, theft and numerous warrants from previous crimes.

"By . Associated Press . Congress has passed a bill that makes it legal to 'unlock' cellphones so the devices can be used on other carriers in some instances. The law, which President Obama said he looks forward to signing, undoes a move by the Librarian of Congress in 2012. That made it a copyright violation to unlock a phone without the carrier's permission. The law passed Friday by the House of Representatives makes it legal to unlock phones for personal use, at least until the Librarian's next round of rulemaking, next year. The measure was passed earlier by the Senate. New law: Congress has passed a bill that makes it legal to 'unlock' cellphones so the devices can be used on other carriers in some instances . Unlocking typically involves entering codes on the phone. In more difficult cases, the phone needs to be hooked up to a computer to have new software installed. Carriers have, in some instances, sued people who made a business out of unlocking phones and reselling them, but individuals unlocking for personal use have never been pursued. Carriers have become more lenient in their unlocking policies in recent years. Verizon, for instance, ships most of its phones unlocked. However, technical differences mean that it's often difficult to move a phone from one network to another, and if you can make the move, phone functions are impaired. The easiest move is between AT&T and T-Mobile US.","Congress passed a bill Friday allowing unlocked phones to be used on other carriers .

"By . Jason Groves . Moscow last night warned that plans for European sanctions on Russia’s banks, oligarchs and defence sector will make the global financial crisis worse. European ambassadors gathered in Brussels yesterday to hammer out a tough new package aimed at bringing some of the country’s leading banks to their knees. Officials also agreed travel bans and asset freezes on a number of senior figures, including Vladimir Putin’s spy chief. Scroll down for video . Russia's ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko, pictured with the Queen in 2011, suggested the West will suffer more if it presses ahead with sanctions . But in a menacing intervention, Russia’s ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko suggested the West will suffer more if it presses ahead with sanctions that Moscow considers ‘illegal, unreasonable and counterproductive’. Mr Yakovenko did not specify whether Russia would retaliate, although Moscow has the power to cause chaos by turning off the gas supplies that many EU countries rely on. But at a Press conference in London, he said: ‘In my view the sectoral sanctions against Russia may well trigger a long anticipated end-game of the present global crisis.’ It was also reported last night that  Moscow could take retaliatory action against British firms operating in Russia such as Shell and BP. A diplomatic source told the Telegraph: ‘We want friendly relations. We will go along as far as we can then we will retaliate.’ Mr Yakovenko also denied that Moscow was arming the separatists suspected of shooting down flight MH17 and accused the West of trying to cover up the true causes of the crash. A pro-Russian rebel touches the MH17 wreckage at the crash site near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine . His comments came as it emerged proposed EU sanctions on Russia’s state-owned banks go much further than expected. Leaked documents reveal plans to restrict their ‘access to capital markets’. They would be banned from issuing new bonds in the EU, a market worth £6billion last year. The move would affect four major  banks including Sberbank and VTB, both listed on the London Stock Exchange. But proposals to curb defence exports are much less draconian, and will allow France to press ahead with a controversial £1billion warship deal, which David Cameron described as ‘unthinkable’. French Foreign Minister Larent Fabius hit back with a thinly-veiled attack on Britain’s role in the 2003 Iraq war. In the coming days Brussels is expected to publish an initial list of about 15 senior Putin allies who will face travel bans and asset freezes. It is understood to include the head of Russia’s feared secret service Alexander Bortnikov, although critics pointed out he does not travel abroad. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson last night defended his plans to take part in a £160,000 tennis match in a Tory Party fundraiser with the wife of one of Mr Putin’s former ministers. The London Mayor insisted the Foreign Office had been asked to check Vladimir Chernukhin was no longer an associate of the Russian leader. But critics said it was extraordinary that the Tories were apparently using the Foreign Office as a ‘private investigator’ to vet party donors.","Alexander Yakovenko called sanctions 'illegal and counterproductive'

Now Monica is taking the Brooklyn based company Visualaz to court, reports mamamia.com. Visualaz is run by Igor Boshoer and his wife Valerie. Igor boasts Hollywood credits for visual effects for films such as 'The Wolf of Wall Street.' Monica told the Mail Online that Visualaz claims to be a Hollywood production company and that they kept putting off her video because they had 'too much other Hollywood work' to do. She explained that they are a new company for whom wedding videos are a 'side job' but she was willing to give them a chance after seeing other wedding trailers they'd completed. Monica said she never saw a full video of theirs before her wedding otherwise she may not have chosen them. She says her own wedding trailer makes her wedding video appear to be fun and romantic but she says in reality the trailer is a misrepresentation of what her video really is like. Monica told the Mail Online that the trouble with the company Visualaz started before they even received the video. The New York Daily News reports that when the couple asked for a short 'love story clip' to be played during the ceremony, the filmmakers suggested that Komrash should be dressed as a transvestite in a dress who falls in love with his future wife, says court papers filed Wednesday in the Brooklyn Supreme Court. Monica told the Mail Online that her husband expressed wishes for the 'love story clip' to be a scene from his favorite movie but that Visualaz rejected his ideas. From the trailer: She puts on a dress made by her very own company, 'Monica's Bridal' From The trailer: The groom, Felix Komrash, also prepares to walk down the aisle . From the trailer: Monica puts on her veil just before she is about to get married . Nikchemny said that the transvestite suggestion from Visualaz was 'very inappropriate and disrespectful' and a 'complete joke.' Nikhemny also claims that the video company only showed up with a small piece of the equipment they promised in their $13,000 contract. When the bride did receive the video after 'months of postponement' she said it lacked a 'beginning middle and an end.' 'They acted in such a way that was so extreme and outrageous,' said the family's lawyer, Mikhail Usher. 'We're asking for damages above and beyond the contract.' Usher told the Mail Online that they are asking for the $13,000 cost of the wedding video plus punitive damages for 'mistreatment' and for causing emotional distress. 'A lot of publications keep changing the amounts we are suing the company for,' said Monica's lawyer. 'We are asking for around $50,000,' he said. Nikchemny owns a third generation bridal store in Sheepshead Bay called 'Monica's Bridal' and says it was important to her that her wedding was perfect and top-notch. Nikchemny got the video when she was pregnant an says that the stress caused by the video led to 'medical complications.' Doctors checked the bride's blood sugar the same week she received the video and it was dangerously high due to her stress levels 'caused by the video.' 'How can I show my son this video?' she asked. 'These memories, I'll never be able to get back again.' Monica claims if she wanted the raw footage she'd have to sign over the rights to her own wedding video. She said the raw video was also . missing important parts of her ceremony such as the cocktail hour, . dessert table, and the signing of the Jewish wedding agreement. 'My wedding video was basically just people dancing,' said Monica. They left out key moments, she said, like the cigar bar and other parts of the ceremony. The company was surprised to hear that the couple didn't like their video. Visualaz got a positive response from fans on facebook who applauded the 14 minute trailer. Monica warns people not to be 'fooled' by the same trailer that she received one month after her wedding. The Mail Online tried contacting Visualaz but no one was available for comment.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates - with many citing TV host Holly Willoughby as their inspiration . As the summer holidays end, there’s only one group putting maximum effort into looking immaculate for the first day back at school – and it isn’t the children. Mothers spend an average of £87 to make sure they look their best at the school gates, figures out yesterday reveal. When many children return to class on Monday, mums will have spent a collective £658million on clothes, jewellery and beauty treatments as one in five of them admits they feel under pressure to look glamorous on the school run. One in six plans their outfit at least a week in advance, research by discount website VoucherCodes.co.uk shows. Some 8 per cent also get their hair and nails done and even have their fake tan topped up in order to dazzle at the school gate, spending an average of £25.88 on spa treatments. And 7 per cent admit they make an effort due to their crush on the teacher – with 4 per cent of single mums seeing the drop-off  as a chance to find love. Of the 1,000 mums polled, most cited TV host Holly Willoughby as their inspiration for school run style, with singer Myleene Klass in second place. One in seven will fork out for a completely new ensemble, with more than one in four admitting they spend time on their appearance to avoid embarrassing their child in front of classmates. Mothers in London spend the most, splashing out an average £136.10 on looking perfect. Other school gate models included Elle McPherson, Tess Daly, Jools Oliver and Stella McCartney. Anita Naik, consumer editor at VoucherCodes.co.uk, said: 'Competitive mums put a lot of effort into making sure their children are seen to have and be the best. 'But our research shows they put the same pressures on themselves - making sure they look trendy to impress their child’s classmates and teachers and the other parents. Singer Myleene Klass (left) was in second place for the second most envied school run style. Other school gate models included Elle McPherson, Tess Daly, Jools Oliver (right) and Stella McCartney . 'For mums hoping to look good for the school run without blowing a hefty chunk of the family budget it’s worth downloading money-saving apps designed to show you the best deals available while you’re out and about. 'It’s also worth bearing in mind that beauty salons often provide introductory rates, so mums getting their hair or nails done should think about trying a new place and checking whether they can get a deal as a first time customer.'","Mums spend a collective £658million to look glamorous on the school run .

"By . David Wilkes And Neil Sears . An African wildcat that was at the centre of a police search after it escaped whilst its owners were on holiday was caught after it was corned by a tiny house cat in the back of a neighbours garden, say police. The African wildcat was spotted by a neighbour in their garden late last night, close to where the cat had first gone missing near where its owners lived. A neighbour saw their own tiny house cat challenge the big African cat which had been described as 'dangerous', but both were equally scared of one another. Scroll down for video . Safari time in suburbia: The escaped serval pads past the shrubbery and climbing frame in a Surrey garden yesterday . Found: Elmbridge Police tweeted Great News!!! The missing serval from West Molesey has been reunited with their owner - thank you to all who helped with the search . The unnamed neighbour called the police and they arrived at 8.50pm. They told police that they had watched several local reports in the media and realised that the missing African wildcat was in their garden prowling around. They then said how they saw their own pet cat challenge the big cat but said both looked quite scared of each other. A police spokesperson for West Moseley police told Mail Online: ‘The owner of the cat turned up to get the cat from the neighbour’s house and brought a blanket to subdue him. ‘The neighbours called the police and they all arrived at the house at 8.50pm last night. ‘When the wildcat was captured, it was nervous and worried as it had not been out of the house before. ‘But it calmed down when the owner threw a blanket over it. West Mosely Police confirm that the owner will not face any charges, but will be given advice on how to look after animals properly so that it does not happen again. West Moseley Police were called after the cat was found. The large African wild cat had been seen creeping menacingly past the undergrowth showing just why it is nicknamed the ‘savannah stalker’. But . it was no match for a smaller pet and West Molesey Police which launched a widespread . search - including a police helicopter - for the 'dangerous' cat in . Surrey after it went missing. In a tweet by Elmbridge Police today, it was confirmed that the cat had been found. The tweet read: 'Great news!!! the missing serval from West Molesey has been reunited with their owner - thank you to all who helped with the search. The message was then re-tweeted by West Molesey Police who had lead the search. Yesterday, before its capture a picture emerged of  the cat near a neat . lawn, climbing frame and slide which were all giveaways that this particular beast – . a potentially dangerous serval – is a long way from its natural home. For this . display of stealth was taking place yesterday not in the wilds of Africa . but in the tame gardens of north Surrey, well within the stockbroker . belt. The exact location of the suburban safari was West Molesey where shocked householder Allan Tinkler captured the serval on camera as it padded past his shrubbery. Police warned that the wild cat should not be approached. A police helicopter and the RSPCA joined the hunt and the public were asked to call 999 if they spotted the animal. It is owned by a local couple who had left it in the care of a cat-sitter while on holiday. But it gave its guardian the slip and was last night on the loose, until it was caught at 8.50pm. The serval: a cat of spare parts . Police said it had been reported missing at around 9am yesterday having escaped from an address in West Molesey. Fortunately it is well domesticated. A police spokesman said: ‘At around 9am today we received a report that a serval cat was on the loose. ‘The pet cat had escaped from an address in Anne Way, West Molesey. ‘The animal is registered as a dangerous cat although it is not believed to be aggressive.’ The serval, similar in appearance to a small leopard, stands about 18 inches tall and is 2ft long. Its owners are believed to be due back from holiday today. One of their neighbours, Percy Cooper, said: ‘I have been keeping an eye out for it in my garden and have seen the helicopter going overhead but I haven’t seen the cat.’ The police helicopter crew joked on Twitter: ‘On safari with @SurreyPolice looking for escaped serval. Search continues.’ Serval owners in the UK must have a licence to keep them as pets - which the police confirmed that the owners had for the cat. The animals are also cross-bred with domestic cats to produce Savannah cats, which can sell for more than £600 each as kittens. Video courtesy of Big Cat Rescue . The serval is known as the 'cat of spare parts' thanks to ears and legs which are very big for its body size, its small head, long neck and short tail. Large ears let it hear the rodents it hunts as they tunnel underground. Long legs allow it to leap vertically up to ten feet in the air to catch birds. Their beautifully patterned hair makes them attractive to poachers.","Large African wildcat was found prowling around in a neighbour's garden .

"By . Nick Craven And Peter Robertson . Fraud probe: Lee Jones, former general manager of Champneys spa in Tring . To millions of TV viewers, Lee Jones was the smooth star of a documentary about luxury health spa Champneys. The manager of the resort in Hertfordshire, whose clients include Barbra Streisand, pandered to his guests’s every whim. But last week, after a tip-off from a viewer, the venue in Tring found itself at the centre of a fraud investigation as around £10,000 from petty cash was discovered to be missing… and so was Mr Jones. The slick 40-year-old, who drove a £60,000 Range Rover, began working at Champneys last September as deputy manager, then took over as general manager in April. Colleagues recalled the 6ft 3in charmer as ‘incredibly charismatic’. They were also intrigued by his background: he told them his mother held a stake in Louis Vuitton and that his QC father had thrown him out because he was gay. Mr Jones said his mother gave him a £10,000-a-month allowance but he wanted to work to show his father he could ‘be something’. He claimed he lived in a £5 million house in Notting Hill – only later was it discovered that ‘Curly Crescent’ doesn’t exist. After the screening of the ITV documentary this month, PR director Cheryl Howard recognised the man she claims tried to fleece her. When confronted by Champneys bosses last Monday, Mr Jones dismissed the claims as ‘fantasy’, then left for the day, saying he wanted to consult lawyers. He never returned. According to Champneys sources, last week Mr Jones withdrew £6,100 from petty cash, telling colleagues it was authorised by the spa’s co-owner Stephen Purdew. An earlier withdrawal for £3,500 was explained as ‘garden furniture for Mr Purdew’. Mr Purdew denied any knowledge of either transaction. Ms Howard said she met Mr Jones two years ago when he was working at a London hotel, and she had no reason to think he was anything other than respectable. Last summer, Mr Jones told her he was temporarily homeless and she offered to let him stay at her house in Weybridge, Surrey. A few weeks later she noticed unusual activity on her credit and store cards. ‘I was in Harrods and one of the managers asked me how it was that I was simultaneously in the store and trying to buy something on my online account,’ she said. ‘Someone using the delivery address of my house in Weybridge was trying to order £2,080 worth of kitchen equipment, flowers, sports clothing and suits.’ Clients at the luxury Champneys spa (pictured) in Tring, Hertfordshire include Barbra Streisand . She suspected Mr Jones and told him to leave, and then found three credit cards had been fraudulently applied for using her address. She called police, who referred her to Action Fraud, the national fraud agency. They have not contacted her since. When Mrs Howard saw the same man on TV she called Champneys. Yesterday it was confirmed a case of alleged ‘employee-related fraud’ at Champneys was being investigated by Action Fraud. The Mail on Sunday yesterday tracked Mr Jones down to a £90,000 terraced house in Redditch, Worcestershire. His parents – Mary, 64, and David, 65 – live in a £120,000 ex-council house in Oldbury, West Midlands. Mr Jones Snr is not a QC, and his wife does not have shares in Louis Vuitton. ‘Our Lee’s been on holiday, but he’s just got back. I’ll tell him you’re trying to contact him,’ said Mrs Jones. Though someone was clearly in at Mr Jones’s house, no one answered the door. We put our allegations in writing through the letterbox, but received no response.","Lee Jones was star of documentary about luxury health spa Champneys .

"By . John Mcgarry . Not quite a cricket score at the home of Scottish rugby but, nonetheless, the kind of emphatic, seemingly effortless victory that Ronny Deila would have coveted so greatly as he made his ‘home’ bow as Celtic manager. A new boss and an alien venue was a potentially lethal combination for Celtic as they attempted to move closer to a third successive qualification for the group stages. Yet this was as assured a performance as their supporters could have wished for under the circumstances. As a consequence, the new man on the bridge already has a degree of wind in his sails. Sterner tests undoubtedly lie in wait for the Norwegian and his players in the coming weeks than a Reykjavik side that lacked any semblance of belief they would pull off a highly-improbable aggregate comeback. However, that shouldn’t detract from a proficient, ruthless display by the Scottish champions that hinted at much more to come. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Celtic manager Ronny Deila . Job done: Virgil van Dijk celebrates after Celtic secured their place in the next round of qualifying . Opener: Van Dijk flicks home from close range to make it 1-0 to Celtic in the 14th minute . Jumping for joy: Virgil van Dijk punches the air after putting Celtic ahead in the early stages .

Whether . it’s Legia Warsaw or St Patrick’s who next roll up in Edinburgh, the . Murrayfield experience will hold no fears now for Deila’s men. It might . not be home but nor should it be seen as detrimental to their chances of . reaching the group stages either. Last . night’s perfunctory victory was as much a psychological exercise as a . physical one. The issue over the stadium and its hybrid surface will . surely now barely be worthy of a mention when they regroup there in a . fortnight’s time for what’s likely to be their last visit. By . the time they had eased their way into the third qualifying round by a . combined five-goal margin, all concerns over the switch of venue . suddenly seemed rather absurd. Lingering . worries over the change of manager will naturally remain until more . arduous hurdles are cleared - but the positivity that has surrounded the . former Stromgodset man from the first minute he landed in Scotland . shows no sign of abating. The . 4-2-3-1 formation his side shaped with a week ago was again in evidence . and it permitted his side to control the match from the first whistle . until the last with fluency and zest. It . wasn’t the first time Celtic had played a ‘home’ tie in Europe on alien . territory, although few among the 36,000 crowd would have witnessed the . famous slaying of Leeds at Hampden in the 1970 European Cup semi-final.

Test: Celtic boss Ronny Deila gets a feel for the pitch at Murrayfield ahead of the game . More . than 136,000 had descended on Mount Florida that evening – a European . record that will surely never be broken – and last night’s gathering in . the east was never likely to attract more than a fraction of that . number. Celtic did their . level best to replicate the feel of Parkhead in a stadium with 7,000 . more seats than their spiritual home. They made a decent fist of it with . hundreds of latecomers rushing from the Murrayfield hostelries to . applaud Deila as he took his place on the bench for the first time in a . competitive game in Scotland as Celtic manager. There . would be no quibble with the welcome afforded by their hosts. The . Scottish Rugby Union had promised a newly-laid surface fit for a . Champions League qualifier and it was that and then some. A combination . of grass and synthetic fibres, Murrayfield might well have made a late . entry to host the lawn bowls at the Commonwealth Games. It . was tailor-made for the high-intensity, passing game championed by . Deila. The wide expanses were a source of torment for a Reykjavik side . who had just about kept themselves in the tie a week ago with a compact, . diligent display on home soil. Midfield battle: Celtic's Callum McGregor challenges Gary Martin for the ball in the centre of the park . The . clicking of mobile phone cameras among the Icelandic players as they . inspected the turf in their suits pre-match was a subtle indication that . their ambitions didn’t stretch far beyond savouring the occasion. Within . half an hour, already three goals down on the night, you suspected the . visitors had already had enough of sight-seeing in the capital. Teemu . Pukki ought to have beaten Stefan Magnusson when one-on-one inside five . minutes but Virgil van Dijk’s six-minute brace – with both goals . springing from corners - rendered that irrelevant. Pukki’s . second near thing of the evening was more down to the agility of the . visiting keeper than the Finn’s shortcomings but commendably he was on . hand to sweep home his side’s third moments later following Callum . McGregor’s cut-back. Clinical: Teemu Pukki slams a shot past Magnusson to make it 3-0 to the hosts before half-time . Easy peasy: Pukki saunters over to team-mate McGregor to celebrate Celtic's third . Game, set and match: Pukki adds a fourth after Magnusson, in purple, had raced from his goal . With . the match over as a contest long before Latvian referee Andris Treimanis . brought the first half to a close, there was a degree of inevitability . about Deila’s men easing off a fraction in the second period. Kris Commons twice menaced Magnusson with vicious efforts from distance that the KR keeper did well to parry. On . a night of seemingly boundless positives, Deila was able to hand both . Beram Kayal and Adam Matthews half an hour each while Liam Henderson . enjoyed the last 18. Henderson . oddly arrived on the scene to a chorus of good-natured boos – the . reason being that Pukki was going the other way at the same time seconds . after side-stepping Magnusson to clinically claim his second and his . side’s fourth.

"By . Nikki Murfitt . Supermarkets losing £100million a year propping up their online delivery services. Experts say that while supermarkets often charge £3 or £4 for each home delivery, the actual cost to them is £20. As a result, they are effectively paying customers to shop with them. Retail analyst Dave McCarthy said: ‘The transition from in-store retailing to online retailing in the grocery market is losing the industry £100million profit per annum. It costs Tesco around £20 to deliver to their customers whoi pay around £4 for the service . ‘When a customer switches from shopping in a store to shopping online, it is a lot less profitable for the retailer, which suffers a double whammy. The store loses profits from the lost sales and importantly, a contribution to fixed costs such as rates, energy and the store manager’s wages. ‘And when the customer shops online, the retailer incurs extra costs for packing the products, paying transportation costs, wages, fuel and for the cost of the vehicle which is an expensive, multi-temperature-controlled vehicle.’ Morrisons and Tesco are among the big supermarkets who are losing out on home deliveries . Mr McCarthy tells a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary to be screened tomorrow night: ‘Discount supermarkets are growing at twice the rate of online shopping, yet the big four keep investing and chasing online custom. ‘How much trade would these supermarkets lose if they stopped online? The answer is not as much as they are losing out to the growth of discount supermarkets.’ The beleaguered supermarket giants – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have seen combined lost sales of more than £3billion in recent years and have slashed thousands of jobs. Last week, Tesco ousted embattled chief executive Philip Clarke after yet another dire profits warning. Last week, Tesco ousted embattled chief executive Philip Clarke after yet another dire profits warning . The success of discount chains such as Lidl and Aldi has meant that middle class shoppers are happy to boast about how savvy they are with their money, and take pride in the fact that they don’t fall victim to the consumerism being promoted by the big four. Mr McCarthy says: ‘As the recession hit, consumers were forced to go elsewhere and as a result they have experimented by trying products in the discount stores and found what they do and don’t like. ‘The discount stores have a compelling offer. They are providing quality and value for money.’ Dispatches quotes customers saying that shopping at Aldi has cut their grocery bill in half without compromising on quality. One said: ‘That was a big surprise. You think because something is cheap then it is probably going to be rubbish quality but it is just the opposite. ‘I used to shop in Sainsbury’s but felt I was being taken for a ride.’","Customers pay £3 for delivery but price to shops is actually £20 .

Peter John, 54, was found dying as his wife Donna, up to 50 other mourners and a priest gathered around her stepfather’s coffin at the City of London cemetery in East London. The casket had just been lowered into the ground when a cemetery worker discovered Mr John bleeding and unconscious nearby. Peter John, 54, was found dying as his wife Donna, up to 50 other mourners and a priest gathered around her stepfather's coffin at the City of London cemetery in East London (pictured) He had been attacked with a screwdriver after leaving the other mourners to visit the lavatory.  Mrs John, 48, left the graveside of her stepfather David Brown to be told the shocking news. ‘I don’t even remember the last words Peter said to me,’ Mrs John told The Mail on Sunday. ‘All I remember is him saying, “I am going to the toilet” and that’s it. ‘Next thing I know, somebody said, “Everybody has to leave the cemetery because somebody has been murdered.” I never thought it was my husband. After that I sat on the grass verge in shock. I am still in shock.’ Mr John was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital in nearby Whitechapel where he was pronounced dead at 8.05pm with his wife and partner of 26 years by his side. Mrs John said: ‘We did everything together. He did not have any enemies. We just lived a simple life in East Acton. I feel so awful and I don’t know what to think.’ Police arrested a 52-year-old man who was last night still in custody. Scotland Yard said officers were keeping an ‘open mind’ as to the motive. Mr John was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital (pictured) in nearby Whitechapel where he was pronounced dead at 8.05pm with his wife and partner of 26 years by his side . It was unclear whether the killer was linked to the funeral. But within hours of the murder, forensics teams were carrying out searches at the scene. The funeral that preceded Wednesday’s burial service took place at Our Lady of The Assumption Church in Bethnal Green. Father Tom O’Brien said: ‘I had to leave a little bit earlier in the hearse [after the burial] and only heard about it afterwards.’ A cemetery spokesman said the worker who discovered Mr John dying – a digger driver – was receiving ‘all the emotional support he needs’. A post-mortem examination is likely to take place tomorrow.

"By . David Kent . Former Manchester United defender Mikael Silvestre last week caused consternation when he accused the Manchester City of 'buying trophies' and 'shutting the door' to young talent. However, the Frenchman's remarks were greeted with wry smiles by the powers-that-be at the Etihad Stadium, for Silvestre actually pleaded to cross the divide and join City in the summer of 2010. After spending two years with Arsenal, the curtain was coming down on Silvestre's career when he approached City to offer his services. United: Mikael Silvestre for played for Man Utd for nine years before moving to Arsenal ad then Werder Bremen . Silvestre, for nine years a player at Old Trafford between 1999 and 2008, made the remarks at a promotional event in his role as a United ambassador in the United States last week. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, a Manchester City insider said: 'Silvestre came to us when his contract had expired at Arsenal and asked if we would be interested in signing him. 'In fact, he was a bit desperate about it. It was a touch embarrassing to see a former United player in such obvious need of a final pay day. 'There was never any chance of Silvestre coming to City, of course, but it seems he's now got an ace to grind. Embarrassing: Man City bought players from all over the Premier League but said they had no interest in Silvestre . Rivals: Mikael Silvestre watches on as Trevor Sinclair puts City 1-0 up against Manchester United . 'We read his comments about Manchester City with a mixture of surprise and amusement, given they were made by a player who made it clear he was happy to come and play for a club he apparently has no respect for if we paid his wages. 'There used to be a time when it was said that City spoke more about United than their own club - but it seems the opposite is true now. 'It would be interesting to see if Mikel Silvestre is aware of the money both Manchester clubs have spent in the transfer market during 2014. He might be surprised.'","Mikael Silvestre criticised Manchester City for 'buying' success .

"By . John Mcgarry . When Charlie Mulgrew left Celtic first time around, he did so not so much as under a cloud as under angry, darkened skies. A public spat with former manager Gordon Strachan stamped the player’s ticket to England – initially with Wolves – and there seemed no doubt back then that it was of the one-way variety. If the chances of the player returning to the home of his boyhood heroes looked slim as he embarked on a tour of duty including outposts like Southend, then the prospect of him skippering the Parkhead side one day looked next to nil. Turnaround: Charlie Mulgrew is set for the armband against KR Reykjavik . Little wonder then that upon being handed the armband in Iceland by Ronny Deila last week in the absence of the injured Scott Brown,  the 28-year-old midfielder took a moment to take stock. Whilst Mulgrew had occasionally enjoyed the honour under previous manager Neil Lennon, never before had he led the team out for a European tie. ‘Being captain is huge,’ Mulgrew said. ‘Growing up a Celtic fan, to captain the side – be it in a friendly or a reserve match, never mind a Champions League qualifier, is a proud moment. It’s a huge honour and I’m delighted. ‘When I left Celtic the first time, I never thought something like this would happen. When you leave, coming back is the last thing on your mind – never mind captaining the club. ‘What was the secret? Keep believing in yourself and hard work is the main thing. But it’s a proud moment to stand in for Broony and I’m delighted.’ Now a seasoned Champions League and international player, Mulgrew might well have been forgiven for glossing over the honour bestowed on him in Reykjavik. A lifetime of following the club taught him better, though, while the esteemed company he joined served to remind him of his responsibilities. In talks: Mulgrew chatting with Leigh Griffiths in training . ‘Paul McStay was a great captain when I was growing up. Neil Lennon, too, and Henrik Larsson captained the side. ‘There are guys like Jackie McNamara - and Billy McNeill won the European Cup as captain. ‘I grew up as a Celtic fan and watched some of these guys captain the club. It’ s a dream come true to do it. ‘It is an important role. You just have to lead by example. Scott has done that for three years and I will try to carry that on. ‘It’s a great confidence boost to be handed the armband after he got injured. He’s a great captain and it’s good that the manager has come in and seen me as a captain, too. ‘There is an added responsibility but you just try to do things the way you normally do. ‘The responsibility is in the back of your mind, but you just need to keep doing your normal things.’ Captain's role: Facing the press ahead of the key Champions League game . Very much his own man, Mulgrew believes there would be no sense in him attempting to merely parrot the approach of Brown in the lead-up to tonight’s second leg. ‘We are two different characters,’ he insisted. ‘We are good friends off the pitch and hopefully some of what he does rubs off on me. ‘Do I see myself as a leader? I suppose I’d like to think I lead by example in some ways. But that’s for other people to say. If I’m captain, I’ll just look to lead by example. ‘I’ll speak to younger players but I do that anyway. I try to help the young guys naturally.’ For all Celtic lead by a goal going into tonight’s match, the job isn’t yet done. Given the high-stakes game they hope to be a part of, Deila’s side can assume nothing. ‘We just look after ourselves and hopefully that will be enough,’ Mulgrew added. ‘It won’t be easy. It never is when a team camps in to defend. ‘But we created chances in Iceland and hopefully we can do the same again and take them this time. ‘Maybe it should have been more convincing over there but it’s early in the season and that bit of sharpness will come. There are just small things that we need to work on.’","Charlie Mulgrew set for Celtic armband on Tuesday .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A 28-year-old woman fed up with being catcalled is taking on her street harassers by confronting them and secretly filming their reactions. Lindsey from Minneapolis aims to show the 'cumulative daily impact' of unwanted wolf whistles or sexual comments on women with a series of videos posted online. In the clips, Lindsey asks the men to explain their sexist behavior - and is shocked at their defense. 'Where I come from, we holler at women. I'm sorry if that offends you, but you shouldn't feel that way because women are put on this earth to satisfy a man,' 'Jared' from Ohio says. 'If she feels offended, she should never have been born.' Scroll down for video . Confronting street harassers: Lindsey was walking to work when two businessmen loudly faux-whispered 'Minnesota chicks are hot' her (one of the men is pictured). She explained to them they made her feel uncomfortable . Strange compliment: This stranger called Lindsey a 'b***h' when he walked by her and explained it meant 'sexy' when she confronted him . Keen: Lindsey said she was on her way to work this month when this man hollered at her from across the street . Lindsey, who refuses to provide her last name, posted her late night exchange with 'Jared' to YouTube on Thursday. She said she was at a bus stop when 'Jared' solicited her. He continued to harass her when she refused him. When she asked him why he wouldn't give up, he said he believed she was interested in him and that he 'wasn't going to stop what he was doing.' He added: 'White women get offended when black men approach them.' Lindsey responded: 'Listen, I'll yell at white men about this, I'll yet at women about this. The point is, I should be able to walk down the street, just like you should be able to walk down the street.' 'Jared' Fed up: Lindsey said she'd been harassed numerous times in a five minute walk down Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis when she decided to confront catcaller 'Umar' Lindsey has posted a number of similar exchanges online, telling Buzzfeed she starts conversations with catcallers to understand their motivation. 'I . am genuinely interested in what place this is coming from,' she said. 'The theme I hear the most often is that . they truly, genuinely think it’s a compliment, and they are shocked. If that is true, then simply telling people it’s not a . compliment may go a long way... 'The filming provides them a platform to embarrass themselves in a way that they’ve already embarrassed me.' The young woman began posting the videos this week, after a stranger touched her hair and called her 'blondie' on an escalator. When she told the man he 'could just say hi', he yelled at her and called her ugly. Astonished at the bizarre reaction and wanting to do something about it, Lindsey has also created a series of pocket-sized cards which explains why catcalling is inappropriate. 'Cards Against Harassment' Cards Against Harassment: Lindsey has created 10 sample cards which are on her website designed to explain to catcallers why their behavior is offensive . 'Minnesota chicks are hot' She has handed out at least 30 cards this summer, seizing opportunities to educate catcallers on their bad behavior. However she notes on her website that they shouldn't be used in situations where a woman feels unsafe. 'Being harassed by strangers isn't fun, but now, responding to street harassment can be,' the website says about the cards. Other exchanges Lindsey has filmed include a man who called her a 'b***h' before explaining it meant sexy, and two businessmen who loudly muttered 'Minnesota women are hot' at her as she walked by.

"By . David Clough, Press Association . MS Dhoni has complained bitterly about the 'very hurtful decision' to fine Ravindra Jadeja for his alleged spat with James Anderson during the first Investec Test. Jadeja was fined 50 per cent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council, a sum in the region of £3,000, over the fracas reported in the Trent Bridge pavilion stairwell. England fast bowler Anderson will face a more stringent punishment - up to a four-Test ban - if he is found guilty at a hearing on Friday of the Level 3 charge of 'abusing and pushing' Jadeja. VIDEO Scroll down to watch India Cricket captain MS Dhoni describes Jadeja fine as 'hurtful' Unhappy: India captain MS Dhoni (left) said the decision to fine Ravindra Jadeja was 'very hurtful' Safe hands: Jadeja joined the Indian team for a practice session in Southampton on Saturday . Conference: Captain Dhoni and head coach Duncan Fletcher talk during Indian practice at the Ageas Bowl . India captain Dhoni has raised the stakes with his recollection of events which - as Jadeja's batting partner, when they made their way off for lunch on day two of the drawn match - is sure to be of interest to ICC judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis. Dhoni acknowledged, unlike the Board of Control for Cricket in India in a press release on Friday, that no right of appeal is available for the Level 1 judgment against Jadeja. But he was nonetheless highly critical of the process. 'To me, it is a very hurtful decision,' he said. 'I felt a lot of things were neglected in judging the case.' Dhoni stopped short of naming Anderson, but was otherwise very specific as he put evidence in the public domain at his press conference on the eve of the third Test in Southampton. Clash: Jadeja (left) and England's James Anderson (right) were involved in an incident at Trent Bridge . Incident: Jadeja (right) was found guilty of 'conduct contrary to the spirit of the game' by the ICC at his hearing . Verbals: Anderson and Jadeja have a frank exchange of views out in the middle on day two of the first Test . 'I would not like to take any other individual name in this,' he said. 'But we started walking and there is an individual who used foul language against Jadeja - and I had to step in the middle and by the time we reached the ropes, I thought the thing had defused. 'By the time we were through the members' area, I was ahead of Jadeja. He was a couple of yards behind me and again something happened.' Dhoni insists Jadeja was, throughout, an innocent party. 'Something was said to him, and he just turned to the individual - and after that he was pushed, and he barely gained his balance,' said Dhoni. 'He turned to see what is happening. On the basis of that, he is fined. The thing that was told is that it was against the spirit of the game - but what we have to say is that we can't ignore whatever has happened. Limbering up: India will be looking to build on their Lord's victory when the third Test begins on Sunday . Lining up: India captain Dhoni assesses the pitch at the Ageas Bowl on the eve of the third Test . 'If somebody is saying something to you from behind and you turn and you look, that is not aggressive.' India will resume the series on Sunday, with a 1-0 lead, harbouring evident grievances over the way Jadeja has been treated. Dhoni added: 'The bat was under his armpit throughout, right from lunch (being called on the pitch) until he entered the dressing room and not one word was spoken by him. 'I am not lying when it comes to the factual matter. I don't think there was a bit of aggression (from Jadeja) and that is the reason I am very hurt by the wording that has been given. I think it is very important.' India are frustrated at their inability to appeal against the decision made by match referee David Boon. Threat: Ishant Sharma will hope to continue his Lord's form, where he took seven wickets in second innings . Setting: England trained earlier in the day at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton ahead of the third Test . 'That's the ""beauty"" of it...you can't really appeal against it,' said Dhoni. 'The BCCI and the leaders are working things out, because we are definitely not at all happy with the wording. 'If we are going into the lobby and we are walking - and if I ask you 'excuse me' and you turn around, that can be an act of aggression from your side - especially if you have anything in your hand. If I push you, or you face me square on, that's an even worse act of aggression. 'Definitely to me, if I am here to judge, I don't think Jadeja committed anything. It also becomes slightly difficult - because tomorrow, if I ask any of my players 'don't say a word, we'll report it to the match referee' whatever happens, we will get fined 50 per cent. 'I am better off abusing the guy or whatever, because 50 per cent of my match money has gone on the other guy abusing me.'","Jadeja was involved in an incident with Anderson at Trent Bridge on July 10 .

"By . Guy Aspin And Simon Peach, Press Association . Laura Muir, one of Scotland's leading Hampden hopes, had the national stadium in full voice as she cruised into the final of the 1500 metres at the Commonwealth Games. The 21-year-old, a veterinary student at Glasgow University, came home third in a quick heat won by Kenya's World Championship bronze medallist Hellen Obiri in a Games record of four minutes 04.43 seconds. Muir looked comfortable throughout, biding her time before moving up to second at the bell and, safe in the knowledge she had done enough with the top four going through automatically, easing off in the final 30m. Class: Laura Muir sailed through to the final of the 1500m final on Monday . She came home in 4mins 05.19secs, with Hannah England, England's former World Championship silver medallist, joining her in Tuesday's final, finishing one place further back. Laura Weightman, who is trained by Steve Cram, will also be there after finishing strongly to come home third in the second heat in 4:08.58, while Jemma Simpson made it three Englishwomen in the final, qualifying as a fastest loser. Muir admitted the pace of the race took her by surprise, but was happy with the run. 'That was quick,' she told BBC Sport. 'That was quicker than I thought it was going to be. 'It was just a matter of getting around as comfortable as possible and save as much as I can for tomorrow. 'I think I did that today so I am pretty happy.' In front: Hellen Onsando Obiri (centre) and  Muir compete in the women's 1500m first round . Muir got the biggest roar of the morning from the near full house and, asked about her reception, said: 'It is absolutely amazing. It feels like a Mexican wave of cheers when you go around. 'It is amazing. Usually I can pick out my mum and dad quite easily, but I'm not sure I can with all the flags here.' Kirani James, the Olympic 400m champion from Grenada and one of the biggest names in Glasgow, looked in imperious form in qualifying, less than a month after he became the fifth fastest man in history over the distance. The 21-year-old, who clocked 43.74 in Lausanne at the start of July, was able to ease off the gas with more than a quarter of a lap to go to cross the line in 45.52, with Michael Bingham behind him in second in 45.80. Close: Nigel Levine had to rely on a fastest loser spot to progress to the semi-finals . Martyn Rooney was a comfortable winner of his heat in 45.57, but England's third entrant, Nigel Levine, had to rely on a fastest loser spot to progress to the semi-finals after coming home fourth in 46.35. Rooney said: 'That was my best race of the year. I will treat the semi like a final.' English trio Christopher Baker, Martyn Bernard and Tom Parsons, along with Scotland's Raymond Bobrownicki qualified for the high jump final, while England's John Lane lay second and Ashley Bryant third after three events of the decathlon.

"By . Associated Press . A man who prosecutors say did not commit a 1990 rape for which he served 12 years in prison should be exonerated based on recent DNA testing he did not request, a judge recommended on Friday. The conviction of 57-year-old Michael Phillips should be vacated, Dallas County Criminal District Court Judge Gracie Lewis said. The matter now goes to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals; it was not immediately clear when the court would make a ruling. Dallas County district attorney Craig Watkins sought the exoneration after DNA testing identified another man as the culprit in the rape of a 16-year-old girl at a motel where both men lived. Michael Phillips speaks to reporters after court in Dallas today. A judge has recommended the exoneration of a Phillips who prosecutors said did not commit a 1990 rape based on recent DNA testing . Watkins has an ongoing project of reviewing untested rape kits, even without defendants initiating the request. Should the appeals court decide in Phillips' favor, it would be the 34th exoneration by Watkins' Conviction Integrity Unit. 'This is a great day for Mr. Phillips but a terrible day for our justice system,' Watkins said on Friday. Phillips served 12 years in prison after entering a plea deal that he said his attorney advised him to take, fearing a jury would not side with a black man accused in the rape of a white girl who picked him out of a photo line-up. He was released in 2002 but his failure to register as a sex offender later landed him back in jail for six months. He now lives in a nursing home. Phillips said during the hearing that he was appreciative. 'I never imagined I would live to see my name cleared,' Phillips, who suffers from sickle cell anemia and uses a wheelchair, said in a news release on Thursday. 'I always told everyone I was innocent and now people will finally believe me.' Mr Phillips (pictured in two earlier police mugshots) said this week that he never believed that he would live to see his name cleared . Police and prosecutors have long aided some exonerations without having special conviction-review units, and many still do. But since Watkins started his Conviction Integrity Unit in 2007, several more prosecutors' offices across the country have created such staff teams or expert panels to review wrongful-conviction claims. In the Dallas County unit, DNA preserved by the Southwest Institute of Forensic Sciences in sexual assault kits is tested. There was no DNA from Phillips to compare to the profile from the semen in the rape kit, Watkins said in a news release Thursday. But when the semen was put into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, another person was identified as the perpetrator. A district attorney's office spokeswoman said the statute of limitations has expired on the crime and that the perpetrator who was identified remains free. The district attorney's office said his attorney at the time was Mike Morrow. When reached by The Associated Press on Thursday night, Morrow said he could not immediately recall the case from 24 years ago and had no immediate comment.

"By . Gavin Mccafferty And Simon Peach, Press Association . England's Adam Peaty wants to show the world what he can do by adding the 50 metres breaststroke crown to his gold from the 100m event earlier at Glasgow 2014. The 19-year-old had little time to celebrate his success at the Tollcross Swimming Centre on Saturday, returning to the pool the following morning for the 50m heats. Despite only managing three hours' sleep, Peaty showed no signs of fatigue as he set a new Commonwealth Games record by swimming 27 seconds flat, beating world-record holder Cameron van der Burgh by 0.39secs. Winner: Adam Peaty blows a kiss to the crowd after a brilliant last 25 metres brought him a gold medal . The South African hit back in the evening session by setting a new Games record of 26.80s in his semi-final, although Peaty managed to set a new personal best of 26.99s to win his race shortly after. It sets up a mouthwatering final on Monday evening, when Van der Burgh and Peaty will face tough competition from, among others, home favourite and 200m champion Ross Murdoch. 'Another PB, by 0.01 funnily enough, but it makes all the difference going below 27 for the first time,' Peaty said. 'There's a great crowd at the moment and they pushed me towards that. 'I think my medal chances are quite high if I just keep my composure and just keep calm. 'The main thing now is just having fun and relaxing. My 50 is just add-on event anyway - it is not an Olympic event - so I might as well just go out there and show the world what I can do.' Ambition: Peaty is gunning for another gold in the 50m breaststroke . Asked about wrestling back the Games record he lost to Van der Burgh just hours after setting it, Peaty added: 'He is a world-class swimmer - obviously the Olympic champion as well - so it will be a very close race. 'I had a right ball there - it was really, really fun. Just coming out to the crowd is amazing so I am just taking it all in.' Murdoch is among three Scots in the final with Mark Tully and Joe Welstead. Disbelief: Peaty seems shocked after setting another record during his powerful showing in 50m heat . 'I am so proud to get into another final and represent my country again,' Murdoch said. 'I am also proud of the other two boys who smashed their personal bests to make it. 'Now I am looking for a personal best. I am a lot more relaxed than I was the first couple of nights.' Scotland took their medal tally in the pool to nine on Sunday night thanks to silver in the men's 200m freestyle relay and bronze for Hannah Miley and 13-year-old Erraid Davies. England also won three medals with Fran Halsall and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor taking golds and Liam Tancock adding a bronze.

"By . John Mcgarry . In an age when many have willingly surrendered all pretence of style in favour of substance, Ronny Deila offers a refreshing, intriguing take on what is important in football and what is not. Asked yesterday if a scrappy, unconvincing performance against KR Reykjavik would be deemed irrelevant by progression via any aggregate score, the Norwegian sat up in his seat as if his ears had been assaulted by a volley of personal insults. ‘I will never say that. Never,’ he retorted. ‘If we win, I will say I am very happy with the result but I will also say if I am not happy with the performance. In the game against Krasnodar (a 3-1 win in pre-season), we were lucky. We should have lost that game but we won. Okay, that sometimes happens, but I can’t fool myself or my team. Pushing for style: Ronny Deila wants his team to impress as well as win . Finisher: Callum McGregor (right) celebrates with team-mates after scoring the only goal in the first leg . ‘We could have lost 1-0 in Iceland but that would have been unlucky because we played well and had many more chances than them. We won 1-0 and we should have won more. On Tuesday we have the chance to make that better. ‘I’m after a performance and I think we will get a good one tomorrow.’ Even without Anthony Stokes, Scott Brown and James Forrest, Deila has sound reason to believe he will cut a content figure come the close of play. His charges were measurably superior to the Icelandic champions a week ago. The one-goal margin of victory in no way reflecting the stranglehold they had over the game. Given the uncertainty surrounding their temporary housing at the home of Scottish Rugby, that was no bad thing. An opening night victory was verging on mandatory. For all Deila and his players were suitably impressed with the hybrid surface they trained on last night, this remains a step into the unknown. Yet if anyone believes this rather odd scenario of playing a home game in an alien stadium is some kind of ready-made excuse, they are sorely mistaken. ‘I haven’t been to Celtic Park, so for me this is the first home game,’ Deila added. ‘And when I went out there I wanted to play football. ‘It’s a very good pitch, brand new and a lot of people can be here as well, so I think we’ll have a good support. ‘Of course, Celtic fans are different class. They are the 12th man and I hope they come and support the team because we need it. ‘The players understand how I’m thinking now, how every training session is important, every game is important and this game is unbelievably important to get through. But it’s also important to get a performance, not just to get through and get a result. ‘We want to go out and be better than we were the last time we played because we need progression and we need to use every day to get better. ‘If we go through but have played badly then I get angry because we haven’t used the day in a good way and if you play bad you can lose as well. ‘Then we have big problems. I really want to have a good performance and if we do we will entertain the crowd and the fans and also win the game.’ Missing: Striker Anthony Stokes won't be playing in the game on Tuesday . Leader: Nor will captain Scott Brown, pictured here with assistant manager John Collins . Shorn of a raft of players tonight, Deila finds his squad already stretched but the misfortune of some naturally opens doors for others. The Norwegian appears to be a fair man but an extremely demanding one. In these early days of his regime, he’s prepared to cut his players a degree of slack but his patience isn’t boundless either. Players - such as Temmu Pukki - who haven’t previously impressed in a Celtic shirt, are being widely encouraged to now make their point. You sense they’d be well advised to take it sooner rather than later. ‘Teemu still has a future at this club,’ Deila added. ‘I come in here with an open view. ‘Everyone has the chance to make a career for themselves here. Teemu has worked hard but I want him to develop more. ‘His fitness could be better but I think he is more conscious of what he is doing on the pitch and I’m looking forward to seeing more of him. ‘It’s important for our strikers to score but I think we have been quite effective in our pre-season games. I always like to look behind the results, though, and we have deserved to lose some of those games. ‘However, that was not the case in Iceland, when we should have won by more. I think we have strikers who will score goals. It’s not a problem: we just have to feed them with chances. ‘We had a lot of big chances in Iceland and if we keep on playing like that we will score more goals.’ Tony Watt is another with some making up to do. Unable to match the mammoth expectations that followed his winning goal against Barcelona in 2012, he spent last year farmed out to Belgian side Lierse in the hope he might mature. Chance to shine: Teemu Pukki (left) will be given the opportunity to impress . Prize asset: They will be desperate to hold on to the likes of goalkeeper Fraser Forster . So has Deila already detected that change to the extent that he might involve him tonight? ‘We will see,’ he replied. ‘He has special skills and he has something extra. He can score goals - we have seen that in training. He is training well now and he looks fitter. He has had a little bit of trouble with his thigh. He is not ready for 90 minutes but he might get some minutes.’ Nonetheless, regardless of the impact such fringe players might make in the coming weeks, it seems inconceivable that Celtic would go into the group stages without further strengthening – should they get there. The prospect of a prized asset like Virgil van Dijk or Fraser Forster also departing before August is out cannot be discounted so, provided his side do progress, the manager’s ability to work seamlessly with his club’s signing model is likely to be given a stern early test. ‘The players who are here now are the ones who are going to take us through,’ Deila added. ‘Maybe we can get two or three in, but the main players are here now. Nothing revolutionary is going to happen. ‘Yes, if we sold any of our bigger players, I would expect some of the money to be made available to me. That’s the way the club has been. If players go out, we get money to do something else. ‘It’s hard to do it right away, to go in and get your target in an hour or whatever. You have to take your time and find the right prospect. We are working hard. We have players we have identified and we will see if we can get the ones we want.’","Deila wants his side to impress as well as win games .

"By . Rob Robertson . On a day of drama and ultimate delight for Scotland’s rugby sevens team, they kept their hopes of a Commonwealth Games medal alive after qualifying from their group. A controversial 17-14 opening defeat to New Zealand, who were reduced to five men after two yellow cards, was followed by an easy 56-0 win over Barbados which meant it all came down to their final group match against Canada. Only a win would do to qualify and Scotland, roared on by a crowd of over 50,000 in the evening session, which equalled the morning attendance, didn’t disappoint running out 21-5 winners. Big support: Mark Bennett celebrates a try in the decisive game against Canada as the fans cheer him on . They will return to Ibrox today to play in front of a total audience of around 100,000 for the knock-out stages of the tournament hoping to pick up Scotland’s first ever rugby sevens medal. They started their campaign with a spirited loss to the current Commonwealth Games champions New Zealand who were given a scare in a match that ended in real ill-feeling. The All Blacks started superbly, racing to a 17-0 half-time lead but in the second half Scotland rallied, roared on by the home crowd. Two New Zealanders picked up yellow cards for denying Scotland try-scoring opportunities that had the home fans booing them for their poor sportsmanship. We did it: Bennett celebrates with Colin Gregor as the Scots secure progress to the quarter finals . With a two-man advantage Scotland slowly cut the deficit and two converted tries from Lee Jones set up a thrilling finish. With the Kiwis panicking, there was confusion on their bench which led to Tim Mikkleson, the second New Zealander to be yellow-carded, returning to the field around 10 seconds before his two minutes in the sin-bin was over. That was illegal and, because of that, there were grounds for appeal by Scotland. After thinking about it, Scotland coach Stevie Gemmell saved referee Marius van der Westhuizen’s blushes by refusing to make an issue of his mistake. Backing: Scotland's fans were in great voice at Ibrox and will need to be again for Sunday's knockout stages . ‘An error was made that had no direct impact on the outcome,’ said Gemmell. ‘Just as we look at our errors, all referees analyse their performances.’ Scotland’s try scorer Jones was a bit more forthright, accusing New Zealand of using every trick in the book to stop them winning. ‘After giving them a 17-point halftime lead it was always going to be tough but we came back at them. But they managed to break down a couple of our attacks that could have led to tries,’ said Jones. ‘Playing for Scotland in a stadium like this is phenomenal — our target is to medal and we ran New Zealand, who are the current champions, close so that is a very good sign.’ Not getting us down: Scott Wrigh and co managed to come back with two wins after the opening loss . Scotland’s second match was easier as they strolled to a 56-0 win over whipping boys Barbados. In an eight-try romp in the rain they set up the winners-take-all match in emphatic style with two tries from Jones and others from Mark Bennett, Scott Wight, Sean Lamont, James Johnstone, Stuart Hogg and Colin Shaw. Man of the match Lamont believes their performances at the group stages showed they have the ability to secure a medal. Big win: Lee Jones leaves a Barbados man grounded as Scotland racked up the points against the minnows . Grit: Canada's Michael Phillips is stopped in his tracks by the Scottish defensive line at Ibrox . ‘This squad is showing they can be contenders,’ he said. ‘We are playing good sevens rugby and we can’t wait for the rest of the tournament.’ In the final match of the day, Scotland went in 14-5 ahead at half-time thanks to tries from Jones and Richie Vernon which were converted by Colin Gregor. The only reply from Canada was a try from Michael Fuailefau. In the second half Scotland sealed the match with a try from Bennet converted again by Gregor. Although Scotland were given the biggest cheers, the home crowd embraced the tournament with massive crowds at both sessions.

"By . David Kent . Andy Carroll has taken an understandably glum-looking selfie in hospital. The striker took to Instagram to post a snap of himself just as he prepared to go in for ankle surgery. And you can understand the look on his face, after several injury-ravaged seasons with Liverpool and West Ham, Carroll was finally hoping for a clean bill of health as he finally looked to fulfill the promise he showed following his breakthrough at Newcastle.VIDEO Scroll down to see behind the scenes of West Ham's new kit unveiling . Glum: Andy Carroll's pre-operation selfie from hospital . Blow: Andy Carroll is reportedly out for four months after tearing ligaments in his ankle . SEPTEMBER 2012Misses a month after straining a hamstring against FulhamDECEMBER 2012Twists his knee against Man Utd and is out for two monthsMAY 2013Falls awkwardly and damages his heel against Reading and is out for seven months . But, once again, it wasn't to be, as an ankle injury on a tour of New Zealand ruled him out for up to four months. It is then expected that he will not . return to action until December at the earliest, missing the crucial . start of West Ham's campaign. The . England international was unable to play last season until January after . injuring his left heel and made only 16 appearances. That . injury had completely healed and he was gearing up for the start of the . new campaign by heading out to New Zealand for the club's pre-season . tour when this fresh injury struck in training. It is understood to be . completely unrelated to the one he sustained 14 months ago. In . the last game of the 2012/13 season he ruptured the lateral plantar . fascia – the tendons that run through the arch of the foot, connecting . the heel to the toes – in his right foot leaping for a ball against . Reading. When he was thought to be on the mend, the medial one went and he was out for almost six months of the last campaign. Having . been on loan at the club from Liverpool for one season, West Ham . pressed ahead to make the transfer permanent last summer in what Sam . Allardyce described as a 'calculated risk.' Missing: Carroll had to withdrawn from West Ham's pre-season tour in New Zealand . Out: Carroll was originally expected to recover from the injury before the start of next season . The . West Ham manager was initially told that Carroll, who has won nine caps . for England, would only be out until September but he ended up missing . the entire first half of the season. This . was despite owner David Sullivan seeking out a top specialist, Lieven . Maesschalck, and he spent time with the physiotherapist in Belgium to . help his recovery. It will be hugely frustrating for Allardyce that he will have to start a second successive season without his star striker. Carroll . has scored just two goals since he became their record signing and, on . around £80,000 per week, their highest-paid player. He has so far cost . them £1million per Premier League game.

"Four Sri Lankan athletes were stopped by police after cycling down the M74 motorway on Wednesday.

Harry Aikines-Aryeetey is confident there will be three Englishmen in the 100 metres final at the Commonwealth Games — and all have a medal chance.

"By . Ronnie Esplin, Press Association . Scottish flyweight Reece McFadden claimed he looked into the eyes of Charlie Edwards and knew his confident quest for Commonwealth Games gold would continue following their battle at the SECC. The 19-year-old from Forgewood had beaten the world's top amateur flyweight Andrew Selby on Friday night, saying afterwards: 'This gold is mine. This gold is my medal', before going on to say that he would beat Charlie Edwards next. In a classic Scotland versus England last-16 clash in front of an enthusiastic crowd, Croydon boy Edwards, fighting for the first time after getting a first-round bye, had to fend off the hometown fighter in the first round and did so at times with some assurance as punches were exchanged but after three pulsating rounds, McFadden was given the unanimous decision. Confident: Reece McFadden has the flyweight Commonwealth title in his sights after beating Charlie Edwards . The verdict did not impress the Englishman, who said: 'It is what you expect. Now he is the golden boy. 'I am not one who says I got robbed but I really thought I won it, I thought I did enough but that's the way it goes, we are in Scotland.' However, McFadden claimed his take on a boxer's body language again confirmed the decision. Going all the way: McFadden takes a punch from Edwards but after beating him he wants to win gold . He said: 'I knew I beat those two boys by them looking away. When my eyes were constantly on them they were looking away, looking at the referee, not wanting to know. 'That's when they are beat. I have noticed that with guys who have beat me or given me my toughest fight, they look at me square on, right at me. 'Those two boys didn't do that. But it doesn't matter if you stare at my eyes, I am still going to beat you anyway because I am the fittest I have ever been in my life and I am ready for a gold medal.' Vocal support: Edwards thought McFadden benefitted from the support of the partisan crowd . Expanding on his view of the decision, Edwards said: 'It is what it is, you are in Scotland, you are in his back yard, with all that crowd cheering. 'I thought I won but in front of this Scottish crowd I would have had to done a right number on him. 'I thought I won but that's the way it goes, it is boxing.

The sight of Luis Suarez shimmying off to the promised land of La Liga while Alexis Sanchez shuffled into Arsenal is yet another sign the sun is setting on the heyday of the Premier League. Much like the sun-starved hordes who stream from our shores to the Costa del Sol each summer,  the true greats of football are heading to one destination. And it’s not dreary old Blighty. Sure, the 'greatest league in the world' will still be a draw for some. But it is not too much of a stretch to say England is now merely a home for Spain’s cast-offs. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gareth Bale and Toni Kroos with Real Madrid . New boy: Luis Suarez swapped Merseyside for Barcelona this summer in a £75m move . Signing: The PFA and FWA Player of the Year chose to make his move to Spain after consistent speculation . In the beginning, there was David Beckham. Spain had not even had their hands on a European Championship when the England midfielder packed his bags at Old Trafford in 2003 and accepted the untold riches offered by Real Madrid. He was closely followed by Michael Owen a year later. Both were undoubted stars for the two English clubs with the biggest world-wide appeal, yet both were cashing in on wealth and opportunity abroad. Perhaps, though, it was Cristiano Ronaldo’s switch from Old Trafford to the Bernabeu in 2009 which was the clearest indicator that the Premier League was no longer the go-to place for the game’s greatest talents. Ronaldo had undoubtedly latched on to a football nation on the up when he switched to Spain just a year before their first World Cup triumph. Top Gunner: Barcelona sold Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal to help fund their move for Suarez . Premier League: Diego Costa moved to Chelsea and Ander Herrera to Manchester United . But reasons for his move must go deeper than that. Manchester United were still one of the game’s super-powers under the leadership of Sir Alex Ferguson; there was every reason for one of the world’s greatest players to stay at one of the planet's premier clubs. Real Madrid, despite their standing on the world stage, have a stark record of underachievement in the last five years, with just one league title. Added to that, they have won only three European Cups since the 1960s. Ronaldo is not alone, there is now a talent drain to Spain. Despite Real’s lack of recent achievement, Gareth Bale, one of Britain’s finest players of a generation, still saw fit to move to Madrid from Tottenham last year. Record breakers: Real Madrid broke the world transfer record twice, first with the signing of Ronaldo then Bale . VIDEO All Star XI: Ronaldo highlights . Perfect tenth: Bale celebrates winning the Champions League, Real's 10th European Cup, in his first season . Wanted: Manchester United were interested in Toni Kroos but the World Cup winner chose Real Madrid . The Premier League’s best reply was for Arsenal to gamble Mesut Ozil. This summer, Spain gets Suarez, we get Sanchez; Manchester United wanted Toni Kroos, he went to Madrid; Spain gets Colombia’s World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez, and we can’t top that. The money on offer from Spain’s leading clubs is undoubtedly one of the biggest lures for players on the transfer merry-go-round. But even if the Premier League’s leading clubs stump up sufficient cash to tempt Messi, Ronaldo, Rodriguez et al, there are inescapable realities which will always give Espana the edge. Madridista: Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez is on the verge of a move to Spain . Golden balls: Beckham moved to Madrid after falling out with Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson . Red-letter day: Michael Owen also made the move to Madrid, from Liverpool . The attraction of climate and lifestyle should never be underestimated by British clubs attempting to land the leading players. But there is a harsher, more blunt . reality. The . physicality of the Premier League, one of the reasons it stands proud, . is also one of its biggest drawbacks. Chelsea and . Manchester City may believe they can buck the trend, but money doesn't . buy you everything. When it comes to the true legends of the game, the . pockets of the Premier League’s top clubs will never be deep enough to . overcome the other obstacles. And Spain will continue to reign. Return: Fabregas returns to the premier league after failing to make the cut at Barcelona .","Luis Suarez joins Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in Spain .

"By . Dominic King In Boston . Loic Remy had a medical in Boston on Tuesday as he closed in on a £8.5million move to Liverpool. Liverpool envisage no problems with his medical and expect the deal for the QPR striker to be completed in the next 36 hours having already agreed personal terms. The France international flew out to America - where Brendan Rodgers squad are training at Harvard University - and will become Liverpool's fifth signing of an increasingly busy summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Loic Remy in shooting practice during France training . Liverpool bound: Loic Remy is close to completing a move to the Reds . The Departed: Remy will be hoping to replace Luis Suarez and form a partnership with Daniel Sturridge . Remy will give Liverpool more striking options following the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and there is increasing confidence that he will be joined by Dejan Lovren, who has been Rodgers' top central defensive target all summer. Liverpool had a £20m bid for the Croat rebuffed in early June and though he was furious about that, threatening to stay away from St Mary's, Lovren reported back for pre-season training. But he has had his heart set on move to Merseyside and it appears that Southampton, who had been looking to command a bigger fee, will grant Lovren his wish and, in the process, take the fees they have received from Liverpool during this window to £47.6m. This will be the biggest outlay ever made by a Liverpool manager during one transfer window and Rodgers, after missing out on Swansea pair Ben Davies and Michel Vorm, is still looking for a left-back - a move for Sevilla's Alberto Moreno, who is a target for Napoli and Atletico Madrid, could yet be resurrected - and expects to add the promising young Belgium striker Divock Origi, who will be loaned back to Lille once his transfer is complete. Key target: Liverpool remain interested in Southampton's Dejan Lovren . Assuming all goes to plan with Lovren, he will link up with Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, both of whom are among a squad of more than 30 - as is goalkeeper Pepe Reina - that have arrived in Boston. Lambert is still on a high after making his first Liverpool appearance in the 2-1 win over Preston at Deepdale on Saturday when he played 50 minutes of the friendly and wore the club's famous No 9 shirt. The England striker said: 'I was nervous before kick-off and I probably haven't been that nervous for a while. I've played in a lot of big games in my career and that's the most nervous I've been before a game for a while. 'I was a little bit disappointed not to get a goal but I thoroughly enjoyed it; it was a special moment for me and one I'll remember.' Dream come true: Rickie Lambert is delighted to be playing for his beloved Liverpool .

"By . Andy Sims, Press Association . England shotgun ace Charlotte Kerwood blasted her way to Commonwealth Games glory in the double trap. The 27-year-old from Sussex was in devastating form at the Barry Buddon Centre in Dundee, nailing 94 of her 120 clays to claim her third individual Commonwealth gold medal. Kerwood won her first gold at Manchester 2002 aged just 15, and would probably have more in her collection had the event not been excluded in Delhi last time out. Shooting for gold: Charlotte Kerwood was in brilliant form in the double trap event . Easy peasy: Kerwood won her third Commonwealth Games gold medal in the double trap on Sunday . She finished two shots clear of India's Shreyasi Singh, who claimed silver. Rachel Parish, with whom Kerwood also won pairs gold at Melbourne 2006, made it a medal double for England by taking bronze. The 33-year-old from Nottingham finished level with Canada's Cynthia Meyer on 91 and triumphed in a sudden-death shoot-off. Kerwood led by five shots at the start of the final round and appeared relaxed, smiling and laughing, as the competitors lined up. But with Singh and Meyer closing in, she missed a pair halfway through the round and gave herself a dressing down before holding her nerve over the final few shots. 'It feels pretty good, I can't quite believe it,' Kerwood told Press Association Sport. 'The Commonwealth Games obviously like me, it's a good event to come to. 'I was laughing because I didn't realise I was five targets ahead at the start, so I thought 'no pressure!' Then I felt it was slipping away from me a little bit, which wasn't good. But now it feels amazing.' Congratulations: Kerwood gets a hug after easing to victory in the shooting double trap event . Kerwood will have little opportunity to celebrate, though, as she lines up in her favoured event, the Olympic trap, on Monday morning. 'That will be good experience for tomorrow because now I know what to expect with the crowd and everything. 'There's no time to celebrate yet. Tomorrow is what I have been training for. My coach thinks I was crazy going for this one as well but I'm going to be more confident now.' For Parish, who claimed silver behind Kerwood in the individual event eight years ago, it was also a test of nerve in the shoot-off. 'I've practised doing that before with the other England guys, I knew what was coming and I knew I'd done it before and I could do it again - and I did,' she said. 'I'm disappointed with the way I shot today, I know I can shoot a lot better than that, so I'm really pleased to have come away with a medal. 'I think there will be some champagne now. Possibly a lot!'","The 27-year-old nailed 94 of 120 clays to win third Commonwealth gold .

"By . Declan Taylor . Arsene Wenger will sit down with Jack Wilshere this week to talk about the player’s conduct during his post-World Cup holiday in Las Vegas. Wilshere risked the wrath of Wenger when he was pictured smoking and drinking in a swimming pool in Las Vegas last week as he partied with England goalkeeper Joe Hart.

"By . John Mcgarry . Ronny Deila has warned that his transfer wish-list will become irrelevant if Celtic don't qualify for the Champions League group stages. The Norwegian takes charge of his first game on Scottish soil on Tuesday night when the Parkhead side seek to close out their second qualifying round tie with KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield. Leading 1-0 from the first leg in Iceland, Celtic are fully expected to advance to the next round despite their temporary surroundings and a pitch which is a combination of grass and an artificial surface. Ready: Celtic manager Ronny Deila makes his way onto the Murrayfield pitch . But Deila warned that only by completing the job and negotiating the next two hurdles lying in wait will he retain a prospect of being handed the funds to land the calibre of player he covets. 'Of course, qualifying for the Champions League is very important when it comes to attracting players. That's a huge thing and it is a big target for us,' said the manager who will be without injured Anthony Stokes. 'We work together at Celtic. I talk with Peter (Lawwell) and he has the same task as me - to make Celtic as good as possible without putting the club out of order economically. There's no problem at all. It's very easy. 'But you know what kind of money there is. It doesn't compete with the biggest clubs in Europe. But it is big in Scottish terms. Focused: Celtic prepare for Champions League second qualifying round tie with KR Reykjavik . 'We are looking for quality and that's very hard just now, when a lot of the big clubs in the rest of the world haven't even started pre-season. 'You have to beat clubs like Manchester City who can just buy the ones they want when they want. The biggest get their food first - then the rest of us come after. That's the challenge we have. 'The longer the window goes, the bigger the opportunities get. There is more pressure on every club and they have to take decisions. So, for me, quality is the word - that means someone who can go in and do something at once. But there is also quality in those who can be longer-term prospects.' Stokes has a thigh injury, joining skipper Scott Brown and James Forrest on the sidelines but Kris Commons is expected to be fit despite training on his own yesterday. Close up: KR Reykjavik manager Runar Kristinsson (right) inspects the Murrayfield surface . Deila, also missing the departed Georgios Samaras from last season's squad, believes those players remaining at his disposal have the wherewithal to make the group stages. 'Anthony, of course, is a very good footballer so it is not ideal he is not available - but we have many strikers in the squad so it isn't the worst position for us to lose players from,' he added. 'It is only for this game, though, he will be back for the next one. 'I'm confident the current squad can get us to the group stage. A lot of them have been there and done it before. But it's not exactly the same, because we have lost Samaras, Brown and Forrest for these big games. But other players have to take steps and get us into the Champions League.' Meanwhile, stand-in skipper Charlie Mulgrew declared the squad completely satisfied with Murrayfield's new hybrid surface after training on it. 'It's a class stadium. The pitch is great so we can't complain,' he said.","The Norwegian takes charge of his first game on Scottish soil on Tuesday .

"By . Moira Petty . Kenney Jones has led a gilded life. At 16, he was already performing as a drummer and he went on to play in three of Britain's iconic bands: The Small Faces, The Faces and The Who. The father-of-six lives with his second wife, Jayne, a former model, in a Surrey manor house and presides over his own polo club, where Prince Charles is a visitor. Then, last September, he was dealt two huge blows. As he puts it: 'My lovely mum, who was 89, was dying in hospital, and I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.' Thankfully, his cancer was caught early. 'Even so, it's been a huge shock,' says 65-year-old Kenney, 'and I had some dark moments.' Last September Kenney Jones, pictured with wife Jayne, was diagnosed with prostate cancer . He also had some medical luck. For in his anxiety about his mother, he'd forgotten to renew his private health insurance and ended up being treated at his local NHS hospital, the Royal Surrey in Guildford - which is the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment for prostate cancer. 'Someone was looking after me,' he says, with an upward gaze. As the cancer had not spread beyond the prostate, Kenney was suitable for brachytherapy, a form of internal radiotherapy. Unlike standard radiotherapy, which is fired from outside the body and carries a risk of causing damage to the nerves and/or surrounding tissue - potentially leading to incontinence and impotence - brachytherapy involves implanting tiny radioactive seeds inside the prostate, where they target the rapidly dividing cancer cells close up. But Kenney had a newer form, known as 4D brachytherapy, which has been developed by a team at the Royal Surrey led by Professor Stephen Langley, a consultant urological surgeon. This relies on two types of radioactive seeds, loose and 'stranded', which are like beads on a thread. (Standard brachytherapy uses one or the other type.) Was treated at Royal Surrey - the only centre in the country offering a cutting edge treatment . Ultrasound scans taken beforehand are used to precisely map the size and shape of the prostate, so the surgeon knows how long the strands of seeds should be; these are then pre-loaded on needles. While the loose seeds are precisely placed inside the prostate, the stranded seeds are placed around the inside edge, emitting radiation just outside the gland to tackle any microscopic cancer cells that might have escaped. The idea is to treat the whole prostate, not just the areas of malignancy flagged up by a biopsy. The number of loose seeds is decided during the procedure itself. The 4D element of the treatment is the use of a special computer during surgery. In real time, this adds up the radiotherapy dose as each loose seed is implanted, so each patient gets the precise amount they need. The difference in terms of side-effects is significant, says Professor Langley. He also performs robotic removal of the prostate - said to be a more accurate form of prostate surgery - and says that one in 20 of these patients suffers incontinence afterwards. And more than half have difficulty getting an erection again, because the very small nerves connecting with the penis may be severed during surgery. Standard brachytherapy, available in most UK cancer centres, reduces the chance of incontinence and impotence compared with both prostate removal and traditional radiotherapy. Professor Langley says that with the 4D version, there is 'less than a 1 per cent chance of incontinence, and more than 83 per cent of our brachytherapy patients retain an erection'. 'Also, we . can find no evidence of cancer in more than 90 per cent of the 700 . patients we have treated with 4D brachytherapy over eight years,' says . Professor Langley. 'We are world leaders  in this. 'Dr Peter Grimm, a co-founder of brachytherapy in Seattle in 1985, has been over and wants to take it back to the U.S. 'We are training clinicians, and three UK centres should be offering it over the next three years.'Kenney . Jones thinks that if men knew having their prostate checked needn't be . the end of their sex life, or harm bladder control, more would be . tested. He . says that he'd had annoying bladder problems for more than 15 years. 'I'd get up three or four times in the night. I'd feel an urgency but . then couldn't pass much water. But I was in denial and never saw a . doctor because  I feared it might be cancer.' Professor Langley says the . common perception that urinary symptoms are the key sign is erroneous, . and less than 1 per cent of the prostate cancer patients he sees have . urinary symptoms. In fact, such symptoms are more common in advanced . cases where cancer has spread outside the prostate. The drop in the number of men dying as a result of prostate cancer in the past decade . Instead . of waiting for symptoms, he believes men over 50 should have regular . tests of their levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a protein . produced by the prostate. It was a PSA test that first alerted Kenney's GP to his problems. He was offered the test in a routine check-up last September. 'I was scared and wanted to say no, but I agreed to it. What a fool I was for not being more informed.' A week later, it came back as 6.7 and a second test a week on showed it had risen to 6.8. In a man of Kenney's age, the PSA level is usually no higher than 4. Kenney underwent a biopsy and MRI scan. As he was being tested, he admits he became upset. 'I thought I might never get an erection again,' he says. 'These were worries I couldn't share, not even with my wife. What if sex was never the same again? We love each other, but enjoying a healthy sex life is important.' A couple of weeks after the biopsy, Kenney was told that he had cancer but that it  hadn't spread outside  the prostate. 'Of . course I was still concerned, but it was very different to when I was . told my enlarged thyroid gland might be cancerous 30 years ago. Back . then, I couldn't hear a  word until the  shock subsided. 'It turned out to be benign. Now that I'm older, thoughts like, ""I've had a pretty good life"" went through my head.' Kenney had a newer form of radiotherapy, known as 4D brachytherapy . When . Kenney told his children, aged from 16 to 42, 'they were a bit . shell-shocked. Because I'm dyslexic, I'd had to read the hospital . information pack three or four times so I could explain the treatment to . them.' He underwent the brachytherapy in January under general . anaesthetic, and was discharged the next day with tamsulosin. This drug . relaxes the muscles around the bladder and prostate to assist urination. (Night-time problems with urination can surface four to six weeks after . surgery once the radiation begins working.) During his recovery, Kenney suffered insomnia. 'The nights were long and my bladder was very full. It was uncomfortable - as if I had a cork stuffed up it. It's not very rock 'n' roll, but camomile tea helped. I got about two hours' sleep and people said I looked ill. 'Professor Langley advised avoiding sex until two to four weeks after the surgery as it can be uncomfortable. But then he's probably never treated a rock star before. The minute I got an erection, I was delighted. My wife has no complaints.' In April, he was thrilled when his PSA test came back at 2.5. Professor Langley says that after three months the radiation has all but fizzled out, but the cancerous cells take longer to die off. 'PSA levels fall over two to three years, and by five years our average PSA is 0.1,' he says. He acknowledges this treatment is no better at curing patients than prostate removal, but argues that it leaves patients with a better quality of life. Professor Roger Kirby, a trustee of Prostate Cancer UK, offers a dissenting voice: 'The big advantage of getting rid of the prostate is that the cancer cannot return.' Meanwhile, Kenney has been working to raise funds for Prostate Cancer UK with a benefit night at Hurtwood Park Polo Club, reuniting him with Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend for the first time since he left The Who in 1988. 'I want to increase awareness - a man dies of prostate cancer every hour in the UK,' he says. 'My wife and I have had everything - and we don't need that any more. We're downsizing. Now is the time for me to enjoy my wife and family in a more relaxed way. I intend to live to a ripe old age.' prostatecanceruk.org .","Last September Kenney Jones, 65, was diagnosed with prostate cancer .

Similarly, Adidas’ Fitsmart tracker is unique because it measures heart rate response to physical activity and then guides the user train at the right intensity for the best results, including weight loss. Continuing with barcode scanners, Vryenhoef said Google Glass could prove the perfect dieters tool, to capture codes and track calorie intake. It could even calorie check recipes as wearers read cook books, by recognising the description in the ingredient list using optical character recognition.

With a built-in barcode scanner to capture the barcode of the food item the wearer is purchasing, or about to consume, their calorie intake will be automatically tracked throughout the day . Into the kitchen, Vryenhoef states that all food could soon be fitted with Radio Frequency ID (RFID) tags. Once introduced, a mobile app could scan RFID-tagged meal ingredients in one go, to quickly calculate the total calorie content of a dish. Furthermore, a RFID reader in a fridge and cupboard will be able to automatically display the contents to a smartphone or tablet. Fridge contents will be listed with full nutritional information, and the app could suggest low calorie recipes ideas from the food available.

'Imagine a full length mirror that could show you your current shape and, at the press of a button, what you'll look like at your goal weight', said Vryenhoef. This builds on technology being developed by Oral B (pictured) which shows the weather and traffic details on the mirror . During February’s Mobile World . Congress, the Connected City exhibition featured tags on posters that . could be used to purchase foods on the go. The nutritional information . from these purchases could soon be included at the checkout, for . example, continued Vryenhoef.

They are smaller than a finger nail, . contain a gel made out of a mixture of metals and chemicals, including . microscopic pieces of gold, a silver compound and vitamin C. The gel starts out red but changes colour over time, as its ingredients react with each other. The rate of the colour change corresponds with the speed of growth of the food poisoning bug E coli at different temperatures. When the sensor turns green, this means the bacteria have grown enough for the milk to be off. As the tag sits on the outside of the carton, there is no need to open it. 'Imagine . a full length mirror with a screen behind it that could show you your . current shape and at the press of a button what you'll look like at your . goal weight,’ said Vryenhoef. ‘To . help you achieve your goal, it also provides data and statistics . showing how many calories you would need to stick to attain your desired . weight and body shape over what time period.’ This builds on technology being developed by Oral B which shows the weather and traffic details on screen, and helps people brush their teeth more effectively. Dieting technology could also extend eating out, too. Vryenhoef envisions augmented reality restaurant menus. By holding a phone’s camera over the menu choices, the phone will virtually overlay all the nutrition data for the dishes by referring to a central database of nutrition information. ‘The latest tech developments promise a new wave of tech-enabled dieting,’ continued Vryenhoef. ‘With the growing interesting in self-monitor for activity and vital health indicators, this area promises some exciting new developments which is great news for the many of us struggling to lose or maintain our weight. ‘It is estimated that one in every four adults in the UK is obese and if this trend continues, by 2030 half of the UK could be obese adding an additional £2 billion per year to the national purse in medical costs for obesity related diseases. ‘According to the NHS, the best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced calorie controlled diet and to exercise regularly. So any tech gadget that simplifies the calorie controlling and counting process should help keep the nation’s burgeoning waistline in check.’","Tim Vryenhoef has detailed predictions for the future of dieting .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . When you are driving in bad weather or if there’s a sharp bend ahead, caution is vital. But soon you could be able to see what is up ahead or around the corner with your own spy in the sky. Taking a leaf from the military, Land Rover’s engineers are looking at creating miniature drones that could be launched from their new 4x4. Land Rover engineers are looking to create miniature drones to help drivers see what is coming up on the road ahead . The drones would scan the road up to 20 yards ahead and send back live images to the driver via a mobile phone in-car wi-fi link. The images would be displayed either on a screen in the car or on the windscreen using jet-fighter style technology. The drones have been revealed ahead of the launch of Land Rover’s new seven-seater Discovery Sport off-roader, to be unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in October. It is the first of a new family of Discovery vehicles that will adopt a range of innovations being developed by engineers at parent company Jaguar Land Rover. Another development is the ‘see-through bonnet’, which would allow drivers to spot potholes or rocky terrain that would otherwise be out of sight. Cameras in the grille would project images of the ground below onto the windscreen of the car. A glimpse in to the future? Drones could one day help drivers 'see round corners' Motorists could also soon be able to drive their car remotely at low speed via an iPad tablet or smartphone without being in the vehicle. This would allow them to steer through farm gates or when coupling the vehicle to a trailer. The car’s electrically-powered steering wheel and radar sensors would do the rest. Infra-red lasers in the fog lamps would also scan the ground ahead, produce a relief-like map of problems and engage the traction system automatically to cope with them. Gesture control, using motion sensors, would allow drivers to command the car. With a wave of a hand or flick of a finger they could switch on the headlights, indicate or change radio channel. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Land Rover’s new, driver-assisting technology will enable safer, smarter and more enjoyable driving.’","Drivers may soon be able to see around the corner using a 'spy in the sky'

"By . Mark Prigg . They are the seven dwarf galaxies - and they could shed new light on dark matter. Researchers this week began experimenting with a new type of 'Frankenstein' telescope made by stitching together telephoto lenses. They almost instantly spotted the seven celestial surprises while probing a nearby spiral galaxy. spot the seen dwarves: This image shows the field of view from the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, centered on M101. Inset images highlight the seven newly discovered galaxies. The Dragonfly Telephoto Array uses eight telephoto lenses with special coatings that suppress internally scattered light. This makes the telescope uniquely adept at detecting the very diffuse, low surface brightness of the newly discovered galaxies. It uses the same kind of lenses that are used in sporting events like the World Cup. The compact, oven-sized telescope was built in in 2012 at New Mexico Skies, an observatory in Mayhill, N.M. The previously unseen galaxies may yield important insights into dark matter and galaxy evolution, while possibly signaling the discovery of a new class of objects in space, researchers said. For now, scientists know they have found a septuplet of new galaxies that were previously overlooked because of their diffuse nature: The ghostly galaxies emerged from the night sky as the team obtained the first observations from the 'homemade' telescope. The discovery came quickly, in a relatively small section of sky. 'We got an exciting result in our first images,' said Allison Merritt, a Yale graduate student and lead author of a paper about the discovery in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. 'It was very exciting. It speaks to the quality of the telescope.' Pieter van Dokkum, chair of Yale’s astronomy department, designed the robotic telescope with University of Toronto astronomer Roberto Abraham. Their Dragonfly Telephoto Array uses eight telephoto lenses with special coatings that suppress internally scattered light. This makes the telescope uniquely adept at detecting the very diffuse, low surface brightness of the newly discovered galaxies. 'These are the same kind of lenses that are used in sporting events like the World Cup. 'We decided to point them upward instead,' van Dokkum said. Yale astronomers used a new telescope, the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, to detect the diffuse light of the new galaxies. He and Abraham built the compact, oven-sized telescope in 2012 at New Mexico Skies, an observatory in Mayhill, N.M. The telescope was named Dragonfly because the lenses resemble the compound eye of an insect. 'We knew there was a whole set of science questions that could be answered if we could see diffuse objects in the sky,' van Dokkum said. In addition to discovering new galaxies, the team is looking for debris from long-ago galaxy collisions. 'It’s a new domain. We’re exploring a region of parameter space that had not been explored before,' van Dokkum said. The Yale scientists will tackle a key question next: Are these seven newly found objects dwarf galaxies orbiting around the M101 spiral galaxy, or are they located much closer or farther away, and just by chance are visible in the same direction as M101? If it’s the latter, Merritt said, these objects represent something entirely different. 'There are predictions from galaxy formation theory about the need for a population of very diffuse, isolated galaxies in the universe,' Merritt said. 'It may be that these seven galaxies are the tip of the iceberg, and there are thousands of them in the sky that we haven’t detected yet.' Merritt stressed that until they collect more data and determine the distances to the objects, researchers won’t know their true nature. But the possibilities are intriguing enough that the team has been granted the opportunity to use the Hubble Space Telescope for further study. 'I’m confident that some of them will turn out to be a new class of objects,' van Dokkum said. 'I’d be surprised if all seven of them are satellites of M101.'","Previously unseen galaxies may yield important insights into dark matter and galaxy evolution .

"By . Emma Innes . and Mark Prigg . An asteroid nine times larger than the QE2 has sailed past the Earth - and is so big it even brought along its own moon. The 1.7mile long space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon. Scientists have named the asteroid 1998 QE2 but the name has nothing to do with the transatlantic Cunard liner - it follows a code used for newly-discovered asteroids by the US Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . The asteroid was captured as it sailed past the earth. It is so big it even dragged its own moon along . An artist's impression of the QE2 asteroid that sailed past earth last night . Researchers were stunned to spot the . smaller moon asteroid is circling the larger space rock, an unusual but . not unheard of space phenomenon. The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2. It . was discovered on August 19, 1998, by the Massachusetts Institute of . Technology Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) programme near . Socorro, New Mexico. The object made its closest approach to Earth at 9.59pm last night. The sequence of radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 was obtained on . the evening of May 29, 2013, by NASA scientists using the 230-foot . (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, when the asteroid . was about 3.75 million miles (6 million kilometers) from Earth, which is . 15.6 lunar distances. The first radar images of asteroid 1998 QE2 were obtained when the asteroid was about 3.75 million miles (6 million kilometers) from Earth. The small white dot at lower right is the moon, or satellite, orbiting asteroid 1998 QE2 . The main asteroid is believed to be about 1.7 miles long, or nine times the length of the Queen Elizabeth 2 and has a rotation period of . less than four hours. The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid's satellite, or . moon, is approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) wide. The radar imagery revealed that 1998 QE2 is a binary asteroid. In the near-Earth population, about 16 percent of asteroids that are . about 655 feet (200 meters) or larger are binary or triple systems. Radar images suggest that the main body, or primary, is approximately . 1.7 miles (2.7 kilometers) in diameter and has a rotation period of . less than four hours. Also revealed in the radar imagery of 1998 QE2 are several dark surface features that suggest large concavities. The preliminary estimate for the size of the asteroid's satellite, or . moon, is approximately 2,000 feet (600 meters) wide. The radar collage . covers a little bit more than two hours. As the asteroid moves close, scientists scanned it with radar using a 230ft wide dish telescope at the . Goldstone Observatory in California’s Mojave Desert. The resolution of these initial images of 1998 QE2 is approximately 250 feet (75 meters) per pixel. Resolution is expected to increase in the coming days as more data become available. Between May 30 and June 9, radar astronomers using NASA's 230-foot-wide (70 meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, will perform an extensive campaign of observations on asteroid 1998 QE2. The two telescopes have complementary imaging capabilities that enabled astronomers to learn as much as possible about the asteroid during its brief visit near Earth. Even from a distance of nearly four . million miles, the researchers wanted to study features on the . asteroid as small as 12ft across. Chief . investigator Dr Lance Benner, from the American space agency Nasa’s Jet . Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said: ‘It is . tremendously exciting to see detailed images of this asteroid for the . first time. The giant space rock will get no closer than 3.6 million miles, or 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon . ‘With radar we can transform an object from a point of light into a small world with its own unique set of characteristics.’ White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a press briefing about the asteroid: 'scientists have concluded the asteroid 'poses no threat to planet Earth'. He then laughed and said: 'Never really thought I'd be standing up here saying that, but I guess I am.' The asteroid will not make a return trip to the Earth for at least another two centuries. In 2016 Nasa will launch a robotic sample return mission to one of the most potentially hazardous known near-Earth objects (NEOs), the asteroid (101955) Bennu. The asteroid, which measures a third of a mile across, comes within 500,000 kilometres of the Earth every six years. Scientists have calculated that in 2182 there is a one in 1,800 chance of the object colliding with the Earth.","The asteroid sailed past the Earth at 9.59pm UK time last night .

"By . Julie Cook . Charmaine Kember, 35, experienced painful varicose veins in her legs which then appeared in her vagina . As . a doting mother of four, Charmaine Kember loves being at the centre of . family life. But becoming a mother has cost her health - and . self-confidence - dearly. Charmaine, 35, enjoyed trouble-free . pregnancies with her first two children Sean, now 15, and daughter . Aimee, now 12. 'I loved being pregnant and wanted a big family,' she . recalls. When she and partner Lee, 35, a salesman, found out they were expecting a third child, they were thrilled. 'I . had the usual stretch marks after being pregnant twice before,' recalls . Charmaine, from Gillingham, Kent. 'So when they started popping up . again, I didn't mind.' But when she was around 14 weeks pregnant she . noticed large, blue veins on her legs - they began in clusters around . her ankles then spread further up. 'I'd joke to Lee about adding varicose veins to my pregnancy battle scars,' she remembers.Varicose . veins develop when the veins stretch and the valves inside them, which . prevent blood flowing the wrong way, fail to work. Blood pools in the . veins, causing them to become swollen, enlarged and painful. They are . common in pregnancy as hormones relax the walls of the veins and more . blood is produced to support the growing baby, putting strain on the . veins. As her pregnancy progressed, Charmaine noticed more and more unsightly, dark blue veins on her legs. 'They began to look like road maps,' she says. 'I had to cover up with trousers or maxi skirts. I felt awful.' Then one night when she was 20 weeks pregnant, she felt a hard, lumpy vein in her vaginal area while bathing. 'I . realised in horror what it was,' she says. 'I couldn't see it, but it . was a varicose vein - just like the huge ones on my legs.' The following day, she felt another one, then another, and they started causing great discomfort. 'I . told my midwife about the veins in my legs and she said they were . normal in pregnancy. Then I told her about the ones I'd found down . there.' After an examination the midwife confirmed it was varicose . veins, or vaginal varicosities. Charmaine was referred to a consultant . gynaecologist, who said they'd probably diminish after the birth. Scroll down for video . Charmaine's varicose veins got so bad she had to walk on crutches . The . consultant explained that varicose veins in intimate areas affected . around one in ten pregnant women - they are caused when blood pools . inside the pelvic veins deeper inside the body. 'I was amazed - I'd . never read anything about this, or even heard anyone talk about it . before,' says Charmaine. 'I wondered how many other women were hobbling . around like me, mortified.' In fact, vaginal (or vulval) varicose . veins become more common with each pregnancy a woman has, explains Dr . Katrina Erskine, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Homerton . Hospital, London. 'They occur both in the vagina and in the vulva. They are the same as varicose veins in the leg; they lead to swelling, . and are rather uncomfortable. 'They are caused by the baby sitting . on the large blood vessels that drain blood from your legs, causing back . pressure, and hence the veins widen.' Professor Mark Whiteley, . consultant surgeon and clinical director of The Whiteley Clinic, thinks . the condition could be more common than doctors realise. According to . his research, one in five women who've had a previous vaginal delivery . and suffers with varicose veins of the legs, also has varicose veins in . the pelvis and vaginal area. 'Fortunately, in most patients, the veins are either relatively small or deep, so most ladies are not aware they have them.' He . explains that pregnancy hormones that prepare a woman's body for labour . and an increase in the volume of blood mean these vulval and vaginal . varicose veins can be seen more easily. 'After pregnancy, once the . hormones and blood volume return to normal, the veins shrink and in some . people appear to have completely gone. 'However, with specialised . transvaginal scans we can see if the varicose veins in the pelvis or . vagina are still there. They can contribute to varicose veins in the . legs.' But Professor Whiteley adds that because it is not easy to get . a clear picture of the female pelvis from standard scans, often women . are told they are imagining the problem. Yet these veins can have a depressingly real effect. As . Professor Whiteley explains: 'Women can suffer symptoms such as . dragging pain, discomfort during sexual intercourse, and irritable . bladder. This is due to the weight of the varicose veins in the pelvis . pushing on these organs.' The medical term for this is pelvic congestion syndrome. Charmaine has been told they won't go away and there is nothing more she can do . Charmaine's veins continued growing during her pregnancy - both in size and quantity - along with her discomfort. 'It . began as being uncomfortable, then progressed to severe pain - soon I . could barely walk and needed crutches because the veins made my legs . swell so much it hurt to move. 'I was so embarrassed. I didn't let . Lee anywhere near me and worried how our sex life would be after the . birth. It was bad enough having unsightly veins on my legs, let alone . there. 'I didn't tell my friends. Most pregnant women compare stretch . marks or bumps. How could I discuss what I had going on down below?' Charmaine's daughter, Annabelle, now five, was delivered by emergency . Caesarean, and she was hopeful the veins would soon go. But six . months later, the veins on her legs were as large and blue as before. The vaginal veins diminished a little over time, but remained very . uncomfortable. Her GP said there was nothing anyone could do. Two years later, Charmaine was pregnant again. But her joy was tempered by the fear that the veins would worsen. Sure enough, at ten weeks the hard blue veins started appearing again - new ones as well as the existing veins. 'The . midwife gave me stockings, to support the veins in the legs, but there . was nothing I could do about the others,' she says. 'I was in agony.' Because of her pregnancy, Charmaine couldn't take strong pain relief. 'I just had to put up with it,' she says. As the weeks passed, more and more veins appeared and she again had difficulty walking, ending up on crutches. 'My legs were like something from a horror film,' she says. 'I felt like a freak.' As for a romantic life with Lee, 'it would have been too uncomfortable and embarrassing' . With . the birth of their son Teddy, now 17 months, 'we had our complete . family - two boys, two girls', says Charmaine. 'But it had come at a . cost. My veins didn't go in the weeks after Teddy's birth. I knew they . never would.' Charmaine has been told they won't go away and there is nothing more she can do. But Professor Whiteley says this information is wrong. 'It . is amazing how few gynaecologists, GPs and nurses know there is . treatment available,' he says. The number of adults who are affected by varicose veins . 'What these women need is a specialist . transvaginal duplex scan, which shows exactly which veins in the pelvis . are causing the problem. Once they are known, little metal coils can be . placed inside these veins which then completely shrivel away.' Professor . Whiteley believes treating the veins would help the varicose veins in . the legs. 'Our research, about to be published in the journal of . Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatics, suggests failure to treat these . veins is a major reason why leg varicose veins come back after . treatment in up to a third of women.' Unfortunately, this specialist . treatment is not widely available. Charmaine herself is pragmatic . about her situation. 'It was a nasty thing to go through but is a small . price to pay for our lovely family.'","Charmaine Kember, 35, from Gillingham, suffers from vaginal varicose veins .

"The Icelandic sagas of the Norse people are 1,000-year-old chronicles of brave deeds and timeless romances, but how true to Viking life were they? To find out, physicists Professor Ralph Kenna and student Pádraig Mac Carron created a statistical network of associations between characters in ancient texts including The Tain, Beowulf as well as Homer's Iliad. These were then compared to the characters mentioned in five of the Icelandic sagas, believed to be loosely based on fact. This network combines the character associations between the five major Icelandic sagas, including overlapping characters in Egil (blue), Vatnsdaela (yellow), Laxdæla Saga (green), Gisla (turquoise) and Njáls Saga (red). White nodes represent characters who appear in more than one of these sagas . The Táin is a legendary tale from early Irish literature. It details a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, set in the 1st century AD. Beowulf is an Old English epic poem set in Scandinavia. In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geatish poeple in Scandinavia, helps Hroðgar, the king of the Danes, when he comes under attack by the monster Grendel. Beowulf later becomes King of the Geats in Sweden. He dies after a battle with a dragon fifty years on. The Iliad is an ancient Greek poem set during the Trojan War. It details the the ten-year siege of the city of Troy, as well as the battles between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles. These tales aren't Icelandic, but were studied because the Icelandic sagas are said to have . borrowed from these, and similar, stories. By exploring the number of interactions . between protagonists, the researchers built a network of recurring . characters, which in turn helped to reveal if the stories were pure fiction or if they are based on a historically accurate society. In 2010, Professor Mac Carron and Kenna studied the historical tales in the Táin, Beowulf, and The Iliad. These tales aren't Icelandic - the Tain is Irish, Beowulf is Scandinavian, and The Illiad is an ancient Greek poem - but they were studied because the Icelandic sagas are said to have borrowed from these, and similar, stories. The researchers made a note each time a character appeared, and each time he or she interacted with someone. They then compared these to data from 18 narratives, five of which contain over 100 characters each. These included the Njáls saga, Laxdæla saga, Vatnsdæla saga, Egils saga Skallagrímssonar and Gísla saga Súrssonar. These five tales were examined individually in order to compare different sagas to each other. They also studied the sagas collectively, and from a network of 1549 individual characters, were able to gain insight into the structure of the overall saga society. The network described in The Iliad, for example, was relatively similar to what is known about the ancient Greek society that historically existed. Beowulf also had references to factual networks. Whereas, The Táin's network appeared more artificial. The researchers concluded that while that doesn’t mean the events were based entirely on fact, or were entirely fictional, they resemble how modern-day social networks function and appear as statistical networks. For social networks, nodes represent people or characters in a text and the links denote interactions. Network theory attempts to show how these relationships are distributed. In this simplified version, examples of friendly relations are shown in green, and red connections are hostile . Physicists Ralph Kenna and Pádraig Mac Carron created a statistical network of associations by studying characters mentioned in the Tain, The Illiad (pictured) and Beowulf manuscripts. These were compared to data from 18 narratives, five of which are Icelandic sagas and contain over 100 characters each . They also discovered that many of the secondary characters were better connected than protagonists, suggesting these people were more influential to plots, or in real life, than first thought. ‘We can conclude that whether the sagas are historically accurate or not, the properties of the social worlds they record are similar to those of real social networks,’ said Kenna. ‘Although one cannot conclusively determine whether the saga societies are real, on the basis of network theory we can conclude that they are remarkably realistic.’ In the Njáls saga, warrior Gunnar Hámundarson is exiled from Iceland but refuses to leave and is killed. His friend Njáll Þorgeirsson is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign. The saga dates to the late 13th century, but is set between 960 and 1020. Laxdæla saga was also written in the 13th century and is set in Breiðafjörður, Iceland from the late 9th century to the early 11th century. The saga focuses on a love triangle between Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir, Kjartan Ólafsson and Bolli Þorleiksson, which leads to a feud, and ultimately the death of Ólafsson and Þorleiksson. In Njáls saga, Gunnar Hámundarson is exiled from Iceland but stays, and is killed. His friend Njáll Þorgeirsson is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign. The saga (illustration pictured left) is set between 960 and 1020. Egil's Saga tells the story of Icelandic viking Egil Skallagrimsson (illustration pictured right) In Vatnsdœla saga, written in the 13th century, was set in a valley south of Hunafloi in the north of Iceland in the late 10th century. It follows the story of Ingimundur and his family. Ingimundur was the grandson of chieftain Ketill Raum and fought for King Harald Fairhair of Norway at the battle of Hafrsfjord. Egil's Saga was written in 1240 AD, but the story begins in Norway in 850. It tells the tale of Icelandic farmer and viking Egil Skallagrimsson. Gísla saga Súrssonar tells the story of Gisli between 940 and 984. Gisli is told he must kill one of his brothers-in-law to avenge another. He is outlawed and forced to stay on the run for thirteen years before he is finally hunted down and killed. It was made into a film called Útlaginn, or The Outlaw, in 1981. Other findings, which suggest the stories may have biographical elements include the number of recurring characters. For example, the pair found a large overlap between the Njal's Saga, and the Laxdæla Saga which hasn’t been spotted before. The Laxdæla Saga also featured more interactions with women than had previously been discussed. This means previously unknown patterns had been revealed, and because the sagas are thought to have been written using genealogical reports, they may have been based on factual connections.","Physicists studied the historical texts of the Tain, The Illiad and Beowulf .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It is supposedly the next great technological leap forward that will carry us all into a brighter tomorrow – the ‘wearable computer’ that will revolutionise our daily lives. But will Google Glass be able to tell us if our flight is running late, whether there are traffic delays on the way to the airport, and where our lost bags have ended up? Faces of the future: Staff at Copenhagen Airport try Google Glass devices for size . They may well if the airline industry follows the example set by Copenhagen Airport. The main transport hub in the Danish capital has stepped into the future after becoming the first airport in the world to equip its staff with Google Glass. The experiment was conducted earlier this month, and declared a success by the airport’s operational team, who found that it assisted in the job of looking after the 62,000 passengers who pass through the complex’s four terminals every day. ‘The feedback from our passengers and service team has been overwhelmingly positive,’ says the airport’s Marie-Louise Lotz. ‘We found Google Glass very easy to use, and more user-friendly than other devices such as tablets. ‘We can reduce the amount of paper our managers need to carry, such as duty rosters, desk allocation sheets, peak prognosis, passenger numbers and cruise arrivals. ‘And because the devices are hands-free, our managers are not focusing on a screen and can engage better with our passengers.’ A leap forward, maybe: Reaction to the devices among passengers varied according to age group . The devices are not yet available for passengers to use, but the airport hopes that they will be introduced on a wider basis at some point in the future – although there were also concerns about certain shortcomings in the technology. ‘The devices need improved scanning capability, battery life and reduced heating during operation,’ says Jim Peters of SITA, a technology firm which works with the air industry. ‘But the potential for widespread usage in the air transport industry is great. ‘SITA will continue testing and researching the best ways for this innovative technology to be embraced by airports and airlines.’ Reaction from passengers at Copenhagen Airport was mixed. Younger travellers recognised the Google Glass devices, and were positive about their implications. But older passengers were often unaware of the wearable items until they were pointed out to them – although they liked the concept when they were given details. Changing times: Google Glass has been available to the public since May - but is still expensive . ‘The pilot was very promising,’ says the airport’s Christian Poulsen. ‘We are now investigating how we could efficiently introduce wearable technology to our passenger services team.’ Google Glass has been available to the public since May, although the price – US$1500 (£1100) may still be considered prohibitive to the casual buyer.","Danish air hub achieves world first by trying out the wearable computers .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . There are serious new tensions between Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, the most powerful figures in global football, in the lead-up to Sunday’s World Cup final. UEFA president Platini is said to have had enough of FIFA chief Blatter continuing to snipe at European football with his latest attack a suggestion in the FIFA Weekly publication that Europe should lose two of their World Cup places to Africa and Asia. That is the last straw for Platini, who is said to be surprised and disappointed by Blatter’s comment, which he regards as political posturing to curry favour with other confederations ahead of next year’s FIFA election when he will seek a fifth term. Growing tensions: Michel Platini isn't impressed with Sepp Blatter's suggestion that Europe should lose two World Cup places to Africa and Asia . UEFA, who had only 13 teams in Brazil compared to 15 in France in 1998, have no intention of reducing their representation, and if anything want to add to it, such is the strength of the game across Europe. Blatter wrote: ‘We need a new deal, preferably sooner or later. The Africans are at a severe  disadvantage and the same applies to the AFC. It cannot be that the regions are treated with such disdain.’ Yet Blatter suggested in April that there should be no change to the allocations to  protect the quality of the World Cup. Platini returns to Brazil to watch the second semi-final in Sao Paulo with his relationship with Blatter, following their major differences at the FIFA Congress, at an all-time low. The UEFA overlord will announce whether he intends to stand against Blatter for the FIFA presidency at a press conference in Monaco on August 28, having consulted with his 54 national associations earlier that day. ...........................................................................................................

Papua New Guinea competitor Toua Udia was arrested following a report of an incident at a Tesco supermarket near the Athletes’ Village in Glasgow. Udia, 22, competed at the Clyde Auditorium at the weekend following the alleged assault last Monday. Udia was arrested after the alleged assault at the Tesco supermarket in Rutherglen, Glasgow, pictured . He was charged under the Sexual Offences Act at Glasgow Sheriff Court and is scheduled to go to trial on Friday after pleading not guilty. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: 'At around 5.10pm on Monday July 21 police received a report of an incident at Tesco’s supermarket on Dalmarnock Road, Rutherglen. 'A 22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault.' The Commonwealth Games Federation said it was aware of the allegation. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said a 22-year-old man has been arrested in connection with an alleged assault .

'It certainly didn’t impact on his ability to compete because there was no condition placed upon him.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . We hardly ever think about it, but the Earth we’re standing on rotates at around 1,100 miles per hour (1,670 km/h). But what if that rotation suddenly stopped? That's what Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, set out to answer with his latest video. The London-based scientist has outlined the devastating impact that a sudden halt to the Earth’s rotation would have on life as we know it. Scroll down for video . Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, has described what would happen if Earth stopped turning. The gravity of the still Earth is the strongest at the polar regions (shown in green). It is intermediate in the middle latitudes and weakest at the high altitudes of the Andes, close to the equator . Everything would be launched in a ballistic trajectory - around 1,100 mph (1,670 km/h). Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to content with, which could destroy everything in their path. Meanwhile, Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. On perfect sphere Earth, the world’s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. If the Earth stopped spinning, it would take 365 days for the Sun to move through the sky and return to the same position. If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1,100 mile per hour (1,670 km/h) rotation speed at the equator. Stevens describes how most people would die a horrific death. ‘Immediately everything that wasn’t on Earth and wasn’t safely at the poles would continue to moving as it had,’ he explains. ‘It would be flung due east at 1000mph…Your body would immediately become a 9inch calibre bullet.’ Those who were somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. ‘Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude,’ continued Mr Stevens. ‘The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding with these winds would be enough to cause massive fires and unparalleled erosion’. Meanwhile, Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. Because of the Earth’s bulge in the middle, the oceans are held out at the equator by 5 miles (8 km). On a perfect sphere Earth, the world’s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. ‘Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface,’ explained Stevens . If the Earth’s rotation slowed to one every 365 days, a condition called 'sun synchronous', every spot in the Earth would have permanent daytime or night-time all year long. This is similar to the situation on the moon where for two weeks the front-side is illuminated by the sun, and for two weeks the back side is illuminated. If it stopped spinning completely, the world would have half a year daylight, and half a year night time. ‘The yearly change in the sun's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt,’ Nasa said. ‘As you moved along constant lines of Earth latitude, you would see the elevation of the sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the sun change from a single point on the Earth due to the Earth's daily rotation.’ But while this may sound horrific, according to Nasa, the probability for such an event is ‘practically zero’ in the next few billion years. Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation .","Michael Stevens outlines the devastating scenarios in his latest video .

He added that he had no comment about the workers' strike, and reaction from customers who have come out in support of his ousted cousin. Arthur T, who staff have always liked, and who is described as being like George Bailey from the classic film It's a Wonderful Life, has said that his offer more than meets the value of Market Basket. He also called on the company to reinstate the staff who had been fired after protesting in favor of him. 'Their fierce loyalty to the company and its customers has always been deeply valued,' he told the Boston Herald. 'It is about the people who have proven their dedication over many years and should not have lost their jobs because of it. I urge that they be reinstated.'

The board also decried what it called the 'negative behavior' of some current and former employees. 'It . is now clear that it is in the interests of all members of the Market .

Many . employees are distrustful of Arthur S and two co-chief executives who . were brought in from outside the company: Felicia Thornton, a former . executive of the grocery chain Albertsons, and Jim Gooch, former . president and chief executive at RadioShack Corp. Arthur S. has not spoken publicly about his ouster or the striking workers supporting him .

Power couple: Weekly Standard editor Daniel Halper has authored an explosive book about Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The Clintons are pictured at the New Hampshire Democratic Party 100 Club Dinner in Milford, New Hampshire on January 4, 2008 . In his book, Halper quotes Hillary Clinton's former law classmate who claims his friend was a keen marijuana smoker. 'I think she’s acknowledged it, and . if she hasn’t acknowledged it everybody else will tell you: She was an . enthusiastic pot user,' the friend told Halper. The Weekly Standard online editor also claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blackmailed Bill Clinton with tapes of the then-president's steamy phone sex with Monica Lewinsky. The conservative writer claimed that the British and Russians also ‘scooped up’ the microwaves off the top of the White House and taped Clinton's phone sex conversations with Monica – and perhaps other women. MailOnline has reached out to the Clintons for comment. Explosive: Weekly Standard editor Daniel Halper has authored this book on the lives and careers of Bill and Hillary Clinton . Halper has told Radar that while some of these allegations were open secrets in Washington D.C., reporters 'go easy' on the Clintons in order to advance their careers.

'They’re worried . they’ll get shunned. Especially in considering she might be the next . President, why would you pick her off, and her people off right now? It . wouldn’t be good.' While Hillary Clinton remains coy on her presidential ambitions, speculation is rife that she is likely to throw her hat in the ring. However Halper claims in his book that the public have the wrong idea about the Clintons, which may hurt the former secretary of state's presidential chances. 'I think on the one hand Hillary's often portrayed as cold and calculating while Bill was sort of a motive and this bubba-like figure. I found that the opposite is closer to being the case,' Halper told Fox's Megyn Kelly. 'So, Bill tends to be more cold and more calculating while Hillary tends to have long-time friends and have actual relationships and is sort of a more complicated figure.' Halper told Radar that he still has more Clinton secrets to spill which could derail Hillary's 2016 presidential run: I’m just gonna leave it at that.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . A wave of weddings among pensioners is driving a rise in the popularity of marriage, according to the latest official figures yesterday. The number of those aged between 65 and 70 who were married in 2012 went up by a quarter among men and more than a fifth among women. The growing trend to marriage in retirement points to a generation of pensioners who no longer believe their lives are settled when they collect their bus pass. It follows evidence of increasing levels of marriage breakdown among the newly-retired. There was an annual rise of five per . cent in the overall number of weddings in England and Wales to 262,240 – . the highest total in any year since 2004. Although the fast-rising population is partly the cause, marriage rates are also at their highest since the mid-2000s. There . were more brides and grooms in every age group, but the figures from . the Office for National Statistics show that people are choosing to . marry later in life. The average age of a bride is now 34, compared to . under 29 in the 1970s. The . biggest leap in marriages was among those aged between 65 and 70. Grooms in their late 60s increased by 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, . to 3,520, and brides of the same age went up by 21 per cent, to 1,990. Around one in 10 were single before tying the knot, two thirds were divorced and the rest widowed. The overall rise in marriages was accompanied by an increase in couples choosing church weddings – . up by 4.6 per cent in a year to 77,910 after years of decline. However . seven out of 10 weddings are now civil ceremonies, most of them . conducted in ‘approved premises’. Harry . Benson, of the Marriage Foundation think-tank, said the figures were . ‘excellent’ news but added: ‘Many more years of similar rises are needed . to reverse the catastrophic long-term trend away from marriage. ‘The . awful reality is that only one in six parents who don’t get married . stay together compared to four in six parents who do get married. Less . marriage means more family breakdown.’ The trend . means the average age of marriage for men and women was 36 and 34 . respectively, a figure which has been rising steadily after a slight . fall in 2007 and 2008. Andrew . Newbury, head of family law at Slater & Gordon solicitors, said: . 'In the past, people might have considered that they might be too old to . remarry once they'd reached pension age.' 'However, . that baby boomer generation with longer life expectancy, improved . health and financial security can see that it's not necessarily too late . to start a new life. 'Going by current examples, it's still possible to have a long and happy marriage after the age of 65.' However, the ONS also found that a third of marriages will end in divorce by the 20th wedding anniversary.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Lower Manhattan looks set to be extended into the East River after the scheme to expand a 1.3 mile stretch of land was ruled financially feasible. The proposal, released last month, was dubbed Seaport City and could be built alongside a levee scheme aimed at offering protection from storm surges such as the one caused by Hurricane Sandy. The expansion could provide two new city blocks as well as open space and according to documents is 'technically, legally and financially feasible.' An artist's impression of Seaport City, which could be built on a multi-purpose levee to protect Lower Manhattan from storm surges . An artist's impression of how the Bridging Berm which will protect the lower east side of Manhattan from storm surges could look . It is hoped that one of the benefits of creating both residential and commercial developments would help offset the construction costs that would run into billions of dollars and even fund additional resiliency programmes. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the shoreline of the East River rose to 19 feet above sea level highlighting the city's vulnerability to coastal flooding and storm surges. Last year, another report first floated the idea of a 'multi-purpose levee' to protect the city from extreme weather. Dan Zarilli, director of New York City's Office of Recovery and Resiliency said: 'If we don't make something like this happen, we are totally exposed to the risk of climate change. The area near to the Williamsburg Bridge, which could be reclaimed and transformed into what has been dubbed 'Seaport City' 'We’re . putting big, bold ideas out there because traditional solutions are . going to prove ineffective. This is a feasible way to protect the city.' Multi-purpose levees have been successfully implemented in flood-prone areas in the Netherlands, Japan and Singapore. They are usually built in areas of particularly high vulnerabilities due to high population densities, concentration of economic activity, and the location of critical infrastructure systems. It appears that the levee will run along the East River from East 13th Street to Corlears Hook Park, just south of the Williamsburg Bridge. A map showing how the island of Manhattan has expanded outwards from 1650 to 1980 . Building on reclaimed land in Manhattan has been taking place since the 17th century when it was still known as New Amsterdam. The first expansion took place in 1646 under Peter Stuyvesant, who took over as the governor of New Amsterdam colony when the island of Manhattan was expanded between one and four blocks on each side. But it was not until the 20th century that Lower Manhattan's geography underwent a dramatic transformation. In 1934, construction began on the East River Drive (known now as the FDR Drive), expanding Manhattan to the east. Running 9.5 miles from Lower Manhattan's Battery to the Triborough Bridge, the highway is built on a combination of landfill and pile-supported relieving platforms. Lower Manhattan pictured in 1934, while construction began on the East River Drive, now known as FDR Drive, which expanded Manhattan to the east . By 1976, Lower Manhattan had expanded an additional 23.5 acres with the creation of Battery Park City along the Hudson River, with 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the World Trade Center as its foundation. The area became home to an upscale residential neighborhood with great schools and parks not far from New York's City bustling financial district, but the close proximity to the water has left that part of Manhattan prone to flooding. Now, New York City has 400,000 people and 68,000 buildings inside the flood plain. The bridging berm will effectively raise the riverbank to nine feet above current level, which is more than four feet above Hurricane Sandy’s high-water mark. Predicted timelines on how long the project will take to complete range from five to 35 years but the city has already started to consult with the local community on plans. Manhattan has been subject to a series of land reclamations, the first of which took place in 1646 when the island expanded between one and four blocks on each side. The berm will also provide better access to the park, left, which is largely cut off from the neighbourhood by the highway . However, it was Lower Manhattan's violent encounter with Sandy, which overwhelmed the streets with water and plunged most of the area into darkness, that made local residents, business owners and city officials realise how truly vulnerable that reclaimed land was. In 2000, the Guggenheim Foundation announced plans to build a 400 foot tall building south of the Brooklyn Bridge near to Battery Park on the East River waterfront. However, two years later it was revealed the project had been cancelled as foundation director Frank Gehry acknowledged the prospect of finding the $950million funding was unrealistic. A model of the Guggenheim Museum, which was planned for the East River but was dropped as the Guggenheim Foundation said it was unrealistic to find the $950million needed to finance the project . In November 2000, the Guggenheim Foundation announced plans to develop piers and build a 400-foot tall building south of the Brooklyn Bridge on reclaimed land in Lower Manhattan. The foundation were said to have pledged $67.8 million towards the project, which was to include a new Guggenheim museum designed by Frank Gehry. Mr Gehry designed Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao and crowds were drawn to view the plans at the New York museum on Fifth Avenue. The plans showed it would have had 200,000 square feet of exhibition space, a theatre and a centre for arts education as well as six acres of open space. It would have been built on connecting platforms extending from Old Slip to Maiden Lane. However, just two years later the plans were dropped from a report released by city mayor Michael Bloomberg called 'New York City's Vision for Lower Manhattan'. Guggenheim Foundation director Thomas Krens acknowledged that the $950million needed to finance the project would be unrealistic to find. In a statement at the time he said: 'The Guggenheim project has to be rethought, perhaps on a more modest level, and certainly in the context of the city's master plan for the development of Lower Manhattan.'","Plan to expand Manhattan by 500 feet deemed 'financially feasible'

"By . Katy Winter . A couple are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10 month old son after he and his twin brother were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks. Deborah Jackson, 32 and partner Nick Filby, 28, from Harlow, Essex, find their happiness is tainted by heartache as they grieve the tragic death of their second son. Despite the best efforts of medical teams, baby Owen only survived an hour after his delivery, while his brother Ollie fought for his life in hospital for six months. Alongside Deborah and Nick's joy at Ollie's recovery and homecoming, they are still grieving the tragic lost of his twin brother Owen . When Deborah, a trained nanny and Nick, a plumber, were told that she was expecting twins eight weeks into her pregnancy they were thrilled. But at 23 weeks Deborah suffered a heavy bleed with stomach pains and a worried Nick rushed her to hospital where she was told she was in labour. She says: ‘I knew already it was one week before the abortion limit. Ollie (right) and Owen (left) were born at just 23 weeks weighing 1lb 10grams and 1lb respectively . ‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I pleaded with doctors to do everything they could for the twins as long as it wouldn’t be cruel.’ Their local hospital wasn’t specialist enough, and Deborah was transferred to a specialist premature baby unit at another hospital, an hour away. There, they told her that her twin boys had little chance of survival and that even if they did survive they’d be severally mentally and physically handicapped. She says: ‘They told us to prepare for the worst, it was the most terrifying moment of our lives.’ Deborah’s labour lasted four agonising hours. Little Owen arrived first, weighing 1lb but he was breach and badly damaged. His shoulders and back had been broken during his birth and his skin was bruised. Deborah with Ollie, who was critically ill at birth, requiring a total of 19 blood transfusions to keep him alive . The second twin Ollie was born a few minutes later, just 10g bigger. He cried, and was taken straight off to an incubator. Deborah says: ‘This should have been the happiest time of our lives - instead me and Nick never felt so afraid. ‘I sat up in bed holding little Owen. We sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him and I held him close so he’d feel the warmth of my skin. The family held a small service for baby Owen . ‘When his body went cold after an hour and a half we knew he’d gone. ‘Afterwards I didn’t know how I could carry on.  But like Nick I knew we needed to stay strong for Ollie.’ Ollie was critically ill, suffering a brain bleed hours after birth and doctors told the couple to prepare to say goodbye. However miraculously Ollie survived his first few days. Then the medical team discovered a hole in his heart and although the doctors managed to close it with medication, Ollie suffered a massive bleed on his lungs - nearly drowning him in his own blood. Again Deborah and Nick prepared to say goodbye but Ollie fought back, again and again as he suffered a further two major bleeds. Things looked their bleakest when he caught pneumonia and his lungs collapsed. Then he caught a stomach infection, which causes the intestines to die. Doctors pumped his tiny body with steroids and antibiotics. Then when his retinas started to detach he needed injections in his eyes to save his sight. Deborah says: ‘Doctors said they were running out of options. But we’d already lost one baby, we couldn’t bare the thought of losing Ollie too.  We were living on a knife edge. ‘But despite needing 19 blood transfusions Ollie kept going. We spent every second we could by his incubator praying he’d pull through.’ In the meantime the couple had to bury their other son Owen. Ollie was in hospital for over 6 months, recovering from several potentially fatal conditions . Deborah says: ‘We held a small service with close family. It felt like my heart was breaking as they took his tiny coffin away to be buried. ‘ . After the funeral the couple were back at the hospital by Ollie’s side. ‘He’d cheated death so many times it was as though he had a guardian angel. ‘Maybe it was his brother, there was no other explanation. ‘And the doctors couldn’t explain it.  They told us that they’d never seen anything like it.’ Although Ollie, now 10 months, still requires oxygen to assist with his breathing, his brain functions are normal and he constantly improving . For weeks Ollie battled for his life, surprising them each time they thought he couldn’t take anymore, and slowly he began to put on weight and stabilise. Finally after six months he was allowed home, and since, he’s been going from strength to strength. ‘Deborah says: ‘He’s doing so well, he’s turned into a right little tinker and now weighs nearly a stone! ‘All his brain functions are fine now and although he still needs help with his breathing and has an oxygen canister at home, it’s constantly improving each time he goes for his check ups. ‘One day we’ll sit him down and tell him about his big brother Owen. ‘We’re proud of him too and grateful for the brief moment we had him in our lives.’","Couple horrified Deborah, 32, went into labour 18 weeks early .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Ministers should spend up to £1billion of taxpayers’ money to persuade lonely older people to use the internet, an influential think-tank said yesterday. Encouraging the elderly to log on would ease the isolation of those who live alone while saving many millions for the NHS and in state-subsidised care home places, according to the Policy Exchange. The cost of internet education for the more than six million people who do not know how to use it would amount to £875million – or £141 each – said the think-tank, which has close links to David Cameron. But the savings would be almost double that. Going online: More than six million people still do not know how to use the internet (posed by models) At present, four in ten over-65s do not have access to the internet. The report said everyone in Britain should have the skills and confidence to go online by 2020. It added that one in ten patients who visit their GP do so because they are lonely rather than due to illness. Isolated people are more likely to need emergency hospital beds or admission to care homes. The number of people aged 85 or over is set to double in the next 20 years, with many living hundreds of miles from family members. Report author Eddie Copeland said: ‘In an increasingly isolated and fast moving world it is vital that everyone in society is able to use the internet and understand its benefits. ‘From alleviating social isolation, bringing together communities, paying bills and now accessing public services, online can improve lives.’ Many pensioners visit GPs or hospitals partly out of loneliness, said the think tank (picture posed by models) He added: ‘Being able to simply write an email or access a social networking site could provide older people with a way to stay connected to their friends and families, who may live hundreds of miles away. ‘Maintaining these important relationships will help an ageing society vulnerable to loneliness.' Some 29 per cent of people over 65 have still never used the internet, according to figures by the Office for National Statistics issued in the first quarter of this year. Among over-75s nearly two in three, three million people, have never used the internet.","Report was by the Policy Exchange, which has links to David Cameron .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Scotland would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the UK, a study found yesterday. An international dividing line between Scotland and England would discourage cross-border trade and cut 5.5 per cent from Scottish gross domestic product, it said. The calculations - made by two of Scotland’s leading economists - suggest that independence would have cost the country almost £8 billion in 2012. The huge fall in wealth creation would occur as an automatic result of setting up a border, the study claimed. Scotland would lose more than five per cent of its economic output if it broke away from the UK, experts have claimed. Scots will vote in the referendum over whether they stay as part of Britain in September . Further losses caused by independence could then include major companies fleeing an independent Scotland, or higher interest rates as a result of the potential loss of the pound. The projections will further inflame the fierce debate over economic impact of independence that has become the central argument in advance of the September independence referendum. The new assessment is based on an analysis of the way international borders suppress trade to a greater extent than regional boundaries which run inside countries. Dr David Comerford of Stirling University - who is currently working for the Scottish Government on improving economic forecasting - and Professor Jose V. Rodriguez Mora of Edinburgh University looked at the effect on trade of the border between the UK and Ireland. Ireland, they said was ‘the country with which the UK has the lowest measured trade frictions.’ They also examined the borders between Spain and Portugal; the US, Canada, and Mexico; and inside the EU. Their report, presented to the Royal Economic Society conference in Manchester, said that international borders ‘impede trade flows’. The study, by Scotland's two leading economists, backs the case for Scotland staying part of the UK, as advocated by Alistair Darling MP (second left). An international border between Scotland and England would discourage trade and cut 5.5 per cent from Scottish GDP . Reasons why include the way service industries tend to operate mainly inside their own countries, and people’s preference for buying from their own national companies rather than foreign competitors, the study said. ‘National borders impede trade flows much more strongly than do the borders between regions within a country,’ the report said. ‘The scale of the difference between national and regional borders is such that there may be significant welfare or productivity effects from removing borders between countries, or conversely from creating borders within existing nation states.’ It added: ‘Sharing a nation state produces a substantially higher degree of economic integration than even a very close trading relationship between independent countries.’ Scottish nationalists have denounced Chancellor George Osborne's threat to without the pound as bullying . The ‘friction’ in trade between economically developed countries and EU member countries is ‘significantly higher’ than the drag on trade by borders between US states, Canadian provinces or Spanish regions, the report said. If Scotland were to trade only internally - so that Scottish companies did business only with other Scottish firms - that would cost Scotland 16.3 per cent of its economic output, the economists calculated. Setting up an international border with the UK would cost Scotland more than a quarter of what it would lose by abolishing foreign trade entirely, they said. The two economists said their estimates were ‘on the conservative side’ and that losses could be greater because ‘part of the border effect is due to a large degree of home bias in services trade.’ They added that part of the reason for losses if a border is created is that inefficient and mediocre companies would find it easier in Scotland. ‘Mediocre firms that would find it impossible to survive when facing direct competition from the rest of a larger country, would find it profitable to survive in the independence scenario. This is because they are sheltered from more intense competition. ‘Unproductive but local firms find themselves in a better competitive position, and the access more of what is now a captive market.’ Rows over the future of Scotland’s economy have come to dominate the arguments between yes and no camps in the run-up to the 18 September referendum. Nationalists have denounced as bullying the warning by Chancellor George Osborne, backed by Labour and LibDem leaders, that the pound will not be shared with an independent Scotland. While the yes camp says a UK government would inevitably do a deal on the pound, and an anonymous leak suggests one London minister agrees, losing the pound threatens Scotland with high interest rates or loss of control of its own currency. There have also been a series of warnings from major companies that they would shift headquarters out of Scotland if independence came.","Two of Scotland's leading economists calculated the cost of independence .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Mothers who fail to obey court rulings will in future be 'brought up short, according to Appeal Court judge Lord Justice McFarlane, pictured . Separated mothers must no longer get away with ‘Catherine Tate justice’  that prevents fathers from seeing their children, a senior judge said. No mother should be able to ignore court orders, stop a father ever meeting his children, and then tell him ‘Am I bothered?’, Appeal Court judge Lord Justice McFarlane said. He said that radical fathers’ groups were right to complain that men were often wrongly shut out of their children’s lives. Mothers who fail to obey court rulings will in future be ‘brought up short’, the judge said. The warning from Sir Andrew McFarlane, one of the country’s most experienced family judges, follows a series of reforms earlier this year designed to speed up cases which decide on how separated parents will share the care of their children. It follows years of failure to enforce orders giving fathers contact with their children. In around 4,000 cases a year fathers go back to court repeatedly to try to get access to their children because mothers defy the courts. Judges have rarely fined or imprisoned intransigent mothers because most believe that to punish the mother would harm the children. At one point the last Labour government considered, and then dropped, the idea of making disobedient mothers wear electronic tags. Sir Andrew said in a speech that he hoped the reforms introduced this spring will compel more mothers to stick to the rules. ‘Where, post separation, a child lives with one parent, it is hard to underestimate the expectation that the system will now place upon that parent to respect and to meet the need for the child to have a good, sound, ordinary relationship with the other parent,’ he said. ‘These changes should, and in my view must, mark the end to what I might call the Catherine Tate approach to post-separation parenting, where the parent who holds all the trump cards, because the child is currently living with them, simply shrugs her shoulders and says to the other parent, who merely wants to see his child, “Am I bothered?”’ Sir Andrew said that groups like the radical Fathers 4 Justice ¿ which organised disruptive demonstrations at landmarks and in parliament in the 2000s ¿ had a case. A campaigner is pictured dressed as Batman on a balcony at Buckingham Palace in 2004 . ‘The system, the law, now requires them to be bothered. They have a responsibility to be bothered and if they persist in abdicating from that responsibility they can expect all those they encounter in and around the court system to bring them up short.’ Sir Andrew said that groups like the radical Fathers 4 Justice – which organised disruptive demonstrations at landmarks and in parliament in the 2000s – had a case. ‘Whilst deprecating some of their tactics, I had, in the course of a number of meetings, sat down in calm circumstances and listened to the stories of a number of fathers who considered that they had been profoundly let down by the system. ‘Whilst it might be that there are genuine, child focused, reasons why individual members of the various fathers’ groups have been denied contact, that could not be said of most of the individuals I have met in that context over the years. There is, in my view, a core validity to the essential complaints that these fathers make.’","Mothers who fail to obey rulings will be 'brought up short', judge says .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Christopher Stott is completely dependent on his wife Nicola, but was treated 'disgracefully' by Thomas Cook when staff refused to let the couple sit together . A severely disabled passenger treated ‘disgracefully’ by an airline cannot sue for compensation because of a shocking legal loophole, senior judges said yesterday. Thomas Cook staff left Christopher Stott ‘humiliated’ by refusing to let him sit with his wife Nicola on a plane, even though he needs constant attention and the couple had paid extra to do so. But Supreme Court judges said the holiday firm had done nothing wrong in law, because airlines are governed by an international convention which says nothing about mistreatment of the disabled. Cabin crew left Mrs Stott kneeling in the aircraft aisle trying to look after her husband throughout a flight that lasted more than three hours. The airline failed to find a way for the couple to sit together even though they had paid a fee to do so, and despite assuring them twice that they would get the seats they needed. Staff failed to ask other passengers if they would agree to move to accommodate Mr and Mrs Stott.Cabin crew did not help even when Mr Stott’s wheelchair overturned and he fell to the floor of the aircraft. If the couple had been treated the same way on the ground, the firm concerned would have faced criminal prosecution under disability discrimination laws as well as the prospect of a compensation bill. But Thomas Cook will face no sanctions and does not need to pay even token compensation, the judges said, because airline flights and the embarkation of passengers are governed by the Montreal Convention. Mr Stott, 58, a former pensions administrator, said: ‘The convention that covers airlines was last rewritten in the 1990s and it didn’t make any allowance for disability.’  The judges called for the agreement to be revised urgently to plug the loophole. The couple, from Tarporley in Cheshire, went on holiday to the island of Zante in Greece in 2008 and paid a £30 premium to sit together . Mr Stott, who has been paralysed from the shoulders down since a cycling accident at the age of 21, relies entirely on his wife for such basics as movement and feeding, the court heard. The couple, from Tarporley in Cheshire, went on holiday to the island of Zante in Greece in 2008. They paid a £30 premium to sit together and were told they would be allocated the proper seats. However, when they checked in for the return flight they were told they could not sit together, and seat allocations could not be changed. Their case was brought to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Lord Toulson, who was sitting with four other Supreme Court judges, said: ‘When boarding the aircraft from an ambulift, matters got much worse. Mr Stott, who has been paralysed from the shoulders down since a cycling accident at the age of 21, relies entirely on his wife for such basics as movement and feeding, the court heard . Thomas Cook will face no sanctions and does not need to pay even token compensation, the Supreme Court judges said, because airline flights and the embarkation of passengers are governed by the Montreal Convention . ‘As he entered the aircraft, Mr Stott’s wheelchair overturned and he fell to the cabin floor. ‘Those present appeared not to know how to deal with the situation. Mr Stott felt extremely embarrassed, humiliated and angry.’ Lord Toulson said ‘cabin crew apparently made no attempt to ease their difficulties’, adding ‘it was a very unhappy experience’. The airline’s behaviour would break British and European discrimination law, the judges said.Lord Toulson said: ‘There is much to be said for the argument that it is time for the Montreal Convention to be amended.’ Supreme Court deputy president Lady Hale said the couple had been treated ‘disgracefully’ by Thomas Cook, and it was equally disgraceful that the law gave them no redress. A spokesman for Thomas Cook Airlines said, “We make every effort to ensure that any customer requesting assistance receives the help they need. Whilst we welcome the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court today, we’d like to reiterate our apology to Mr and Mrs Stott following their requests not being met when they travelled with us in 2008.”","Staff refused to let Christopher Stott sit with his wife Nicola on plane .

A judge who wants to ‘let the light in’ was put in charge of Britain’s most secret court yesterday. Mr Justice Charles was made Vice-President of the Court of Protection, the tribunal that has been heavily criticised for making life-changing decisions out of sight of the public. The reshuffle means the Court of Protection will from next month come under the full control of Mr Justice Charles, a family judge who has backed the drive for more openness in the courts. The appointment, made by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, follows a series of scandals involving the court, which decides on the affairs of people too ill to decide for themselves. In April it was caught in controversy after the Daily Mail revealed that a Court of Protection judge had secretly jailed a woman over her attempts to get her father out of a care home where she thought his life was in danger. It was criticised again earlier this month after ordering that a woman who had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act undergo an involuntary caesarean. Mr Justice Charles has been Judge-in-Charge of the Court of Protection – a non-statutory role – since 2011. The Judicial Office said in an announcement yesterday that the new appointment ‘will allow him to continue with the work he has begun as Judge-in-Charge’. The switch also involves the court linking with the Family Division, whose president, Sir James Munby, has been pressing for greater openness in courts. The Judicial Office said Mr Justice Charles, 65, will use ‘his family background and his extensive experience to support the President’. The judge told a committee of peers last month that there was a ‘historical reluctance’ to publish Court of Protection judgments but this was going to change. ‘To my mind the impact of proceedings having more sunlight let in, more transparency, outweighs the difficulties that in some cases some people may have in having their privacy invaded,’ he said. Controversial: The Court of Protection, unlike almost any other, is closed to public scrutiny . He added that greater openness ‘would improve the performance of all involved in the court process – I don’t exclude judges from that’. The switch means that one of the most senior judges, Chancellor of the High Court Sir Terence Etherton, loses the title of Vice-President of the Court of Protection after less than a year. Sir Terence took up the post of Chancellor, including the Court of Protection role, only in January.","Court of Protection has made several life-changing rulings without scrutiny .

Sir Michael Wilshaw branded Birmingham 'a national disgrace' Birmingham has been branded a 'national disgrace' by Ofsted's chief inspector, who said the city is one of the worst places to grow up in the developed world. Sir Michael Wilshaw highlighted the infant mortality rate in Britain’s second city, which is higher than Cuba's and almost twice the national average. He singled Birmingham out in a scathing report that found 20 areas in England where councils do not have ‘the most basic acceptable practice in place’. Sir Michael blamed Birmingham, where a third of children live in poverty, for ‘failure of corporate governance on a grand scale’. Birmingham recently published a review . of the cruel murder of two-year-old Keanu Williams by his mother in . 2011. His case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students. Birmingham City Council, one of the 20 to be classed as 'inadequate', . has now failed on seven inspection judgements, Ofsted said. Sir . Michael said: ‘It is an absolute disgrace and government needs to look . at this with real urgency. If better governance means breaking [the . department] up so children are better protected, then that’s what needs . to happen.’ He added: ‘Why . is it that nearly a third of children in the city live in households on . low incomes? Why is it that infant mortality is almost twice the . national average, worse than in Cuba and on a par with Latvia and Chile? ‘These are shocking . statistics and a national disgrace. They are a testament to failure of . corporate governance on a grand scale. ‘What . is shocking is that this is the city council with responsibility for . more children than any other, our second city, the largest unitary local . authority in the country. ‘This is a city that should be nipping at London’s heels for power, status and influence.’ He implied that the council would work better to protect children if . it was smaller, saying: 'As somebody said about the banks not so long . ago, if they are too big to fail, they are too big. The same could be . said about this council. Two-year-old Keanu Williams (left) was beaten to death by his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth (right). A review into his death found his case was dealt with by unqualified staff and students . 'It is an absolute disgrace and . government needs to look at this with real urgency. If better governance . means breaking it up so that children are better protected, then that's . what needs to happen.' The chief inspector spoke as Ofsted released its first report on England’s 152 children’s services departments. Just 3 per cent of councils were rated as 'outstanding' and 86 - more than half - were deemed to be 'less than good'. The report highlights that across . England 700,000 children live in a home with an alcoholic parent, . 100,000 children have parents who are being treated for a hard drug . addiction, 130,000 live in domestically violent homes and there are . 17,000 children living with a parent who has a severe or enduring mental . illness. Sir Michael said children’s services had been undermined because one in three departmental directors have either quit or been sacked in the past year – 50 out of 152. ‘Incompetent and ineffective leadership must be addressed quickly,’ he added. ‘But where those in leadership positions have capacity and potential, this must be recognised and nurtured.’ Birmingham City Council has now failed on seven inspection judgements. Pictured: Council buildings . The report found 86 of the 152 councils had children’s services that were ‘less than good’. A spokesman for Birmingham council . said: ‘We are already on record as saying that we have failed to meet the basic expectation of keeping vulnerable children in this city safe. 'This is a long-standing problem which we acknowledge and the leader has said that improving children's services is his number one priority. 'While we can only agree with the seriousness of what Sir Michael has said with regard to children's services - indeed we have said it ourselves - we now need improvement rather than further diagnosis lacking any offer of solutions. 'We must work with Ofsted on this and we repeat our determination to improve the safety of children in this city as the highest priority for this council.' The 20 judged inadequate were Barnsley, Bexley, Birmingham, Blackpool, Calderdale, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire East, Cumbria, Devon, Doncaster, Herefordshire, Isle of Wight, Kingston on Thames, Medway, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rochdale, Sandwell, Slough and Somerset.","Sir Michael Wilshaw singled Birmingham out in scathing report .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Fortnightly rubbish collections are a threat to public health, Government guidance warned yesterday. It said that no longer picking up bins from homes every week ‘must surely increase the risk’ to health. The warning to councils contradicts years of assurances from Whitehall that fortnightly collections have no effect on health and that infestations or smells that began after their introduction are the fault of householders who fail to observe the rules. Collections: With the growth of recycling many councils switched to weekly rounds - now labelled unsafe . Mess: Fortnightly collections were rubbished by the Department for Communities and Local Government . Instead, the guidelines from the Department for Communities and Local Government said that alongside the health risk, reports show ‘householders suffering because of highly unpleasant odours coming from their rubbish, and maggots infesting their wheelie bins’. The concerns were made public as part of an official appeal by the department and its Secretary of State Eric Pickles for councils to return to the weekly collections of general rubbish that began to be abandoned a decade ago. Eric Pickles leads the department and has repeatedly lobbied for weekly collections . Between half and three quarters of the 350 local councils that  operate rubbish collections now have compulsory recycling systems involving fortnightly collections of general ‘residual’ rubbish, or other restrictions on what families can put out for the binmen. Mr Pickles’ document condemned the switch away from weekly collections in guidance that puts his department at odds with a rival Whitehall ministry, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [Defra]. Defra has overall responsibility for waste collection. Its ministers have promised to ‘push ahead on all fronts’ in order to meet European recycling targets and Defra papers say this includes demanding further ‘behavioural changes’ from householders. Mr Pickles said: ‘This Government is standing up for hard-working people and getting rid of barmy bin policies which made families’ lives hell. ‘Rubbish collections are the most visible service that people get for their £120-a-month council tax bill. People deserve a comprehensive weekly service in return for their taxes. If councils adopt this new guide as their bin bible, they will be able to save taxpayers’ money and still increase the frequency and quality of rubbish and recycling collections.’ Health concerns about fortnightly collections first arose in the mid-2000s, amid complaints from householders and adverse reports from private pest control organisations. Government-backed advice to councils said they should adopt fortnightly collections during the winter months, when people are less likely to notice the smell. The new Communities Department guidance said councils which move to fortnightly collections tell their residents there are no problems when the system is operated correctly. ‘While this “evidence” is not officially doubted here, a fortnightly collection is clearly a reduction in service from a weekly collection and must surely increase the risk,’ it said. ‘There is no getting away from this fact. Worry: Health concerns were first raised over fortnightly collections in the mid-2000s by pest controllers . Heaps: Household waste and recycling can quickly pile up over Christmas (file photo) ‘One recent survey has found that problems with flies and smells were much worse with fortnightly collections. Only this summer, reports from across the country have told how residents are unhappy with their fortnightly collection.’ It added that World Health Organisation recommendations say that in temperate climates like that of Britain, rubbish should be collected once a week, and that fortnightly collections have been blamed for a rise in numbers of rat infestations. The guidance denounced a series of ‘myths’ about fortnightly collections. It said claims they make life easier for residents are ‘surprising’ and European regulations do not demand the end of weekly collections or the introduction of five separate bins. Last year Mr Pickles offered councils that keep or bring back weekly collections a share of £250million in incentive money from his ministry.","Guidance was issued yesterday by department led by Eric Pickles .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Lost custody: The unidentified woman will have her two sons, 11 and 14, taken away following the ruling . A mother said to have harmed her two sons by ‘permissive parenting’ has been stripped of the right to bring them up. The brothers, 11 and 14, will now live with their father so they will be given ‘the guidance and boundaries appropriate for teenage boys’. A judge made the order after hearing that the boys, who  lived with their mother after their parents’ break-up, were staying up late,  missing school, late for classes and neglecting  their homework. The mother spent much of the day in bed while her sons were left to play computer games, Judge Laura Harris heard. She said the mother was ‘complacent about the educational issues and minimised concerns about lateness, homework and general progress’. Adding that she thought it likely that the mother was depressed, the judge said: ‘She does spend hours under the duvet, on the phone or using her iPad, and the children are left to their own devices. It seems to me to be likely that they are spending a lot of time playing on their own or on their Xboxes. ‘She does have a very permissive style of parenting, and I accept the father’s evidence  that she is more like a friend than a parent. ‘I am satisfied that there is a failure to provide proper guidance and boundaries essential for the social and emotional development of these pre-adolescent and adolescent boys.’ The case is the latest in which separated and divorced mothers have been criticised by judges for neglecting the welfare of their children while encouraging hostility towards the father. Judge Harris, sitting in the Family Division of the High Court, said in her ruling – which has been published with the parents and children un-named – that the 41-year-old mother had ‘significantly failed’ her sons. After hearing from a senior teacher and a court-appointed social worker, she said that the older boy ‘is not achieving his educational potential, which is harmful to his future prospects’. Ruling: The case was heard in the family division of the High Court, which sits in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, pictured . Target: The mother even accused judge Laura Harris, pictured, of being biased towards her ex-husband . The judge added that there was a risk the younger brother would ‘go the same way’. The boys’ behaviour ‘shows a lack of discipline and structure,’ the judge said. ‘Although the court must be tolerant of different standards of parenting, I consider the permissive parenting in this case has caused the children harm.’ Judge Harris said the mother deeply resented the father, who she believed had begun an affair before their marriage broke up in 2002, and who she believed had failed to pay properly for his sons’ upbringing. She was awarded custody in 2002, and in 2004 a court ruled that the children should live with their mother while having weekend contact with their father. In 2012, the father asked a court for custody after repeatedly complaining that he had been denied contact with them. Judge Harris said the father ‘has, in my view, demonstrated far better insight into the needs of his boys’. ‘He is much more in favour of structure, boundaries and discipline, and I can understand why the boys might baulk at that.’ Judge Harris said the mother had manipulated the boys into hostility towards their 43-year-old father and that her hatred of him was ‘almost pathological’. ‘So preoccupied is she with her own sense of grievance that she completely overlooks the effect of her behaviour on her children. In my judgment, she has prioritised her own needs and feelings at the expense of the needs of her children.’","Father complained his ex-wife was not acting like a parent .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Almost half of new mothers are now over 30 as record numbers of older women choose to start families. And most of these women are married, in comparison with new mums in their 20s who are far more likely to be single or living with a partner. Nearly 360,000 women in their 30s gave birth last year – 49 per cent of the total – and just under seven in ten were married, the Office for National Statistics said. Changing times: The proportion of women having children aged under 25 has fallen sharply while over-35s has risen . Meanwhile 369,000 women under 30 gave . birth but their family situations were less stable than their older . counterparts on the whole, with almost two-thirds either cohabiting or . single. The average age of . new mothers also hit a historic high of 29.8 years, up from 29.7 in . 2011. The figure has been rising since 1975, when a woman typically gave . birth at 26.4 years. Now . the average age of motherhood is higher than it was during the 1930s and . 1940s, when it reached a peak of 29.3 years in 1944. The . Office for National Statistics said: ‘The overall rise since 1975 . reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying . childbearing to later ages. ‘Possible . influences include increased participation in higher education, . increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing . importance of a career, the rising costs of childbearing, labour market . uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.’ Overall, . just over half – 53 per cent – of babies were born to married mothers. Family: Most parents are now aged over 30, with fathers more likely to be older, the ONS said . Warning: Midwives said older mothers were more likely to suffer from complications (file photo) Among . mothers in their 30s, 69 per cent were married, while only 37 per cent . of under-20s were married. This dropped to one in five among those aged . between 20 and 25. The ONS report suggests young mothers are . increasingly likely to be less well-off and in relationships that are . more likely to break down, while older mothers tend to be in stable . relationships and have reliable incomes. Previous . studies have found cohabiting relationships typically break up within . three years, often creating single-parent families. By contrast, . families of married couples are more likely to stay together, and are on . average wealthier, healthier, and the children benefit from a better . education. Author on the . family Jill Kirby said: ‘There is a big divide opening up between . better-off, better-educated women who wait until they are older and . marry before having children, and younger and often poorer mothers who . do not see marriage as a first step. They have children in more casual . relationships. ‘We should be . worried by this because it is clear from all the data that children . whose parents are not married have a much higher risk of seeing their . family break up. ‘We need reforms to encourage women to marry before they have children to give their children a better chance.’","Average age of women giving birth is now 29.8 years, ONS reveals .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Fragile: Civil partnerships have begun to break up at the same rate as marriages . Civil partnerships have begun to break up at a speed approaching the divorce rates of heterosexual couples. The number of partnerships legally dissolved in England and Wales shot up by 20 per cent last year and has more than doubled in three years. Analysts said the figures could suggest that some civil partners – among whom the longest-lasting partnerships have been registered for just under eight  years – are experiencing the ‘seven-year itch’. However, while for heterosexual couples the peak age of divorce is the early 40s, for same-sex civil partners – who typically legalise their relationships at a much older age than heterosexuals – the highest level of break-ups is among younger people, especially among women in their 20s and 30s. Nearly a third of all the civil partners who ended their partnership last year were women under 40. The . average age of a civil partner whose relationship dissolved in England . last year was actually younger than the average age at which gay or . lesbian couples register a civil partnership. Lawyers said the growing number of dissolutions meant partnership break-ups were comparable with divorce. The Office for National Statistics . said the number of civil  partnerships celebrated in 2012 was 7,037, an . increase of 3.6 per cent on 2011. Dissolutions in 2012 rose by 20 per cent, to 794 from 663 in 2011. Vicki McLynn of Pannone Solicitors said: ‘The likelihood of civil partnerships experiencing a seven-year itch should perhaps not come as that much of a surprise given that the issues which the couples involved face are broadly the same as those who are married. Equality: Although the rates of dissolution are proving the same, civil partnerships break up at a younger age than marriages . ‘The greatest possibility of husbands and wives divorcing occurs when they have been married between four and eight years and these new figures fit that pattern for civil partners too.’ ‘More than half the dissolutions recorded . in 2012 ended female partnerships and women were almost twice as likely . as men to break up a civil partnership.’ Alison Hawes of Irwin Mitchell said: . ‘The number of civil partnerships that have taken place is reaching a . substantial critical mass now and it is expected that these . relationships will follow the general trends of marriage and divorce. ‘It is a common generalisation that there is a seven-year itch when relationships supposedly become more difficult. ‘In . reality, it is often a few years into relationships that couples think . about separating as things may not have worked out as planned. 'Same issues': A divorce expert said the phenomenon is unsurprising since same-sex couples face similar problems to heterosexual ones . 'The . statistics show that the first 10 years are the most vulnerable in a . marriage, and the same seems to be true of civil partnerships.’ Civil partnership dissolution rates remain below those of marriage – 3.2 per cent of male and 6.1 per cent of female partnerships have broken up in England and Wales – but the pattern appears close to that of divorce among heterosexual married couples. Overall, 455 female partnerships ended in 2012 and 339 male partnerships. The figures apply only to England and Wales because 2012 figures for Scotland remain unpublished. The average age of someone whose partnership was dissolved in England and Wales last year was 38.6 - while the average age of someone registering a civil partnership in England was 38.9. The ONS said: ‘The rising number of dissolutions is a consequence of the increasing number of civil partners living in the UK.’ Overall, 60,454 civil partnerships have been registered since 2005. Laws allowing same-sex marriage come into effect next year.","New figures show the number of ended partnerships shot up by 20 per cent .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . When it comes to the delicate subject of personal health, it seems British women are burying their heads in the sand. For they are more likely to rate themselves as fit and healthy than women in almost all other European countries – despite the fact they tend to suffer worse health. Indeed British women have a shorter life expectancy than many of their European counterparts, are more likely to die from cancer, drink too much and be obese. In denial? More than 75 per cent of British women rate themselves as fit and healthy, statistics have revealed . According to figures from the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, 76.5 per cent of women in the UK rated their health as good or very good. It put UK women in third place behind Ireland, where 83.1 per cent of women rated their health highly and Sweden on 78 per cent. In Germany only 63.3 per cent of women thought their health was good, and in France 64.4 per cent. Both countries registered scores below the EU average of 65.3 per cent and – surprisingly – below that of some of the poorest EU countries. In Romania, 64.7 per cent of women rated their health as good or very good, and in Malta 68.8 per cent. British men, however, were less optimistic than women. In Sweden, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Greece and Ireland, men reckoned themselves healthier than British men did. The results were drawn up from surveys carried out in the 28 EU member countries, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Swiss women considered themselves healthier than their British counterparts, while men in both Iceland and Switzerland gave themselves higher marks than British men. The figures come after several studies have raised concerns about the health of women living in the UK. A recent study by the World Health Organisation and researchers from University College London found life expectancy among British women is two years shorter than in France, Spain and Italy, and a year shorter than in Cyprus, Malta and Andorra. It also suggested that 23 per cent of British women are overweight – double the European average.Breast cancer survival rates in the UK are among the lowest in the industrialised world, while cervical cancer survival rates are better in Slovenia and the Czech Republic than in Britain. Unhealthy: A recent study has suggested that 23 per cent of British women are overweight, while binge drinking among females has more than doubled in the past decade . Binge drinking among women more than doubled during the last decade, and just last month a survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found heavier drinking among 15-year-old British girls here than in any developed country except Denmark. Eurostat said their table ‘gives an overall assessment by the respondent of his or her health in general. It added that the survey is carried out only among households, and not in care homes or hospitals, which ‘is likely to contribute to an under-estimation of health problems’.","More than 75 per cent of British women rate themselves as fit and healthy .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . The Scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to God, its leaders said yesterday. They bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as Scouts. But new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version. Scroll down for video . Tradition: The original promise, written by Robert Baden-Powell, left, in 1908, will be retained by new recruits . The decision opens a gulf between the Scouts and the Guides, who earlier this year dropped all references to God and religion from the promises girls are asked to make when they join. It was welcomed by church leaders, who praised the Scouts for ‘affirming the importance of spiritual life.’ The Scout choice to keep God in its main membership pledge follows months of argument over whether the country’s two biggest youth movements should continue to honour religion as one of their central principles. Guide leaders said in June that their organisation’s longstanding demand that girls who sign up should promise to ‘love my God’ was ‘confusing’ about belief and ‘discouraged some girls and volunteers from joining us.’ Instead new Guides now pledge ‘to be true to myself’ and ‘to serve my community’. But Scout officials said yesterday that following a 10-month consultation ‘the core Scout Promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme.’ Oath: The Duchess of Cambridge accepts flowers from a local Scout in 2011. The reference to the Queen in the promise will be retained as well. The decision opens up a new element of competition for recruits between the two organisations. Although the Guides remain an all-female group, Scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members. The Scout Promise, which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907, requires that new members declare: ‘On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’ Different versions for the use of Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have been available since 1960, although all have included a religious reference. There are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘to the country in which I am now living’ rather than to the Queen. The new wording for atheists says: ‘On my honour I promise that I will do my best to uphold our Scout values, to do my duty to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’ Scout Chief Commissioner Wayne Bulpitt said yesterday: ‘Throughout its 106-year history the movement has continued to evolve and today marks an important step in that journey. 'It also signifies the determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society that it serves. ‘We are a values-based movement and exploring faith and beliefs remains a key element of the Scouting Programme. That will not change.’ Churchmen from the main denominations welcomed the move. The Right Reverend Paul Butler, Church of England Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, said: ‘As the recent national census demonstrated, we remain a faithful nation where the majority of families find identity and meaning in religious belief. Opposition: Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society said he preferred the Guide's approach` ‘In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs Scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible, and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life and not to restrict meaning to arbitrary self-definition.’ Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society welcomed the decision but said: ‘We think the Guides’ response to this issue was infinitely superior. They introduced a secular oath for everyone. 'This approach relieves young people of having to make a decision about what they believe at a time in their lives when maybe they haven’t decided.’","It was decided to retain the historic oath after a ten-month consultation .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Nigeria has accepted more than £1billion in aid from Britain while losing twice that sum every year through corruption in its oil industry, it was revealed yesterday. Some 100,000 barrels of oil a day are being stolen from pipelines, ports and storage tanks with the connivance of politicians, officials and military  top brass, says an authoritative report. It also points out that the aid to Nigeria may not be going to those who need it the most. In fact, some of it is being used to equip the country’s navy. The stolen crude oil represents five per cent of all production in oil-rich Nigeria. Nigeria has accepted more than £1billion UK aid, despite losing twice that sum every year through corruption in its oil industry. Above, the Total Nigeria onshore oil and gas refinery at Amenam in the delta of the Niger River in Nigeria . The report by the think-tank Chatham House said the proceeds of the theft are then laundered in major financial markets, with the City of London key among them. It warned that the scale of the stolen oil trade ‘threatens the integrity of financial markets and the legitimate oil business’. Nigeria's share of the aid was questioned last month after the Mail disclosed the country's plans to expand its space agency (above) The report comes at a time of growing controversy over Britain’s foreign aid budget, which is due to rise to £11billion a year in 2015. Questions over Nigeria’s share of the aid – £1.14 billion over the five years – were raised last month after the Mail disclosed the country’s plans to expand its space agency and put an astronaut in space in two years. The inquiry by Chatham House – established for almost a century with close links to the Foreign Office – throws further doubts over the fate of aid money sent to Nigeria. The report, Nigeria’s Criminal Crude, said the cash is going to pay for Nigerian naval equipment and training at a time when the country’s maritime forces have conspicuously neglected to attempt to stop shipments of stolen oil. It said foreign oil workers have watched as tankers known to be loaded with illicit cargo have sailed past patrol vessels unmolested. Tory backbenchers have been fiercely critical of David Cameron’s commitment to increased aid spending. They believe much of the cash amounts to subsidies for rich people in developing countries at the expense of the British poor. The Chatham House report said: ‘Nigerian crude oil is being stolen on an industrial scale. Proceeds are laundered through world financial centres. In Nigeria, politicians, military officers, militants, oil industry personnel, oil traders and communities profit, as do organised criminal groups. Some 100,000 barrels of oil a day are being stolen from pipelines, ports and storage tanks with the connivance of  officials, says an authoritative report. Above, oil pipelines in Port Harcourt, Nigeria . ‘The greatest victims are ordinary . Nigerians. The trade destroys the environment, weakens public . institutions, swallows government revenue that could buy public goods, . and imposes other social costs.’ Britain is named as a ‘hotspot’ where the profits are laundered. The process involves ‘bulk cash smuggling … heavy use of middlemen, shell companies and tax havens, bribery of bank officials, cycling cash through legitimate businesses and cash purchases of luxury goods.’ The reported scale of the stolen oil trade is said to be 100,000 barrels a day, worth more than £6million. That means the illicit industry is worth well over £2billion each year. The Department for International Development, which administers the aid budget, said Britain was working to fight corruption in Nigeria.","Nigeria has accepted more than £1billion in UK aid, despite losing twice that sum every year through its corrupt oil industry, it has been revealed .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Young Britons should think about the ‘destructive’ impact on their families before travelling to Syria, Theresa May warned today. The Home Secretary issued a blunt messaging declaring ‘don’t go to Syria’ as she backed a campaign highlighting the effects on communities in the UK when people join jihadist militants. More than 400 people are thought to have left Britain for Syria and Iraq to join rebel fighters, sparking fears they will become radicalised to launch terror attacks when they return home. Home Secretary Theresa May issued a blunt messaging declaring ‘don’t go to Syria’ A new nationwide campaign - Families Matter – was launched today by not-for-profit organisation Families Against Stress and Trauma (Fast) to urge people to stop their relatives from travelling to join the conflicts. Mrs May said: ‘This campaign addresses one of the most significant issues facing communities up and down Britain – the extremely damaging effect of young people choosing to travel to Syria and now Iraq. ‘While many may be motivated by a desire to help the country, the result and impact on these people, their families and often on the communities they are trying to support is very destructive indeed.’ Several high-profile incidents have led to a national effort to prevent young people travelling to Iraq and Syria. Last month two men from Cardiff and a man from Aberdeen featured in an online recruitment video urging western Muslims to join the fighting with the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (Isis) group. Mrs May joined the Families Matter launch in London, warning of the impact on communities left behind at home when loved ones joining fighting in Iraq and Syria . Mrs May added: 'I am clear, in relation to people who are going to Syria and returning as terrorists, the Government will take action. 'Over 400 UK-linked individuals have now travelled to Syria since the uprising began. Anyone travelling to Syria and Iraq is exposing themselves to serious risks and the Government strongly advises against it. 'Providing a campaign called Families Matter is about supporting the families. Remember the family and the stress and trauma it causes when someone travels to Syria. The message is don’t go to Syria - there are better ways to help. 'The best way people can help respond to the crisis is from the UK within the UK and within the safety of their families and communities. Nasser Muthana, 20, Reyaad Khan, 20, and Abdul Raqib Amin, 26, appeared in the video and are thought to be among more than 400 Britons fighting in Syria and Iraq. Nasser’s father Ahmed, who appeared in a Fast campaign video and whose other son Aseel is also in Syria, said: 'Nasser was going to be a GP. We expected a high life for him. He was the best of the best but unfortunately he chose to go with these wrong people. 'I think ‘am I going to see him alive again?’ Maybe we won’t even see the coffin - we’ll just see on the news they’re dead.' The Home Office has stepped up measures to act as a deterrent, including prosecuting some of those who come back as terrorists.","Home Secretary warns of impact on families when loved ones join fighting .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . The 'fiscal factbook' sheds light on how the EU spends the billions of pounds it receives from Britain and other member countries . The European Union spends more on advertising than the drinks giant Coca-Cola, according to a new analysis of how Brussels uses our money. Its budget for promoting itself and all its works comes to £2.4billion a year. That compares to the £2.13billion spent in the same year by the soft drinks company on promoting its brand around the world. The vast scale of the EU’s self-promotion was set down in a new ‘fiscal factbook’ designed to shed light on how Brussels spends the billions it receives from Britain and other member countries. Small-scale bills highlighted in the report include £160,000 paid towards a yet to open fitness and rehabilitation centre for dogs  in Hungary. And on a larger scale the report details how the ambitions of EU diplomacy has seen 44 diplomats stationed in Barbados, one of Europe’s less-troubled trading partner nations. It also points to some of the widely-known but often forgotten aspects of EU spending condemned as driven by political folly. Among these is the annual budget of £150 million for ferrying MEPs and their staff between the European Parliament’s two headquarters buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg to appease politicians in Belgium and France. The EU Fiscal Factbook, published by the TaxPayers’ Alliance at the Tory conference, is likely to sharpen differences over Europe among the party’s MPs. It comes at a time of deep anxiety over pressure from Ukip, which demands withdrawal from the EU.The TPA’s founder Matthew Elliott said: ‘Britain’s contribution to the EU gets bigger every year. ‘That means bigger tax bills for families and too much of the money is wasted. Brussels also makes life difficult for British businesses with draconian regulations. ‘We deserve a better deal. This factbook provides a clear overview of the big picture: how much cash do we hand over every year?’ The dog fitness and rehabilitation centre in Hungary highlighted in the report, which includes the development of a hydrotherapy system, was given £160,000 in 2009 to ‘improve the lifestyle and living standards of dogs’. Progress has been slow and building work had not even started a year after budget approval.The money went to an IT company called Gyrotech that built new offices which remain empty. The Court of Auditors has refused to approve the EU budget for 18 successive years over concerns about mismanagement and fraud. But Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, this month warned the auditors: ‘Your reports are not released into a void but into the rough and tumble of political life and media reporting. Every year, they generate headlines that “yet again the EU’s accounts have not been signed off”, with deceptive allegations of fraud and mismanagement. ‘We should be teaching Europeans that Europe is not the source of problems, but the solution.’ Since then the European Commission has told EU members states they should contribute an extra £3.5billion to Brussels this year to meet unexpected ‘legal obligations’. The bail-out will bring EU spending this year to £126billion, 8.4 per cent up on the previous year. Mr Elliott said yesterday: ‘Voters want clear facts as we move towards an EU referendum.’ The factbook sets out Britain’s net contribution to the EU – the amount paid after taking into account spending by Brussels in Britain – at £7,255billion euros in 2011. This is more than the contributions of France or Italy, and second only to Germany. Spain received more than three billion euros. Of overall spending, £44billion this year will go on the Common Agricultural Policy, the farm subsidy system often derided as the means by which France shores up its rural economy. The CAP paid handouts of more than £250,000 each to 889 British landowners in 2011. and more than £1million each to 47 landowners. The report calculated the burden of EU regulation on the British economy at £124billion, or £5,000 for every British household. The advertising budget included £15million on a Parliamentarium, opened in 2011 as a supposed tourist attraction, but described by critics as a ‘propaganda temple’. The cost of EU advertising was calculated in 2008 by the Open Europe think-tank, and includes a broadcast channel, an opinion polling organisation, films and huge numbers of publications, funding for sympathetic pressure groups, and special publicity conferences.","New analysis shows how EU spends the billions it receives from Britain and other member countries .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The number of working days lost to strikes almost doubled last year to more than 440,000, it emerged today. As David Cameron plans a crackdown on trade unions, new figures showed almost half of all days lost were in education after teachers staging walkouts. The Tories sought to pin the blame on Labour leader Ed Miliband, claiming his ‘chums at the top of the trade unions’ were putting the economic recovery in peril. The Office for National Statistics said there were 443,600 working days lost in the UK last year as a result of 114 separate stoppages, up from 249,000 lost days in 2012. In total, there were 50 public sector walkouts and 64 in the private sector. However, the number of working days lost in the public sector rose sharply from 198,000 in 2012 to 363,000 in 2013. Overall 82 per cent of all working days lost were in the public sector. ‘This reflects the relatively large one-off strikes that occurred in the public sector in 2013,’ the ONS said. Almost all strikes called last year were in rows over pay, a major change to 2010 when the majority were in protest at redundancies as coalition’s spending cuts began to bite. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps told MailOnline: ‘While we are working to secure Britain’s future, Ed Miliband’s chums at the top of the trade unions are trying to take us backwards. ‘This massive hike in strike damage to our economy is a national scandal. It is a stinging slap in the face to British people and their families who are trying to work hard. ‘Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up to his trade union paymasters. He just isn’t up to it.’ Unions are to be banned from going out on strike on low turnouts or using old ballots of members under Tory plans to end disruption of public services. David Cameron last week revealed the Conservative party manifesto will include plans to legislate on the rules on staging walkouts . Last week Mr Cameron revealed the Conservative party manifesto will include plans to legislate on the rules on staging walkouts. Up to a million teachers, council workers, health workers, firefighters and civil servants staged a strike across England and Wales last week. More disruption is expected later this year. The threat of industrial action in protest at spending cuts and pay restraint has been condemned by the government, . However, the ONS said the scale of strikes has fallen in the last two decades. 'Looking at the last 20 years compared with the previous 20 years shows that the average number of working days lost per year has decreased considerably from 7.8 million days in the period 1973-1992 to 615,700 days in the period 1993-2012.' The high number of days lost in 2011 was due to a couple of large public sector strikes, while the 2002 figure was due to one very large stoppage in the transport and storage industry.","Number of days lost surges to 443,600, up from 249,000 days in 2012 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Rebekah Brooks acquired a retired police horse specifically for David Cameron to ride it, it was claimed today. The tale of Raisa – and whether or not the Prime Minister had ever ridden her – became one of the most bizarre episodes from the fallout of the hacking scandal. Now the Met Police boss who agreed to provide the horse to Mrs Brooks has claimed she boasted Mr Cameron would be climbing into the saddle, even before she had taken delivery of the animal. Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were loaned a Met Police horse named Raisa in 2008 . It emerged in spring 2012 that Mrs Brooks, the former Sun and News of the World editor, had been lent the 24-year-old retired Met horse between 2008 and 2010. The deal was struck after Mrs Brooks Dick Fedorcio – the Met’s then-head of public affairs. According to a new book, Mrs Brooks suggested Mr Cameron would be riding the horse while she was in talks with the Met about looking after the retired beast. Alan Hiscox, the head of Imber Court, the Met’s horse training centre, said he was told by his bosses that it would ‘definitely be a good idea for the Met Police’ to loan a horse to Mrs Brooks, according to The News Machine’ by James Hanning with Glenn Mulcaire, serialised in The Independent today. In October 2007, Mr Hiscox to the Cotswolds to check out the stables and facilities at the Brooks’ home. Mr Hiscox said: ‘As we were being shown round the stables, she told me that David Cameron would also be riding the retired police horse. After several days of trying to dodge the question, in 2012 David Cameron finally admitted that he had indeed ridden Raisa . ‘At the time I did not think much of it, other than to wonder why she told me that. She may have been trying to show off, but it was a curious thing to say.’ Questions about the horse, and whether Mr Cameron had ridden it, emerged when the spotlight fell on the nature of close relationships between journalists, the police and politicians. In late February 2012 Mr Cameron’s official spokesman initially insisted: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a horse.’ Two days later the Prime Minister had to cut off from a Brussels summit to answer questions about the horse. He told reporters that Raisa was among his mounts when he rode with Mrs Brooks’ husband Charlie, a friend since they attended Eton. ‘I have not been riding with him since the election,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him. ‘He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride.’ According to the book, Mr Hiscox added: ‘Why did David Cameron’s office not say he had ridden the horse in the first instance? ‘It wasn’t clear to me why they were so embarrassed about it. ‘It is possible, I suppose, that Rebekah Brooks was trying to ingratiate herself with Mr Cameron and that she had told him she was going to get it for him, but in normal circumstances it should not have been a big deal.’ In 2010 the horse was returned to the Met Police, where it later died. Mr Hiscox added: ‘Clearly it had not been ridden or groomed much, but there was no suggestion by me that it had been mistreated, as was claimed in the press.’ Last month Mr and Mrs Brooks were cleared of all charges in relation to phone hacking and perverting the course of justice.","Ex-News of the World editor was loaned horse Raisa by the Met Police .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A record surge in employment means in one town almost no-one is on the dole. In the Staffordshire market town of Uttoxeter just 34 people are claiming Jobseekers Allowance, it emerged today. And with a Waitrose supermarket about to open, with 180 new jobs, it means unemployment could disappear altogether. The small town of Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, which dates back to the Domesday Book, has just 34 people claiming Jobseekers Allowance . National figures released yesterday showed nearly one million people got a job over the past year, the biggest annual increase in employment since records began in 1971. Ministers hailed ‘an important milestone’ in the country’s economic recovery, with more people working in Britain than ever before. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 36,300 in June to 1.04 million, the 20th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest total since 2008. But in Uttoxeter, which dates back to the Domesday Book and is home to the famous racecourse, there is now just three dozen people claiming the out-of-work benefits. The town, which has a population of more than 12,000, is famous for its racecourse . Local Tory MP Andrew Griffiths was given the figure by the Department for Work and Pensions to check the figures. He told the Uttoxeter News: 'These are astounding figures, and only go to demonstrate that the government's long term economic plan is paying huge defends in Uttoxeter. 'Overall, unemployment in my constituency has almost halved in the last four years this Government has been in power, but it is fantastic to discover that it has fallen to such a low level in Uttoxeter.’ Waitrose plans to open a new superstore on the site of a former JCB factory, creating 180 new jobs. JCB and biscuit makers Fox's in nearby Cheadle are major employers in the area, while the Alton Towers theme park also employs many local people. Nationally, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.5 per cent. Chris Plant, director of Burton and District Chamber of Commerce, which covers Uttoxeter, said: ""The labour market is continuing to strengthen, with employment rising, unemployment declining and the number of inactive people also falling. ""These figures demonstrate the resilience and flexibility of the Uttoxeter jobs market and points to continued strong positive growth in the second quarter of this year. ""To build upon these figures, it is important that we see measures to increase productivity and firmer action on youth and long term unemployment.’ David Cameron yesterday hailed the latest employment figures as proof ‘more people have the security of a job than ever before’. He added: ‘Of course we need to do more to help people by continuing to bring down the cost of government and people's taxes. ‘That's what we have done and what we must continue to do as part of our long-term economic plan.'","Small market town of 12,000 people dates back to the Domesday Book .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police has found two other cases where similar errors were apparently made. Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way so-called ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run. Critics today claimed it amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA's Hyde Park bombing in 1982. David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK. In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court. The peace process plan agreed between Sinn Fein and Tony Blair's Labour government saw 190 letters of assurance sent to on-the-runs telling them they were not wanted by UK authorities. Lady Justice Hallett said the scheme was not well publicised, and effectively kept 'below the radar', but was not secret. 'The administrative scheme did not amount to an amnesty,' she said. 'Suspected terrorists were not handed a 'get out of jail free card'.' But shockingly she unearthed details of two more cases where errors were made. They included: . The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters. Democratic Unionist First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign over the matter - an ultimatum he withdrew when Mr Cameron ordered the review. A police commander subsequently claimed that 95 of those who received letters were linked, though only by intelligence, to 295 murders during the Troubles. Today Mr Robinson said the scheme was ‘wrong in principle and shambolic in practice’. He added: ‘Of course it was a get out of jail free card for Downey. 'It has the potential of being a get out of jail card for the two that Lady Justice Hallett refers to as in error, it has the potential of being a get out of jail free card for the others who were not given the caveat that was entered in some of the personal letters that were sent out. ‘And indeed it has the potential of being a get out of out jail free card for anyone who has received a letter because no one knows whether it would amount to an abuse of process application being accepted by a future judge.’ Northern Ireland's most senior police officer said it was 'highly unlikely' the two other letters sent in error would lead to the collapse of future court cases. Chief constable George Hamilton said he accepted Lady Justice Hallett's findings and apologised to the Hyde Park victims. He said: 'The difference though between those is that those errors have been identified and we have taken action around those so that even with those two additional errors mitigation is in place.' He added: 'If they ever were to come to court it is highly unlikely that an abuse of process application (to collapse the case) would be successful as it was in the Downey case because we have identified the mistake and we have done something about it.' Under the scheme the names of individuals were passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein, before being handed to police and prosecutors to assess their status. A report on each individual was sent back to the Government and, if they were declared as not being wanted, a letter of assurance was then issued to the individuals. In the Commons today, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said: 'I know that recent events have revived painful memories for those affected by that terrible atrocity (Hyde Park) and I apologise again on behalf of this Government for any hurt that has caused.' She added: 'I fully accept the Hallett Report's conclusions and recommendations and am determined that the Government will act on them. 'But, as I have said before, as far as this Government is concerned, the OTR scheme is over.' For . more than 30 years, John Downey had the IRA bombing in Hyde Park . hanging over his head - and the families of four victims denied justice.","Labour government did deal with Sinn Fein as part of the peace process .

The use of an incorrect date of birth to search a police database may have missed an offence potentially linked to an individual. An individual with the same name and same year of birth was wanted for a terrorist offence. It has not yet been established if this was the same individual who received the letter of assurance.
An individual who was wanted for an offence committed after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord was sent a letter with a general assurance they were not wanted. The origin of the mistake lay in the fact the police believed they were only searching for pre-1998 offences and therefore did not outline details of the 2003 offence when informing the Northern Ireland Office that the individual was 'not wanted by the PSNI'.

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . This is the moment social services took a baby away from its parents when it was just six hours old. The infant at the centre of the Munby judgment, known only as J, was removed from its parents after his birth in April. The father secretly filmed the seizure on a webcam attached to the family computer. Scroll down video . The six-hour-old baby is cradled by its father as a police officer stands close by in the secretly recorded video . The mother is clearly distraught in the video as Staffordshire social workers and police take the baby away . It has long been available on the internet but an edited version can only now be published and viewed legitimately. The views of the father and mother of the four children taken into care by Staffordshire social workers can also now be published following yesterday's landmark judgment by President of the Family Division Sir James Munby. In June the baby's father was given a suspended six-week . prison sentence by a family court judge for his refusal to co-operate . in getting the video removed from internet sites. The parents said social workers removed their baby because they decided their mother was incapable of bringing them up because of her learning disability. The video shows the father holding the newborn infant at their home when social workers and police come to take it away. In the video, the mother is clearly distraught and holds onto her baby and rocks it as her husband remonstrates with officers and council staff. One social worker can be heard telling the parents: 'We are going to take [baby J]. I don't want to have to get physical.' The mother can be heard wailing and screaming 'no' as social workers take her baby. The baby's father told the Daily Mail: 'I . taped over the light on the webcam so the social workers couldn't see . it was switched on.' The couple - who cannot be named - have lost four children who were removed by social workers. Three have now been adopted. The father said yesterday they have never been accused of harming their children. Cases in which children have been taken from families with learning difficulties have been acutely controversial over the last decade. Campaigners and some academics say . over-zealous social workers have broken up families led by parents who . are no threat to their children and who can look after them capably. A version of the video can be published for the first time after Sir James Munby said the father could share it . One social worker can be heard saying: 'We are here to take [baby J]. I don't want to have to get physical' The father told the Daily Mail: 'The social workers said my wife and I were in a volatile relationship. But we have been married for a long time and we do bicker a bit. We have differences of opinion. 'There has never been violence, and nobody has ever said there is any evidence to say otherwise.' The father said his oldest daughter was seven years old when she was taken from her parents four years ago. 'There were no problems for seven years,' he said. 'Then we had a new social worker who had a different attitude. 'My wife has a learning disability and for a period I was depressed, although that was quickly over after the GP helped. But the social worker tried to section me. The court was told that there was a risk the children would come to harm in the future. 'They were never harmed. They were taken away as a preventative or precautionary measure.' Sir James rejected a sweeping injunction . designed to effectively prevent anyone in the world from seeing the . film, knowing the names of the social workers involved, or even . discovering the name of the local authority that applied for the order, . Staffordshire County Council. The newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure . Sir James Munby said the baby's father should not be prevented from sharing information about the case after Staffordshire Council tried to gag him . The . father said that although social workers considered his wife disabled, . the wife's disability benefits were halted after intervention by . Staffordshire council staff. The parents, who do not work, were supported by family and by church food parcels for nearly nine months, he said, before state benefits to the wife were restored. He said he acted as his wife's carer. The father, 41, had been married to the mother, 36, for 13 years. The couple are permitted to see the eldest daughter six times a year under agreements settled in court, the father said. But he added: 'We have only been allowed to see her once this year. She wants to come home.' A test case in Essex in 2005 involved the parents of a four-year-old girl and a 14-month-old boy removed from their home even though they were clean, well-dressed, well fed, much loved, and had never been harmed. The case attracted attention because Essex social workers used court injunctions to prevent the parents from discussing their children or anyone from reporting the case. A High Court judge backed the council and said it was unrealistic for the parents to expect to bring up their children. Sir James Munby said of Staffordshire's attempt to silence the parents in yesterday's case: 'The father wishes to share information with others. Why should he not be able to do so? 'And why should those who may wish to hear his views not be permitted to approach him? 'This is in effect, if not in intention, a means of indirectly gagging the father so that what from the local authority's perspective are his unpalatable views are less likely to see the light of day.' Sir James added: 'I simply fail to see how naming the local authority, the social workers, the local authority's legal representative or the children's guardian, or even all of them, can in any realistic way be said to make it likely that J will be identified, even indirectly. 'The risk is merely fanciful.'","Seizure by Staffordshire social workers secretly recorded on webcam .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A Labour frontbencher came under fire today after branding David Cameron's new female ministers 'puppets'. Shadow media minister Helen Goodman was accused of sexism after claiming 'their appearance really is most interesting thing about them'. The Prime Minister used his reshuffle on Tuesday to promote several female MPs, who were pictured walking along the 'Downing Street catwalk' to learn of their new roles. Labour's shadow media minister Helen Goodman sparked a furious response with her claim that Tory female ministers were only interesting for their looks . Liz Truss, Nicky Morgan, Penny Mordaunt, Priti Patel, Amber Rudd and Anna Soubry were among the ministers photographed walking up the steps to Number 10 on Tuesday. Employment Minister Esther McVey yesterday laughed off being dubbed Queen of the Downing Street catwalk as 'fine if it inspires girls to go into politics'. She told Sky News: ‘Well all I can say is that it's fantastic having women in powerful positions in the newspapers and if that meant we were walking, the paper might have called it, 'a catwalk' - we were walking into Number 10 Downing Street. ‘And for the last 15 years I have worked with kids from inner city areas - young girls who are looking for role models. They see Nicky Morgan, Secretary of state for Education, and they’re thinking 'hey that’s something could do.'’ Labour had criticised the Mail's coverage of the reshuffle for being sexist for focussing too heavily on women and what they wore. But today Ms Goodman wrote on Twitter: 'Mail's page on Tory women was fair: all are puppets who'll change nothing and their appearance really is most interesting thing about them.' Employment minister Esther McVey was promoted to attend Cabinet in the reshuffle, as she posed on the stapess of Number 10 . Miss McVey has laughed off her new title of Queen of the Downing Street catwalk (featured in yesterday's Daily Mail) as 'fine if it inspires girls to go into politics' The remarks sparked a furious response on the internet. Mrs Morgan, the new Education Secretary, called on Labour leader Ed Miliband to act. 'Disappointing words from shadow minister Helen Goodman,' she posted online. 'Will Ed Miliband condemn these appalling comments?' Tory MP Nadine Dorries wrote: 'Truly shocking tweet. Maybe you should check your sexist comments with your women and equality boss Gloria de Piero first.' Claire Perry, the new transport minister, said: 'Helen, I can't imagine you actually think that given how much work we have done together on child protection online. 'Tragic that sensible female MP like you can't tell your Labour bully boys to get stuffed when they give you nonsense to tweet.' Defence Minister Anna Soubry - another of those featured - demanded an apology. 'Helen Goodman's comments were deliberately insulting,' she said. 'She should personally apologise to every one of the talented women she has chosen to cheaply slur.' 'Ed Miliband needs to make clear that these comments are absolutely unacceptable.' Clare Perry becomes a junior transport minister, Baroness Stowell becomes leader of the House of Lords and Anna Soubry is promoted to Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence . Another Tory MP, Sarah Newton, wrote a letter calling for action against Ms Goodman to Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman, who last week railed against the sexism against women still prevalent at Westminster. 'This disgraceful and demeaning slur damages not only those Conservative MPs referred to, but all women in politics,' she wrote. 'Ms Goodman is a member of your Shadow Ministerial team. It is therefore incumbent upon you either to condemn her remarks, or pass the matter to Ed Miliband to take disciplinary action. 'Given that you have devoted much of your political career to advancing the cause of women in public life, it will be deeply disappointing if you ignore Ms Goodman's repulsive remarks.' As the row erupted, Ms Goodman said the comment had been meant as a joke. 'I'm very sorry my last tweet offended some people. I intended it as a light-hearted remark,' she said. She has now deleted the message. Amazingly, Labour stood by Ms Goodman. A party spokesman said: 'The Labour Party's view is that David Cameron's promises on increasing the representation of women are a sham. He said a third of all his ministers would be women. Fewer than one-in-four are. It is David Cameron who has failed.'","Shadow media minister Helen Goodman sparks fury with message on Twitter .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Michael Gove's week is going from bad to worse. First he was dumped from the Cabinet as Education Secretary, then he lost his first vote in his new role as government Chief Whip. Now it has emerged he became trapped in a toilet in the Houses of Parliament and nearly missed another key vote in the Commons. Michael Gove was ousted as Education Secretary in the reshuffle, to the delight of teaching unions, but his new job as Chief Whip does not seem to be going according to plan . Mr Gove’s sudden departure from the Department for Education was one of the big shocks of the reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron promoted several women and Eurosceptics. His demotion to Chief Whip, without a major department, leaves him outside the Cabinet and taking a £36,000 pay cut. As Chief Whip, Mr Gove is charged with ensuring Tory MPs turn up to vote on legislation. But on his first day in the job, he suffered a defeat over controversial plans for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to audit Labour’s manifesto. In the Commons today it was claimed his attempt to make a good impression in the new job were put at risk after becoming stuck in a toilet. Angela Eagle, Labour's Shadow Commons leader, told MPs: 'I'd like to welcome Mr Gove... he hasn't had the most auspicious of starts. 'Yesterday, he not only lost his first vote but he managed to get stuck in the toilet in the wrong lobby and he nearly broke his own whip. 'We know all about the former education secretary's love of free schools. Independent of any central authority - I wonder if he is keen to allow the emergence of lots of free Tory MPs who don't have to submit to his authority.' Mr Gove ran into trouble as MPs were preparing to vote on a Labour plan to have their manifesto audited by the Office for Budget Responsibility . William Hague, who quit as Foreign Secretary to become Leader of the Commons, insisted: 'You made fun of what he was doing yesterday - knowledge of who is in the toilets in whatever lobby is a very important piece of information for any chief whip. 'I take this as evidence he was carrying out his duties very assiduously.' The first vote of his tenure as Chief Whip came as Labour MP Alison McGovern launched a backbench bill to enshrine the plans into law, but they are opposed by the government. In a parliamentary ambush, Labour MPs called both aye and no when asked to agree it to trigger a vote. With most Tory and Lib Dems MPs already heading to lunch after Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour won by 203 votes to 16. The vote is not binding, and the bill stands no chance of becoming law, but losing a vote within hours of taking the job is embarrassing for Mr Gove. Earlier he was mocked in the Commons, as Labour leader Ed Miliband asked Mr Cameron: ‘We have always said we will support the Government when they do the right thing - so can I join thousands of parents across the country in congratulating you on getting rid of the Education Secretary? 'Why did you demote him?’ Mr Cameron hit back: 'Let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved. A record number of academies, new free schools, standards rising across the country, and reforms that will endure. 'But isn’t it extraordinary... on a day of a record increase in the numbers at work in our country, you will do anything not to talk about economic recovery, deficit falling, economy growing, numbers in work rising - and I’m not surprised you don’t want to talk about people in work, your own job looks a bit shaky.' Labour leader Ed Miliband  yesterday mocked Mr Gove, as he sat on the front bench next to William Hague, Nick Clegg and David Cameron during PMQs . Mr Cameron heaped praise on Mr Gove's record on academies, free schools and raising standards . Playing down his surprise shift yesterday, Mr Gove said: ‘Demotion, emotion, promotion, locomotion, I don't know how you would describe this move, though move it is, all I would say is that it's a privilege to serve.’ But his removal as the face of the government’s education reforms came after polls showed he was toxic for teachers – and voters. A new Ipsos/Mori survey yesterday showed just 22 per cent of voters say they like him, half the 44 per cent who like Mr Cameron. A huge 58 per cent said they like Boris Johnson. Mr Gove has previously been tipped as a future Tory leadership candidate but the poll showed just 11 per cent of people think he has what it takes to be a good Prime Minister. Almost a third (32 per cent) backed Mr Johnson as a PM, followed by 30 per cent for Theresa May and 18 per cent who thought George Osborne has what it takes.","Michael Gove was demoted to Chief Whip in Cameron's dramatic reshuffle .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . It's that awkward moment when you are forced to have a meeting with someone who you tried to force out of a job. David Cameron today grimaced his way through his first formal talks with Jean-Claude Juncker after failing to block his appointment as European Commission President. The two men posed for a photograph where Mr Juncker did not even look at the camera, and the pair were later pictured trying - and failing - to high-five each other, which was quickly mocked online. Scroll down for video . Great mates: David Cameron and Jean-Claude Juncker attempt a bizarre high-five at a meeting in Brussels . Mr Cameron's official spokesman said Mr Juncker makes a habit of welcoming people with a high-five . The attempt at public displays of bonhomie were not entirely successful, and did little to disguise the tensions between the two men. Mr Cameron was so bitterly opposed to Mr Juncker taking the top Brussels job that he forced an unprecedented vote on it. Only Hungary joined Mr Cameron in voting against his appointment. Now, the Prime Minister has been forced to pretend the whole thing never happened, and insist he can still work with the former Luxembourg premier. Their face-to-face encounter in Brussels today comes after Mr Cameron made a difficult phone call to congratulate Mr Junker in his success in taking the job he tried to block. 'The Prime Minister congratulated Mr Juncker on running a successful campaign and securing the Council nomination,' Downing Street said in a statement last month issued through gritted teeth. Mr Juncker, a fixture in EU politics for decades and architect of the eurozone, has insisted that descriptions of him as an arch-federalist are overblown. Downing Street played down the significance of the photographs today, insisting Mr Juncker greets lots of people with a high-five. Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said: 'As I understand it, it is how Mr Juncker greets quite a lot of people. 'They know each other quite well, of course, because they sat around the EU table when he was Prime Minister of Luxembourg.' However, the display of mock playfulness became the subject of internet parodies and ridicule online. A parody account named after Mr Juncker posted this message, claiming he tried to 'slap' Mr Cameron . Another Twitter account likened the encounter to a handshake from The Simpsons . He has also stressed he is not in principle opposed to the UK repatriating some powers from Brussels - a key demand of Mr Cameron in the run-up to an in/out referendum mooted for 2017. However, he has said the free movement of labour within the union is not up for grabs, and risked the wrath of Eurosceptics by lavishing praise on one of their hate figures - former commission head Jacques Delors. Mr Cameron's surprise decision to put Lord Hill forward to represent Britain has been branded a 'shambles' after the peer had to sell shares in a lobbying firm to avoid criticism over conflicts of interest. He acted to head off concerns over his significant holding in £140 million global public affairs company Huntsworth, which operates in Brussels. Downing Street released this picture of the pair, with Mr Junker looking away from the camera and Mr Cameron grinning awkwardly . An official picture issued by the European Union of the face-to-face talks suggested the meeting was not particularly cordial, with Mr Cameron sitting with his arms folded . MEPs had warned that they would be looking closely at the interest in deciding whether to confirm his appointment. President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz also suggested that he could be rejected for being too Eurosceptic - although he later backtracked and insisted he would be treated fairly at confirmation hearings. Number 10 pointed out that the European Parliament has the opportunity to approve or reject a new commission 'as a whole, as a slate, not as individuals'. Lord Hill told journalists in Brussels that he would not view himself as a Eurosceptic. 'I'm not a great one for looking for names or badges or boxes,' he said. Lord Hill previously replied 'non, non, non' when asked if he wanted the EU job - but said last night: 'I am not a reluctant conscript. It is true that I loved my time at the House of Lords, which is a fantastic institution, full of wonderful people. 'The fact is, having thought about the importance of this job, the pivotal role that it will play, the crucial time in the history of the European Union and also of Britain, it is a fantastic opportunity to be involved and I would be mad not to do it.' During talks last night, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared to cower as Mr Cameron was talking to Portugal's Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho . EU leaders last night put off decisions on commissioners and portfolios for a few weeks, with an impasse between Germany and Italy being blamed. Each of the 28 member states nominates someone to serve in a post for a four-year term, with Luxembourg's spot already taken up by Mr Juncker. Britain's current commissioner, Baroness Ashton, has a senior role as High Representative, which means that brief will go elsewhere this time round. The summit also failed to agree a president of the European Council to succeed Herman Van Rompuy - a position for which Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, wife of Neil Kinnock's son Stephen, is thought to be in the running.","First meeting between the two men since Cameron tried to block his job .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The average age of new mothers has hit 30 for the first time. Women choosing to delay starting their families until later in life mean the average age when giving birth has risen by four years since the 1970s. Experts said it was a sign of women opting to concentrate on their careers before settling down, while also a sign of ‘how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century’. Last year there were 698,512 births in England and Wales, down by 4.3 per cent since 2012. However, the average age of mothers rose to 30years, compared with 29.8 years in 2012. It is the first time the average age has surpassed the three-decade mark since records began in 1938. The Office for National Statistics said: 'The average age of mothers has been increasing since 1975, with increasing numbers of women delaying childbearing to later ages. 'This may be due to a number of factors such as increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.' Fertility decreased among all age groups last year, but the biggest fall was among women aged under 20 and 20-24, down by 13 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively. The ONS added: ‘In most developed countries women have been increasingly delaying childbearing to later in life, which has resulted in increases in the mean age at first birth and rising fertility rates among older women. ‘Although fertility rates for women aged 40 and over have been rising fast, fertility among women in their forties is still considerably lower than for women in their thirties. Women aged 30-34 currently have the highest fertility of any age group.’ Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: 'The average age of mothers in this country has hit 30 for the first time as many women are deciding to start their families later in life. UK mothers are now on average older than women elsewhere in the world when they have their first baby. 'There may be many reasons for this, including the time it takes to achieve educational and professional development, as well as financial security - and it may also be a reflection of how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century. 'We need to support women's choices to have children at the age that is right for them. We certainly need policies in place that enable women to better combine family and working life, and in particular ensure that younger mothers don't suffer setbacks. 'While pregnancy and birth in older women may present slightly different challenges for healthcare professionals, the answer is not to cajole women into having babies before they are ready but to ensure our family planning and maternity services are set up to cater for the changing needs and choices of women today.' Almost half of all babies (47 per cent) were born outside marriage, up from 41 per cent a decade ago. In 1938, when records began, just 4.2 per cent of babies had parents who had not tied the knot. The percentage of babies born in England and Wales to mothers from outside the UK also reached a record high, hitting 26.5 per cent compared with 25.9 per cent in 2012 and 11.7 per cent when these records were first collected in 1969.","98,512 births in England and Wales, down by 4.3 per cent since 2012 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A magistrate friend of Sir Cyril Smith tried to cover up allegations of sexual abuse against the politician by warning off police investigating the claims, it has emerged. A report written by a senior detective in 1970 revealed the magistrate made 'veiled threats' to officers, telling him he did not feel the issue was 'court worthy'. It found there was 'prima facie' evidence Smith had indecently assaulted youngsters, but it did not go any further. A magistrate friend of Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith said it was not 'court worthy' to prosecute him over allegations of indecent assault . The 14-page report released last night by the Crown Prosecution Service was compiled by a detective superintendent for Lancashire's chief constable William Palfrey. It was written during an investigation into allegations that Sir Cyril had sexually abused eight teenage boys in the 1960s by spanking and touching them, six of them at the privately-run Cambridge House children's care home in Rochdale. The officer, whose name has been concealed in the heavily redacted report, said there was 'prima facie' evidence that Sir Cyril was guilty of indecent assault and that the then Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate would have been 'at the mercy of any competent counsel' if he were prosecuted. But he said a magistrate friend of Sir Cyril had warned officers against proceeding with the inquiry. Three separate files on the issue were later passed to the director of public prosecutions and the Crown Prosecution Service, but on each occasion no prosecution was pursued. The magistrate, whose name was also redacted, told the detective during an interview: 'May I offer a personal opinion. I sincerely hope that this matter is not prosecuted before the court. In my opinion, as a justice of the peace, it is not court worthy. 'The prosecution can do no good at all and the backlash will have unfortunate repercussions for the police force and the town of Rochdale.' He added: 'It is no secret that Cyril and I are buddies and not only politically.' The detective, from the Number 5 District Task Force in Oldham, wrote: 'Those observations were recorded at the time in Detective Chief Inspector (name redacted)'s official duty diary. The veiled threats and innuendos contained therein reflect (name redacted)'s general attitude to this inquiry.' Sir Cyril was interviewed by the officer in February 1970, but refused to answer questions regarding the allegations against him other than through a pre-prepared statement, in which he stated 'most emphatically' that he had not behaved indecently towards the boys. The report suggests that Sir Cyril had a right to carry out medical examinations on them and to administer corporal punishment, and when handing over his statement the politician produced a copy of an agreement, allegedly signed by the young residents, in which they agreed to allow officers of the hostel to exercise 'full parental rights' over them on all matters, including 'medical and general discipline'. Lancashire's chief constable William Palfrey ordered the report to be compiled in 1970 . The detective wrote that Sir Cyril was 'most unimpressive during my interview with him', saying: 'He had difficulty in articulating and even the stock replies he proffered could only be obtained after repeated promptings from his solicitor. 'Were he ever to be placed in a witness box, he would be at the mercy of any competent counsel.' The officer concluded: 'It seems impossible to excuse his conduct. Over a considerable period of time, whilst sheltering beneath a veneer of respectability, he has used his unique position to indulge in a sordid series of indecent episodes with young boys towards whom he had a special responsibility. 'Prima facie, he appears guilty of numerous offences of indecent assault.' In November 2012 Greater Manchester Police said Sir Cyril abused young boys in the 1960s in his role as secretary of the Rochdale Hostel for Boys Association. After that announcement the force began looking at fresh claims of abuse at Knowl View, a council-run residential school for vulnerable boys where Sir Cyril served as a governor and which closed in the mid-1990s, as well as allegations of a cover-up. But it was announced last week that inquiries were being halted to allow for a 'wider investigation' into the alleged corruption. In a recently-published book Rochdale's Labour MP Simon Danczuk claimed Sir Cyril raped a number of young boys at a residential school. Police, spies and politicians helped to hide the historical child abuse carried out by the politician, according to Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith. The 29-stone politician was left free to abuse children as young as eight despite 144 complaints by victims, he and co-author Matthew Baker said. During the 1960s, Sir Cyril - when he was a councillor in the town - acted as a governor for several schools and was active on many council committees involving youth activities. At least 10 people have so far come forward to say they were abused at Knowl View, of whom seven say they suffered at the hands of Sir Cyril. Sir Cyril was elected a Liberal MP in 1972 and became a Liberal Democrat on the formation of the new party before leaving Parliament in 1992. He was knighted in 1988 and died in 2010.","1970 report reveals how magistrate said prosecution was not 'court worthy'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Michael Gove suffered his first Commons defeat as Chief Whip today, as he was revealed to be the least popular senior Tory in the country. David Cameron rallied to the defence of his old friend, after dumping him from his role as Education Secretary in yesterday’s dramatic reshuffle. While teaching unions celebrated Mr Gove’s departure after bitter clashes over his leadership, supporters of his free schools programme have expressed dismay at his demise. Scroll down for video . Michael Gove, arriving in Downing Street today, was shunted from the Department for Education to become Chief Whip . Mr Gove’s sudden departure was one of the big shocks of the reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron promoted several women and Eurosceptics. His demotion to Chief Whip, without a major department to, leaves him outside the Cabinet and taking a £36,000 pay cut. As Chief Whip, Mr Gove is charged with ensuring Tory MPs turn up to vote on legislation. But on his first day in the job, he suffered a defeat over controversial plans for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to audit Labour’s manifesto. Labour MP Alison McGovern has launched a backbench bill to enshrine the plans into law, but they are opposed by the government. In a parliamentary ambush, Labour MPs called both aye and no when asked to agree it to trigger a vote. With most Tory and Lib Dems MPs already heading to lunch after Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour won by 203 votes to 16. The vote is not binding, and the bill stands no chance of becoming law, but losing a vote within hours of taking the job is embarrassing for Mr Gove. Labour leader Ed Miliband mocked Mr Gove, as he sat on the front bench next to William Hague, Nick Clegg and David Cameron during PMQs . Mr Cameron heaped praise on Mr Gove's record on academies, free schools and raising standards . Earlier he was mocked in the Commons, as Labour leader Ed Miliband asked Mr Cameron: ‘We have always said we will support the Government when they do the right thing - so can I join thousands of parents across the country in congratulating you on getting rid of the Education Secretary? 'Why did you demote him?’ Mr Cameron hit back: 'Let me tell you what the former education secretary achieved. A record number of academies, new free schools, standards rising across the country, and reforms that will endure. 'But isn’t it extraordinary... on a day of a record increase in the numbers at work in our country, you will do anything not to talk about economic recovery, deficit falling, economy growing, numbers in work rising - and I’m not surprised you don’t want to talk about people in work, your own job looks a bit shaky.' Playing down his surprise shift yesterday, Mr Gove said: ‘Demotion, emotion, promotion, locomotion, I don't know how you would describe this move, though move it is, all I would say is that it's a privilege to serve.’ But his removal as the face of the government’s education reforms came after polls showed he was toxic for teachers – and voters. A new Ipsos/Mori survey today showed just 22 per cent of voters say they like him, half the 44 per cent who like Mr Cameron. A huge 58 per cent said they like Boris Johnson. Mr Gove has previously been tipped as a future Tory leadership candidate but the poll showed just 11 per cent of people think he has what it takes to be a good Prime Minister. Almost a third (32 per cent) backed Mr Johnson as a PM, followed by 30 per cent for Theresa May and 18 per cent who thought George Osborne has what it takes.","Michael Gove was demoted to Chief Whip in Cameron's dramatic reshuffle .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Positive economic data and signs of compromise in Congress have the International Monetary Fund predicting faster economic growth in the United States next year. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also praised the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement last week that it intends to scale back its massive monetary stimulus. 'Growth is picking up,' Lagarde said. 'And unemployment is going down. So all of that gives us a much stronger outlook for 2014, which brings us to raising our forecast.' Things looking up: IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde announced Sunday that the Washington-based lender will upgrade their economic forecast for the U.S. for the coming year . The IMF forecast in October that the U.S. economy would expand 2.6 percent in 2014 after growing 1.6 percent this year. At the time, Lagarde warned that Congressional failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling could damage not only the United States, but the rest of the global economy. A U.S. Congress, deeply divided along party lines, did manage to pass a limited, two-year budget deal last week to trim some planned spending cuts and reduce the risk of a government shutdown. Yet the legislation does nothing to avoid a possible U.S. debt default that could occur if Congress does not raise a cap on U.S. borrowing. President Barack Obama's administration has warned that the government could run out of borrowing authority needed to pay its bills as soon as February if lawmakers do not swiftly raise the debt ceiling. Success?The IMF's decision was based in part on the U.S. Federal reserve's decision to trim its aggressive bond-buying program on Wednesday but sought to temper the long-awaited move by suggesting its key interest rate would stay lower for even longer than previously promised . 'The budget deal that was cut at year-end is a very good sign of...responsibility, accountability and realism,' Lagarde said on Sunday's Meet the Press. 'I certainly hope that in February, Congress will be equally responsible and will not threaten the recovery with yet another debate about whether or not the U.S. honor or default.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A team of researchers has discovered evidence that an planet may be forming quite far from its star -  and much further than has been seen before. Astronomers using NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope say they have discovered evidence of a planet forming 7.5 billion miles away from its host star - about twice the distance Pluto is from our Sun. Planet formation far away from a small parent star goes against conventional planet-making wisdom. Somewhere out there: An image of TW Hydrae and the planet-making stuff surrounding the star. Astronomers believe a planet is forming within the gas and dust and sweeping up debris, as shown by the gap in this picture . In a galaxy far, far away: The new findings could reveal a little bit more about planets in far off galaxies . Usually, planets form over tens of millions of years from the slow gathering of dust, rocks, and gas but it normally happens closer to a central star, like our sun. Planets begin to form when a cloud of debris and gas swirl around a star. Gradually the bits and pieces start colliding, sticking together and growing bigger into small rocks, bigger ones and eventually, planets or gas giant planet cores. The planet lies inside a dusty, gaseous disk around a small red dwarf TW Hydrae, which is only about 55 percent of the mass of the Sun. The discovery adds to the ever-increasing variety of planetary systems in the Milky Way. Breaking the norm: Usually planets form when they're close to a mother star, but on this occasion a planet that is twice as far as Pluto is from our sun is beginning to form . Planets are thought to form over tens of millions of years. A planet 7.5 billion miles from its star should take more than 200 times longer to form than Jupiter did, which is at a distance of 500 million from the sun. However, what complicates the story more is the fact that TW Hydrae is just 8 million years old and is only 55 percent as massive as our sun. This dusty protoplanetary disk is the closest one to us, some 176 light-years away in the constellation Hydra. Hubble was observing the area to understand not only whether planets have formed, but also what conditions can result in planet formation and what chemical constituents are available for new planets. Out of this world: We're learning a little bit more about alien worlds and how they're created. Scientists have discovered evidence that an extrasolar planet may be forming quite far from its star . Lead author of the study, John Debes of the Space Science Telescope Institute remarked, 'Typically, you need pebbles before you can form a planet. So, if there is a planet in the gap and there is no dust larger than a grain of sand farther out, we have provided a challenge for traditional planet formation models.' Coauthor Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution and principal investigator of the observations said it is surprising to find a planet only five to 10 percent of Jupiter’s mass forming so far out since planets should form faster closer in. She said it is difficult to make a low-mass planet far away from a low mass star. 'If the mass of this suspected planet is as low as it seems to be, this presents a real puzzle. Theory would say that it cannot exist,' said Carnegie astrophysicist Alan Boss. The research is published in the Astrophysical Journal.","New planet being formed twice as far as Pluto is from our Sun .

"By . Daniel Miller . A fossil hunter found himself caught between a rock and one very hard face after discovering this mysterious carving glowering out from a boulder that had fallen from the top of a cliff and landed on a Scottish beach. Phil McInroy, from Dundee, found the creepy-looking carving on the side of the rock while searching for fossils close to St Andrews East Sands beach. The 31-year-old immediately contacted Fife Council and their archaeologist Douglas Spiers confirmed there was no record of the carving. Rock face: A fossil hunter discovered this mysterious carving on a boulder that had fallen from a cliff onto a Scottish beach . Mr McInroy said that he only spotted the face in the rock after noticing it in a photo he had taken. He explained: 'I was just walking along the beach getting photos looking towards St Andrews. 'I was having a look at one of the photos and saw what looked like a face in the rock, I thought I was maybe seeing things. 'Initially . I thought it was a formation in the rock, maybe something natural, but . when I looked closer I realised it was man made. 'I was looking closely at the rock and suddenly realised I could see a face staring back at me. It's lifesize and quite abstract but covered in lichen and moss, so it blends in with the other rocks. 'I wanted more information so got in contact with the council. They sent someone out to look at it as they had no record. 'I was really surprised when I found it, it is not something you would obviously see unless you're looking for it. 'It has now been added to the Fife Sites and Monuments record. It is not the sort of thing you find everyday, maybe I'll be the next Indiana Jones.' Curiously, this is the second . carved face reported to the Archaeological Unit in the last year. The . other was at the foreshore at Kinghorn and also considered to be . relatively modern. Fife Council's archaeologist Mr Spiers . believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years, but said . it was a feature of interest and beauty. Peek-a-boo: The mysterious carving was covered in lichen and moss so it blends in with the surrounding rock . Douglas Spiers, Fife Council's resident archaeologist, believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years but said it was a feature of interest and beauty . Mr McInroy said that rock in the area was a soft red sandstone which can erode rapidly when exposed, giving a false impression of antiquity. He said: 'I can only suggest this was a rock that possibly already had some features which suggested a human face to persons unknown, who then enhanced them by some rudimentary carving of the soft stone. 'The face is actually carved on a large detached boulder that has fallen from the cliffs bordering the foreshore. 'Cliff . falls are a reasonably frequent occurrence along this part of the St . Andrews coast, indeed, only a little further along from the carving is . another cliff fall that occurred only a few months ago. 'The . fact that the face is in its correct attitude would almost certainly . preclude the carving having been on the rock prior to it having tumbled . to the shore and, therefore, it must have been carved in sit since that . event.' 'My feeling is this is the work of a modern artist who saw an opportunity and just started carving.' Mr McInroy has also investigated another case in recent years on the Isle of May, where it turned out to have been carved by an archaeologist in his spare time while he was working on the island in the 1903, and the discovery of a 'Pictish' carving on a rockface at Falkland, which was actually the skilful work of a modern artist.","Creepy carving discovered on rock near St Andrews East Sands beach .

Aides to the president admitted Sunday that peak traffic volumes could make the site crash. While saying HealthCare.gov had improved, .

Could crash: Jeffrey Zients, standing here next to President Obama, admits that peak traffic volumes during the coming weeks could overwhelm the site as consumers scramble to sign up before a December 23 deadline . Networks of volunteer organizations are expected to resume enrollment activities after a long U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, many of them with backlogs of would-be applicants waiting for access. Enroll America, the nonprofit group that serves as a flagship for private sector enrollment efforts under Obama's landmark healthcare law, said it planned to launch a new 'Coverage is Coming' push, with more than 1,000 events over the next three weeks ranging from commemorations of World AIDS Day to community health summits and holiday toy drives, according to Enroll America spokesman Justin Nisly. AIDS Alabama, a statewide non-profit organization that received a federal grant to help people enroll, had been relying largely on paper applications to sign people up until last week, when they noticed major improvement in the website, said Lauren Banks, the organization's director of policy and advocacy. One glitch the organization came across last week involved apparently incorrect information about tax subsidies, Banks said. For example, she said, people who appeared to be eligible for subsidies given their income levels were told they did not qualify. On time: Healthcare officials said Sunday that they made the self-imposed deadline to make the Obamacare website usable for 50,000 applicants at one time . Banks said the organization planned a . radio campaign as part of a push to get people enrolled by December 23 . so they could have coverage starting next year. 'We really are going to push super-hard the next 23 days to get people enrolled for the January 1st deadline,' Banks said. The . White House, which plans to hold public education events about the . healthcare law throughout December, will hold a Youth Summit on . Wednesday to help drive outreach and enrollment over the remaining . four-month enrollment period. The . number who need coverage starting January 1 could include millions of . uninsured Americans with preexisting health conditions and others who . have been notified that their current health plans will expire at . year-end because they do not meet Obamacare's standards for benefits and . consumer protection. Good news: According to the eight-page report released this morning, the website has made 'dramatic progress' in 'doubling' site capacity . Zients . said on Sunday a five-week emergency 'tech surge' had doubled the . capacity of the online health insurance portal that is crucial to . helping people shop for insurance plans, while making it more responsive . and less prone to errors. The . administration said the effort's key improvement was to increase . HealthCare.gov's capacity to 50,000 simultaneous users, which would . allow the site to handle a minimum of 800,000 users per day. Officials . acknowledged however that the site may not operate smoothly for some . visitors even when the capacity has not been exceeded, and said they . were still scrambling to repair and install functions at the crucial . 'back end' of the system that are needed to finalize enrollments with . insurers. 'The real challenges remain, and that's downstream,' said Rick Howard, research director for the technology consultant Gartner. 'The . real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate . the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is.' Not over yet: The real error rate will be in the billing transactions and how accurate the billing information is and how accurate the premium calculation is, say researchers . Craig . Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg . School of Management, said Sunday's announcement represented 'dramatic . progress', but that the fixes mainly brought the website to 'the . baseline of what we need the site to be able to do'. Officials . are working to correct errors in the consumer enrollment data sent to . insurers and have not built in several necessary functions, including . one that will enable the government to pay federal subsidies to insurers . on behalf of low-income enrollees. Without . those functions working properly, HealthCare.gov and websites for 14 . state-run marketplaces could have difficulty operating in 2014. Even so, officials said, the site is dramatically better than when it was launched on October 1. Necessary: Officials are working to correct errors in the consumer enrollment data sent to insurers and have not built in several necessary functions. Without them, the site could have difficulty operating in 2014 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . E-cigarettes should be banned in public places because they 'normalise' smoking, a leading doctor has said. Surgeon Ram Moorthy urged so-called 'vaping' to be banned in the same places that smoking is prohibited. Mr Moorthy, deputy chair of the British Medical Association board of science, is due to present a motion to the union’s annual representative meeting calling for the restriction. 'E-cigarettes could be a portal into nicotine addiction and we should look to ban them in public places,' he said. E-cigarettes 'normalise' smoking and should be banned in public places, surgeon Ram Moorthy of the British Medical Association board of science has said . Should E-cigarettes be banned in public? 'The concern is that we know among adolescents there is a huge awareness of e-cigarettes and we know that from cigarette smoking that smokers pick it up before the age of 18. 'E-cigarettes are currently being marketed through celebrity endorsement and we have seen the raft of flavours that are out there. 'On one hand they say these are very much for smokers, but your traditional 40-year-old male smoker is not going to go out and buy a pink candy flavoured e-cigarette. 'The flavours are very much geared at younger users. 'We have had a huge culture shift in the social acceptability of smoking since the ban in public places. 'The difficulty with e-cigarettes is the majority of devices mimic cigarettes and therefore it potentially normalises smoking.' Recent research suggested as many as 30million people across Europe have tried e-cigarettes. And a separate study found that by January this year, there were 466 brands of e-cigarettes available online through English language websites. The researchers also found 7,764 'unique flavours' on these sites. Mr Moorthy said the range of flavours electronic cigarettes are now available in, means they are geared up to a younger audience . Meanwhile, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has recognised e-cigarettes as an effective alternative to cigarettes, while calling for regulation of the products. The professional body said: 'The RCP recognises that electronic cigarettes and other novel nicotine devices can provide an effective, affordable and readily available retail alternative to conventional cigarettes. 'These innovations could make harm reduction a reality for smokers. 'The RCP also recognises that these new products present potential risks as well as opportunities for individual and population health, and therefore advocates proportionate regulation to maximise the overall public health benefit.' Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: 'Although there are concerns that e-cigarettes might lead people into smoking, research has found only 1 per cent of never-smokers have ever tried e-cigarettes. 'While e-cigarette use in England is rising, encouragingly smoking rates continue to fall. 'Balanced and effective regulation of e-cigarettes as medicines can manage the risks and maximise the potential for these products to replace smoking.'","Surgeon Ram Moorthy due to present a motion to the British Medical Association annual meeting calling for restrictions on use in public .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Chantell Miller's newborn baby girl Ka'Leah died after doctors mistakenly inserted a feeding tube into her heart. Her twin brother Kaleem, pictured with his mother, is now two . A premature baby girl died after doctors mistakenly inserted a feeding tube into her heart, causing her to suffer a heart attack. Chanell Miller, 31, gave birth to twins, a girl and a boy, at 28 weeks into her pregnancy. The newborns were transferred to Newham University Hospital's neonatal unit, where they were being cared for by specialist teams. But nine days after their birth, Miss Miller, from East London, was told her little girl had stopped breathing and died. A post-mortem examination revealed the newborn, named Ka'Leah Noel, died when doctors incorrectly pierced her heart with a long line feeding tube. Ka'Leah's twin brother, Kaleem Noel, survived and is now two-years-old. An inquest earlier this month determined the feeding tube was wrongly inserted into the newborn's heart. Bart's Health Trust who run the hospital, have since said that they have compiled a comprehensive action plan to improve training given to neonatal staff on the correct insertion of long lines, in a bid to avoid a similar tragedy. Miss Miller said: 'I appreciate that lessons have been learned by the hospital, I hope this never happens again - no mother should go through what I went through. 'I have to deal with the fact that if it wasn't for a simple oversight, Ka'Leah would be with us now. 'Nothing will ever bring back my only baby daughter - her death will be with me for life.' While pregnant, Miss Miller, who has five sons, was delighted to find out that she was to give birth to her first daughter. But just 28 weeks into her pregnancy Miss Miller was rushed to hospital after suddenly going into labour. Medics found her son was in the breech position, while her daughter was facing backwards, and rushed Miss Miller into the operating theatre to undergo an emergency Caesarean section. Four hours later on May 7, 2012, both babies were born - but it was not until three days later that Miss Miller was able to see the twins. Ka'Leah was the smaller of the two, weighing less than a kilogram. They were both incubated and fed by a long line - a tube used to feed babies that do not yet have working intestines. The twins, who were born at 28 weeks, were rushed to a specialist neonatal unit at Newham University in London where medics were caring for them. Pictured is Kaleem as a newborn . When her twins were nine days old Miss Miller was summoned to the neonatal ward from her hospital bed to be told her daughter had passed away. Pictured is Ka'Leah's scan and hand and foot prints . 'They were little fighters,' said Miss Miller. 'Both were breathing on their own and doctors were positive they'd pull through.' Nine . days after the twins' traumatic birth Miss Miller, who was still . staying in the hospital for treatment for an infection caused by the . emergency Caesarean, was called to the neonatal ward. Miss Miller said: 'I was nodding off in my hospital bed when a nurse told me I needed to get myself to their ward fast. 'When I got there, I found medics frantically working on Ka'Leah. A short while later, a doctor delivered the devastating bombshell - my daughter had stopped breathing and died. I went numb.' A spokeswoman for Bart's Health . Trust, which runs Newham University Hospital, said: 'Bart's Health NHS . Trust are extremely sorry for the distress caused to the family as a . result of the failings in care provided to Ka'Leah. 'We have apologised in writing to Miss Miller and extended our deepest sympathies on her very sad loss. 'The . clinicians involved in Ka'Leah's care were in early contact with the . coroner following her death and have co-operated at every stage with . ongoing inquest proceedings. 'A full internal investigation into Ka'Leah's death was commissioned as soon as the post mortem results were available. 'As . a result of this we have implemented a comprehensive action plan, . including producing clear guidance on the safe insertion of long lines . and improving the training of staff to ensure their correct . positioning.' Miss Miller demanded a post-mortem after she received conflicting reports about the cause of her daughter's death. She . said: 'My mum arrived at the hospital to support me but was astonished . when a doctor explained that her granddaughter had suffered a heart . attack. 'I'd been told Ka'Leah had stopped breathing, it didn't stack up. 'Desperate for answers, we pushed for a post mortem which revealed a doctor had pierced Ka'Leah's heart cavity with the long line.' An inquest two weeks ago determined that the line was incorrectly inserted into Ka'Leah by a doctor in his first year of speciality training. The misplaced line caused cardiac tamponade, a rare condition where fluid builds up around the heart. It was found that this, coupled with Ka'Leah's prematurity, caused her death. At the inquest at Walthamstow Coroner's Court on June 11, coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe recorded a narrative verdict saying she had no doubt that the line was incorrectly positioned. Miss Miller said: 'The inquest showed that no senior doctor had picked up on the mistake for over five days. 'Negligence had cost me my only little girl. 'The hospital have since apologised but as far as I'm concerned it isn't enough. 'I'm so lucky to have Kaleem but some days he looks so much like his twin sister it breaks my heart. 'Even now, two years on, I'm terrified to let him sleep in case he doesn't wake up. 'I am pleased the hospital are trying to stop this from ever happening again but I'm not happy that nobody has been punished for their mistakes. 'Following the inquest this month, I have decided that I need some time to grieve before possibly taking further action.'","Chantell Miller gave birth to her twins - a boy and a girl - in May 2012 .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A teenage girl was diagnosed with leukaemia when doctors revealed the crippling stomach pains she had blamed on a dodgy Chinese was in fact blood cancer. Brooke Evans suspected she was suffering a food intolerance or an allergy when experiencing excruciating pain after a takeaway. When her parents rushed the 18-year-old to hospital in August last year, doctors revealed her symptoms were a sign of something more ominous - a rare form of cancer, lymphoblastic leukaemia. She was immediately put on to a . pioneering drugs trial funded by the charity Cure Leukaemia, which . included rounds of chemotherapy and more than three months in hospital. Scroll down for video . Brooke Evans thought she was suffering a food intolerance or an allergy when she experienced crippling stomach pains after eating a Chinese takeaway last August. But after being rushed to hospital by her parents, the 18-year-old was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer - lymphoblastic leukaemia . And today 18-year-old, from Redditch, has been told by doctors treating her, that her cancer is in remission. In August last year Brooke was a healthy teenager, visiting the gym five times a week and enjoying her second year of sixth form. It was only when she had spicy food, first a Chinese, then an Indian meal, and later a homemade chile con carne, that she suffered severe stomach pains and her parents rushed her to hospital. After another visit to hospital at the end of September doctors searching for an explanation ran tests and finally diagnosed her with leukaemia. She then faced six months of intensive chemotherapy and will continue to have low doses of the treatment for two years. Brooke said: 'It’s crazy that it’s the takeaways that that led to my diagnosis. 'I only got sick when I ate spicy food and a Chinese takeaway put me in A&E. 'It’s lucky really because it’s not my kind of thing - I rarely eat spicy food and it was just special occasions: a meal with my friend and my dad’s birthday. 'It was just because everyone else was eating one - I prefer pizza really. 'The pain was horrific but it went away after some strong painkillers. Doctors immediately put Brooke, pictured top right with her family, on a pioneering drugs trial which involved rounds of chemotherapy and has now been told she is in remission . Leukaemia is a blood cancer. The disease affects the white blood cells, which are an important part of our immune system, helping the body fight infection. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is one of the four main types of leukaemia. Anyone can develop leukaemia at any age.While it is more common in adults, leukaemia is the most common form of childhood cancer, with most children diagnosed under the age of five. Symptoms include: . Source: Cure Leukaemia . 'Because my back was aching as well . they thought it might be sciatica, or that it was something like . irritable bowel syndrome which is why I started keeping a food diary. 'I do feel much better now but there are still things that restrict me - most mornings I wake up feeling sick. 'And . although I feel unlucky that I’ve had it, I don’t wish I hadn’t had it. It’s made me the person that I am and as family we’ve all helped each . other to cope.' Having just . been declared in remission, Brooke is now desperate to raise awareness . of the disease and the charity that funded the trial that saved her . life. Brooke’s father Simon, 49, said: 'If it hadn’t been for the trips to hospital after the takeaways and the Cure Leukaemia drugs trial we don’t know if Brooke would be here now. 'She was perfectly healthy and there were no other signs that anything was wrong. 'She wasn’t even a regular takeaway fan. The doctors told her to keep a food diary and we all thought it was food-related. 'But then when we came in for the last time they said she had been in too many times and they needed to do some tests. 'The next day I got a call while I was at work with Brooke in tears and my wife Mel trying to explain. 'It was absolutely devastating. You just feel like someone has just driven over you. 'As a parent it’s heart-breaking to know that your daughter is in pain but she has been so brave. 'She would get to the middle of the night after eating some foods and be in agony, rolling around in bed. 'Now we just want to help other people with the same disease. 'We were like rabbits in the headlights when she was first diagnosed and Cure Leukaemia’s nurses helped us through everything. 'If people donate money to Cure Leukaemia they can continue with the trial and help more people with the same type of cancer.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A stunned couple whose first child was born though a pioneering IVF technique are expecting their second baby after conceiving naturally. Gemma and Simon Potter tried in vain to start a family for four years before becoming the first parents in the UK to have a child using a new IVF procedure. But two years after the arrival of daughter Isabella, the couple were shocked to discover Mrs Potter was pregnant again - after a natural conception. The new addition to the Potter family is due on Boxing Day. Scroll down for video . Simon and Gemma Potter are expecting their second child this December after conceiving naturally, two years after their daughter Isabella was born via IVF . The couple said they were shocked when they discovered the 29-year-old was pregnant. Mrs Potter said: 'I couldn't believe it when it read positive. I screamed ""two pink lines"" at Simon, and then I didn't speak for about 20 minutes out of shock.' Mrs Potter, pictured with her daughter Isabella at three months pregnant left, and when Isabella was a newborn, right, is due to give birth to her second child on Boxing Day . Mrs Potter, 29, said: 'We both really wanted children and it was the natural thing for us after getting married and buying a house together . 'It was really hard when we found out we couldn’t have children. All I heard the doctor say was ""impossible"" and I zoned out from the reasons why. Fertility . expert Dr Geetha Venkat said in her career which has spanned 20 years, . she has heard of couple's concieving naturally following IVF. She . said there are two different circumstances when it can happen. The . first is in instances with couples like the Potters, who have conceived . through IVF and go on to have a second baby naturally. And the second is when couples' IVF fails, yet they fall pregnant naturally later. Dr . Venkat, of Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'I don't know the . specific explanation for his, but I have a feeling that because of the . hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy, somehow it makes the . ovaries, eggs and function of the reproductive system better, leaving . couples able to concieve naturally. 'It is as though the ovaries are stimulated as a result of the pregnancy. 'I . have seen a few cases in each instance, where a couple already has a . child through IVF, as well as the more rare occurrence, when a couple's . IVF has failed.' 'I’d peed on so many sticks and every month I’d get hopeful. I’d think of dresses and pick out dresses in my head, but every time the result was the same.' The couple, from Wigan in Lancashire, decided to try and conceive using in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - a process where an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body. But they were chosen for an NHS trial into a new form of IVF using an incubator with in-built microscopes, meaning a fertilised embryo would remain undisturbed during the crucial conception. Mrs Potter underwent the pioneering procedure at Care in Manchester. Previously, an embryo would have been removed from the incubator several times for doctors to examine it under a microscope, creating risks that may have caused the IVF to be unsuccessful. But the new technique uses a time-lapse system that allows embryologists to see how the embryo develops so the best one is used to bring on conception. The couple were given the time-lapse video to watch the six-day artificial conception unfold in just a matter of seconds. 'It was awesome to look at and a really special way of marking the pregnancy,' said Mrs Potter, who owns her own cake business. 'People can usually see their baby develop through scan pictures but not from as early on as this. 'It’s amazing to watch it and think how did that turn into my little girl who’s now running around like a maniac.' But . two years after the birth of her first child Isabella, Mrs Potter was . baffled to learn she was pregnant for the second time after conceiving . naturally. The couple's daughter Isabella, pictured left and right, was born after Mrs Potter was given a radical new form of IVF, having been told by doctors it was 'impossible' for her to conceive naturally . She said: 'Everything started tasting of mushrooms, which is what happened when I fell pregnant with Isabella. 'I didn’t believe for one minute that I might be pregnant but I was late as well so I bought a test. 'I couldn’t believe it when it read positive. I screamed ‘two pink lines’ at Simon, and then I didn’t speak for about 20 minutes out of shock.' The family are hoping to raise awareness of the pioneering treatment for other couples who are struggling to get pregnant. Mr Potter, 35, an expert software engineer, said: 'It was so surreal for us. 'Our aim is to raise awareness and help some other families in the future. 'We see it as a way of paying back for what we received from the IVF treatment.'","Gemma and Simon Potter spent four years trying for a baby to no avail .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A man's scalp was stretched to the size of a grapefruit using an inflated balloon to cover a bald patch left when surgeons removed a tumour and 23cm of skin. Surgeons used the groundbreaking procedure to stretch Chris Stoyanov's skin over his scalp after 17 years of operations to try and remove the tumour tissue. A special bag was inserted underneath Mr Stoyanov's skin and doctors gradually filled it with fluid until it reached the size of a grapefruit. The 30-year-old from Worthing in Surrey had to live with the large growth of six months, taking great care to ensure it did not burst. Surgeons stretched Chris Stoyanov's scalp using an inflated balloon beneath the skin (left). The groundbreaking procedure allowed doctors to cover a patch of baldness left following surgery to remove a tumour. Today, the 30-year-old has a full head of hair after the successful procedure (right) The builder said it had been difficult, especially when it came to sleeping. But the procedure, performed by plastic surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick was a success, and the skin on the back of Mr Stoyanov's head stretched enough to cover his entire scalp, meaning he no longer has the bald patch. Mr Stoyanov said: 'It was very uncomfortable and as it got bigger I had to be more and more careful that it didn’t burst. 'It was a difficult six months but I managed to take things very slowly and carefully and it’s proved a huge success.' The procedure was performed after Mr Stoyanov endured 17 years of operations to remove a tumour. When he was 13 a fatty cyst appeared on the crown of his head. Despite numerous operations in Bulgaria, doctors were unable to remove it completely. Mr Stoyanov said: 'After a few years, it just grew back again. I went back and forth from hospital. 'Surgeons would keep removing the tumour and the skin around it. They had to use skin grafts from my legs to cover the patches and my hair never grew back so I spent nearly seven years in baseball caps.' For 17 years Mr Stoyanov had numerous operations to remove a tumour which began to grow on his scalp when he was 13 years old. After moving to the UK surgeons removed the final tumour tissue, but had to remove 23cm of the 30-year-old's scalp in the process. It left him with a huge bald patch, pictured . Doctors gradually inflated the balloon in Mr Stoyanov's head over six months (left). Plastic surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick was then able to stretch the expanded scalp to cover the bald patch, creating a new hairline (right) Mr Stoyanov finally gave up on treatment in Bulgaria and moved to the UK in 2009. Two years later he consulted his local GP who referred him to specialists in London. Alarmingly, he was told that if the tumour was left to grow untreated it could eventually pierce his skull and prove life threatening. Mr Stoyanov said: 'I had never thought it could be so dangerous and it was quite a shock when I was told what could happen if I just left the tumour to grow. I knew something had to be done.' Surgeons discovered that previous operations had failed to remove all the tumour tissue, leaving it to grow back. Mr Stoyanov pictured following the surgery to create his new hairline . In order to remove all the tissue, . doctors had to remove 23cm of skin from Mr Stoyanov's head, replacing it . with a skin graft from his thigh. But while removing the tumour, it left Mr Stoyanov with a huge bald patch and the prospect of the hair never growing back. But a year later, surgeon Mr Kirkpatrick came up with an innovative solution to his problem. Mr Kirkpatrick said: 'Tissue expansion is a well established technique in plastic surgery but it is very rare to use it on such a large defect of the scalp. 'It was most important to restore all Chris’s missing hair to his previous hairline which effectively meant making half a head of hair makeup a full head of hair. 'Placing the expander in the correct position and inflating it enough so that the scalp would move to the right position without bad scars or wasting any hair took careful planning. 'I know that it was a pretty tough six months for Chris but it is great to see his self confidence as restored as his hairline.' The balloon was gradually filled with 950ml of liquid through a tube inserted over Mr Stoyanov’s right ear. He said: 'I had to be really careful that I never hit my head so I certainly wasn’t allowed to work on any building sites because it was too risky. 'As the lump got bigger I tried to hide it with hats - which was a bit difficult because it was the middle of summer and it was boiling hot.' After six months the skin was stretched from the back of Mr Stoyanov’s head and stapled in to place. His hair started to grow back after just over a month and today Mr Stoyanov has a full head of hair. The procedure means that he will never go bald - because the hair that is growing comes from the back of his head, an area that isn’t affected by hair loss. Mr Stoyanov said: 'I had begun to think that I would be in and out of hospital forever and that I would have to buy an endless supply of baseball caps to hide my scalp from everyone. 'But this has really changed my life. It really is unbelievable and I’m so grateful.'","Chris Stoyanov endured 17 years of operations to try and remove a tumour .

A Missouri woman is now facing a murder charge after having previously been charged with abandonment of a corpse following the discovery of the remains of a baby boy in a cave in Missouri. Latasha Wilson, 19, admitted to police that she gave birth to a baby boy on or around January 29 but that she and another man, Zakary Carter, 20, discovered that the baby was deceased a short time after. The pair dumped the body in a cave without seeking medical attention for the baby. Later, Carter allegedly returned and tried to burn the body. Drowning death: Police say Latasha Wilson gave birth in a toilet and left her baby to drown in the water before dumping his body in a cave . Grim discovery: The baby's badly decomposed and burnt body was found in a cave in Pertle Springs . Wilson had been charged with abandonment of a corpse, but following an autopsy, the medical examiner found the baby was born alive and that he drew breath before he died. Prosecutors say the baby was born alive in a toilet and that Wilson waited too long to remove him from the water, reports Fox 4. Tampering: Prosecutors say Zakary Carter and Latasha Wilson dumped Wilson's baby boy's body in a cave, and that Carter later returned and set the body alight to try and destroy the evidence . He ultimately drowned. 'There was a lot of degradation done, decomposition of the body. He was set on fire. A lot of different body parts had to be sent off for analysis,' Johnson County, prosecutor Lynn Stoppy told Fox 4. 'He was born alive, and but for the actions or potentially inactions of this woman, he would be alive today,' she said. The baby boy's body was discovered on March 4 by two biology students from the University of Central Missouri, where Wilson is also a student, doing work at Pertle Springs, a recreational area owned by the university. According to court documents, Wilson admitted to giving birth to the baby boy in the bathroom at Walmart, her place of employment. She stayed there for about three hours before wrapping him in paper towels and carrying him out of the bathroom and placing him inside her locker. She said that both she and Carter had realized the baby was dead after he was born, and they then took his body to the cave and left it there. It is unknown who the baby's father was, but Fox 4 reports the baby was Caucasian. Shocked community: Latasha Wilson was a student at the University of Central Missouri, which owns the land on which she allegedly dumped her dead son's body . Carter later returned and tried to burn the body in an attempt to destroy the evidence, say prosecutors. He has been charged with tampering with physical evidence. It is unclear if he will face further charges relating to the infant's death.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Vivien Reynolds has less than two years to live after being diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer three years after being told her smear test was clear . A 45-year-old woman is today dying of terminal cervical cancer three years after doctors reassured her a routine smear test was clear. Vivien Reynolds says she has been handed a death sentence as the hospital responsible admitted they had made a fatal mistake in reading the test results. Ms Reynolds, from Widnes in Cheshire, has been told by doctors she could have as little as two years left to live. Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust has admitted full liability for the error, but say no incompetence on the part of staff was involved. They are expected to make a financial settlement with Ms Reynolds, but she said no amount will ever be enough. 'I've been sentenced to death,' she said. Her smear test was carried out at her local GP surgery but reviewed by staff at Warrington Hospital in 2008. Ms Reynolds, an administrator at a haulage company, said: 'This has left me totally devastated. It's changed my life. 'You think you’re going to live forever and it’s taken away from you and It’s really hard to accept and come to terms with. 'When I was told I had cervical cancer it felt like I was on a bungee string and it wasn’t reality. It makes it harder to accept because there was an error. 'You put your trust in the system to do a smear to have it correctly read and to be told it wasn’t, it’s hard, and I want them to change how little time they spend looking at slides. 'It wasn’t just one person that looked at my slide it was two people, and if both of them misread it, there’s obviously some kind of error in how it has been dealt with and it needs to be reviewed and changes made.' Ms Reynolds, who has a long-term partner but no children, feels her future has been snatched away. She said: 'Money will never be enough because this is my life. 'Had I been murdered by somebody they would be doing time with a possibility of a life sentence and I’m not going to get that and I haven’t done anything wrong.' The trust says its systems are robust and that the staff involved are fully trained, adding that smear tests are not diagnostic tests and are not 100 per cent effective. A report of the internal investigation states: 'Guidelines were followed. False negative results are inevitable in screening even in the best laboratories.' It says human error was a factor in the case, saying the 'abnormal cells were in clumps and difficult to interpret'. The trust admitted liability but say no incompetence was involved. Vivien Reynolds, pictured before her cancer diagnosis, was told by doctors in 2008 that the results of her smear test were clear. Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust have admitted liability for an error in reading the results, but said no incompetence was involved . The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31. Ms Reynolds’s lawyers at JMW . Solicitors in Manchester said abnormalities that signalled she was at . severe risk of developing the deadly disease were missed on a cervical . smear test carried out in 2008. Beth . Reay, Ms Reynolds’s medical negligence solicitor at JMW, said: 'Once . someone is diagnosed with cervical cancer the NHS does a review of their . case to see if anything could have been picked up earlier. 'Three separate screeners then looked at Vivien’s test and all three of them spotted the pre-cancerous cells. 'We have had our own independent expert review on Vivien’s case which revealed that if she had been diagnosed in 2008 she wouldn’t have needed chemotherapy, could have been treated with a routine procedure and would have made a complete recovery.' The solicitor explained that a smear test slide is checked twice. The first check takes about eight minutes and any abnormalities should be picked up then. Any that are reported as clear are sent for a rapid review – a safeguard that is supposed to ensure any signs of cancer that were missed first time around are detected. But she said as the second check only takes a minute there is greater room for error. 'As a safeguard to pick up on signs that were missed first time it’s inadequate,' she said. Mel Pickup, chief executive at Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'We are desperately sorry to hear about Mrs Reynolds’s illness. 'We fully investigated the circumstances of Mrs Reynolds smear test report from 2008, and found that her screening test did not identify a problem that might have then been treated earlier. 'We have accepted full liability for this and apologised. 'When we investigated the smear report, we also checked all the training, practice and standards of our screeners, and found it to be all correct. 'The screeners who provide the programme are trained to the highest standard. Their work is continually quality assessed on a routine basis, and external quality assurance visits are in place to check those standards. 'Screening reduces the chance of cervical cancer by about 75 per cent, but no screening programme can be 100 per cent effective. 'National and regional quality experts advise that false negative tests do occur, and cannot be completely avoided. 'It is really important that women go for their cervical smear test when invited – more than half of all cervical cancers occur in women who are eligible for screening, but don’t attend.'","Vivien Reynolds went for a routine smear test at her GP surgery in 2008 .

She set up a Facebook page, called Hoy Dono Vida (Today I Donate Life) to raise awareness about bone marrow donations. Gaynor had lost contact with her father almost decades earlier after her parents' divorce. Through a Facebook search, Gaynor found her father, whow as living in Cordoba, a city about 400 miles west of Buenos Aires. New hope: Gaynor's half-brother has just been tested and her father will be tested early June to see if their bone marrow is compatible . She was also reunited with her half-brother, whom she hadn't seen since he was a baby and who was living in the same city as her. Her half-brother has already had a blood analysis test to see if his bone marrow is compatible. 'My dad is coming on June 4 to have it done also,' Gaynor told EFE.

"By . Alex Greig . The mystery over a honeymoon couple presumed dead in a boating accident 60 years ago has been reignited - after a witness said they never even boarded the vessel thought to have claimed their lives. Thomas and Dorothy have long been presumed to have died in a notorious boat accident on Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, in 1954. But an investigator has now raised the possibility that the boating accident was cover for the couple to vanish and begin a new life. Six people were confirmed dead in the Missouri lake's worst ever accident - and officials added the Faheys to the death toll after they went missing the same day. The couple had expressed an interest in boarding the doomed boat named Grand Galize but doubt remains over whether they were in fact aboard. Honeymoon tragedy: Thomas and Dorothy Fahey were believed to have drowned in a boating accident, but their bodies were never found and the were not documented passengers on the boat . Now the Coast Guard pilot in charge of the vessel on that fateful day says he is certain they never boarded the boat . 'We are very, very certain they were not on the Grand Glaize,' Captain Charlie Meyer, a United States Coast Guard licensed boat pilot and afficionado of the Grand Glaize mystery told KOMU. 'We're not even sure they drowned.' Confirmed dead at the time were Letha Rockwell, 50, and daughter, Rosalyn Ruth Rockwell, 16, of Belle Plaine, Iowa; Mrs Richard Lamberty and her two-year-old son, Warren of Fremont, Nebraska; Duaine Hodges, 19, of Missouri Valley, Iowa; and Patricia Gump, 16, of Tunas, Missouri. Gump's body was never recovered after the accident. Meyer has spent years pondering the mystery of the Faheys disappearance. Honeymoon: The couple were staying at the Lazy Days Resort, where their car and belongings were found . Mystery: The couple took these pictures of each other in front of their cabin at the Lazy Days Resort just before they went missing . 'This is a true, 60-year-old story that has all the elements of many mysteries, docudramas and other headline-grabbing stories,' Meyer said in a written compilation of newspaper articles and court records. The couple had married on May 22 in Chicago and were on a two-week honeymoon. They were reported missing from Lazy Days Resort where they had been staying after they had been absent a few days and their car was found in a parking lot near Bagnell Dam. According to the Lake News, the couple had written a postcard to family saying that they were going to accompany friends to the boat but that they wouldn't be boarding it themselves. The only explanation their families could think of was that they had changed their minds. Meyer has worked on many hypotheses. Did they escape unknown problems to another country? Did they have underworld ties in Chicago and knew too much? Or did they simply die in the boating accident, having decided at the last minute to board the ship, and still lie somewhere at the bottom of the lake? At around 2pm on May 28, 1954, a sudden, violent storm threw the Grand Glaize on its back, depositing all of its passengers in the water. Final correspondence: Dorothy Fahey sent this postcard to her father just days before she and her new husband disappeared . Paid up: The two had booked to stay at Lazy Days Resort until early June, but disappeared without a trace on 28 May, 1954 . Seven people were rescued. Six bodies were recovered, while three, those of Gump and the Faheys, were never found. The search for missing passengers was called off a few days after the accident. The Lake News Online reports that experts say it is nearly impossible for three bodies from the same accident to never surface. According to a report in the Chicago Tribune at the time, the Faheys were 'presumed' to have died in the tragedy, reports the Lake News. Meyer recently spoke to Junior Graham, the pilot of the Grand Glaize on the day of the accident. 'He seemed very confident that they were not aboard, and he had to struggle to try to remember how they were even involved,' Meyer told the Lake News Online. A memorial wreath was laid in the lake on Wednesday at the approximate site of where the Grand Glaize overturned.","On May 28, 1954, a boating accident on the Lake of the Ozarks claimed the live of up to eight people .

"The smallest-ever baby to be born and survive at a Milwaukee hospital has returned triumphant to celebrate her first birthday. Born at just 24 weeks and so tiny she weighed only 13 ounces, baby Phoenix is now a bouncing one-year-old girl who weighs almost 18lb. Her mother Shaina Freeman was struck with early onset pre-eclampsia, a condition that threatened both Freeman and her unborn daughter and for which the only cure is to deliver the child. First birthday: Phoenix is now one year old, after a shaky start when she was born prematurely at just 24 weeks . Freeman's obstetrician Dr Matthew Lee at St Joseph's Hospital has delivered thousands of babies, but he is aware that Phoenix is no ordinary baby. '(It's) really about a miracle. What they could do doesn't always turn out this way, but we are all fortunate that she has done well,' Lee told WISN. Phoenix was in the ICU for a total of three months until she weighed five pounds. Survivor: The tiny girl weighed just 13 ounces when she was born and stayed in hospital for three months before she was allowed home . Growing: Phoenix pictured in September at about four months (left) and in February this year (right) Big girl: Phoenix now weighs 18lb, a healthy weight for her age . When she was first born, her father Charles Sims says, she fit into the palm of his hand. 'She's having so much fun. Look how strong she is,' says Sims of his daughter today. Phoenix's survival wasn't just luck, though. A whole team of people worked to get her through her first months in hospital, and they all gathered to celebrate the growing girl. Phoenix still must receive oxygen from a tank for a lung condition, but she is expected to grow out of it. Her mother is ecstatic at her little girl's progress. 'It's a blessing, she is doing really good. We're blessed that everyone was able to make it today. She's doing good,' Freeman told WISN.","Phoenix Sims was just 24 weeks when she was born last May .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A volcano erupted on the heavily populated Indonesian island of Java today, sending a huge plume of ash and sand 10 miles into the air and forcing the evacuation of more than 200,000 people and the closure of five airports. Indonesia's national disaster agency ordered the evacuation of all families living within a six-mile radius of Mount Kelud. The volcano is 54 miles south of Indonesia's second biggest city Surabaya, a major industrial centre. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho said the eruptions had ceased, but the ash had spread as far as 312 miles to the west and northwest, causing more problems, especially for airlines. Scroll down for video . Indonesian airport personnel inspect volcanic ash covered planes and the airport of Yogyakarta about 200 kilometers . Blotting out the sun: Thick volcanic ash spews high into the air as Mount Kelud erupts on the Indonesian island of Java, forcing the evacuation of some 200,000 people . There she blows: The eruption sent a huge plume of ash and sand 10 miles into the air 300 miles to the west and northwest of the volcano . Cloud of chaos: The volcano is 54 miles south of Indonesia's second biggest city Surabaya, a major industrial centre . Mount Kelud is one of 130 active volcanoes in the world's fourth most populous country. The agency estimated that up to 200,000 people living in its vicinity had been affected by the eruption, and some families were still being brought out of the evacuation zone. The cloud from the eruption forced the shutdown of airports at Surabaya and the cities of Yogyakarta, Solo, Malang and Semarang in East Java and Central Java provinces, stranding thousands of passengers. Local television networks showed images of cities and grounded airplanes blanketed in a layer of ash. Other airports, including Denpasar on the resort island of Bali, were unaffected, so far, according to Garuda Indonesia , the national flag carrier. Shrouded: Around 200,000 people living in its vicinity had been affected by the eruption and some families were still being brought out of the evacuation zone .

Operations were unaffected at a major oil refinery in Cilacap run by state-owned energy company Pertamina, officials said. The refinery, with a capacity of 348,000 barrels per day, accounting for a little more than a third of Indonesia's total output of refined products. 'Thankfully, Cilacap operations are normal, although ash has indeed reached the Cilacap area,' said Pertamina spokesman Ali Mundakir. 'As a preventative measure, we have immediately prepared air filters for equipment there.' East Java is the main area in Indonesia for sugarcane plantations, but officials expected limited damage to crops. 'The eruption will affect sugarcane plantations, but the impact is relatively small,' Soemitro Samadikoen, chairman of Indonesian Sugarcane Farmers Association told Reuters. 'With this very small impact and high stock (in the domestic market) we do not need to import white sugar from other countries.' Grounded: An Indonesian airport official walks near an airplane covered with volcanic ash. Five airports were closed in the wake of the eruption . Health fears: Indonesian passengers wear masks after their flights were cancelled due to volcanic ash from Mount Kelud's eruption at Adi Sumarmo airport in Solo, Java . The disaster mitigation agency later said the cloud was dissipating and that the volcano was no longer erupting. Nugroho said the disaster mitigation agency had confirmed two people were killed by the collapse of roofs due to the weight of the fallen ash. The eruption otherwise caused minimal damage to buildings, Nugroho said, but had left 3cm to 5cm (1 1/2 to 2 inches) of ash and sand on roads. Mt Kelud is just one of nearly 130 active volcanoes in the world's fourth most populous country. At least 11 people were killed earlier this month in the north of the island of Sumatra when Mount Sinabung erupted. The volcano has been spewing lava and ash for months, forcing thousands to flee the area and destroying crops. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono wrote in a message on Twitter that he planned to visit the area near Kelud.","Eruption sent plume of ash and sand 10 miles into the air and 300 miles to the west and northwest on island of Java .

"By . Mike Dawes . Catalan Dragons produced a sensational First Utility Super League performance as they ran out 40-6 winners against Wakefield at Stade Gilbert Brutus. Elliott Whitehead scored a hat-trick of tries as the Dragons scored seven tries to put the agony of last week's 37-16 defeat to Wigan behind them. The French side raced into a 28-0 half-time lead despite dropping the likes of Jeff Lima and Olivier Elima, while both Gregory Mounis and Vincent Duport were absent through suspension. Scorer: Elliott Whitehead scored a hat-trick during Catalan Dragons' 40-6 victory over Wakefield . Catalan opened the scoring in the 13th minute, Daryl Millard collecting Sam Williams' kick to the left corner after Richard Owen got caught underneath the ball. Former Wakefield winger Millard touched down, with Williams adding the conversion. From the restart, Leon Pryce managed to get his hands free in the tackle and offloaded to Louis Anderson, whose quick hands allowed Morgan Escare to race around the Wakefield defenders to score in the left corner. Williams missed the conversion, yet the Dragons had raced into a 10-point-lead and Wakefield offered little resistance as Catalan ran riot before half-time. Whitehead scored his first with a dummy and drive from short range after 21 minutes, Williams adding the simple conversion. Four minutes later Zeb Taia chased Millard's short kick in behind the Wakefield defence and won the race to collect the ball and touch down to further extend Catalan's lead. Whitehead then dummied wide and raced through the attempted tackles of Tautai and Tim Smith and raced 40 metres to score. Williams' fourth successful conversion meant the score was 28-0 to the hosts at the break. Halted: Catalan's Daryl Millard is tackled by the Wakefield defence during Saturday's game . After half-time, Wakefield continued to be their own worst enemies, Paul Sykes knocking on and Escare collecting the ball on the run and racing 70 metres untouched to score a sensational effort.Williams again added the conversion to take the scores to 34-0. Wakefield refused to give up, and thought they had scored as Matt Ryan charged over the line, but he failed to ground the ball properly as the video referee refused the try claim. Just before the hour mark, Whitehead scored his hat-trick try after the ball had been sent out to the right and to Williams. He handed on to Whitehead, who pushed away Sykes' would-be tackle to touch down. Williams' conversion made the scores 40-0. Wakefield did gain some consolation, however, as Paul McShane pounced on Escare's knock on to set Reece Lyne away to score unopposed. Paul Sykes' conversion took the final score to 40-6.","Elliott Whitehead scores hat-trick as Catalan Dragons beat Wakefield 40-6 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An American scientist has discovered two new possible pyramid sites in Egypt, after spending 10 years studying Google Earth. Archeology researcher Angela Micol has pinpointed two areas along the Nile basin, 90 miles apart, both containing unusual shaped mounds. One site includes a 620ft-wide triangular plateau that's almost three times the size of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Vast: The giant triangular plateau near Abu Sudhum is three times the size of the great Pyramid of Giza . Smaller mounds found by Ms Micol still measure up to 330 feet across . Micol's 'second site' has four-sided 'pyramidal area', surrounded by further raised mounds . Ms Micol, who is based in North . Carolina, now plans to visit the sites to confirm they really are the . location of ancient pyramids. The first area sits alongside the Nile in Upper Egypt, 12 miles from the city of Abu Sidhum. If the plateau found there represents the remains of a genuine pyramid, it would be the largest ever discovered. The discovery was made by archeological researcher Angela Micol, from North Carolina . Ms . Micol said: 'Upon closer examination of the formation, this mound . appears to have a very flat top and a curiously symmetrical triangular . shape that has been heavily eroded with time.' The second site, 90 miles north, contains a four-sided shape that's 140ft wide. 'It . has a distinct square centre, which is very unusual for a mound of this . size and it almost seems pyramidal when seen from above,' Ms Micol . said. Speaking to Sky . News, she added that there were also three smaller mounds: 'similar to . the diagonal alignment of the Giza Plateau pyramids. 'The images speak for themselves. It's . very obvious what the sites may contain, but field research is needed . to verify they are, in fact, pyramids.' Both sites are significant because almost all the known pyramids were built around Cairo. Ms Micol's sites are much further south. It's . not the first archeological breakthrough to have been made thanks to . Google Earth - in May last year American Egyptologist Dr Sarah Parcak . identified 17 lost pyramids. And Ms Micol herself has used the program to discover a possible underwater city off the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Pyramids were first built in Egypt in the 28th century BC as tombs for the nation's Pharoahs. The most famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of Cairo. Vast and elaborate structures they took many years and up to 100,000 workers to construct. To date there are 138 known pyramids in Egypt. 2700BC - The first stone pyramid was built at Saqqara, just south of Giza, for the pharaoh Djoser. Unlike the later pyramids, it was made by building layers of stone on top of each other, so it resembled a set of steps. 2600BC - The Great Pyramid of Giza was built as a tomb for the Pharoah Khufu (Cheops). Standing 147 metres hihg and weighing an estimated 6,500,000 tonnes, it's the largest ever discovered. 2575-2150BC - The golden age of pyramids. Hundreds were constructed around Cairo. The new discovery is significant because almost all the 138 known pyramids are located near Cairo. Ms Micol's pyramid sites are much further south. Almost all the 138 known pyramids are located around Giza, in the outskirts of Cairo. Ms Micol finds are far further south, near Faiyum and Abu Sidhum .

"By . Kit Holden . Bayern Munich look set to end their activities in this summer’s transfer window, despite having only made one major signing in Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer. Speaking in Munich on Thursday, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola declared that he is happy with his squad, and that he will not be signing any more outfield players . On Monday Bayern struggled to a 1-1 draw against third-tier German side MSV Duisberg but Robert . Lewandowski got off the mark for Munich after netting in his . first appearance for the club since his move from Borussia Dortmund. VIDEOScroll down to watch Lewandowski score impossible double flick in Bayern training . Content: Pep Guardiola is happy with the strength of his squad heading into the new season . The only position left to fill, . Guardiola said, is that of third choice goalkeeper, with youngster Lukas . Raeder having left the club. ‘We will maybe need another goalkeeper, but otherwise there’s no need for any more transfers’ said Guardiola. After securing former Borussia Dortmund star Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer, Bayern have brought in only two players: defender Juan Bernat from Valencia, and midfielder Sebastian Rode from Eintracht Frankfurt. While Rode is largely expected to be a squad player, Bernat looks set to take over David Alaba’s left back position, with the Austrian moving back to midfield to replace Toni Kroos. Bargain: Despite losing Tony Kroos to Real Madrid, Bayern's only high profile acquisition in Robert Lewandowski was a true bargain on a free transfer from arch rivals Borussia Dortmund . Welcome return: Holger Badstuber has returned from 18 months on the sidelines . Neither Bernat nor Rode are transfers which have been greeted with euphoria from the Bayern fans, though, especially with Kroos having left for Real Madrid. ‘I am very honoured to have been (Kroos’) coach,’ said Guardiola, ‘we did everything to keep him, but he wanted a new challenge’. Guardiola has also described Holger Badstuber as ‘like a new signing’, with the defender returning to the first team squad after spending eighteen months side-lined by injury. Badstuber’s return will certainly strengthen Bayern’s defence, but there are concerns in some corners of the Munich media that the squad needs a little more if Bayern are to stay on a level with their major European rivals. With Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea and others all having added new superstars to their squads, some have criticised Bayern’s inactivity. But to Guardiola’s credit, he is sticking by the principles which brought him success at Barcelona. He told press on Thursday that he will be looking to bring through a number of younger players into Bayern’s first team this season. ‘We are working with the younger players, and getting to know them. They will play if we need them”, he said. Bayern certainly have a wealth of young talent at their disposal. Danish starlet Pierre-Emil Hojberg impressed as a surprise member of the starting eleven during the German Cup Final in May, and has a close relationship with Guardiola. Players such as Gianluca Gaudino and Lucas Scholl, son of former Bayern legend Mehmet Scholl, are also looking to break through from the youth system. Both appeared for the first team in this week’s pre-season friendly against MSV Duisburg.","Signed Borussia Dortmund star Robert Lewandowski on a free transfer .

"By . Freya Noble . An Australian socialist organisation hit with a fierce wave of backlash over the cover of one of their publications has been forced to withdraw the offending image. Red Flag, an online newspaper published by the Socialist Alternative, recalled a cover which featured the Prime Minister with a razor to his throat, the headline 'One cut we'd like to see' splashed below. The cartoon is based on a poster by Michael Callaghan from 1977, which sees former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser with a blade to his neck with 'Give Fraser the razor' written underneath. This image of Tony Abbott with a razor to his throat sparked outrage on the Socialist Alternative's Facebook page and they were forced to withdraw the cover . The poster was prompted by Fraser's decision to block supply which ultimately led to the Whitlam government's dismissal in 1975. In a statement released by the Social Alternative on Tuesday morning Red Flag editors defended the message sent by the cover but said they were forced to withdraw it citing 'legal concerns'. '""Give Fraser the razor!"" was chanted by demonstrators in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane at mass rallies and strikes... The slogan appeared on placards, posters, and graffiti. It was even set to music,' they wrote. 'Tony Abbott’s budget, and the Liberal plans for slashing welfare and cutting wages, is far worse than anything that Fraser carried out when prime minister.' News.com.au report that before the original post with the image of Tony Abbott was pulled down off the Social Alternative Facebook page, it recieved hundreds of comments against the 'violent' image. The cover was inspired by Michael Callaghan's 1977 poster which featured former prime minister Malcolm Fraser with the slogan 'Give Fraser the Razor' 'Oh ... not cool. I’m no fan of the LNP — policies, parties, associates or leader — but this seems unnecessarily violent,' wrote one user, while another said 'dreadful picture. DO NOT CONDONE violence to anyone. Even Abbott. You LOST me off this page and as a supporter.' However the Red Flag deny that they were trying to incite any physical forms of violence with the image. 'The razor was and is clearly metaphorical. Just as cartoons that depict Bill Shorten knifing Julia Gillard in the back are not suggestive of an actual physical attack but merely are visual representations of perceived betrayal, so the razor in both our cover and the original poster suggest that the prime minister should be cast aside. Red Flag deny they tried to incite any violence with the cover, but make no apology for the statement they made with the image . 'It is the height of hypocrisy to make a song and dance about an allegorical newspaper cover, while defending a government which just last week announced that it wishes to deport asylum seekers who have anything less than a 50/50 chance of being tortured or persecuted if they are returned to their “home country”. Red Flag editors Corey Oakley and Ben Hillier closed the statement with 'The difference between this threat of actual violence and an allegorical cover could not be plainer,'  reiterating that they make no apology for the cover. Historically, the razor is considered to be a symbol of Australia's corrupt past, and was also used by gangs as a violent weapon during the Depression. The original poster featuring Fraser was sparked after the 1975 Constitutional Crisis - also known simply as the Dismissal. Fraser came in to power as the 22nd Prime Minster of Australia after he played a key role in the dismissal of Gough Whitlam.","The Socialist Alternative withdrew to cover of their Red Flag newspaper .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Agnieszka Pomaska said her fellow countrymen were applying for better paid jobs now than before . Poles have ended up competing for highly paid professional jobs in the UK because they are better educated and work harder than their British counterparts, a Polish MP has suggested. Agnieszka Pomaska, a senior MP with her country’s ruling party, said Polish immigrants to Britain were no longer seeking low-paid work in the agricultural sector as they did a decade ago. Instead, she said, her countrymen would inevitably seek out middle-class professions. Speaking at a conference in London yesterday, Miss Pomaska criticised British politicians who suggest immigration from the EU has prevented British youths from finding jobs. She said Britain had been happy to open the labour market when it needed low paid agricultural workers and it was not possible to ‘eat the cake and still have it’. ‘You mentioned the problem of competition from Eastern European, Polish people and that they are not so well paid; you say that British people can’t get a job because someone else has got it. ‘But competition is a part of a free market economy so you can’t blame people that are able to compete. ‘It’s not only about the money they get, it’s also about sometimes education and competing in a different way... I think it’s wrong to say they are stealing places to work. ‘You have to remember why you opened the labour market, you did it because you needed these people. ‘About agriculture, Poles and other nations came here because Brits didn’t want to do this work anymore and now the Polish people are better educated and their knowledge of English is better so they are looking for other possibilities. ‘That’s why some of the employers in the agriculture sphere are complaining there are no Poles who like to work there. ‘So we should remember how we started this process of opening the labour market. It’s not possible to eat the cake and still have it.’ Miss Pomaska, 33, chairman of the Polish parliament’s European Affairs Committee, pointed out that Poland’s education system is doing better than Britain’s in international rankings. The issue has ignited a war of words . this week between David Cameron and Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk, . after Mr Cameron suggested Britain should cease the payments . And she defended the payment of child . benefit to Poles in the UK whose children live abroad, saying they pay . tax and spend their money here. The issue has ignited a war of words . this week between David Cameron and Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk, . after Mr Cameron suggested Britain should cease the payments. At the same event Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, said: ‘I think we should be absolutely clear, . we know we have got a skills deficit in this country, I mean this is the . elephant in room. Priti Patel described the country's 'skills deficit' ‘Immigration of the brightest and the best will always do well and prosper in this country.’ She said the education system in Britain . in the past had not been ‘outward looking’ and competitive enough, . adding: ‘I despair on that point I really do. 'I worked for a range of . companies around the world and you can see what the competition is like. 'And it is extraordinary that we had that lack of focus on training and . skills development in this country. ‘We have to be brutal and face . the facts in this country. 'We have had generations in this country that . haven’t worked, and so that’s become their social norm and trying to . break that culture of worklessness which is one of the largest battle . this government has alongside making schools competitive again.’ Half a million Poles have settled in Britain since they acceded to the European Union in 2004. Mr Cameron suggested Britain should no longer pay benefits to children living in Poland, whose parents are currently entitled to £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for the second one - far more generous payments than are paid in Poland. In 2012, about 24,000 EU migrants claimed child benefit in Britain, whose children did not live in the country. But Miss Pomaska said it was unfair to treat Poles differently to British taxpayers.","MP said Polish immigrants were no longer seeking low-paid work in UK .

"By . Sally Lee . and Emily Crane . A woman, 46, has been arrested over the suspicious deaths of two women at their northern NSW nursing home. Marie Darragh, 82 and Isobella Spencer, 77, were found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina. Police arrested the woman - a nurse at St Andrews Village - at a property in Seaspray, south-east of Melbourne, on Monday morning. She is expected to be charged with the murders as well as the assault of an 88-year-old woman. Scroll down for video . Marie Darragh, 82, was one of two women found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina . The woman will remain in police custody overnight before appearing in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. NSW detectives will also apply for the woman to be extradited to Sydney. In June, MailOnline reported that police confirmed they were 'looking at the actions of all nursing home staff' in relation to the deaths and are examining what medications the elderly residents were given. Ms Darragh, who was on the brink of death when she moved to the Ballina nursing home three years ago, managed to turn her health around after she quit smoking. Ms Darragh's daughter, Charli Matterson, told the ABC her mum had lived at the home for three years and was healthy at the time she died . Her daughter, Janet Parkinson, said her mother's new-found health and happiness made the suspected murder so much harder to deal with. 'It's total heartbreak,' Ms Parkinson said on Thursday. 'Because when she went in there she was ready to die. She was so frail and it has taken them three and a half years to get her where she was. 'They built her up and she had to go this way ... that's the heartbreaking thing.' The women were pronounced dead before paramedics arrived just before Mother's Day. A third elderly woman at the nursing home was attacked on the same night but survived. She is understood to be helping police with their investigation and her name has not been released. The nursing home said she is in good health and is back at the facility after a stint in hospital. Detectives believe they have a good idea how both women died and have questioned nursing home staff. 'Obviously we are looking at the actions of staff members that night. However, we are keeping an open mind,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said. 'The fact that these deaths occurred in unexpected circumstances on the same night, in the same location, prompted an immediate response from homicide investigators. 'There is nothing to suggest the women's deaths are in any way linked to deaths in other nursing homes.' Det Supt said the management and staff at St Andrews Village nursing home had been very supportive of the detectives managing the case. Ms Darragh was a grandmother to 11 and mother of three including Charli Matterson . Police arrested a 46-year-old woman who was a nurse at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina, northern NSW . Ms Parkinson said she had her own suspicions about what happened, but could not speak highly enough of the nursing home staff. 'Obviously I have missed something,' she said. Ms Darragh, a grandmother to 11 and mother of three, had 'loved' living at the nursing home, according to her daughter. The manager of the nursing home, Phillip Carter, said that the cause of the women's deaths was still unknown but that the deaths have 'deeply distressed staff, residents and their families'. 'The police have advised me they do not have conclusive information on the causes of death at this stage,' he said. 'St Andrews acted immediately to involve the police because the deaths were unexpected. 'We understand the pain of losing a loved one and we are doing all we can to assist police.' He also said he knew nothing about the assault on the third woman. 'All I've been told is there's an investigation because of two unexpected deaths. They haven't consulted with me about anyone else being assaulted or tampered with,' he told MailOnline. Police did not disclose any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home .

"By . Sally Lee . Australia's drug addiction has reached a new high as recent figures revealed that the use of illicit substances are more extensive than other nations around the world. Shocking statistics were released by the United Nation's 2014 World Drug Report, detailing that Australia ranked the highest ecstasy-users in the world, followed by fourth place for cocaine and then seventth for cannabis. The report also showed Australia's disturbing rise in demand for prescribed pain opioids such as codeine and morphine, ranking second after the U.S. Australians are the top ecstasy using nation in the world, according to the United Nation's 2014 World Drug Report . But while Australia tops the world in ecstasy consumption, data suggests that usage has been reduced. 'In Australia, expert opinion points to an increase in the consumption of cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, and solvents and inhalants, but a decline in the use of ""ecstasy"",' the report said. 'There is a wide range of drug analogues and new psychoactive substances that are currently available in the Australian illicit drug market.' The declining availability of heroin in Australia has consequently increased the abuse of prescription opioids, including so-called 'hillbilly heroin', the report suggests. It stated that high-income countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States have a high consumption of opioids for medical purposes. Shocking statistics revealed that Australia ranked 4th for cocaine . Australians are the 7th highest cannabis users in the world . 'In 2001, the heroin market in Australia underwent a supply drop and a consequent change in consumption patterns, in which most indicators of heroin use declined and some consumers resorted to prescription opioids as a substitute,' the report said. In particular, use of oxycodone increased significantly, displacing morphine in some cases. 'A comparison of price data for heroin and oxycodone in Queensland, Australia, in 2011 and 2012 shows that a tablet containing 60 mg of oxycodone cost $20-30, while an equivalent amount of heroin at retail prices would have cost $40-50.' Cocaine use remained stable over 2012 with an estimated number of 14 million to 21 million  past-year users globally. However the report suggested that the increasing availability of the drug in Europe could possibly be driven by an increasing supply originating from Peru. Such supplies, which are destined for Europe, could be entering the emerging Australian market which has expanded in recent years while prices are higher than western and central Europe. 'Past-year use of cocaine among the general population aged 14 years or older in Australia rose from 1.6 per cent in 2007 to 2.1 per cent in 2010, although the average frequency of consumption appears to be low possibly due to high prices,' the report said. The manufacture of methamphetamine in North America expanded once again with a dramatic increase in the number of dismantled methamphetamine laboratories reported in the United States and Mexico. These two countries along with China, Thailand and Iran continue to report the highest amounts of methamphetamine seized worldwide while the report also suggested that there's a growing demand in south-east Asia. Topping cocaine usage is Scotland while Iceland came placed first for cannabis. While Australia tops the world in ecstasy consumption, data suggests that usage has been reduced .","Australians ranked the 4th highest cocaine-users and 7th highest cannabis-users in the world .

"By . Sally Lee . The subject of the email says it all: 'After Rolf Harris – the last great Australian artist left'. This was the tasteless reference made by a publicist for Sydney-based AC Agency in a media release sent out on Wednesday promoting an auction of works by iconic Australian artist Pro Hart.

Yesterday her father Chetan Chauhan, 37, wept as he told an inquest his daughter was 'smiling and happy' on the last day he saw her alive. Mr Chauhan, an IT worker, told an inquest jury at London's Royal Courts of Justice his daughter was a ‘character’ who was ‘already forming her own personality’. She had loved going to nursery and was ‘smiling and happy’ on the day he dropped her off for the last time, he said. ‘It was a Wednesday, she was well,’ he said. ‘She was a perfectly happy child. She was smiling and quite happy that day, everything was fine.’ Staff at the nursery, a family-owned business with nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton in London, dialled 999 after the incident on the morning of August 23, 2012. The inquest heard paramedics found Tiya not breathing and removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from her airway. She was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital, Tooting, but died later the same day. Mr Chauhan's wife Dipta, 36, wept in the public gallery as he told the jury about their young daughter and showed a picture of her weeks before her death. ‘Tiya was a character,’ Mr Chauhan said. ‘I remember her at home playing with her brother with their toys. ‘She was loud. She was forming her personality, she would pull her brother off her toys and push him away, but she was quite affectionate with her brother and with us. ‘Tiya was loved by everybody. She was an infectious child. She would go up to anybody, she wasn’t afraid of anything.’ Mr . and Mrs Chauhan, who have been married 11 years and have three other . children, did careful research before choosing a nursery for Tiya and . her older brother, the inquest heard. Tragedy: The toddler's father Chetan Chauhan, pictured leaving the Royal Courts of Justice in London, wept as he gave evidence to the inquest jury. He said his daughter was a 'character' forming her own personality . The couple, who live nearby, were happy with the care when Tiya started at Dicky Birds two days a week in October 2011, Mr Chauhan said. But he was dismayed when he collected his tiny daughter from day care one afternoon with teeth marks on her cheek in January 2012, and she was bitten again in February. He said: ‘At the time my wife felt maybe she should take Tiya out of nursery.’ Recalling the fatal incident, nursery room leader Ashleigh Brooks told the inquest jelly had been used as a sensory play activity at the nursery 'for years' but that it was 'hardly ever out'. 'We either had cubes put out so it's sticky, touchy-feely sort of thing or melted,' she said. 'It's always in the cupboard.' 'The jelly was in a water tray and Tiya was standing there with another little girl... They were both playing and I sort of waved and gave them a big smile. They were playing like there wasn't a problem' - Staff member Deborah Maloney . She . said that there had been 'a few issues' during 'free flow play' in the . past because it was harder to supervise the children. 'Some days it did work but other times it was used a little too much,' Ms Brooks said. But she added the children 'really loved the chance to explore' and play with different activities. Moments before the incident, said staff member Deborah Maloney: 'The jelly was in a water tray and Tiya was standing there with another little girl... They were both playing and I sort of waved and gave them a big smile. 'They were playing like there wasn't a problem.' Nursery . practitioner Olivia Aling found the toddler lying face down on the . ground and carried out first aid with deputy manager Carna Poci, she . said. 'I saw Tiya lying face down on the floor with her head to one side,' Ms Aling said. 'I noticed she had blood and foam around her mouth and a small amount of blood on the floor around her mouth. 'I went straight over and picked her up off the floor. I rolled her towards me so that her head was in my elbow. Carna took her from me and we called her name but no response.' 'I held Tiya's head while Carna started CPR. The ambulance service was directing us as to what to do. I held Tiya's head while she did breaths and compressions on her chest.' The inquest continues today. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tiya Chauhan stopped breathing during play session at Dicky Birds nursery .

"By . Dan Bloom . A pub chef quit his job because he has an all-consuming fear of baked beans. Father-of-one Rob Griffiths said he could no longer face making fry-ups with the 'orange devils', which forced him hide whenever they were on the hob. The 31-year-old said at one point he could not even walk down the tinned goods aisle in Tesco because he was so scared. Horror: Rob Griffiths, 31, feels faint if he encounters 'orange devil' baked beans and has to flee the room . Mr Griffiths, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, is thought to be one of the few people in the world with a chronic fear of baked beans, or leguminophobia. 'If you put a baked bean near me I’m likely to be sick,' he said. 'I get shaky, I have to just escape, I have to just run. 'The smell of them just really, really weirds me out. At one point I couldn’t go down the aisle in Tesco because of the beans. 'I couldn’t go into cafes or anything like that because people would be having fry ups. Just the thought of it would horrify me. Struggle: At one point the father-of-one said he could not enter the tinned goods aisle at Tesco . 'I used to be a pub chef and breakfast was hard. I had to get my waiting staff to prepare the beans while I hid in the back.' After quitting his pub job Mr Griffiths started working as a window cleaner. He said his 11-year-old daughter Genie-May and girlfriend Emma Beckett are understanding of his fear - but not everyone is so kind. 'Obviously a lot of people . would wind me up about it,' he said. 'People have heard about it and actually . started chasing me around the house with them. It is very distressing.' Nowadays Mr Griffiths says his fear is less severe than it used to be and he is interested in discovering what caused it. 'I think the fear has . developed from my brothers,' he said. 'They used to throw food at me and I think . they used to throw beans and then I developed this fear.' Professor Sir Cary Cooper, a leading behavioural psychologist at Lancaster University Management School, said: 'It does sound strange and unusual, but people can develop phobias towards pretty much anything. 'He needs to unpack why he has this phobia in the first place and if it does go back to childhood then why did having beans thrown at him bother him so much. 'This does sound like a classic phobia and it is quite serious actually. There are ways of getting help to get over it, whether it is through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, desensitivity training or something else. Help is out there if he wants it.' Terrifying: A simple dish of beans on toast comprises more or less everything Mr Griffiths, 31, fears most .","Rob Griffiths, 31, from Milton Keynes, flees the room whenever he sees them .

"By . Dan Bloom . An Italian Alpine village is being sold on Ebay for less than the price of a London flat. Calsazio is nestled in the dramatic hills of northern Italy, near the Gran Paradiso National Park - but many of its 14 houses are abandoned and in urgent need of repair. Now the village's remaining residents are banding together to sell their entire community for just £195,000 in the hope it will be turned into a tourist spot. Yours for £195,000: The picturesque but dilapidated Alpine village of Calsazio has been listed on Ebay . Fancy a bid? The 'used' item must be picked up locally and unfortunately, refunds are not accepted . The cost - a 'Buy It Now' tag of 245,000 Euros - is less than half the average price of a flat in London, which stands at £475,000 according to the sales website Zoopla. And it is around the same as the average cost of a home in Britain, which has risen 11.8 per cent in the last year according to Nationwide. Despite seeming like a bargain, however, the village has not yet attracted a buyer with seven days left to bid. It probably does not help that its condition is listed as 'used', the seller can only offer collection in person and refunds are not accepted. Breathtaking: The village borders northern Italy's Gran Paradiso National Park (pictured) But its optimistic item description - just a few sentences long - reads: 'At the foot of the Gran Paradiso National Park, it is located just 50 miles from the centre of Turin. 'A strategic location to live, start a business or a tourist restaurant. Fourteen homes combine more than 50 rooms. 'The village lends itself to a functional recovery, aimed at the renovation of buildings meeting architectural and historical criteria.' The settlement has been described as one of the most beautiful in Italy, surrounded entirely by a lush green valley. The national park which it borders was the first to be declared in Italy, and was used as a personal hunting ground by King Vittorio Emanuele II in the mid-1800s. Its dramatic landscape with peaks more than 4,000m high is teeming with glaciers, vultures and mountain goats. Aiding the sale is Italy's National Union of Mountain Communities (Uncem), which said any buyer would have to respect the traditional appearance of the beauty spot. Italy's stagnant economy, however, means the sale could fall distinctly flat. Last week the government admitted defeat over a public auction in which officials had tried to cut the nation's staggering debt by selling off national monuments. Almost all the lots had to be withdrawn from sale after they did not attract enough interest, despite including a castle and a 'haunted' island in the Venetian lagoon. Traditional: The 14 homes are made of stone and wood, and the buyer would have to respect their history . Well-placed: The item's short description on Ebay boasts that it is just 50 miles from Turin . In Britain, on the other hand, house prices are soaring after years of stagnation triggered by the 2008 crash. Calsazio may be one of the most beautiful Italian villages ever put up for sale on Ebay, but it is not the first. Two years ago the medieval Tuscan village of Pratariccia was offered for just 2.5million Euros after standing empty for 50 years. The village was reportedly abandoned after its young population moved to the cities, including nearby Florence, and the dominance of a farming life vanished with the older generation.","Tiny settlement of Calsazio lies just outside Gran Paradiso National Park .

It was posted on Facebook by Lisa Maree on Saturday and gained wide-spread attention on social media. Amanda Veitch lies on the floor of Gold Coast University Hospital.

Since then, the image has gained 736 shares from Ms Maree's page.

"By . Sally Lee . A former dominatrix of a multi-millionaire octogenarian has been taken to court by the elderly man's family after she was given more than $120,000 from him . A former dominatrix of a multi-millionaire octogenarian has been taken to court by the elderly man's family after she was given more than $120,000 from him. The New Zealand family said the woman, aged in her 50s, was a 'predator on elderly, lonely men'. The man's wife of many decades told the court that it was six years ago when she was introduced to the woman by her husband. She was initially told the woman was interested in renting one of their properties to run as a brothel, reported stuff.co.nz. The wife, who now lives in a nursing home, said she was not comfortable with the idea but her husband seemed very fascinated. The man also discussed his interplays with the dominatrix and also complained to his daughter about the sexual relationship with his wife, the judgement said. 'He sat down and told me he was into bondage and discipline... he described his sessions with [the dominatrix] to me, being tied up and whipped,' the daughter said in evidence. Prior to that conversation the man's daughter thought her father had a 'typical Catholic attitude towards sex', the judgement said. Inquiries by the family then found the woman had a history of financially preying on other older men. The man also discussed his sexual interplays with the dominatrix and also complained to his daughter about the sexual relationship with his wife, the judgement said . The judgment said it was clear that more than $120,000 had been gifted from the man to the woman, which were earnings from his $20m real estate empire. Judge David Brown ordered that a property manager be appointed to administer his property portfolio after finding that under the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act the man lacked competence to manage his own affairs. He also noted that when the man was in court, he had quickly given a different explanation for how he met the woman - saying he responded to a dominatrix advertisement and went for a B&D session where the woman 'happened to be on duty'. Then he claimed to have become her friend and supporter after meeting her later when she was on duty as a social worker. Judge Brown said he was satisfied with the evidence that the dominatrix exerted 'undue influence' over the elderly man. The parties involved cannot be identified as the man is considered to be in a vulnerable state.","A New Zealand family of the elderly man has taken his former dominatrix to court .

"By . Dan Bloom . We all dream of owning a little place in the country, though most would admit 12 bedrooms, 85 acres, a cricket pitch and a Roman mosaic is a bit much. Not so for the millionaire owner of Nottingham Forest FC, who has bought a £4million 19th Century stone mansion as his part-time bolthole. Aged 45 and from one of Kuwait's wealthiest families, Fawaz Al-Hasawi is expected to live in Grade II* listed Dunstall Hall for some of the year and spend the rest of the time in his home country. Holiday cottage: We all dream of owning a little place in the country, but not like this. The millionaire owner of Nottingham Forest FC has bought the 19th Century stone mansion Dunstall Hall, near Burton, Staffordshire, for £4million - as his part-time bolthole. The home was on the market for a year and the price was lowered by £1m . Sumptuous: The mansion has stained glass windows, grand chandeliers, classical friezes, carvings, paintings and a Roman mosaic of Cerberus the three-headed dog . We're going to need a substitution: The dining room table seats 20 - an unfortunate number if 45-year-old Mr Al-Hasawi wants to invite the Nottingham squad for supper . Originally a hunting lodge on the brow of a hill in Needwood Forest, the mansion near Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, sits on a former 1,500-acre estate which dates back to 1145 when it was owned by the Earl of Derby. In the 19th Century it was owned by the son of Sir Richard Arkwright, a leader of the Industrial Revolution who invented the spinning frame bearing his name, before being bought by the Hardy family in 1851 who turned the Old Manor House into the grand home it is today. At the entrance to the hall stands an imposing 1850 portico-like structure whose legend reads: ‘ISQUI DEDIT MIHI SERVET’ (He who has . given watches over me). Things get better inside, where the mansion has stained glass windows, grand chandeliers, classical friezes, carvings and a dining table that seats 20, just short of a full squad. The great hallway boasts a Roman mosaic of Cerberus the three-headed dog, who guarded the entrance to the mythical underworld, which is said to have been appropriated from the ancient settlement at Trivoli near Rome, Italy. Each main room leads into the hallway, and the whole mansion is L-shaped to make as many views as possible of the grounds, which nowadays are a more modest 85 acres and include parkland, a cricket pitch, gardens and a lake. Room with a view: One of the 12 bedrooms in the mansion, which underwent extensive renovation in the last 15 years including new wiring and plumbing . Grand: The main hall is dominated by a staircase with detailed depictions of animals set amongst foliage carved by the master craftsman Edward Griffiths in 1899 . Luxury: Over the last six years the mansion has been used as a grand wedding venue after it was bought by the bookmaking millionaire Barry Morgan and converted . Alongside the main home, Mr Al-Hasawi will also get an integrated one-bedroom apartment, a former stable block which is now a . three-bedroom cottage, offices and garages. The house was bought in 1997 by the racing tycoon Sir Stanley Clarke, and after his death it fell into the hands of Barry Morgan, the former owner of bookmaker Needwood Racing. He turned it into a corporate venue which hosted sumptuous weddings, including in the grand stone orangery attached to the main house - a use which could possibly continue under its new owner. The home was on the market for more than a year and the price is believed to have dropped by around £1million before the sale was completed. Estate agent Strutt and Parker said it has undergone a complete refurbishment with new wiring and plumbing in the last 15 years. 'The house now presents . itself as a wonderful opportunity to be used as a family home or . business', the estate agents said. 'The house is mainly built of ashlar stone and is L-shaped . making the most of the views and surrounding park. Manicured: The estate's current 85 acres include parkland, gardens, a lake and a private cricket pitch for the 45-year-old (good practice for if he ever switches sports) Grandiose: The mansion was once the hunting lodge on an estate whose origins can be dated to the 12th Century. In the mid-1800s is was hugely expanded . Stained glass: The mansion includes highly decorative windows and is now owned by Fawaz Al-Hasawi, the 45-year-old chairman of Nottingham Forest FC (right) who succeeded his cousin Omar in December 2012. He can also enjoy a ballroom, vaulted ceilings and grand arches - when he's not in his home country of Kuwait, that is . 'The main reception . hall is dominated by a magnificent staircase, which has detailed . depictions of animals set amongst foliage carved by the craftsman, . Edward Griffiths, in 1899. 'The sitting room is interlinked to the . long library through double mahogany doors providing very flexible . entertaining space. 'The passageway from the great hall features a series . of arches, exquisitely decorated vaulted ceilings and stained glass . windows overlooking an internal courtyard. 'The . ballroom is a rare surviving gem from the age of Victorian . extravagance.

The chairman succeeded his cousin Omar at the helm of Nottingham Forest in December 2012, a turbulent time for the club, and has since improved its fortunes in the eyes of many fans. One of his first moves was the surprise sacking of manager Sean O'Driscoll, but it would not be the first. In a busy time for the club, two more managers have parted ways with Nottingham Forest in the last 18 months. Mr Al-Hasawi could not be reached for comment.","Magnificent Dunstall Hall is on a former 1,500-acre country estate near Burton, Staffordshire, which dated back to 1145 .

"By . Dan Bloom . Holiday in danger: Toni Hedley, her daughter Lacey-Grace and son Mason, who has no passport . A six-year-old boy could miss a long-awaited family holiday next week after becoming the latest victim of Britain's passport crisis. Toni Hedley has been saving for almost a year to fly with her son Mason Williams to Marmaris, Turkey, on Wednesday - but he still has no travel documents, putting the whole holiday in jeopardy. However, despite Ms Hedley, 23, from Gateshead, first applying for his passport on May 15, the Home Office has now promised the document will be ready in time. Ms Hedley booked the trip for seven family members almost a year ago because she knew she would have to miss her mother's wedding, which took place in term time. So the 23-year-old carer, her son Mason and daughter Lacey-Grace Williams planned to hold a belated celebration along with her mother, sister, brother-in-law and nephew. On May 15 she attempted to apply for a passport online for Mason, whose travel documents had expired. But the Passport Office told her there were technical problems with her online application, and they would have to send her a paper declaration form in the post. She asked them to do so - but it took two weeks to arrive, she said. Ms Hedley said she returned it immediately, but since then she has had to wait another three weeks. Now there are just days left before the trip, which cost £900 for Ms Hedley and her children. She said: 'My mum got married in Turkey in May and we couldn’t go because the kids were in school. 'So we booked this as close to the school holidays as possible and I have saved all year for it. 'I have just been calling and calling... I can’t understand how someone can promise this and then not ring us. 'It is so frustrating. I cannot stop crying and Mason is so upset. Nobody has told us anything.' Devastated: Mason pictured with (from left) his sister Lacey Grace Williams, mother Toni Hedley, cousin Liam Marston and aunt Carlie Hedley . Mason's mother said: 'I was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been. He has been counting down the days' Mason was due to meet several members of his new grandfather's family, who are all from Turkey, for the first time and is now distraught. 'I could not leave him,' said his mother. 'It is just awful, if I have to stay at home my daughter will also miss out on a holiday but we are not going to leave him. 'It is tearing the family apart. 'I was speaking to the dinner ladies at his school and they were saying how excited he had been. He has been counting down the days.' Since Ms Hedley's dilemma appeared in her local newspaper the Chronicle, however, the family have been offered a possible reprieve. They have been contacted by the Passport Office and told Mason's travel documents will hopefully be ready on Monday to be picked up from an office in Liverpool. Chaos: Pictures . leaked to MailOnline last month showed hundreds of boxes of applications piled . on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piling pressure on the . Government to introduce emergency measures . It is a 350-mile round trip - but Ms Hedley said it would be worth it to end the chaos. The Passport Office said it was 'working to ensure' all customers receive their official documents within the expected timeframe but said it was also 'doing everything possible to speed up the system'. A spokesman said: 'It is not unusual during peak periods for HMPO to operate with high numbers of applications in the system at any one time, with this year seeing the highest levels for 12 years. 'We are working to ensure that our customers receive their passports within our service standards and are determined to do everything possible to speed up the system, while maintaining the security of the passport. 'The Home Secretary has announced a series of additional measures to ensure people and families receive their passports in good time for their summer holidays. These include bringing in extra staff and extending opening hours to seven days a week. 'We have also introduced a range of measures to help those who need to travel urgently, including free upgrades and extensions on the passports of overseas customers.' The case is just one of tens of thousands caught up in a huge passport backlog which emerged last month, when photos were leaked of stacks of orange binders in the Liverpool processing centre. The revelation prompted an apology in the Commons from Home Secretary Theresa May. Speaking on June 18, Mrs May said 11 per cent of applications were being processed within three weeks - the target waiting time. 'I would like to say to anybody who is unable to travel because of a delay in processing their passport application that I am sorry and the Government is sorry for the inconvenience they have suffered and we are doing all we can to put things right,' she said.","Mason Williams, six, is due to fly to Marmaris, Turkey, next Wednesday .

'For 40 years, for good or . ill, the family has been part of the national soap opera and I never . expected that, and a lot of people think they know us and in some ways . they do know parts of us,' he told ITV's Lorraine Kelly. 'My life has also seemed incredibly episodic, like a soap opera.' He . continued: 'They're so small the little chaps and I'm not sure that . they'll have this craving to remember their mum and I think that's . healthy. 'You know, they're . young enough - it's a terrible expression - to be able to build . emotional relationships away from the primary relationship with the . mother. 'I know that sounds . very cold and empirical but obviously I've had to think about it and so . have Tom, their dad, and Keith and Sue, their grandparents, who are . amazing people and doing fantastically with the guys. 'So . I don't want them becoming wrapped up in the Geldof life. It's great in . some respects, it's appalling in other times and things.' The singer spoke almost three months to the day since Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7. Father and daughter: Bob Geldof and Peaches. He said he was amazed by the impact she had on her generation . Emotional: The singer shared a hug with ITV's Lorraine Kelly almost three months to the day since Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7. He is devoting himself to his music . He said he coped through his music but he and his family were still struggling. 'There's not many options,' he said. 'It's . intolerable, it's very hard as, everybody must realise if it's happened . to them too. What else do you do? You get on with it.' The 62-year-old said he escapes the thoughts of Peaches' death through music, but this could also bring out his darkest emotions. 'Being . on stage is entirely cathartic,' he said. 'It just clears your head... When I come off stage I'm physically exhausted and mentally clear.' The singer, whose first wife Paula Yates died of a heroin overdose in 2000, added: 'If I dwell on the words sometimes I find it hard to struggle . through the song because they take on whole meanings I never meant when . I wrote them.' Speaking of . the Rats' No 13 single Diamond Smiles, he said: 'I was writing about a . girl I read about in one of the papers, a socialite, and she went to a . posh party and went upstairs and she hanged herself during the party. Opening up: The Boomtown Rats singer, whose appearance was timed with the launch of a comeback tour, talked about how songs he had written decades ago had taken on new meanings he never imagined . 'These things assault you without warning,' the Boomtown Rats singer said. 'You could be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have got to be very careful because this is still very raw' Close: Bob Geldof and his daughter Peaches in 2009 (left) and with Peaches and her sister Pixie in 1996 . 'I think somebody said she was the brightest of diamonds and I called the song Diamond Smiles. 'If . I really think about those words it's too bizarre, it's too telling, . about whether it's about Paula or - now - what it's about Peaches.' 'The default position for me as a person is right, things have to be organised, and that distracts me,' the singer continued. 'But . like anybody else these things assault you without warning. You could . be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have . got to be very careful because this is still very raw. 'Like anybody else these things assault you without warning. You could . be talking to someone, you could be walking down the road, and I have . got to be very careful because this is still very raw' - Bob Geldof . 'I'm . walking down the road and suddenly out of the blue there's an awareness . of her and I buckle, and I've got to be very careful because walking . down the King's Road there's paps everywhere so I have to duck into a . lane and blub for a while. 'I don't want this to be a blub fest but you can imagine it.' However, the Irish singer said he had been humbled by the public's support. 'We were overwhelmed by people writing . to us in the kindest way,' he said. 'Complete strangers but who felt it and the . nice thing about that was this young girl had made such an impact, . especially on her generation. 'I . was talking in Leeds and some people came up to me and said ""you're . Peaches Geldof's dad, aren't you?"". But I liked it, I liked being . Peaches Geldof's dad.' Of . his proposal to his long-term girlfriend Jeanne Marine just a month . after his daughter's death, he said: 'I was going to do it anyway on her . birthday - I love her to bits and she's amazing and I certainly . wouldn't have got through the last 20 years without her.' He . thought of postponing the proposal, he said, but: 'Then I thought no, . we need to let some air into the room, we need to let some light in.' Tragic: Peaches, pictured with her children and husband Tom Cohen, worried she would echo her mother's fate . Performing with The Boomtown Rats, he played at he Volksfest Festival in Plymouth, Devon, almost two months after she died. Miss . Geldof was close to her father and after her death, he was the first . family member to make a statement about their loss, expressing his . devastation and disbelief. ‘Peaches . has died. We are beyond pain,' Geldof wrote. 'She was the wildest, . funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us. ‘Writing . “was” destroys me afresh. What a beautiful child. How is this possible . that we will not see her again? How is that bearable?’ Smiling through it all: Despite the grim subject of the interview, the presenter remarked on how well the singer looked, cracking a handful of jokes in the studio as he looked forward to going back on tour . Miss Geldof was found unconscious at her home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7 after taking heroin. An inquest hearing was told the drug was a likely cause of her death. In what is thought to have been her last interview before her death, she spoke of her fears that she would die like her mother Paula Yates, who died of a heroin overdose in 2000. She told the American writer William Todd Schultz: ‘It’s like I’m someone in a book. Your life, they keep telling you, is preordained, “I’m going to die like my mother ... she’s going to end up like her mother”.’ Geldof's interview took place as he prepared to launch a major comeback tour by the Boomtown Rats - who he first . led on stage 39 years ago. The band will tour 15 venues through . England and Scotland in October and November, with tickets having gone on sale at 9am today.","Star gave emotional first TV interview since Peaches' death on April 7 .

"By . Dan Bloom . Stunned police found 70 guns and a Second World War hand grenade when they made a routine search of a dead man's house. Officers were tipped off by a relative who was clearing out the semi-detached bungalow in Brighton, East Sussex, after 72-year-old owner Barrie Hollington passed away. Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police were astonished to discover 30 rifles and 40 handguns - many of which were live and loaded. Haul: Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police in Brighton were astonished to discover 30 rifles, 40 handguns and a Second World War grenade in a routine search of a dead man's house in suburban Brighton . Overgrown: Police visited this suburban house in Brighton after its owner died, where they found the weapons . A bomb disposal team was called to the overgrown empty home, which is in a leafy street on the outskirts of Brighton lined with semi-detached bungalows. The weapons they found included Second World War Sten gun, a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver, rusty bayonets and even a belt-fed automatic machine gun. They made sure the grenade was safe before officers removed the weapons for further investigation. Mr Hollington was believed to have lived in the £220,000 bungalow with his brother Robert Hollington, and neighbours said the house also contained a book collection. Neighbour Alicia Taylor, said: 'I didn't know there were weapons there until someone told me. 'He was a bit of a loner and an oddball. He never did anyone any harm though. 'He was taken into care about a month or so ago.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Who would have thought it, hey? Barrie seemed alright. He was an eccentric but never violent at all. 'It's a nice community round here, the sort of last place you would expect to find one gun, let alone 70.' Clutter: A view through one of the windows of the house, whose owner was described as an avid collector . Mystery: Sussex Police have not revealed any more details about the man, including his age or cause of death . The weapons have now been catalogued . at police headquarters with a green tag attached to each of the guns, . which vary massively in shape, size and heritage. A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'They were reported to us by a relative who was clearing out the house after the man died.' Sergeant Chris Lane added: 'Let’s say it was not our usual day at the office. 'We were told we might found two or three firearms at the house but were amazed to find 70. 'The late owner of them who lived at the house was obviously an avid gun collector. 'The firearms have been removed and secured by officers and enquiries will be made into their origins.' Police are now trying to establish where the guns came from. Leafy: Police were called to this street on the outskirts of Brighton, lined with semi-detached bungalows . Sussex . Police have not revealed whether Mr Hollington had a gun licence, but one of Britain's leading firearms experts said at least some of the collection was probably legal. David . Dyson, who is regularly used as a gun expert in court, said: 'As a principle and looking at the number of . weapons, I would think that many of the guns would have been collected . legally. 'There are a number of weapons from many different decades, but the majority look to be from the Second World War. It would be very difficult for someone to amass a collection of guns that size totally illegally. 'It's very hard to price weapons without handling them, but that collection would be worth thousands of pounds, or maybe more. 'If one of the revolvers is an antique, that could be worth a thousand pounds on its own.' Did you know the gun hoarder?

"By . Dan Bloom . Detectives have issued an e-fit of a man they want to speak to after he was apparently seen running away from a footpath where a Saudi student was stabbed to death. Nahid Almanea, 31, was brutally attacked just over two weeks ago near the University of Essex in Colchester, where she was described as an 'exceptional' English language student who wanted to start a PhD. Today officers said they want to trace this man seen running up Hewes Close, away from the Salary Brook Trail where . Ms Almanea died, at 10.56am on June 17 - about 15 minutes after . she was attacked. Scroll down for videos . Appeal: Detectives have issued an e-fit of a man seen running away from the footpath where student Nahid Almanea, 33, was stabbed 16 times and left to die. He is described as white and 18 to 25 with medium build . He is described as white and aged 18 to 25 with medium build, dark hair and a distinctive bar piercing in his left eyebrow. He was wearing a long-sleeved plain hooded top described as 'London bus red' and dark trousers. In other developments, more than 2,000 students at the university have been given panic alarms after Ms Almanea's murder - which came less than three months after a similar fatal stabbing in a park - in case they are attacked. Registrar Bryn Morris said: Very understandably, there is anxiety for students and the focus is on catching the perpetrators of these dreadful crimes and bringing them to justice. 'The way police have deployed officers must be applauded - it has been just right. 'It's mainly post-graduates on campus at the moment, but I'm not aware of any students who are not planning to come in. 'In the past two weeks a lot of work has been done to support students.' Last known footage: Ms Almanea was captured on CCTV (left) on the morning of her murder, which sparked a vast search by police which is still ongoing more than two weeks later. Officers drained three fishing lakes . Similarities: Two people have died after frenzied knife attacks in Colchester within three months . The man is one of the key potential witnesses who have still not come forward to police. Police previously said they were keen to trace several other people, include a man who may have been following the student. One . was a man spotted walking behind two women, one of them possibly Ms . Almanea, at around 8.45am on June 13, four days before she was . murdered. A second man police wanted to trace was seen on the Salary Brook Trail shortly before Ms Almanea was found, and was wearing a distinctive light brown Italian-style designer jacket. Chief Inspector Richard Phillibrown, . Colchester district commander, said: 'We have received excellent support . throughout this investigation from the whole community. 'We . appreciate their patience whilst the forensic searches continue. We . would also urge anyone with information, no matter how small you might . think, to contact us.' Police . say the case bears similarities to the murder of James Attfield, 33, who was . stabbed 102 times on his arms, hands, back, neck and head, in Colchester's Lower Castle Park on March 29. Officers do not know if the pair were murdered by the same person, but they are keeping an 'open mind', they said. Tragic homecoming: The funeral of Nahid Almanea in her native Saudi Arabia was held last month . Distinctive: DCI Steve Worron shows a picture of a jacket similar to that worn by another man near the scene . Parts of the murder scene finally reopened to the public yesterday after a vast search, which recovered 38 knives and involved draining three lakes. On the day of her murder Ms Almanea was wearing a dark navy blue full-length Muslim robe, called an Abaya, and a patterned multi-coloured hijab headscarf. She also had a black bag with orange panels which she was carrying on a shoulder strap. Chilling: James Attfield, 33, was stabbed 102 times and left to die in Colchester in March . Since her killing, more than 600 calls have been made to the incident room with more than 300 house-to-house inquiries and 250 stop checks. Richard Barnard, head of the International Academy at the University of Essex, said Ms Almanea had recently achieved the highest score in her class for a recent test - but was murdered before tutors could tell her the good news. 'She was very focused, always positive and had an inner self-belief,' he said. 'Her quiet determination to succeed, her hard work and her enthusiasm for her studies had really impressed her teachers . 'Outside of the class, Nahid was always friendly, considerate and thoughtful with a very polite and courteous manner.' There are other people who police say were in the area and could have crucial information. They include a 5ft 7ins white woman, thought to be in her early 20s, with light brown hair, a summer dress and a denim jacket. Another was a white man who 'looked like a student', aged 19 to 23, with blond hair, a backpack and white headphones. Another potential student had dark, short hair and light trousers and was using a phone. Police also want to trace a black man who was wearing a forward-facing cap, a dark blue and yellow striped polo top and a backpack. Anyone with information should contact the force on 01245 282103 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Nahid Almanea, 31, knifed 16 times on June 17 near University of Essex .

"By . Tara Brady . A gypsy homeowner who was refused permission to build a caravan site in his back garden is attempting to bypass planning laws by having it declared as an official campsite. Bill Watton, 45, wanted to put three caravans containing two gypsy households on green belt land at the back of his detached home in Essington, near Wolverhampton. After more than 70 angry residents complained at a public meeting the plans were thrown out by South Staffordshire District Council on August 13 last year. Google view of Mr Watton's Long Lane home (circled), in Essington, Staffordshire . However, the row has now taken a bizarre turn with Mr Watton submitting plans to have the two acres of land declared a campsite with the Camping and Caravan Club. The site - which is in a residential area of the Staffordshire village - will also take up to five caravans or motor-homes along with 10 tents. But yesterday furious residents accused Mr Watton of 'trying it on' saying that nobody would ever visit Wolverhampton for a camping holiday anyway. Councillor David Clifft, chairman of Essington Parish Council, said: 'Mr Watton has failed in his efforts to get planning from the council so this is his way of getting around that. Bill Watton wanted to put three caravans containing two gypsy households on green belt land . 'It is important people in the area know what is going on so they can take the opportunity to put their view across. 'It is also highly unlikely the Camping and Caravan club are aware of the history of the site so I will be sending them a full copy of the planning committee’s last report.' Councillor Clifft said a petition opposing the plan has been signed by 135 residents and 16 letters of objection had also been received. Villagers had objected to the caravans being situated on green belt land and said they were also concerned about increased traffic. Villagers had objected to the caravans being situated on green belt land behind the house (circled) Long Lane resident Caroline Adams, 48, said: 'If they want to live as a traveller they shouldn’t be living in the back garden in a residential lane. 'If this is agreed and it went ahead it would set a precedent. 'Rather than stay in a nursing home people will say they may as well stay in a back garden.' Lorraine Johnston, 56, whose house backs onto Mr Watton’s property said: 'Nobody wants the loss of green belt land. 'We are concerned about the impact on the environment and about the loss of views.' Furious residents  who live near Mr Watton's house (pictured) have accused Mr Watton of 'trying it on' Local hairdresser Joyce Parry, 44, added: 'It’s just a ploy to get around the councils decision, there is now way there is any other reason for it. 'Who on earth is going to come to Wolverhampton for a camping holiday? He is just trying it on.' Darren Whittington, membership services director at the Camping and Caravan Club, said: 'When a certified site is applied for, the club always consults with local residents and authorities as to whether the location should receive a certificate from us and we will continue to follow this process in this instance.'

"By . Tara Brady . Dennis Whitfield, 66, was a tutor for 37 years but at the same time was conning his pupils out of cash . A driving instructor dubbed 'the Doc' because of his resemblance to the Back To The Future character has been jailed for conning pupils in a £250,000 investment scam. Dennis Whitfield, 66, who was a tutor for 37 years, was given his nickname because he looked like Doc Brown played by Christopher Lloyd in the Back to the Future movies. However, beneath his honest church-going persona, Whitfield was secretly pocketing nearly £250,000 by exploiting his job with the British School of Motoring to fool learner drivers into parting with extra cash. He spent 20 years giving his girlfriend lessons yet never put her in for a test. Over that time Dennis Whitfield conned the woman out of £206,000 - telling her he had a pharmaceuticals investment scheme and high interest bank account she should move her money into. When her savings ran out he persuaded her to take out loans for the scheme. He swindled a further £31,000 from other driving school pupils - saying he could get cheap second-hand cars for them. In fact it was all lies, but Whitfield - who pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud and two of theft - refused to explain where any of the cash went, simply telling police he is ‘silly with money’. Whitfield, 66, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was jailed for three years and four months, as Bolton Crown Court heard he has left his former girlfriend penniless and in debt. Whitfield had won her trust after first becoming friends with her sister - who he also conned out of £20,000. He invented a fictitious ‘professor’ working on pioneering medicine and persuaded both women to invest in what they thought was a pharmaceuticals firm. He even gave the family what he said were pills created there - but they were just vitamins. Seven driving school pupils were duped out of between £1,700 and £4,200 each after Whitfield said he could get cheap, second-hand Vauxhall Corsas for them. Driving instructor Dennis Whitfield was jailed for three years at Bolton Crown Court . Each victim handed over cash only to never hear from Whitfield again. The court heard he won the trust of all his victims by talking about his regular church-going and long-standing employment with BSM, formerly the British School of Motoring. Whitfield, who was convicted of another almost identical fraud last year, was said to be ‘ashamed’ of the offences, which occurred between 1995 to 2013. Dennis Whitfield was nicknamed The Doc because he resembled Doc Brown played by Christopher Lloyd (left) in Back To The Future which also starred Michael J Fox (right) Sentencing Whitfield, judge Recorder Ray Herman told him: 'As a result [of your offences] you left [this woman] in terrible difficulties and she is obliged to pay interest on these loans she raised and has had no money returned by you. 'Some of your victims were vulnerable adults, particularly [this woman]. 'You told her you loved her and persuaded her to have driving lessons with you for 20 years.'","Dennis Whitfield, 66, from Bury, Greater Manchester was a tutor for 37 years .

"By . Tara Brady . Victim: Lee Catton was allegedly driving at 42mph in a 30mph zone when he hit Hichame Bouadimi dragging the boy under the wheels of his truck . A skip lorry driver ran over and killed a five-year-old boy after the boy slipped from his mother’s hand, a court heard. Lee Catton, 48, was allegedly driving at 42mph along a 30mph stretch of road when he hit Hichame Bouadimi, dragging the boy under the wheels of his truck. Hichame, who had been walking with his mother and older sister, had run into St Georges Road near the Elephant and Castle roundabout, in south London, after slipping from the clutches of his mother's hand. Jacob Hallam, prosecuting, told jurors: ‘This is a tragic case; it involves the sudden death of a little boy, Hichame Bouadimi. ‘He was only five-years-old when he was killed on the afternoon of October 3, 2012. ‘He [Hichame] somehow slipped from his mum’s hand and ran on to the road. Why he did that we will never know but he did.’ Mr Hallam added: ‘Hichame’s death must have been virtually instantaneous, his injuries were terrible. 'His body lay in the road after Mr Catton’s lorry had driven over it, people who were there went towards him, one of them covered him with their coat.’ Woolwich Crown Court heard how a speed recording device in Catton’s lorry had later showed that he had been driving above the speed limit at the time of the impact. Mr Hallam said: ‘He was driving too fast on a school day when uniformed school children were around on both sides [of the road]’ Catton told police afterwards that he had suddenly become aware of a figure running into the path of his lorry from the left adding: ‘By the time I saw him it was too late’. Scene of the death: Hichame was walking with his mother and older sister before he apparently ran into St George's Road in the Elephant and Castle area of south London . Mr Hallam told the court that the consequences of the crash had had a deep impact on Catton. ‘There is absolutely no doubt that he was profoundly affected by what happened to him. He made the position clear later that same day when he was interviewed by police.’ Catton, from Southwark, south London, denies causing death by dangerous driving and an alternative count of causing death through careless driving. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Lee Catton, 48, was allegedly driving at 42mph on 30mph stretch of road .

"By . Tara Brady . A father-of-two accidentally killed himself with an overdose of painkilling medication after he used his mother’s morphine patch to treat his bad back. Geoffrey Bates, 38, a garage sales manager, was found dead in bed by the mother of his two children just hours after combining the patch with other painkillers which had been prescribed by a hospital. Mr Bates had earlier persuaded his 61-year-old mother to give him one of her fentanyl morphine patches which she had been using to treat her arthritis. Geoffey Bates photographed with his girlfriend Adele: The father-of-two suffered with crippling back pain but died after using one of his mother's painkilling patches with painkillers he had been prescribed from a hospital . She warned her son it might be too strong for him but relunctantly agreed to hand a box of three over on condition he used them sparingly because he said he was in agony. Tests showed Mr Bates, who worked for a Land Rover dealership in Bradford, West Yorkshire, died from a cardiac respiratory failure. An inquest was told the tragedy took place last February after Singapore-born Mr Bates of Apperley Bridge, Bradford, had a severe recurrence of the back pain which had plagued him for two years. A strong opioid medicine similar to morphine, fentanyl is used for treating chronic pain. It is from the same basic  family as heroin and induces relaxation and euphoria. Skin patches containing fentanyl are designed to be worn like a nicotine patch for 72 hours, releasing the drug slowly into the bloodstream. It takes 12 hours for the full effects of the patch, often used for terminal illnesses, to wear off. Several patients have claimed they became addicted to the drug. He went to Bradford Royal Infirmary for painkillers where was prescribed Co-codamol but later that day when his symptoms persisted he contacted his mother Kew Hing Taylor. In a statement Mrs Taylor said: 'On Saturday 8th February at 11.45am I received a call from Geoffrey. ‘I answered the call and he said he had been to hospital earlier that day and was at work but in a lot of pain. He asked for one of my morphine patches.' She explained that she used the patches once every three days and had been using for the last five years. The statement continued: 'On 8th February at 2pm Geoffrey came to my house and asked if he could have a morphine patch to relieve the pain in his back.' During the brief five minute exchange between Kew Hing and her son, which would also be the last time she saw Geoffrey, she warned him that the morphine was very strong. Geoffrey Bates went to Bradford Royal Infirmary (pictured) for painkillers where he was prescribed Co-codomal . She said: 'I told him that the morphine would be too strong for him but he persisted and asked to use just the one. 'I gave him a box containing three and told him to use half a patch as they are very strong. I didn’t hear from him since.' She said she found out about her son’s death the next day and added: 'I was so shocked and I rushed to their home right away.' Mr Bates’ girlfriend Adele Henson, who is mother of his children Jack, five, and Alfie, three-months, said her partner had no health difficulties apart from his back problems. She said: 'I was so shocked. He was only 38 and I loved him so much. I can’t recall him having any illnesses apart from back pain, which he has had for two years.' 'I want to offer each of you my continued sympathy as you seek to come to terms with the incredibly difficult situation' Roger Whittaker, West Yorkshire coroner . Recording a verdict of accidental death West Yorkshire coroner Roger Whittaker, said: 'On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied by the medical cause of death was related to the medication he was taking. 'Clearly Geoffrey had been in a substantial amount of pain - more than he could have been expected to bear. 'I want to offer each of you my continued sympathy as you seek to come to terms with the incredibly difficult situation.'
