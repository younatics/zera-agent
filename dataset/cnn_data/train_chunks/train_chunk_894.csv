"By . Joel Christie . Anthony Rodgers allegedly walked into an Ohio bank and passed the teller a note that told her to hand over money or he'd 'shoot yo a--'. The incident occurred at the Cooper State Bank in Clintonville, Columbus, on July 23. The 23-year-old made off with about $754 from the robbery, however the teller managed to plant a dye pack amongst the cash. After being arrested last Tuesday, local police are said to have been quite taken aback with the tattoos that down Rodgers' face - and for good reason. Colorful character: Anthony Rodgers, 23, has been arrested on a charge of aggravated robbery, but police were shocked to the extent of his facial tattoos . Surveillance: Footage of Rodgers allegedly robbing the Cooper State Bank in Columbus appears to show without his tattoos, perhaps suggesting he used makeup to cover them . On approach: Rodgers is accused of handing the bank teller a note demanding money . Robbery in progress: The teller handed over about $700 in cash, but managed to put a dye bomb in the package . According to Dispatch Columbus, the ink did not show up very clearly in the surveillance footage of the bank. The site noted some criminals have been known to use make up to cover up distinctive tattoos in order to make themselves less identifiable. While there is nothing in Rodgers' police report suggesting as such, it is clear his stamps cant be seen by the bank's cameras. Among the facial art Rodgers has - and which were clearly obvious in his mugshot - is a droplet at the corner of his lips and '69' on his chin. However most noticeably he has 'Truly Blessed' across his forehead. Rodgers left the bank on foot and got into the passenger seat of a black BMW, according to the Columbus police report. Witnesses said the dye pack exploded before he got into the car. Scene: Th 23-year-old allegedly robbed the Cooper State Bank in Clintonville, Columbus on July 23 . Rodgers has been charged with one count of aggravated robbery. It is unclear whether he was armed.","Andrew Rodgers, 23, allegedly robbed a bank in Columbus, Ohio, on July 23 .

"By . Joel Christie . Max Schireson was tired of being asked what type of car he drives. As the male CEO of a billion dollar company and a married father-of-three, he would listen as his female counterparts were questioned on how they maintain a healthy work and family balance, wondering why the same was never asked of him. He was also tired of spending more time on planes flying around the world on business than he was with his wife and kids. So on Wednesday Schireson - who fronts fast-growing New York database company MongoDB, which has grown $220 million in the last four years under his leadership - announced he was stepping down from the 'best job in the world' in order to have more time at home. 'This is the right choice': Max Schireson, CEO of emerging database software company MongoDB, has announced he has stepped down from the demands of his role in order to have more time with his 'beautiful family' Family first: In this undated photo, Max Schireson is seen with his daughter when she was younger. The tech CEO said he feels he has missed too many important moments with his kids to continue with his role . 'Life is about choices. Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so,' Schireson wrote on his blog. 'At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice.' Business Insider noted that MongoDB was last valued at $1 billion but is developing quickly and considered 'one of the most important tech companies in New York'. The software the company offers is used as a backend by the likes of Craiglist and eBay. As CEO, Schireson stood to become 'phenomenally wealthy' if he had stayed seen out the expected trajectory. But Schireson - whose family are based in California - had more important plans. 'I have three wonderful kids at home, aged 14, 12 and 9, and I love spending time with them: skiing, cooking, playing backgammon, swimming, watching movies or Warriors or Giants games, talking, whatever,' Schireson wrote on his blog. 'I have an amazing wife who also has an important career: she is a doctor and professor at Stanford where, in addition to her clinical duties, she runs their training program for high risk obstetricians and conducts research on on prematurity, surgical techniques, and other topics. 'She is a fantastic mom, brilliant, beautiful, and infinitely patient with me. 'I love her, I am forever in her debt for finding a way to keep the family working despite my crazy travel. 'I should not continue abusing that patience.' Successful: Schireson said that MongoDB grew by $220 million in the four years he was CEO. The company started in 2007 . He will move into the role of vice chairman at MongoDB from September 3. Schireson will be replaced . Admirably, Schireson said MongoDB needs a leader that is 'all in' and that is why he is relinquishing his role. Additionally, he is fatalistic about the jobs that such a decision - and making that decision public - will cost him in years to come. 'I recognize that by writing this I may be disqualifying myself from some future CEO role,' he wrote online. 'Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday? Maybe.' Schireson told Forbes that the decision came to him on an overnight flight to Austin. He commutes from New York to Palo Alto, California, every two to three weeks which, along with other travel, would tally his flyer miles at over 300,000 per year. His flight had to make an emergency landing Tucson, but, exhausted, he slept through it. He woke to see some crew members were traumatized by the emergency and had to be replaced by other staff. 'In that moment, I realized, ''What am I doing?""' he told the magazine. Earlier this summer, Matt Lauer asked Mary Barra, the CEO of GM, whether she could balance the demands of being a mom and being a CEO. The Atlantic asked similar questions of PepsiCo’s female CEO Indra Nooyi. As a male CEO, I have been asked what kind of car I drive and what type of music I like, but never how I balance the demands of being both a dad and a CEO. While the press haven’t asked me, it is a question that I often ask myself. Here is my situation: . Friends and colleagues often ask my wife how she balances her job and motherhood. Somehow, the same people don’t ask me. A few months ago, I decided the only way to balance was by stepping back from my job. MongoDB is a special company. In my nearly 4 years at the company, we have raised $220 million, grown the team 15x and grown sales 30x. We have amazing customers, a great product which gets better with every release, the strongest team I have ever worked with, and incredible momentum in the market. The future is bright and MongoDB deserves a leader who can be “all-in” and make the most of the opportunity. Unfortunately, I cannot be that leader given the geography of the majority of the company in New York and my family in California. I recognize that by writing this I may be disqualifying myself from some future CEO role. Will that cost me tens of millions of dollars someday? Maybe. Life is about choices. Right now, I choose to spend more time with my family and am confident that I can continue to have an meaningful and rewarding work life while doing so. At first, it seemed like a hard choice, but the more I have sat with the choice the more certain I am that it is the right choice. In one month, I will hand the CEO role to an incredibly capable leader in Dev Ittycheria. He will have the task of leading the company through its next phase of growth (though thankfully not of commuting across the country while doing it!). I know the company will be in great hands; his skills fit our next phase of growth better than mine do. And I will be there to help (full time, but 'normal full time' and not 'crazy full time') in whatever areas he needs help. More about the announcement can be found in today’s press release. I hope I will be able to find a way to craft a role at MongoDB which is engaging, impactful, and compatible with the most important responsibilities in my life. As great as this job has been, I look forward to creating one which is even better.

"By . Joel Christie . Tragic: The body of Jennifer Huston, 38, pictured, has finally been discovered . Police believe they have firmed up a sighting of missing Oregon mom Jennifer Huston boarding a car ferry in Washington state, some 300 miles from where she was last seen. Deputies in the San Juan Islands are investigating what appears to be a solid description of the 38-year-old in Anacortes on the morning of Thursday July 31, one week after her disappearance. A couple say they saw a blonde female in her 30s on the 9am ferry to Friday Harbor in a car that matched the make and model of Huston's green Lexus, including a crack in the windshield. However the ferry system in the area is connected to 20 terminals, including Seattle, making the search to find Huston on surveillance footage even more cumbersome. 'If that was her on the ferry, she could be on Orcas Island right now, she could be on Lopez, she could be on Shaw, she could be anywhere using the ferry systems,' San Juan County Under sheriff Bruce Distler told KPTV. The unconfirmed sighting adds further mystery to the whereabouts of the married mother-of-two. Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, was last seen taking cash out at a bank, filling up her car with gas and then buying snacks and non-lethal sleeping pills at a Rite Aid in nearby Newberg around 6.22pm on July 24. She also withdrew a 'small sum' of money from an ATM, but it is not known how much. Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station, but police said it was not due to a dead battery, according to Fox News, and she has not used her credit cards since. She told her husband, Kallen Huston, she had some errands to run, but then never returned home. At a press conference this week, Mr Huston - who has passed a polygraph test - said he believed that finding his wife's 99 Lexus would be the key to finding her. He also pleaded directly with his wife for her safe return. Sighting? A couple believe they saw Jennifer Huston, 38, boarding a car ferry here in Anacortes, Washington, on the morning of Thursday July 31, one week after she went missing in Oregon . Last seen: The married mother-of-two was last seen filling up her car near her home in Newberg, Oregon, about 6.22pm on July 24 . Missing: A couple have now come forward saying they saw a woman matching Huston's description in a green Lexus, even describing a noticeable crack in the car's windshield . Vast: If the sighting is confirmed, the ferry system Huston may have been on is connected to 20 different terminals, including Seattle . Clue: If the new sighting of Jennifer Huston is confirmed, she was last seen 300 miles - or a six hour drive - from her Oregon home in Anacortes, Washington . Search continues: San Juan County Under sheriff Bruce Distler said police are using local surveillance footage to firm up whether Huston was in the area on Thursday . Distraight: An emotional Kallen Huston pleaded for any information that could lead to finding his wife in a press conference Friday . 'Jennifer, if you could see this or hear this, I love you,' Mr Huston said. 'You have a ton of support from the community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need you. I love you. 'We'll never stop looking for you.” Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area. They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress. 'After . [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have . covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts . are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office . said. 'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.' The latest sighting is expected to reactivate the search. A clearly emotional Mr Huston, flanked by fellow members of her family, said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer, KOIN reported. Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage . stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after . As to questions surrounding her final . known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband . said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it . was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, . and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering . from for three days. He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.' Captain . Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a . 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 . miles after she filled up the tank. Mr Huston, who has passed a polygraph test, told investigators his wife had left to run errands and had been complaining of a headache for several days before she went out but said nothing else was out of the ordinary. Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother . to her two sons, aged two and six. Her husband previously said he'd told . them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the . truth. He also expressed . his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her . car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife. Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car . 'I ask that anybody helping us, . regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the . side of the highways,' he said. 'This is totally unlike her. She's a . devoted mother. She’s just a very good person, and for her to do . something like this is completely out of the norm.' She was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and black yoga pants. Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information .","Jennifer Huston, 28, went to run errands on July 24 but did not return home .

"By . Joel Christie . Richard Mangino was a typical married father-of-three who had worked most of his life at Logan International Airport in Boston as a ground crew director. But in 2002 - aged 55 - after developing kidney stones, he contracted sepsis, a terrible blood stream infection that doctors said would cause his four limbs to decay and inevitably fall off. As his hands turned black, the passionate musician from Revere made the decision to have a quadruple amputation. He quickly adjusted to life with prosthetic legs and arms with hooks at the end of them, first learning to put his glasses on, then drive and eventually even paint. But over the years he longed to be able to do more - mostly to hold the hands of his two grandsons - and then he read that Brigham and Women's Hospital had performed numerous face transplants. Scroll down for video . Dire: Richard Mangino's sepsis infection became so severe in 2002 his hands to decay and turn black . Amputation: With no other viable option, Mangino and his family made a decision - he would have all four limbs cut off and become a quadruple amputee . 'She's been unbelievable': Richard Mangino relied on the strength of his wife Carole. The two have now been married 45 years . Improvements: Slowly the father-of-three started to teach himself how to do the things he always had using his hooks . Big step: The first major hurdle was learning to put his glasses on . Mental health: Mangino turned to his creativity for psychological support . After meeting with doctors, Mangino was told that, at 65, he was too old for the still-experimental surgery. However his case was extensively reviewed and, noting Mangino's indefatigable spirit, the hospital decided to make an exception - they would give him new hands. 'My wife and I cried - everyone was crying,' Mangino said in an interview with Brigham and Women's Hospital. 'We knew this was it.' The bilateral mid-forearm transplant lasted 12 hours. Four teams had to work simultaneously. Some people were involved in the operation, including 14 surgeons. 'A v-shaped incision is used to accommodate the swelling and to prevent scar contractor,' Dr Simon Talbot MD, one of the chief plastic surgeons on the case, explained. 'Next the bones are joined with metal plates and screws. And next the muscle, tendons, arteries, veins and three major nerves of the forearm are joined.'

'This is it': Richard Mangino and Dr Mathew Carty, MD, prefer for the bilateral mid-forearm transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston in 2011 . In action: Multiple surgical teams at work in the operating room at Brigham and Women's Hospital during Richard Mangino's double hand transplant . Procedure: A video shows how the donor's arm was prepared to be transplanted onto Mangino . Complex: The surgeons used metal rods and bolts to connect the arms, before attaching muscle, tendons, arteries, veins and three major nerves . 'Pivotal': Surgeons say this was the defining moment of Mangino's surgery, as blood from his body starting coming out of the palm of his new hand, showing his body was accepting the transplant . Overjoyed: Mangino and his wife Carole post-surgery . Success: Mangino is acknowledged by Dr. Bohdan Pomahac (left) following a press conference at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Friday, October 14 2011 . Physiotherapy: Richard Mangino works with weights at home for hours at a time . The brain actually comes to the consider the new limbs as its own, doctors said. The surgical team said they had a 'defining moment' during the landmark procedure, where blood started to come out of Mangino's new hand. It showed his body had almost immediately accepted the transplant, or had achieved re-protrusion. 'Ive had a chance at a new life - to live and to hold my grandchildren. To hold my wife and my children. 'To do things as most people will do. I don't have to perform miracles anymore. I can just be a regular person.' But Mangino was sure to point out that what happened to him was no marvel. 'It's not a miracle,' he said. Back to it: Mangino is seen here doing chores one year after his transplant . Achievement: Richard Mangino manages to embrace his love for music again with his new hands, starting to play the piano . Content: Maybe one day he be able to play guitar ago. But for the moment Mangino is happy with the piano . Happy: Richard Mangino and his beloved grandsons . 'These people worked very hard at what they did for me.' Life since the surgery has become relatively 'normal' for Mangino, who has not only been able to play the piano again, but achieve his dream of playing with his grandchildren. 'I can now say hold my hand when we cross the street (to my grandson's), instead of hold my hook,' he said. One day he may be able to pick up a guitar again, he told WCVB this week,  as the feeling in his fingers continues to increase over time, but at the moment Mangino said he's happy with the piano.","Richard Mangino, 68, of Boston, lost both arms and legs to a sepsis infection in 2002 .

"By . Joel Christie . Three bumbling teens who spectacularly failed an armed robbery on a Houston sex shop have now been arrested. The trio - one of whom was brandishing a M-16 rifle - attempted to raid Katz Boutique, a 24 hour adult store on Interstate 45, about 3.10am on April 13, but were only recently brought into custody. The would-be thieves - aged 16, 15 and 15 - made their way through the store to the cash register, with one keeping lookout. One had the M-16, another a revolver and the lookout appeared to be unarmed, according to The Houston Chronicle. Scroll down for video .

Empty-handed: The man run out with nothing to a waiting car, but keep shooting . Final round: Even once they're out, the raiders keep firing, smashing the front door and discarding a total 11 bullets . 'During the robbery, the suspect with the revolver apparently bumped into the suspect with the rifle, causing the rifle to discharge,' police said. 'At that time, both males fired their weapons toward store employees as they ran out the door.' Some shots hit a mannequin and others shattered the glass front door. A total of 11 shots were fired, police said. However the trio left empty handed. Fortunately neither of the two employees in the novelty shop were hurt.

"By . Joel Christie . Pittsburgh Steelers player Cam Thomas is being sued for allegedly giving his ex-girlfriend genital herpes. The 27-year-old lineman has also been accused of lying to the woman, saying the 'puss-filled bumps on his buttocks and inner thigh' were the result of sweat buildup and that the noticeable sores on his penis came from a zipper accident. Thomas - who started 10 games for Pittsburgh last year - has vehemently denied the allegations through his legal team, who say the woman is after money. The lawsuit was filed in San Diego under the name 'Adrienne' and was obtained by TMZ Sports. Caught with pants down: Pittsburgh Steelers lineman Cam Thomas is being sued for allegedly giving his ex-girlfriend herpes and making excuses for the red sores on his genitals, thighs and buttocks . Adrienne claims she dated Thomas in 2010 when he played for the San Diego Chargersand that the two would often have unprotected sex. According to the lawsuit, she had a sexual health check up in December 2010 but the results were all clear. Then in February 2012 she tested positive for genital herpes. Adrienne maintains Thomas is the only person that she could have contracted the disease from. In her suit, Adrienne also claims Thomas was physically abusive during their relationship. However she never went to police to file a complaint. She's suing for sexual battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud through intentional concealment and negligence. Adrienne is seeking unspecified damages, however Thomas will fight the claims in court. Accused: Thomas dated the woman during his NFL stint with the San Diego Chargers in 2010.

Police do not know who whether the text was actually sent by the victim, April Millsap, whose body was found by joggers last Thursday off the popular Macomb Orchard Trail in Armada, some 35 miles northeast of Detroit. No arrests have been made, but a sketch of the male suspect has been released. Investigators say they are looking for a man in his 20s with medium-length curly hair. The man had been seen in the area where April was murdered, according to The New York Daily News. She was walking her dog, Penny, who was guarding her body and barked at the passers-by who inevitably found April. April generally walked her dog on the trail every night. Police have not released how April died, but have confirmed she was not shot or stabbed. Around 600 tips about the case have been reported. 'There's no such thing as a tip that's not worthwhile,' Armada police Chief Howard Smith said at a Sunday news conference.

"By . Tania Steere . An inspirational cancer sufferer who raised more than £3million has been forced to defend himself against cynical social media trolls after making a partial recovery. Terminally ill Stephen Sutton from Burntwood, Staffordshire, was able to go home from hospital on Friday after his health improved. The 19-year-old – who has raised the money for the Teenage Cancer Trust with his deeply moving blogs – welcomed the good news. But a handful of disgruntled donors claimed that they felt ‘conned’ by his recovery. Scroll down for video . Cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton's 'thumbs up' posts online have helped him raise £3million for charity . In an appalling reflection of the cynicism of social media, Stephen was forced to defend himself on Twitter yesterday, saying: ‘Sorry to disappoint you! So you know, I still have my cancer and it’s still incurable, if that makes you feel less “duped”.’ Some Twitter users questioned Stephen, with one saying: ‘I see that the almost dead teenager is now making a “recovery” since raising £3.1million. Surprise Surprise.’ Another wrote: ‘I must be a cynic to not believe #stephensstory in its entirety.’ Another user said: ‘#stephensstory err... I’d like refund please?’ And on the Birmingham Mail’s Facebook page, reader Sarah Hill said: ‘Am I the only one who thinks something is not quite right here? The 19-year-old's positive attitude has seen him amass thousands of fans around the world, including Prime Minister David Cameron and England footballer Steven Gerrard . Fighter: Sutton lost his long battle with bowel cancer on Thursday morning, aged 19 . ‘While I hope I am wrong it feels like we are being conned. ‘One minute he tweets saying he is dying and won’t see the next day, then all of a sudden he is being released to go home. As I said, I hope I am wrong but I have a strange feeling about this.’ Stephen, who has incurable bowel cancer, has won the support of hundreds of thousands of people and a host of celebrities after posting a final ‘thumbs up’ picture and a film about his bucket list of things he would like to do in the time he has left. When the teenager was told he could leave Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, he wrote: ‘After being at a point where it seemed like I’d never make it out it feels so awesome to be able to put that. The recovery I’ve undergone recently is quite remarkable. ‘This extra period I now have feels like a gift, one that I’m determined to use productively. I’ll probably be straight back to doing some crazy stuff/events/etc soon, but for now, it just feels great to be home!’ Even the Prime Minister has showed his support for Stephen, visiting him in hospital on Friday morning. David Cameron said: ‘He’s amazing, just an inspiration. ‘Anyone who watches his video on YouTube just can’t help but be impressed by his bravery and courage but also his incredible warmth and passion for life. It really is extraordinary.’","Stephen Sutton won thousands of fans for his bravery in face of disease .

"By . Joel Christie . A Florida man is facing possible prison time for being bitten by a snake. Eddie Chamberlain, of Fort Myers, was jailed last year for 80 days on a breaking and entering charge. Currently on probation, the 19-year-old was at his girlfriend's house in Cape Coral on July 23 when he saw a snake threatening a neighbors cat and her son, according to WTSP. Chamberlain caught the snake and put in a fish tank. Violated: Being bitten by a poisonous coral snake could land Eddie Chamberlain, 19, in prison for violating his probation . While handling the snake on Saturday, the animal bit him on the thumb. 'I've been bitten plenty of times,' Chamberlain told WTSP. 'Just not by a poisonous snake.' Chamberlain said his arm started going numb 30 minutes after the bite and then another 30 minutes later he had trouble breathing. So severe was the reaction, Chamberlain was taken to Lehigh Acres Regional Hospital, before being transferred to  Lee Memorial Hospital, where he was injected with anti-venom. He remained in hospital for three days. The snake was later identified as a coral snake, which are extremely poisonous. 'I was freaking out,' his mom Dawn told WTSP. However the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission may now decide to fine Chamberlain for keeping a venomous snake as a pet. Deadly: Coral snakes are extremely venomous, and are among just six of the 44 native snake species in Florida that are considered poisonous . The fine would a violation of Chamberlain's parole. State wildlife rules mandate a license and specific training to keep such a snake. Chamberlain said that a judge told him that if he violates probation he could end up back in prison. 'He told me I could get 25 years in prison,' he said. However Chamberlain is adamant the snake was not a pet. 'I saved the cat but almost lost my life,' he said. 'I kinda think I did the good thing.' 'It's kinda stupid that they're trying to (fine) me.' Only six of Florida's 44 native snake species are venomous. They are the eastern coral snake, the southern copperhead, the cottonmouth, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, the timber rattlesnake, and the dusky pygmy rattlesnake.","Eddie Chamberlain caught a snake in Cape Coral, Florida, and put it in a fish tank .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . The tropical storm that is threatening to ruin Fourth of July celebrations on the East Coast has North Carolina residents battening down the hatches and preparing for a hurricane. Tropical Storm Arthur has maximum sustained winds of nearly 60mph and is currently roaring up the Eastern Seaboard, headed for the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Authorities on Wednesday issued a hurricane watched for much of the North Carolina Coast from the Bogue Inlet near Jacksonville to the Oregon Inlet near Kill Devil Hills. A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of Florida and South Carolina. The National Weather Service predicts that Arthur will strengthen into a hurricane by tomorrow - just as millions of Americans prepare to head to the beach for the long Independence Day weekend. Scroll down for video . Moving north: Tropical Storm Arthur is 100 miles east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and traveling at about 6mph . Hurricane watch: Residents along the Outer Banks of North Carolina - a popular holiday tourist destination - were warned to be prepared for a hurricane . The storm will bring coastal flooding, rough surf, thunderstorms and heavy . downpours from the Carolinas to New England on Friday, with the worst of the weather expected to hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina early on Independence Day. Rains are expected to drench most of the Interstate 95 corridor during the holiday commute on Thursday, as well. 'Right now it’s predicted to be a . strong tropical storm, possibly a hurricane as it moves through the . Outer Banks. And that’s going to cause a lot of problems for people to . get out onto some of those roads and beaches out there,' AccuWeather senior meteorologist Paul Walker told MailOnline. The Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm plodded off Florida's coast but wasn't yet spooking too many in the storm's potential path. 'I think everybody's keeping one eye on the weather and one eye on the events this weekend,' said Joe Marinelli, president of Visit Savannah, the city's tourism bureau. As of 8am today, Arthur was centered about 100 miles east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Wednesday and was moving north at 6 mph. The Hurricane Center urged those as far north as parts of Virginia to monitor Tropical Storm Arthur's path. The storm is projected to pass closest to the coast early Friday and bring heavy rains to most of the northeastern U.S. on the Independence Day holiday . The storm will track northeast and away from the coast after side-swiping the Outer Banks on Friday. The weather is projected to turn sunny by Saturday . Off Florida's Space Coast beaches - the closest to Arthur - the sky was cloudy and winds fairly normal Tuesday, said Eisen Witcher, assistant chief of Brevard County Ocean Rescue. Red flags warned of rough surf, and beachgoers were advised to get into the water only in areas with staffed lifeguard stands. But overall, Witcher said, 'it's business as usual.' Red flags also flew Tuesday at Daytona Beach. By midday, a dozen swimmers had been aided by lifeguards when they got caught in a rip current. On any given day, 15 to 20 swimmers need help, said Tammy Marris, spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. Near the storm, 19 ill crew members were evacuated from a South Korean cargo ship after they showed signs of food poisoning. The cargo ship JS Comet was anchored 3 miles off Cape Canaveral, and the Coast Guard reported that deteriorating weather conditions were one factor in the decision to evacuate. In North Carolina's Outer Banks, officials said they would close Cape Lookout National Seashore at 5pm Wednesday and reopen when it's safe. Rough seas: Red flag warnings were issued for Daytona Beach on Tuesday thanks to Tropical Storm Arthur - but that didn't keep swimmers out of the water . Tropical Storm Arthur was centered about 95 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, early Tuesday. It was upgraded from a tropical depression on Tuesday morning . The motel Shutters on the Banks was completely booked for the holiday weekend, general manager John Zeller said, despite forecasts for potentially heavy rain, gusty winds and isolated tornadoes late Thursday and Friday. 'We have received some cancellations but not too many,' he said. 'Basically we are telling people to kind of wait and see what happens.' The motel has a 72-hour advance notice on cancellations, but Zeller said it will be waived if the storm tracks toward the area or warnings are issued. In Folly Beach, South Carolina, dozens of people fished from the pier under sunny skies Tuesday. Others surfed on gentle swells, sunbathed and looked for shells. In Savannah, rooms in the downtown historic district were expected to be at least 80 percent full for the holiday weekend, when crowds pack the beach on neighboring Tybee Island. Cancellations aren't uncommon when storms approach, but those calls weren't coming in Tuesday, Marinelli said. Amy Gaster said her Tybee Island vacation rental company had more than 200 beach homes and condos booked for the weekend, likely to be the busiest of the year. If forecasts start to show a serious threat, Gaster said her staff was prepared to send alerts to guests' cellphones. But as long as Arthur stays offshore, she said her biggest concerns are rip currents and possible thundershowers on Thursday, when thousands are expected to pack the Georgia coast's largest public beach for fireworks. 'Hopefully Mother Nature is going to cooperate with us this year,' Gaster said. A rainy Thursday commute will greet many East Coast travelers who are hoping to make it to their holiday destinations . Rain is expected across much of the East Coast, Southeast and in the Rocky Mountains on Friday - though it could clear up in time for fireworks . Beautiful weekend: The tropical storm is expected to clear away by Saturday, leaving nearly all the country to sunny skies . Most of the East Coast will also experience rough, possibly dangerous, conditions on the beaches as the storm passes by. 'All . along the Eastern Seaboard, there is going to be rough surf and rip . currents. It's going to be a threat for swimmers,' Mr Walker said. Forecasters hope the storm will break for the Mid-Atlantic on Friday night in time for some fireworks displays. However, it's remains possible that Arthur will turn the Fourth of July into a damp squib. The . tropical storm will also likely rub up against a storm front that's . rolling eastward from the Midwest, resulting in even more rain and . thunderstorms. 'As tropical moisture interacts with the front, very heavy downpours may erupt along the I-95 corridor late in the week,' AccuWeather Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok said. There's . still hope for a break in the weather just in time for Friday night's . Fourth of July celebrations for much of the northeast corridor. 'If . the tropical system takes a northeastward turn late in the week, as we . suspect, rain and thunderstorms will begin to shift eastward and out to . sea Friday afternoon and evening so that the weather improves for . fireworks Friday night from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia and New . York City,' Pastelok said. The . tropical storm is expected to push out to sea on Saturday - leaving the . rest of the holiday weekend sunny and pleasantly warm.","Tropical Storm Arthur is expected to strengthen into a hurricane Thursday .

"By . Tania Steere . A West End director has warned that theatres may need to bring in measures to curb the use of mobile phones after a nude performance was stopped because a man was suspected of filming the actors. Actor David Judge interrupted the performance of Athol Fugard’s Statements, a play in which the two lead actors at naked for most of the time, after he and fellow cast member Jasmine Hyde thought they spotted a man in the front row using his phone continuously. The actors suspected he was filming the show, but when he was questioned by staff at Jermyn Street Theatre, the man said he was texting his son who was ill. Nude drama: West End director Anthony Biggs  has warned that theatres may need to bring in measures to curb the use of mobile phones after an incident with naked actors and an audience member at Jermyn Street Theatre in London. File picture . Anthony Biggs, the theatre’s artistic director, told the Evening Standard: ‘Both actors were very concerned by what was happening. ‘Initially they just thought someone was texting, but the phone’s screen stayed on, and the man, who was just four feet away from them, seemed to be pointing it towards the actors.’ Theatre staff checked the man’s phone but did not find evidence of any footage of the play. Mr Biggs warned mobile phones can ‘ruin the experience’ of theatre and new measures may have to be brought in to curb usage during shows. The two actors at Jermyn Street Theatre (pictured) feared the man was filming them as they appeared on stage naked . Mr Biggs said theatres  may have to order audience members to leave if their phones go off and then ban them, ask them to hand in their phones at the beginning or even  use technology to block mobile phone and internet signals. He added: ‘In a live show audiences are part of the performance, it’s totally different to the cinema, they can ruin the experience, for example when David had to come out of character, it broke the spell and ruined the show. ‘At the moment we are fighting against a tide, and this will continue to happen unless we address why  people cannot disconnect from their phone for an hour and a half to experience live theatre.’","Actors stopped performance of 'Statements' after seeing man using phone .

Two robbers who broke into a suburban Oklahoma City house and held the owner at gunpoint three years agp must have thought they had gotten away with their crime by now - but Google saw what they did. And Google has not forgotten. The two men were spotted moments before their crime by a Google Street View van that happened to be mapping out the quiet neighborhood in July 2011. The victim, who spoke to KFOR-TV, says she only learned of the breakthrough recently when a neighbor happened to look up her street on Google Maps and spotted the men. Suspects: Three years after a violent robbery, a Google Street View image emerged of the robbers moments before their crime . The men were captured on camera - by accident - by a Google van that was mapping the neighborhood streets . Now the homeowner, who was held at gunpoint by the thugs for more than an hour while they ransacked her house, hopes the pictures of her two assailants - accidentally captured by Google - could lead to a break in the case after three years. The victim said that when her neighbor sent over the images from Google Street View, she instantly recognized them as the men who robbed her. Their faces are obscured - both by the grainy quality of the image and Google's software that automatically blurs pedestrians. However, police in Oklahoma City are hoping someone can recognize the two, who are believed to be the robbers. The victim said she did not want to give her name to KFOR because she still lives in fear after the robbery. 'They pulled a gun and held me for over an hour. There were times that I thought they would shoot me before they left,' the homeowner said. The woman said she happened to come home and walk in on the crooks looting her house. Instead of fleeing, they held her while they ransacked the home.

"By . Michael Zennie . A 19-year-old missionary from Oklahoma sexually abused up to ten African orphans - some as young as four years old - while volunteering at the shelter where they lived in Nairobi, Kenya, according to federal charges filed against him. Matthew Lane Durham was arrested last Thursday at his parents' home in Edmond, Oklahoma, after he fled Kenya when he was confronted with the sex abuse allegations. The founder of Upendo Children's Home, Eunice Menja, told the FBI that Durham admitted to assaulting between four and ten children, aged four to ten - including one who is HIV-positive - while volunteering at the orphanage between April and June of this year. He allegedly wrote out a sickening confession for Mrs Menja in which he detailed horrific acts of sexual abuse against both boys and girls. According to court documents, he admitted in the written confession that he raped at least three children and forced others to watch the sex abuse. Matthew Lane Durham, 19, faces federal sex abuse charges after he allegedly admitted to abusing as many as ten children at a Kenyan orphanage where he was volunteering . Durham had been on three mission trips to Upendo Children's Home. On his most recent visit, he had asked to stay in an overflow bunk on site, instead of with a host family . He also molested several other children and forced others to perform sex acts on him, according to court documents. In the alleged confession, he detailed forcing one young girl to have sex with him several times. 'Any time I try to read the Bible or pray, this image comes to my head,' he allegedly wrote. Durham's lawyer Stephen Jones, who has previously defended the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, says Mrs Menja forced a false confession from the Durham with 'pseudo-tribal psychological voodoo' and accused her of running a cult out of her orphanage. He told the Oklahoman newspaper that the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney was 'shot through with inaccuracies.' 'The events that occurred in Kenya the last maybe five six days that Matt was there frankly reveal some sort of pseudo-tribal psychological voodoo practiced on him, including confiscating his passport, false imprisonment, keeping food from him one day, delay in allowing him to depart from the country, misleading his parents,' Mr Jones told the newspaper. 'I don’t think Hollywood could make up what happened at this so-called orphanage. We’re on the ground in Kenya now. We’re finding out a lot about these people. This place is right on the outskirts of Nairobi. It's like some cult over there.' Durham, seen here surrounded by children from the orphanage, raised money in his hometown of Edmond, Oklahoma, for the charity in between his trips there . Durham's lawyer has issued a statement calling the charges against the teen 'shot through with inaccuracies' This was Durham's third mission trip to the orphanage in recent years and Mrs Menja had previously praised his compassion and eagerness to work with the troubled children at the shelter, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal district court in Oklahoma City. Durham helped raise money for the orphanage in his Oklahoma hometown, including giving a presentation at the Edmonton Rotary Club. Mrs Menja and her husband - both Kenyan immigrants who live in Oklahoma - founded Upendo Kids International, a Christian charity, that looks after troubled, unwanted and neglected children in a community on the outskirts of Nairobi. Every year, young Christian missionaries from the United States travel to the orphanage to work with the children. The orphanage is in a small town on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya . Eunice Menja and her husband, both Kenyan immigrants who live in Oklahoma, founded the orphanage and recruit missionaries from the U.S. to work there . Mrs Menja did not return a phone call and an email from MailOnline seeking comment. On Durham's most recent trip, he asked to sleep in an 'overflow bunk' at the orphanage, instead of staying with a sponsor family offsite. A Kenyan caretaker who lives at the orphanage began to notice that some of the orphans were acting strangely. When she began to question them, they revealed that Durham had been abusing them, court documents allege. Durham is charged with traveling with Intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct, engaging in Illicit sexual conduct in a foreign place, attempt and conspiracy and aggravated sexual abuse with children.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . A raging wildfire in central Washington has wiped most of a small town off the map - destroying 100 homes as it whips out of control across 260 square miles of dry forest - and fears are now growing that it will claim a second community. The Carlton Complex fire grew by nearly ten times Friday as four fires horrifically merged into one and exploded across the small village of Pateros, officials said. Residents of the town of Malott and outlying areas of nearby Brewster have been evacuated as flames rages only miles from their homes. 'We basically evacuated the whole town' of Malott, Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said Friday night. Those living in outlying areas of Brewster were also told to leave. Malott is home to about 500 people, while the population of Brewster is about 2,400. Scroll down for video . Charred: The foundation of a home and burned-out cars remain from a wildfire the night before, Friday, July 18, 2014, in Pateros, Washington . Scorched: The shell of a burned-out car remains from the fire racing through rural north-central Washington and blackened hundreds of square miles . Race against time: Flames make a run up a hill Friday, July 18, 2014, in Winthrop, Washington as they creep towards yet another town and residents flee their homes . A hospital in Brewster was evacuated Friday night, as were hundreds of residents, officials said. 'The fire is just kind of picking up and blowing down toward Brewster,' said Rogers. Smoke is blowing as far away as Spokane, 150 miles east of the smoldering towns. Firefighters dumped tankers full of fire retardant and tried to slow the fast-moving blaze, but were mostly helpless to protect home that got in the way of the flames. 'Mother Nature is winning here,' said Okanogan County Fire District Chief Don Waller told the Wenatchee World. 'I don’t like to lose structures. It truly bothers me. But there is nothing we can do about this.' At least 95 houses were destroyed in and around Pateros, Washington, a small community of 650 people and 279 homes. Authorities had ordered an evacuation of the town as the wildfire neared, fearing that it would destroyed. An aerial photo of the town shows entire blocks leveled - reduced to charred ash. David Brownlee, 75, said he drove away Thursday evening just as the fire reached the front of his home, which erupted like a box of matches. ""It was just a funnel of fire,' said Brownlee. 'All you could do was watch her go.' Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said late Thursday he's heard of no injuries from the Carlton Complex of wildfires. Smoldering: A chimney, a burned-out car and golf cart are all that remain on this Pateros property after it was ravaged by the fire . Wall of fire: A firefighter cools a tree in a line of fire Friday, July 18, 2014, in Winthrop. Officials have said they are fighting a losing battle to contain the raging blaze . Aftermath: Firefighters say 95 homes in tiny Pateros, Washington, were destroyed by the Carlton Complex fire that whipped through the town on Friday. There are only 276 homes in the entire community . Before: This is how the neighborhood looked before the wildfire blew through and leveled dozens of houses on Friday . Heartbreaking: Emma Franco, center, is consoled after she lost her mobile home in Pateros, Washington, on Friday. Nearly half the town was destroyed by the wildfire . A couple survey the burned out wreckage of what once was their home. Now, only the chimney remains. Entire blocked were leveled by the blaze . A losing battle: Despite the valiant efforts of firefighters, the blaze whipped out of control and remained zero percent contained on Friday . The sheriff issued his highest evacuation notice Thursday for Pateros, a town along the Columbia River.  Residents drove south to Chelan. A hospital in nearby Brewster was evacuated as a precaution, with the patients sent to Omak. 'The whole town was evacuated,' Rogers said in a telephone interview as he drove the eight-mile stretch between Brewster and Pateros. 'It was a chaotic mess but we got everybody on the highway.' 'There's nobody in Pateros' except a few 'stragglers' who stayed, he said, adding the fire was burning in the town, although the small business district was believed intact. Rogers said perhaps 15 to 20 homes have burned in Pateros and another 20 homes in the Twisp-Winthrop area. He had no estimate of how many homes have burned in the entire county of about 40,000 people. The situation in Brewster, population about 2,400, was 'pretty good,' Rogers said. 'It looks like Brewster's OK.' A law enforcement officer in the county for 30 years, and sheriff for 12, Rogers said this fire is the worst he's seen. All of his officers are working and help is coming from nearby Chelan and Douglas counties. 'Hold on,' he said as he drove, 'I've gotta go through a little bit of fire.' He . said the fire had jumped U.S. Highway 97 between Brewster and Pateros . and was burning along the Columbia.  Sections of several highways were . closed in the county. Early . Friday, the Okanogan County Sheriff's dispatch office said the roughly . 300 residents of the Chiliwist Valley, about 15 miles north of Pateros, . evacuated late Thursday night. Four wildfires converged into a single, massive blaze on Friday and immediately grew nearly ten times bigger - engulfing 260 square miles . Firefighters tried to suppress the spread of the blaze with air-drops of flame retardant - but to little avail . Nearly all 650 residents of the town were evacuated ahead of the fire. So far no casualties have been reported . With Lake Chelan, Washington, in the foreground, a large plume of smoke and steam rises from just south of Pateros Friday morning from the Carlton Complex Fire . Two major power lines, one feeding Pateros and one feeding Winthrop and Twisp, have burned, causing a widespread power outage in the county, said Scott Miller, the county's emergency manager. The Carlton Complex of fires has burned across at least 28 square miles of the scenic Methow Valley.  Fire spokesmen were not able to provide updated acreage Thursday night. There is zero containment on the complex, one of two major wildfires burning in central Washington. 'Our personnel have been so busy they're not able to get back to us quickly,' fire spokesman Tim Perciful said from an incident command post where the electricity was out due to the fire. For Friday's fire fight, 'We're trying to get more state resources,' Perciful said. About 100 miles to the south, the Chiwaukum Creek Fire chased people from nearly 900 homes as it burned near the Bavarian-themed village of Leavenworth. That fire sent a light dusting of ash over Leavenworth, where the German-style motif provides a backdrop to Oktoberfest and a Christmas tree lighting festival. The fire's smoke plume rose 25,000 feet into the air. The blaze closed 15 miles of U.S. Highway 2 in the area. 'There's a huge cloud of smoke above us,' Don Hurst, a retired firefighter who lives just outside of Leavenworth, said Thursday morning. 'The winds started to pick up a little. It's just like snowfall here with the ash coming down. It's fine ash. We're getting all this ash fall.' The fire destroyed a church - along with nearly 100 houses . Church members gathered around the wreckage of their house of worship and mourned - then worked to clean it up .

Another 800 homes were less seriously threatened. Authorities said Thursday that the Chiwaukum Creek Fire has grown to more than 10 square miles. It was first detected Tuesday. 'The weather and winds are not in our favor,' said fire spokeswoman Mary Bean. Temperatures have been in the triple digits with winds gusting as high as 30 mph. She said the cause of the fire is under investigation. About 1,000 firefighters were fighting blazes around the state that included the Mills Canyon Fire, the state's largest at 35 square miles. Worsening wildfire activity has prompted the governor's offices in both Washington and Oregon to declare states of emergency, a move that allows state officials to call up the National Guard. Elsewhere across the West: . OREGON: Two different lightning-sparked wildfires grew quickly in hot and dry conditions in central Oregon on Thursday, prompting evacuation alerts. Authorities said the Bridge 99 fire in the Cascade Range 20 miles north of Sisters tripled in size and threatened rural homes along the Metolius River. A top-level evacuation advisory urged residents to leave their homes immediately. In the Ochoco Mountains about 20 miles east of Prineville, the Bailey Butte Fire grew after getting into heavy timber in a wilderness area, prompting the Crook County Sheriff's office to advise residents of 27 homes to leave. The evacuation area included the Mount Bachelor Academy, which was shut down by the state in 2009 amid allegations it mistreated troubled teens. U.S. Highway 26 remained closed at the Ochoco Summit near Mitchell. They were among 13 large fires burning across Oregon. UTAH: A wildfire encroaching on homes in the Tooele County town of Stockton had burned about 200 acres. Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands spokesman Jason Curry said the fire burned part of a water tower but it's believed no homes have been destroyed. A 27-year-old Tooele man has been arrested on charges that he ignited the fire with matches. Police said the suspect, Timothy West, was a volunteer firefighter for the town several years ago, Curry told The Salt Lake Tribune. IDAHO: In central Idaho, the lightning-caused Preacher Fire has scorched more than 50 square miles, burning quickly through grass and brush. More than 300 personnel have been called in to suppress a wildfire inside the Boise National Forest that tripled in size overnight and is steadily spreading.

"By . Harriet Hernando . When planners in China were asked to construct a new railway line in a residential area, they came up with an ingenious way of getting round the problem of demolishing people's homes  – by building the track so it runs right through them. The astonishing train line runs right through the middle of the building in Chongqing, known as Mountain City for its countless skyscrapers, and is one of the most heavily populated areas in China with nearly 33 million people. Planners behind the monorail said they were forced to come up with the plan to cope with overcrowding in the city. There is even a small station which is captured in the footage shot by a passenger on the train. But instead of blighting residents’ lives with the sounds of trains passing through, planners claim the train line has increased the value of the apartments because it is so convenient for transport links. According to them, the trains produces just 60 decibels of noise as it passes through the building — about at loud as a dishwasher. City transport spokesman Yuan Cheng told the Daily Star: ‘Our city is very heavily built upon and that can make finding room for roads and railway lines a real challenge. All aboard! This train runs right through a block of flats in one of the most densely populated areas in China . Coming through: Locals say there is limited noise produced by the train and it has boosted property prices . ‘Sometimes there just isn't room on the ground so we have to think about going under, or over, or - in this case - straight through. ‘In a city as fast paced as this it was clear people wanted to get around quickly. Extending the railway line this way was a gamble, but it was one that paid off.’ The news comes as hundreds face having their homes bulldozed in the UK with the development of HS2, a high-speed railway line with trains running between London and Birmingham.","Planners built track through apartment block - instead of demolishing homes .

"By . Paul Harris . and Tania Steere . It seemed the perfect addition to their £1million home. Trevor and Carolyn Taylor were delighted with their new patio, laid in slabs of finest Indian sandstone at the front of their property – named Villa Sogno, Italian for Dream House. But other residents of the affluent commuter belt cul-de-sac were dismayed to find the couple had dug up and paved over a third of the road outside. Retreat: A builder begins to take down the gateposts before the offending patio is ripped up . It meant cars had limited space to move at the end of the 100ft road, forcing drivers to perform multi-point turns to manoeuvre their way out of the leafy close. Now, after a bitter legal dispute, a High Court judge has ordered Mr and Mrs Taylor to rip up the stonework as well as the fencing and gateposts they had cemented at its edge. They had effectively sealed off the area for their exclusive use, the court heard, taking over what had previously been a turning point for neighbours’ vehicles. Legal costs of fighting the case have left the Taylors £200,000 worse off. But yesterday after a year of disruption and inconvenience, neighbours won their court battle to reclaim the land along the private road in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. The town is one of Britain’s most exclusive – familiar to millions as the backdrop to film and TV locations, including one used for Inspector Morse. Judges at the High Court ruled the Taylors must dig up their patio, remove the gateposts and fencing, and reinstate the road surface. Amanda Tipples QC, deputy judge of the Chancery Division, said the ‘giant’ patio was a ‘substantial interference’ with other residents’ rights of way – and the Taylors had failed to show consideration for them. Instead, she said, Mr and Mrs Taylor presented their neighbours with what they wanted to do – and then went ahead with it in spite of objections. The judge did not accept the couple’s argument that they wanted the gates for security and said she believed they simply wanted to create ‘a large enclosed area that they can only use for themselves’. The court was told in a hearing last month that the Taylors, who run a company that makes bespoke metal gates, wanted to turn the cul-de-sac into a gated close. The two other couples living on the road – James and Helen Begley and Kenneth and Judith Mander – objected. Instead, Mr and Mrs Taylor then proposed putting a gate ‘halfway down’ the close that would give access to all their homes. A year later the Taylors’ solicitors wrote to the neighbouring couples to tell them building work was starting and they were advised they must keep the road clear ‘at all times’. Before they could fully discuss the matter, gateposts were added and the fencing went up. Battleground: The disputed private cul-de-sac in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, where the drama unfolded . The judge observed that parking in the cul-de-sac had been ‘a real challenge’ since September 2012. She dismissed the Taylors’ counter-claim for a declaration that the neighbours were not entitled to access and that the gate would not interfere with their rights of way. Last night friends of Mrs Taylor, 62, said she and her 65-year-old husband were ‘heartbroken and devastated’ over the ruling. The Taylors bought the disputed land when they purchased Villa Sogno seven years ago, and they had always used it as a driveway. They argued the previous owner used to keep six cars and a boat on it and that their neighbours did not use the land. But neighbours claimed prescriptive rights over the land after saying they had exercised a right of way on it for 20 years, the period required under the 1832 Prescription Act. It is understood the Taylors maintain they own the land, which is part of a private road, and therefore did not require planning permission for the patio.","Wealthy couple fenced off, dug up and paved over road outside their home .

Former Great British Bake Off contestant Glenn Cosby has created a dish containing edible insects. He dreamed up the concoction as part of Rentokil's Pestaurant Bug Off competition - and can be seen making it in the footage. The winning recipe will be dished up to the public. Mr Cosby said: ‘The crickets have a lovely crunch to them, they go well with nuts, and they really take up the caramel flavour. They should give a bit of texture as well as a nutty flavour on top.’ He starts off by making the sponge with butter, flour, sugar and eggs. He adds baking powder and cocoa, mixes it all together and pops it in the oven. Mr Cosby then mixes the peanut butter with cream and in a frying pan he melts sugar to make caramel, adding hundreds of dried crickets to the mix. He said: ‘Crickets are perfect for this. They’re a superfood too – they’ve got more protein and fewer calories than beef or chicken.’ Crunchy: Ex British Bake Off star Glenn Cosby bites down on his 'chocolate cupcakes topped with peanut and cricket brittle' After the insects are caramelised, he tops the cupcakes with the crunchy crickets. Tasting his creation, he concludes: ‘The peanut butter actually worked pretty well with the crickets. They’ve got a nice bit of crunch.’ Ex co-stars Holly Bell and Ruth Clemens have also joined in Rentokil's Pestaurant Bug Off competition.

"By . Harriet Hernando . Government spy agency GCHQ is accrediting six universities to train the next generation of cyber spooks to combat rising levels of online crime. The six accredited courses include ‘ethical hacking’, on offer at the University of Lancaster, where students attempt to break into systems to learn how to defend them. And Napier University in Edinburgh has created a mock online bank, which students can hack into. Six universities accredited by GCHQ are training the next James Bonds of the cyber world . Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, which implements the national cyber security programme along with the Office of Cyber Security, officially announced the certification during a visit to GCHQ in Gloucestershire. ‘Cyber security is a crucial part of this government’s long-term plan for the British economy,’ he said. ‘Through the excellent work of GCHQ, in partnership with other government departments, the private sector and academia, we are able to counter threats and ensure together we are stronger and more aware.’ Mark Hughes, the president of BT’s security team, said there was a ‘skills gap’ for cyber security know-how in the UK and welcomed the arrival of GCHQ’s first accredited courses. He said: ‘At BT we are acutely aware of the impact of the UK cyber skills gap and recruiting the right people with the right knowledge and skills is a big deal for us. As a leading Internet service provider we want to employ the very best.’ In a bid to make the UK one of the safest places in the world to do online business, the government is ploughing money into the courses. The news to train students to combat cyber threats was announced at GCHQ headquartes in Cheltenham . To qualify for funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, universities must prove they are conducting world class research.

"By . Harriet Hernando . A lorry driver suffered shocking injuries after being stabbed with broken bottles after he tried to break up a fight between two strangers - which left his insides hanging out. Anthony Dukes was stabbed 11 times in a secluded area of the picturesque Astbury Mere Country Park in Congleton, Cheshire, close to the visitors' centre. The 25-year-old had been swimming in the park lake with friends when he spotted two men fighting and decided to intervene. Cut to shreds: Anthony Dukes, 25, suffered horrific injuries when he tried to break up a fight and he was then stabbed with beer bottles - leaving his insides hanging out . But two beer bottles smashed together became jagged weapons causing horrific injuries to his face, chest and arms. Mr Jukes, who was wearing swimming trunks at the time, said: ‘I tried to stop a fight when I was attacked. ‘It all got out of hand. I don't really know what happened. ‘I felt no pain. People knew before me that I had been stabbed.’ Mr Dukes’ friends, a group of six men and two women, were swimming in the lake when they saw their friend being attacked. They rushed out of the water to help. Mr Dukes said: ‘I just heard somebody shout, 'Jukes, you are bleeding bad, get a towel.’ He only survived the brutal attack when an off-duty paramedic, who was in the park with his family, came to the rescue. Mr Dukes, 25, had been swimming in the lake in Astbury Mere Country Park in Congleton, Cheshire, when he spotted the fight and jumped out of the water to try and break it up . He said: ‘I looked down and could see my insides. ‘I was holding my rib cage and stomach because I didn't want all the blood to come out. ‘I kept as calm as I could because if you are stressed, your blood pressure goes up. ‘I felt I was going because of all the blood I lost.’ The paramedic stemmed the loss of blood with towels until an ambulance took him to University Hospital of North Staffordshire where he spent four hours in surgery having more than 100 stitches. Mr Jukes said: ‘Doctors told me I was very lucky. If there hadn't been an off-duty paramedic there, this could have been a very different situation.’ Lorry driver Mr Dukes needed more than 100 stitches and spent four hours in surgery. He will spend at least a month recovering before he can return to work . He is now recovering at his home in Packmoor, Stoke-on-Trent, with parents Terry and Linda. Mr Dukes had hoped to start a new job as a heavy goods vehicle driver but he will need to take a month off work to recover. But his manager has promised the role will still be waiting for him when he is better. Police have arrested and bailed a 27-year-old Fenton man, pending further inquiries and appealed for more witnesses. Mr Dukes’ father Terry, 57, said: ‘What has happened is absolutely diabolical. Anyone who has information should come forward. This could have been their son or their friend.’ Witnesses should call police on 01244 350 000, quoting incident number 1005 of July 26, or call Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555111.","Anthony Dukes was enjoying an evening with friends in Astbury Mere Country Park in Congleton, Cheshire, when he intervened in fight .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A new mother was touched by the kindness of strangers who went out of their way to get formula milk for her baby when she was trapped in a traffic jam. Shelley Ruck was caught in a 30-mile tailback in soaring temperatures after a cement truck collided with a heavy goods vehicle. But some people who had gathered on a bridge near junction 34 of the M6, south of Lancaster, noticed her distress and came to her rescue. New mother Shelley Ruck, 33, from Warrington was stranded with baby George in a nine hour traffic jam in soaring temperatures on the M6 with just one bottle of milk. But some Good Samaritans came to her rescue and went and fetched some formula . They drove for 20 minutes to the nearest shop and came back with a box of milk powder, two sterilised bottles filled with boiling water and a bottle of spring water which they lowered down to her from the bridge using a jerry can. ‘It was the kindest thing that anyone could have done,’ said Ms Ruck. ‘It was absolutely unbelievable. They saved us. My baby would have been hungry if it were not for their amazing thoughtfulness and kindness.’ Ms Ruck, from Warrington, was stuck until 11pm with her mother Denise and her eight-month-old baby George with just one bottle of formula milk. The soaring temperatures saw police on the scene handing out water to dehydrated drivers. She said: ‘There were people fainting and there was an old lady who had to be taken away in an ambulance because of the heat. Tensions among drivers were running high. ‘It was horrific. If George had woken up I would have had no milk and it would have been dire.’ The 30-mile tailback on the M6 was caused by a collision between a cement truck and a heavy good vehicle . She is keen to thank the mystery Good Samaritans, who would not accept payment for the money they spent. She said: ‘I don't know who they were, but thank God they were there to help. I want to give them a massive thank you. What they did was unimaginable.’ Further along the M6, other drivers spoke of strangers who came to their rescue while they were stuck in the jam. Matthew Jones, 21, was stranded in the tailbacks at junction 36 near Kendal. He saw a farmer help people into his field so they could relieve themselves. Mr Jones, a politics student from Cheshire, said he also saw lorry drivers manoeuvre their vehicles at an angle to provide much-needed shade to hot, dehydrated people stranded in the glaring sun. ‘Everyone pulled together,’ said Matthew. ‘We were all in a terrible position. I didn't have anything to eat or drink in the car but people who did have bottles of water or food were handing them around. There were strangers helping strangers in their hours of need.’ A spokesperson from the Highways Agency said it would have been unsafe for motorists to carry on driving before the road was cleared and thanked people for their patience.","Shelley Ruck was trapped in the 30-mile tailback on M6 south of Lancaster .

"By . Harriet Hernando . Actress Julie Walters makes a shocking discovery about one of her ancestors when she discovers that her great-grandfather attacked a man with a knife - and was accused of murder. In the new BBC1 show Who Do You Think You Are, where celebrities trace their ancestry and discover secrets from their past, Ms Walters, 64, learns relative Anthony Clarke was charged in 1884 after drunkenly attacking the man. Birmingham born Ms Walters said: 'I will have to write a script about him. What a life he has had.' Actress Julie Walters is shocked to discover her family's violent past on BBC1 show Who Do You Think You Are . Clarke, from Islandeady, County Mayo in Ireland, was charged with murder when the man – a 75-year-old called James Joyce - died a few days later. But it was downgraded to common assault when it emerged he'd died of natural causes and was not seriously injured in the attack. The Harry Potter star was initially . proud after finding out her Irish great-grandfather founded the Land . League to protect farmers being thrown off their land when faced with . debt and starvation in the 19th century. The Land League eventually won tenant farmers the right to buy land and by 1917, most had their own plots. But Clarke died in 1918 without having benefited from the reforms he fought for because he did not have any land to his name. Ms Walters, who also starred in Calendar Girls, said:  ‘He still didn't get his land after all that. It is awful being an activist for all those years, he still never got to own his land. He put his neck on the line. ‘An active friend of democracy, I am so proud of him. He was brave and there at the very beginning of the movement that changed the land laws in Ireland. Actress Julie Walters, pictured here with Helen Mirren (left) in the 2003 comedy Calendar Girls, also learned that another relative stole land from farmers in the BBC1 TV show Who Do You Think You Are . ‘One of the great sadnesses of this story is that Anthony Clarke died without being able to buy his land which he had fought for for 40 years. But his legacy is far greater than that bit of land. He changed history here. ‘A man I have never met and knew nothing of, that I can feel so involved with him. I feel something for him which is an extraordinary thing, do I love him? Yes. That is a wonderful feeling.’ But where Clarke fought for the land rights of farmers, Ms Walters discovers another relative -  great great great grandfather Cummins Buchanan, was a “land grabber”, in the same TV show. It is revealed that Buchanan stole farmland from others for his boss when they fell behind their rent and voted against reforms which would have helped the poorest in Ireland. She said: ‘When I first saw that he turned down help for poor starving men, my heart sank,’ she said. ‘To then found he had taken land, like everyone really he was doing the best for his family as he saw it. ‘I am not going to get angry but it is a dreadful thing to do.I can't bear it. To take land off another farmer... gosh an extraordinary thing.’ Who Do You Think You Are? Returns to BBC1 next Thursday at 9pm with Julie Walters' episode.","The BBC1 show traces celebrity ancestry and reveals secrets from the past .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A pioneering takeaway boss has created the ultimate nightcap for punters who want to continue the night long after last orders – battered booze. Northerner John Clarkson, who runs Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Ribbleton, near Preston, Lancashire, is selling deep fried ‘shots’ alongside the more traditional meal of fish and chips. He decided to combine alcohol with food so customers could ‘get full and merry at the same time’. Hot shots: John Clarkson of Mister Eaters Eating Emporium in Preston, Lancashire, has created the ultimate post pub snack - battered booze. Each 'hot shot' contains one measure of alcohol . The sponge inside the 'shots' is soaked in alcohol and comes in a range of flavours including Baileys, Apple Sourz, Tequila, Disaronno, vodka and cola, Malibu and Jagermeister . And he says the £3 'hot shots', which consist of a sponge mixture combined with either Baileys, Apple Sourz, Tequila, Disaronno, Vodka, Malibu or Jagermeister, are a hit. He said: ‘Once you’ve had one, you just want another. I suppose it’s the same as when people say they’re just going for one pint.’ Mr Clarkson, 54, who has hit headlines in the past for creating the deep-friend mince pie and Ferrero Rochers, said the ‘shots’ were particularly tricky to make because the alcohol disperses during the cooking process. So he teamed up with wife Corrine, 39, who took inspiration from a popular British dessert – the sherry trifle. Mr Clarkson combines sponge with alcohol like Baileys, Apple Sourz, Tequila, Disaronno, Vodka, Malibu and Jagermeister. He got his inspiration from the sherry trifle . Kebab: Mr Clarkson has created a variation of the traditional kebab at his takeaway in Preston, Lancashire - an alcohol 'shot' which combines deep fried sponge with booze . Using the sponge mixture from the trifle combined with lashings of booze, Mr Clarkson was able to deep-fry the mixture so the alcohol keeps its original kick. Each portion is a standard shot glass measure and Mr Clarkson asks customers to bring their own alcohol as the chippy does not have a licence to sell booze. He said: ‘Whatever they want, we make it. No-one has done deep-fried alcohol before, but I’ve well and truly given it my best shot.’","Northerner John Clarkson, 54, created the alcoholic snack in his takeaway .

"By . Harriet Hernando . A finalist in Britain’s Shed of the Year competition might have to reduce his pride and joy to bricks and mortar – because he’s been letting it out without the say-so of council chiefs. Jonathan Melville-Smith, 61, built the 80 sq ft shed out of recycled wood in his back garden in Lizard, Cornwall, but it is much more than your average outhouse. Inside it contains a table, gas hob, basin, shelves, seats and a bunk bed on a tiny mezzanine level. Mr Melville-Smith explained: ‘It’s sort of a wibbly-wobbly shape and has a door that looks a bit like a flame and reminds people of pixies and fairies.’ Scroll down for video . Jonathan Melville-Smith's shed, which is in his back garden in Lizard, Cornwall, is a finalist in Britain's Shed of the Year competition. But he may have to pull it down as he has been letting it without the council's permission . Not just a shed: The interior contains a table, gas hob, basin, shelves, seats and a bunk bed . Mr Melville-Smith had been letting out the 'pixie grotto' to holidaymakers keen to see St Keverne, an area of outstanding natural beauty in Cornwall . Magical: The shed's front door reminds people of pixies and fairies . But the very same qualities which won it a place as a finalist in the annual competition might risk its future. Homeowners are allowed to put up modest outbuildings without special authorisation. But the shed needs consent because Mr Melville-Smith has been letting it out to holidaymakers keen to appreciate the sights of St Keverne - an area of outstanding natural beauty in which it lies. But Mr Melville-Smith insists he had no idea it needed Cornwall Council’s go ahead before he built it last year along with a series of gypsy huts, which he also now lets out. He said: ‘At the time I didn’t really think garden sheds needed planning permission. Creature comforts: The shed, which Mr Melville-Smith has been letting out, contains a all the mod cons to provide a comfortable break . Mr Melville-Smith has submitted a planning application to Cornwall Council and hopes that he will not have to tear his creation down . ‘I didn’t set it out as a holiday let. I suppose I thought at the time, ‘it’s a shed’. Now he has applied for planning permission in a bid to sway planners – otherwise he will have to stop using the shed as holiday accommodation or risk having to pull it down. Mr Melville-Smith said the unique accommodation was an asset to the area and attracted lots of tourists. ‘Lots of people stop and take photographs and say how special it is to see something so unusual. ‘They wouldn’t come to Cornwall if it wasn’t for our unique accommodation.’ A spokesman for Cornwall Council said it was waiting to receive Mr Melville-Smith’s planning application before taking further action.","Jonathan Melville-Smith built the shed in his back garden in Lizard, Cornwall .

"By . Harriet Hernando . While parts of Britain are mopping up after flash floods and others are basking in warm weather, stranger things appear to be happening in the sky. One photographer captured sun streaming through the clouds which looked like a spaceship was about to land or something out of 70’s movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind, while another snapped a cloud in Exeter in the shape of a magic carpet. Photographer Adrian Campfield was having dinner with his wife Louise at a restaurant at Beachy Head, East Sussex, when the eery rays suddenly appeared from between the clouds and beamed onto the water. Scroll down for video . Paranormal activity: Photographer Adrian Campfield took this image at Beachy Head in Sussex and said it looked like 'something from Close Encounters of a Third Kind' Mr Campfield said the eery lights were changing for about 15 minutes at Beachy Head in Sussex . The 59-year-old rushed outside onto the 535ft high cliffs to watch the spectacle unfold. Mr Campfield, a former graphic designer, from Bexley, Kent, said the light was changing for more than 15 minutes. He said: ‘I have taken pictures of rays before but never quite like this. It brought to mind the sequences from the film 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. ‘I was pleasantly shocked and stunned because you never expect to witness anything like this. This was an outstanding sight and I was very lucky to be in the right place at the right time.’ Mr Campfield took more than 50 photos, including his favourite of a gull standing on the rocky cliff edge. The rays looked similar to a scene from Spielberg's 1977 sci-fi film Close Encounters of the Third Kind . A message from outer space? A seagull watches the bizarre light shining through the clouds at Beachy Head . He said: ‘We looked out of the restaurant window and saw those rays starting to appear over the sea. Once outside, the height of the cliffs was ideal because my eye level was above the horizon, giving me much more dramatic angles and perspectives. ‘I had to work fast because the light and rays were changing all the time and the atmosphere and moods were fantastic.’ Meanwhile residents in Exeter, Devon, were amazed when they spotted what looks like a flying carpet in the sky. Magic carpet ride? Residents in Exeter, Devon, took this incredible shot of a cloud in the shape of a rectangle . Unsurprisingly Met Office experts rubbished claims this could be a close encounter of the third kind and explained the cloud was caused by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air . But officials at the Met Office was quick to dismiss the possibility of an encounter of the third kind. Met Office employee Laura Gilchrist tweeted the image on July 26: ‘So this evening, over Exeter, there was a rhombus-shaped cloud’. A spokesman for the Met Office said the cloud had been formed by a jet engine moving through a pocket of air with the ‘right conditions’. He said: ‘This cloud has been formed from the exhaust of a jet engine - known as a contrail.‘In this case an aircraft has moved through a pocket of air with the right conditions for the contrail to form, meaning there is just a short section. ‘The wind is blowing across the contrail, and due to the right atmospheric conditions this is causing the ice crystals in that trail to spread outwards - creating this rectangular shaped cloud. ‘It’s unusual to see the cloud edges quite so well-defined as in this example but the processes involved are very common.’","Photographer Adrian Campfield captured the image at Beachy Head, Sussex .

"By . John Hall . Polar air sweeping down from Canada is causing heavy downpours and bringing record-breaking cold weather in parts of the U.S..

Several inches of rain fell in just a few hours in the area over the weekend, with temperatures plummeting as a result of the cold air being forced into the U.S. from the Arctic . Temperatures across parts of eastern and central U.S. will be more reminiscent of late October or early November this week, as the dip in the jet stream forces cold Arctic air much deeper into the country than it normally would. According to the National Weather Service, the weather in Minnesota's Twin Cities - Minneapolis and Saint Paul - was record-breakingly cold yesterday. With a high of just 18C, yesterday's cold weather smashed the Twin Cities' previous record for a July 14 temperature. The previous July 14 record of 20C had stood for an astonishing 130 years, since 1884. Despite the poor weather conditions it is not, however, the second coming of a polar vortex, a phrase the .

'I think people are pretty sensitive to those words,' she said. Divide: The current cold weather in the U.S. has its roots in an Asian typhoon. Though Typhoon Neoguri has weakened since hitting Japan, it altered the path of the North Pacific jet stream, allowing polar air behind a trough of low pressure to spill out of Canada and into the Midwest.

The North Pacific jet stream, which is also known as the polar jet stream, is a fast flowing narrow air current which has a significant impact on the weather in Asia, North America and Europe. Although it is usually stable and relatively easy to predict, typhoons or severe storms - most frequently in Asia - can easily disrupt the flow, causing the sort of extreme weather currently hitting North America. The cold . weather in much of the country is in stark contrast to the Pacific .

"By . Harriet Hernando . The traditional family structure with a father as the breadwinner and a mother who stays home to raise children is becoming increasingly uncommon in Britain. Just one in five families fits the 'traditional' model which has become less popular over the past decade, research shows. In Britain, 22 per cent of families were made up of a male breadwinner and a female who did not work in 2011, a slight decline from 23 per cent a decade earlier. Only one in five British families fits a traditional structure with a father who works and a mother who stays at home to raise the children . The research on modern fatherhood was conducted by the University of East Anglia, the Institute of Education and NatCen Social Research who surveyed 1,500 men across eight countries - France, Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Poland and Britain. The results showed that the number of male breadwinners is declining across Europe - with Spain showing the biggest drop. This was attributed to the availability of part-time work and flexible jobs. Dr Sara Connolly, from the University of . East Anglia, said: ‘We are seeing not only a greater level of equality . in economic provisioning between parents, but also a growth in new . working models involving more part-time and other flexible forms of . employment.’ A decade ago nearly half of all families were headed by a man, but figures from 2011 show that this has dropped to 28 per cent. Greece fell from 46 per cent to 36 per cent, while Sweden and the Netherlands were shown to have the lowest number of working fathers. End of an era? This graph shows how male breadwinners are declining in Europe with Spain and the Netherlands showing the biggest fall between 2001 and 2011 . Fathers were also surveyed on how their job affected family life. More than a quarter of British fathers said they are always or often too tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to do at home with their family, and another 35 per cent said they often worry about work problems even when they are not in the office. Dr Svetlana Speight, of NatCen Social . Research, said: ‘This research shows that in the UK many fathers allow . their job to undermine their family life. 'It suggests that there are . lessons we can learn from countries like the Netherlands where fathers . appear to have a better work life balance.’ Professor Margaret O’Brien, director of the Thomas Coram Research Unit, also said the research showed that many British fathers allowed their job to encroach on home life. She said: ‘Nearly one-third of British fathers still work over 48 hours a week and a tenth over 60 hours a week. ‘If the coalition government is really serious about being family friendly it should sign up to the EU Working Time Directive, which will take pressure of British families and allow parents the choice of sharing work hours between them in a more balanced and modern way.’","The number of British fathers who bring home the bacon is declining .

Bread and butter: Mr Backon, 18, was buttering his bread when he made the gruesome discovery . The 18-year-old said: ‘I was going out with friends and was putting together a packed lunch. ‘I took out a piece of bread and was just about to butter it when I noticed a little black speck. ‘At first I just thought it was a bit of mould or something but then I took a proper look at it and behold, there was a dead insect wedged inside the slice. ‘I was absolutely disgusted.’ Mr Backon said the insect was approximately the size of a 50 pence coin. The teenager bought the loaf from his local Costcutter store. Mr Backon took the loaf back to his local Costcutter in Bournemouth and they exchanged it immediately . He said: ‘I took some pictures on my phone. Then I took it back to Costcutter to get a new one. ‘They were really good and exchanged it straight away. I can’t bear to think that I could have actually eaten the insect if I hadn’t spotted it. I think I will be sticking to Hovis from now on.’ A Kingsmill representative visited Mr Backon’s home and launched an investigation into the gruesome discovery. A spokesperson said: ‘After receiving Mr Backon's complaint, we collected the product for analysis. 'We can confirm that the object is not a cockroach, but a fly. On initial inspection we believe that the fly has not been baked, and it most likely entered the loaf post production, rather than on our site. 'We will be able to confirm this after further testing.’ A spokesperson for Costcutter said: 'Quality is a priority for Costcutter Supermarkets Group and all of its retailers, particularly when it comes to products. 'It is unfortunate that this particular loaf of Kingsmill bread was purchased in one of our stores.

Baraa is a known pseudonym of Amin and is very similar to the name Abu Bara . al-Hindi - the moniker Amin was identified by in the ISIS recruitment . video. It is impossible to independently verify the alleged death of Amin, who was born in Bangladesh but settled in Scotland as a child and went to primary and secondary school in Aberdeen. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office . said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in . Iraq. We stand ready to talk to any family who may be affected. 'The . UK is deeply concerned by the growth of terrorism in Iraq and Syria, . which threatens the people in the entire region and the UK. The UK . advises against all travel to Syria and much of Iraq and anyone . travelling to these areas is exposing themselves to serious risk.' Propaganda: Former Aberdeen schoolboy Abdul Raqib Amin (right) was filmed alongside fellow British extremists Reyaad Khan (left) and Nasser Muthana (centre), both 20, urging other Muslims to fight for ISIS . Wearing wrap-around sunglasses with a white scarf around his head and a machine gun tucked under his left arm, Amin was seen describing jihad as 'the cure for depression' in last month's ISIS recruitment video . Amin's parents are believed to have run a restaurant in Aberdeen for a number of years, before returning to Bangladesh. Amin later moved to Leicester, where he worked various part-time jobs - including as a pizza delivery boy and in a salon. After Amin was identified as one of the three British jihadists who appeared in the ISIS recruitment video, his friends spoke of their shock that at seeing the keen footballer and ‘hyper, energetic lad’ boast of waging holy war in the Middle East. Wearing wrap-around sunglasses and a white scarf around his head, Amin was seen describing jihad as ‘the cure for depression’ in the video. Speaking in front of ISIS’s black flag, he says: ‘Are you willing to sacrifice the fat job you’ve got, the big car you’ve got, the family you have? Are you willing to sacrifice this, for the sake of Allah? ‘Definitely, if you sacrifice something for Allah, Allah will give you 700 times more than this.’ Militant: It is impossible to independently verify the alleged death of Amin (pictured), who was born in Bangladesh but settled in Scotland as a child and went to primary and secondary school in Aberdeen . Militants: ISIS members fighting in the Middle East (pictured) said a Briton referred to as Abul Baraa - a known nom de guerre of Abdul Raqib Amin - was killed fighting government forces near Ramadi in Iraq . After the ISIS video emerged, one person who knew . Amin in Aberdeen said he enjoyed drinking alcohol and going to . nightclubs as a young man, and would deal with any trouble ‘with his . fists’. ‘He was a bit . arrogant – a bit aggro, maybe something to prove. He ended up in a lot . of fights,’ the man, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC. ‘To learn he’s accepted religion in such an extreme way is a bit . shocking. Shocking because he’s a youth from Aberdeen who’s ended up . somewhere like that.’ Amin . attended St Machar Academy in the city and friends describe him as a . well-integrated member of society who was a keen footballer player. It . is understood he lived in the north of Aberdeen, near the city’s Mosque . and Islamic Centre. Imam Sheikh Ibrahim Alwawi said last night: ‘We are . shocked like everyone else.’ Defence force: Iraq has sent an additional 4,000 mainly Shi'ite troops (pictured) to the embattled town of Ramadi to help bolster government forces locked in a running battle with Sunni militants . Raqqa, . where Dujana claims to have heard news of Amin's alleged . death, is considered the capital of the Islamic State - the name ISIS . has given to its recently established Sunni caliphate. The embattled city of Ramadi, on the other hand, may be in overwhelmingly Sunni territory, but remains held by the Shii'te-led Iraqi government. The . Shi'ite-dominated force ensuring the town remains in the hands of the . government is made up almost entirely of reservists who answered calls . by Iraq's leading Shia cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani to take up arms . against the brutal Sunni insurgency. The . government's reliance on Shi'ite troops to fight Sunni militants is . fueling fears Iraq could descend into the kind of sectarian bloodletting . that engulfed the country in 2006 and 2007. Ramadi is capital of the Sunni-majority province of Anbar, much of which has fallen to ISIS forces. Insurgents . took control of Ramadi and the neighbouring town of Falluja earlier . this year.

"By . John Hall . Nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off, birth rates in the Washington D.C. area have soared. With parks closed and dismal October weather keeping many workers indoors, those affected by the shutdown were forced to seek simpler methods to keep themselves amused - the results of which are clearly now bearing fruit. The shutdown itself - which lasted from October 1 to October 16 - took place after the Republican-dominated Congress failed to pass their Federal Budget for 2014 in protest at the U.S. President's radical 'Obamacare' overhaul of the healthcare system. Nothing else to do: Nine months after the shutdown gave government workers an unexpected 16 days off and closed numerous attractions (pictued) birth rates in the Washington D.C. area have soared . With 850,000 employees affected, a total of 6.6million working days were lost as a result of last year's government shutdown - the longest in U.S. history. The cost to the American economy is estimated to be £2.2billion. But perhaps the most surprising impact of the 16 day break is a dramatic increase in the birth rate in the Washington D.C. area. Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., has seen an additional . three births per day in July, according to spokesman Gary Stephenson. 'We’re at near-capacity right now,' Stephenson told ABC News, joking that some furloughed workers 'apparently found ways . to amuse themselves.' Meanwhile Virginia Hospital in nearby Arlington delivered almost 100 more babies in the April, May and June than they did in the same period last year, according to . spokeswoman Maryanne Boster. Rising numbers: Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C. (pictured), has seen an additional three births per day in July, according to the official staff spokesman Gary Stephenson . No entry: With 850,000 employees affected, a total of 6.6million working days were lost as a result of last year's government shutdown - the longest in U.S. history . 'How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people?' anchor Brian Williams joked during NBC's Nightly News. There is a great deal of debate over whether or not events like the shutdown do lead to a spike in births. While some sceptics say pregnancies are so random that any given hospital can have a single birth one day and 20 the next, others are convinced there is a link. Dr Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ senior medical contributor and a practicing obstetrician said: 'I can say that I've definitely seen spikes after things like hurricanes, blackouts and blizzards.' Closed for business: The cost to the American economy is estimated to be £2.2billion. But perhaps the most surprising impact of the 16 day break is a dramatic increase in the birth rate . 'I’m not aware of any hard data on this, . but anecdotally, many obstetricians will ask their patients about the . events nine months prior, and many women will say 'Yes, we conceived . during the blackout',' she added. The link between births and major events is nothing new; nine months after Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. eastern seaboard, the birth rate in New Jersey was up 74 per cent on the previous year. And an even clearer indicator came during 1989, when South Carolina was hit by Hurricane Hugo. Nine months after the storm, the state saw the birth rate spike in each of the nine counties declared disaster areas, but in neighbouring counties that were unaffected, the birth rate was normal.","Birth rate has spiked in Washington D.C. area nine months after shutdown .

The 69-year-old from North Yorkshire, who has not been named, was last seen in the Kiel Canal in Brunsbuttel, Germany, before making the homebound journey on his 17ft yacht Equinox. His family became increasingly concerned for his safety after not hearing from him since last Friday, prompting them to contact the Coastguard yesterday.

"By . John Hall . A Chinese man has been jailed for 11 years for cutting off his nine-year-old stepson's hand with a meat cleaver and boiling it so it would be impossible for surgeons to reattach. Wang Xinyu, 31, met the boy's mother Xiao Shen just over a year ago and the pair had been looking at buying a flat together in Shenyang - a city in east China's Liaoning province. But after the couple had a furious telephone argument about money, Wang lost his temper and began beating Xiao Jun with a stick before cutting off his hand with a meat cleaver and throwing it into a pot of boiling water that was being used to cook their evening meal. Horrific injuries: Nine-year-old Xiao Jun lies in hospital after his mother's boyfriend cut off his hand with a meat cleaver and threw it into a pot of boiling water . Guilty: Wang Xinyu, 31, (centre) beat Xiao Jun with a stick before cutting off his hand with a meat cleaver and throwing it into a pot of boiling water that was being used to cook their evening meal . In the days leading up to the attack, Wang and Jun moved to Shenyang to stay in a rented apartment, while the boy's mother went to stay with relatives in the hope of borrowing the rest of the money the couple needed to purchase an apartment. But there was a furious row when she rang her lover to tell him that the process was taking longer than she thought and after he hung up the phone he grabbed a stick and started to beat Jun. Wang then grabbed a meat cleaver from the kitchen and chopped off the boy's hand before throwing it into a pot of water that had been heating to cook their evening meal. Another resident in the rented apartment block said: 'I heard the boy saying 'Dad, please don't, dad, please don't. Even though I then heard the boy screaming I really didn't expect it would have been so terrible.' Sad: After having his hand cut off by his stepfather, nine-year-old Xiao Jun told police: 'I always thought he would really be a good dad to me, I liked him. Now everything is ruined. I don't know why he did this' Wounded: In the days leading up to the attack, Wang and Jun (pictured) moved into a rented apartment. The boy's mother then went to stay with relatives in the hope of borrowing money . The stepfather then called police to confess what he had done and took the boy and the cooked hand to hospital, where doctors said that it had already swelled up and was no longer usable. It means Jun will not be able to have his hand reattached and he will now need an artificial arm. Wang lost his job as a crane driver as the a result of the crime - meaning that the now disabled boy and his mother no longer have his income. Xiao Shen, who forgave Wang for the attack on her son, has since given birth to his twins. Future: Wang (pictured with his head covered) lost his job as a crane driver as the a result of the crime - meaning that the now disabled boy and his mother no longer have an income . Treatment: At the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court, Wang apologised and admitted cutting of the right hand of Jun (pictured).  His lawyer argued Wang acted 'out of impulse' and asked for a lenient sentence . Injured: A relative of Xiao Jun is seen crying in his hospital ward. After having his hand cut off, Jun's stepfather boiled it in water so that it could not be reattached. Jun will now need a prosthetic limb for the rest of his life . The boy told police: 'I always thought he would really be a good dad to me, I liked him. Now everything is ruined. I don't know why he did this, he just seemed to become someone else.' Wang apologised and admitted to committing the crime at the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court. His lawyer argued Wang acted 'out of impulse' and asked for a lenient sentence. In handing him only 11 years in prison instead of life, the court  agreed to this request after hearing that he had showed contrition and been forgiven by the boy's family.","Wang Xinyu, 31, cut off nine-year-old Xiao Jun's hand after losing temper .

The molluscs are among the largest land snails in the world and can grow to be up to 8 inches long. They are native to Africa and can live for up to 10 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture incinerated the snails after they were inspected, Harty said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture incinerated the snails after they were inspected . Giant African land snails are considered a delicacy in much of West Africa. The are particularly enjoyed in Nigeria, from where the LAX package was sent. The snails are commonly served as finger food in Nigeria, but need to be thoroughly washed to ensure all parasites are killed. They are typically removed from their shell and cut in half to kill them, before being washed in a mixture of salt, lemon and alum gum - which removes the slime. The snails are placed into a put and brought to the boil, then left to simmer for an hour to tenderise the meat. While this takes place, a separate pot is used to pan-fry onions, peppers and tomatoes, with enough water added to create a kind of vegetable stew. The tender snails are then added to the stew along with salt for seasoning, and the whole mixture is then cooked for another 20-30 minutes. The low-calorie, low-cholesterol dish is then typically served with rice and eaten by scooping up small amounts in the hand. Source: WLRN-FM . The snails are also agricultural pests, said Maveeda Mirza, the CBP program manager for agriculture. 'These snails are seriously harmful to local plants because they will eat any kind of crop they can get to,' she added. The person the snails were destined . for is not expected to face any punishment as it is always difficult to prove that a person has ordered or requested items that are sent to them. It is also very rare for a criminal case to be pursued if there is little evidence of professional smuggling and the culprit claims not to know that the legal status of the prohibited items. The authorities are launching a formal investigation into the incident, however, if only to establish why such a large batch of snails was sent to a single person. 'We're investigating . what happened, but it doesn't seem like there was smuggling involved,' Mirza said. 'When someone doesn't know a commodity is prohibited under USDA . regulations there is usually no punishment,' she added.

His 10 ewes and show-winning ram King Kong are now the first Valois Blacknose herd in Scotland. The sheep are so valuable Mr Irvine has installed CCTV and brought in guard dogs to stop them being stolen from his farm. He and girlfriend Jenni McAllister got a surprise when it turned out one of the ewes was already pregnant, giving birth to Scotland’s first baby Valais Blacknose.

Knowledge: Raymond Irvine (left) and his girlfriend Jenni Allister (right) spent several weeks researching the breed, which is unique to the Valais region of Switzerland, before making the trip . Cute: Raymond Irvine said he got a surprise just days after the sheep arrived at his Scottish farm, when one of the ewes unexpectedly gave birth to this adorable lamb . The Valais Blacknose is a coarse-wooled sheep from Switzerland - kept primarily for meat, but also used for wool. It is a unique breed found in the Upper Valais, in the German-speaking part of the canton of Valais. Their earliest mention dates back to 1400 but they were first recognized as a separate breed in 1962. Both rams and ewes have huge spiral horns and a thick coat that keeps them warm during the bitter Swiss winter. The chill of the Highlands in mid-January should prove no challenge from this cute but particularly hardy breed. Highly domesticated, the sheep do not shy away from contact with humans. As a result, many residents of Upper Valais have started keeping them as pets in recent years. They are now regularly seen being walked on leads or tied up outside supermarkets in the villages around Upper Valais. Mr Irvine, 42, said: 'My girlfriend showed me a picture and I laughed because I didn’t think they were real.' 'Then . we thought there could be something in this so we decided to travel . over and see them in real life. We fell in love with them at first . sight,' he added. 'It’s . the first time this breed has ever been in Scotland. I think they are . the world’s cutest sheep. They are so docile and they just make you . smile as soon as you see them, Mr Irvine went on to say. Mr Irvine and Miss McAllister, 34, spent several weeks researching the breed, which is unique to the Valais region of Switzerland, before making the trip. They negotiated with several breeders, to select individuals to buy, which proved difficult as the farmers did not want to part with the beloved animals. The lucky 11 were then transported in a lorry through customs to France, Calais, Dover and finally to Scotland - all within 24 hours. Mr Irvine said he got a surprise just days after the sheep arrive, when one of the ewes unexpectedly gave birth. 'One morning I went to check on them and this thing was on the ground. The farmer had forgotten to tell me one of the females was pregnant,' he said. 'So now we have the first ever Valais lamb to be born on Scottish soil,' he added. Up for grabs: Jenni McAllister said she is considering putting a couple of the lambs on the market next year, and possibly crossing a few of the others with other breeds of sheep .

Tough: The chill of the Highlands in mid-January should prove no challenge from this cute but particularly hardy breed. Their thick coat keeps them warm during the bitter Swiss winter . The sheep will not struggle in the chill of the Scottish winter because the part of Switzerland they live in usually gets much colder. On a trip the couple watched in surprise as people walked the sheep on leads around the village. Whilst the couple were enjoying a romantic meal two of the sheep were brought inside by a Swiss farmer who didn’t want to leave them outside. Mr Irvine said they hope to increase the size of their flock and while many lamb twice a year, they will only be lambed once, in March. The couple are considering putting a couple of the lambs on the market next year, and crossing them with other breeds of sheep. But they will work to maintain the characteristics of the breed and look at different avenues on how to develop a lucrative market for the wool.","Raymond Irvine paid £55,000 for 10 Valais Blacknose ewes and one ram .

"By . John Hall . Budget airlines are not carrying out new anti-terror security checks on electronic devices as confusion grows over exactly where the measures are being enforced. The Department for Transport this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they can be taken on some flights travelling to Britain. But they are not being enforced by airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair, as ministers' refusals to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures leads to increasing uncertainty among passengers. Security checks: The Department for Transport this week introduced new rules demanding passengers prove electrical items are working properly before they are allowed to board flights to Britain . The new security measures - which require passengers to switch on electrical devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones to prove they work - initially only applied to U.S flights. On Tuesday the Department for Transport announced it had extended the rules to cover the UK, and warned all passengers to ensure their electronic devices are fully charged before attempting to board flights arriving in and departing from Britain. The Department for Transport would not disclose the exact routes for security reasons, but Australian officials later claimed the routes affected include aircraft travelling between Britain and Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. There appeared to be some confusion over the new measures this morning, however, with a Ryanair official saying the budget airline 'does not expect the rules will have any effect on short haul . flights within Europe'. It is understood the rules are not being enforced by airlines such as easyJet (pictured) and Ryanair, as ministers' refuse to make public exactly which routes are subject to the rigorous new procedures . The electronic device checks introduced by the Department for Transport this week will not affect all UK passengers. Although they have refused to make public the routes affected, ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks. It is understood this includes flights to and from the Middle East, Africa and parts of southern Europe. If your flight is hit by additional security checks, it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate. Arriving at the airport, passengers will check-in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way. This will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags. Passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they called to the departure gate earlier than usual if their flight is affected. This is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly. The Department for Transport says all passengers arriving or leaving the UK must prepare for the special measures, however. The teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves, not by the airport, but the Department for Transport has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff. If, for whatever reason, your device fails the security check, you will be forced to leave your device behind, and may even be banned from taking the flight itself. An easyJet . spokesman told MailOnline that the company was 'aware' that the . security measures may be stepped up, but said the new rules did not yet . apply to its passengers. And despite the claims from the Australian officials, a number of passengers arriving from . various locations within the Middle East and East Africa said security . checks also remain as normal. However . both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic insist they are carrying out . the additional security checks on all routes the Department of Transport . told them are affected . The 'secondary' checks . are understood to take place at the boarding gate by staff contracted by . the airlines themselves, not employees of the central security team . that carries out body and luggage scans earlier in the boarding process. A . Department for Transport spokesman said he would not be drawn on the . specifics of the checks, or when in the process they take place, but . insisted they are carried out by qualified security staff. The new security measures are controversial as they could see innocent passengers forced to leave behind items worth thousands of pounds simply because the battery was not properly charged. If a laptop, tablet, iPod or mobile phone cannot be switched on and proved to be working correctly, the Department of Transport's guideline is that this item must not be allowed to travel. As these devices are commonly used to keep children amused during long waits in an airports departure lounge, the new rules could hit thousands of families. Dixons said it had seen a 30 per cent increase in sales of battery chargers in its . airport branches last week, when the measures were first imposed on . flights to the U.S. Now that the rules also apply to flights to the UK, this figure is expected to soar further. There is also concern that the time taken to check every device could cause chaos and put additional pressure on already overstretched airport security systems.","Department for Transport announced new security measures this week .

"By . John Hall . A father has been jailed for eight years for killing his baby daughter after being frustrated by her screaming as he tried to play a computer game. Mark Sandland, 28, sobbed as he was sentenced for picking up five-week-old Aimee-Rose by her torso and shaking her during a sudden loss of temper. He claimed he suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him at their flat in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex. Guilty: Mark Sandland, 28, (pictured) shook his five-week-old daughter Aimee-Rose to death, causing injuries to her face, chest, abdomen, hip and lower limbs. He lost his temper because she disrupted his video game . Police who attended the flat after Aimee-Rose was admitted to hospital on November 5 2012 found a PlayStation game controller on the sofa opposite the TV. Sandland was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of lack of intent, which was accepted by the Crown. Sentencing him at Hove Crown Court today, Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said that after he inflicted the injuries, Sandland lied and sought to cover up his actions. Prosecutor Sally Howes QC told Lewes Crown Court on Monday that Sandland’s mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play Assassin’s Creed 3 on his PlayStation at 2.22pm. The detail of the website, giving step-by-step instruction, meant there would have been little point accessing it unless the game was being played, she added. Sentencing, . Mr Justice Sweeney said: 'It’s the Crown’s case that thereafter, . frustrated with the game and with Aimee-Rose screaming, you lost your . temper and you assaulted her, gripping her torso hard and violently . shaking her.' 'Whilst . it’s impossible to identify the precise detail of what you did, the . injuries that you caused Aimee-Rose speak for themselves.' Her . injuries included bruising to her face, chest, abdomen, hip and lower . limbs. She also suffered a range of other injuries, including subdural . haemorrhages in a number of locations. Some 16 minutes after Sandland logged on to the website giving tips on Assassin’s Creed 3, he dialled 999. Playing games: Sandland's mobile phone internet history showed he logged on to a website offering tips on how to play Assassin's Creed 3 shortly before calling an ambulance for his dying daughter . Mr Justice Sweeney told Sandland: 'Whilst you have no recollection now of the fatal incident, it’s obvious that at the time you appreciated what you had done and in consequence lied and sought to cover up what had actually happened.' 'You pretended on the phone that you had a fit. You turned off the television to cover up the fact that you had been on the PlayStation.' 'Thereafter you continued to lie and cover up to those who were trying to treat Aimee-Rose, although I stress that they wouldn’t have done anything different if you had told the truth, and to the police.' The judge said there were a number of aggravating features, including the fact that Aimee-Rose was a vulnerable child aged just five weeks old. In addition, he said Sandland was in a position of trust, made repeated false accounts to cover up his actions, and had shown no real remorse. The judge accepted it was a 'momentary' event lacking in premeditation and he sought emergency help, albeit giving a misleading account. Mr Justice Sweeney said Sandland - who sobbed with his head down as he was sentenced - will serve half his jail sentence. On release, he will be on licence for the remainder of his sentence and if he breaks the terms, will be liable for recall. Concealed his crime: Mark Sandland initially claimed he had suffered an epileptic fit and came round to find his daughter underneath him . On the day of the fatal attack, . Aimee-Rose’s mother was attending her first class for an applied social . science degree at the University of Brighton’s Hastings campus. During . a break at around lunchtime, she sent Sandland a text message asking . after Aimee-Rose, to which he replied: 'She hasn’t shut up since about . half an hour after you left.' When an ambulance crew arrived, Sandland . looked 'panicked and anxious' and pointed to where she lay in the . sitting room, her limbs in a star shape. Sandland told one member of ambulance staff: 'I’m epileptic. I had a fit and when I woke up the baby was underneath me.' Aimee-Rose was admitted to the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards unconscious, unresponsive and, although a heart-beat was re-established, she was unable to maintain respiratory effort without life support. She was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at King’s College Hospital, London, but died on November 9 2012. Miss Howes said the combination of the post-mortem findings of recent head injury, recent traumatic laceration of the liver and recent fracture of the left clavicle was consistent with inflicted injury of the 'shaking/impact type'. Dr Hannah . Cock, a consultant neurologist, found it was 'highly unlikely' that a . seizure was a substantial contributor to Aimee-Rose’s injuries. If he had suffered a seizure, Dr Cock would have expected him to drop anything he was holding and remember later. Miss . Howes said: 'Even if he had fallen on to Aimee-Rose, her pattern of . injuries is not consistent with a fall and crushing alone. Dr Cock would . have expected more disturbance to adjacent furniture than reported.' One expert found Aimee-Rose sustained two episodes that had led to injury - one up to three weeks before she died and a second up to five days before death. When Sandland was told he would be arrested, Miss Howes said he became upset and he said: 'I suppose you are going to say that you know what it is like to be accused of killing your daughter.' In one police interview, he declined to answer most questions, except when he was asked if he had deliberately harmed her. He replied: 'No.' Miss Howes said Sandland, who had an “unconventional upbringing” and was raised by his paternal grandparents, made suicide bids in 2006. Two years later, he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition of the peripheral nervous system, following which he began experiencing seizures. But the court heard that no medical cause could be found to explain them and he was admitted to numerous hospitals between 2008 and 2012.","Mark Sandland, 28, shook his five-week-old daughter Aimee-Rose to death .

"By . John Hall . This is terrifying moment two Red Arrows planes appear to come within inches of a mid-air collision. Amateur photographer David Sleight, 51, captured the image of two Hawk jets seemingly seconds from disaster at RAF Waddington's International Airshow in Linconshire on Sunday. The jets were seen hurtling towards each other at extremely high speed in what looked like a high-risk game of chicken, before finally criss-crossing away at the last possible moment. Scroll down for video . Inches from disaster: Amateur photographer David Sleight, 51, captured the terrfying picture of two Hawk jets seemingly seconds from a deadly mid-air collision at RAF Waddington's International Airshow in Linconshire on Sunday. He described his photograph as a 'one-in-a-lifetime image' Well-positioned: Red Arrows Hawks paint the sky red, white and blue at Sunday's RAF Waddington International Airshow. University lecturer David Sleight was able to capture a number of photographs of their stunning display as guest of honour at the event . Privilege: David Sleight was invited to the show by Station Commander at RAF Waddington, Richard Barrow, because of his ties to the RAF as Dean of Public Engagement at the University of Lincoln. He described his time at RAF Waddington as a 'golden moment' Mr Sleight took the striking image on Sunday as the famous Red Arrows flying team put on a show for thousands of spectators at the RAF Waddington. The university lecturer said he could not believe his luck when he caught two of the acrobatic jets about to cross paths just feet away from each other at around 3pm. 'It was a golden moment. It’s a once in a lifetime image,' he said. 'It had been so exciting to watch the planes crossing and I had plenty of pictures of that but when I saw that photo I ran back to the hosting area of the show immediately,' he added. Mesmerising: David Sleight's guest of honour status enabled him to find a good spot to take photographs of the Red Arrows, who are celebrating their 50th anniversary . Memories: David Sleight said he found the Red Arrows' display exciting, adding that he already taken a number of photographs  - including this one of a Hawk jet traveling upside down - before capturing his 'golden' image of two planes appearing to play a high-risk game of chicken . History: The Red Arrows formed in late 1964 as the official all-RAF aerobatics team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by the air force . Machines: The Red Arrows started using BAE Hawk T1s in 1979. The Hawks are modified with an uprated engine and a modification to enable smoke to be generated. Diesel is mixed with a coloured dye and ejected into the jet exhaust to produce either red, white or blue smoke . Mr Sleight said he went straight over to his group of friends after taking the photograph because he didn’t want them to think he had Photoshopped the image. 'You see pictures all the time of them passing each other or about to but to get them almost nose to nose is a very rare occurrence indeed,' he said. RAF Waddington is the largest of all the RAF Air Shows and is regularly attended by more than 140,000 spectators. Mr Sleight was invited to the show by Station Commander at RAF Waddington, Richard Barrow, because of his ties to the RAF as Dean of Public Engagement at the University of Lincoln. This guest of honour status enabled him to find a good spot to take photographs of the Red Arrows, who are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year. A spokesperson for the RAF said: 'To be clear this superb photograph was of the Red Arrows synchro pair, who complete manoeuvres such as this safely and professionally on a daily basis.’","Amateur photographer David Sleight, 51, captured the image of two Hawk jets seemingly seconds from disaster .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google has put its controversial eyewear back on sale to the US public. The firm is offering the 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale after an initial 24 hour sale sold out. It is believed the firm wants to increase the number of people people using the hardware - and potentially clear its inventory for the 'real' consumer version. Scroll down for video . Next generation: Google Glass has revealed the new look of its high-tech device . Buyers can visit http://google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one to buy Glass. 'Any adult in the US can become an Explorer by visiting our site and purchasing Glass for $1500 + tax – and it now comes with your favorite shade or frame, thanks to feedback from our current Explorers. Source: Google . The firm announced a 24 hour sale last month after its plans were leaked, and the device sold out within hours. Today, it reappeared online for sale to anyone if what is described as an 'open beta'. 'Whoops. So... we’d planned to post this next week, but it looks like the cat's out of the bag now,' Google said when its previous plans were leaked.. 'Over the past several months, we’ve been trying out different ways to expand the Explorer program. 'Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new perspective that is making Glass better. 'But every day we get requests from those of you who haven’t found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too. 'So in typical Explorer Program fashion, we’re trying something new. ' Next Tuesday, April 15th at 6am PDT, the firm will allow anyone in the US to buy them. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in,' the firm said. Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase. Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The secret document obtained by The Verge that reveals the plan . Take your pick: The frames are available in a range of colours, but the one Carol and Sarah tested was a green-grey colour . However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Improved: The slightly bulkier design comes with a detachable ear piece to improve commands . Upgrade: Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar wearing the Google Glass at the Emmys in September. Those with the earlier design will be able to swap their old device for the new one . Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design. 'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.","Search giant previously offered 'explorer version' of Glass for 24 hours .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A father from Arizona, whose baby boy died when he left him in a car outside a bar, was sentenced to four years in prison on Friday. Daniel Bryant Gray had pleaded guilty to manslaughter and child abuse after the death of his three-month-old son Jamison. The 31-year-old had left the baby strapped into a car for several hours on August 28 last year, when temperatures reached 100F. Sentenced: Daniel Bryant Gray has been sent to prison after his baby son died after being left in a hot car . Loss: Baby Jamison was only three months old when he died after being left in a hot car for three hours . Gray chatted to colleagues at the Scottsdale sports bar where he was a manager, and was seen smoking marijuana after leaving his baby in the car. Police said Gray had gone to the bar to do some extra work on his day off. He helped kitchen staff with food preparation and asked an employee for marijuana before the two went outside to use the drug near Gray's car. Gray discovered the baby when he returned to his car to get paperwork three hours later. He ran back inside with the child still in the car seat and brought him into a cooler. 'I left my baby in the car and he's dead,' police quoted Gray as saying. Crime scene: Baby Jamison was left inside this car, above, for three hours on a day when temperatures reached 100F . Distressed: Daniel, pictured with Jamison's mom Rebecca Hillary, was distraught when he found his baby . Heartbroken: Daniel Gray with the baby's mom, Rebecca Hillary . Gray tried fanning the infant, whose core temperature was determined to have reached 107 degrees. Employees and emergency workers tried CPR on the child, but he was later pronounced dead. Investigators described Gray as distraught and emotional throughout his police interview. He had been facing a possible prison term of up to 16 years, but had the maximum term reduced as part of a plea deal. The baby's mother, Rebecca Hillary, was heartbroken by Jamison's death. 'He was my everything. I loved being a mommy,' Hillary told CBS 5 shortly after the death. 'He was a very happy boy. He was always such a good boy. He loved to smile. He just loved to smile, and play and bounce.'","Daniel Bryant Gray was charged with manslaughter and child abuse .

"By . John Hall . A mother who left her toddler son to die in a 45C scalding bath for two hours while she was passed out on a cocktail of drugs has been jailed for three years. Kerry Abel, 38, had claimed she became dizzy and fainted as she stood up while bathing her two-year-old son, Riley Lewis at their home in Hull, East Yorkshire. But a jury ruled that she was guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence after evidence . emerged showing she was a persistent drug user and left Riley to suffer . horrific burns and drown while she was high on a mixture of diazepam, temazepam, heroin, cocaine and cannabis. Tragic: Kerry Abel, 38, (left) left her two-year-old son Riley Lewis (right) to drown after taking a cocktail of eight different drugs and passing out while he was in the bath. She was found guilty of manslaughter . Riley was found face-down in the bath water with burns across almost his entire body on January 4 last year. Sheffield Crown Court heard how Abel had eight different drugs in her system at the time of her son's death - diazepam, temazepam, heroin, methadone, tramadol, cocaine, cannabis and the painkiller pregabalin, which she had bought from a friend. Abel claimed she had only left him alone for five minutes, but Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said experts agreed he must have spent at least two hours in the water. The prosecutor alleged that Abel put her son in the bath, and 'affected by drugs, fell asleep'. Sheffield Crown Court heard the burns were caused after Riley had drowned. Abel had been prescribed methadone to treat her heroin addiction but she had not been able to get her regular dose because it was 'lost in the system', the court heard. She was given an emergency dose on January 2, but failed to collect her prescription the following day. Experienced: Andrew Lewis, the partner of Kerry Abel (pictured left and right) said she 'deliberately took a cocktail of drugs', adding that 'as an experienced drug user, she well understood the dangers' Although methadone was in her body the day Riley died, she had also taken tramadol, her partner’s diazepam, and the painkiller pregabalin. The court heard pregabalin produces a 'euphoric' effect, and that Abel had previously tried and failed to get her doctor to prescribe it. Tests also found traces of heroin, cocaine and cannabis in her blood. Abel, who lived in the property with Riley’s father Andrew Lewis and their children, had wanted the toddler to 'inhale steam' to treat a chest infection, the court heard. Jurors were told that Mr Lewis called 999 at 11.48pm on January 4 last year and said his son was dead. Mr Wright said Abel 'deliberately took a cocktail of drugs during the day that would inevitably have an effect on her function, and as an experienced drug user, she well understood the dangers'. Sentencing her on Friday, Mr Justice Coulson said: 'Riley died as a result of your gross negligece.' 'He was in your care, he trusted you, you let him down, you completely let him down.' Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) heard how Abel had eight different drugs in her system at the time of her son's death - diazepam, temazepam, heroin, methadone, tramadol, cocaine, cannabis and the painkiller pregabalin . Mr Justice Coulson said there was no suggestion Abel was responsible for Riley’s burns, which he accepted happened after the boy drowned. In mitigation, Benjamin Nolan QC, defending, told the court that no punishment meted out could be any worse than the loss of her son. Mr Nolan said: 'No punishment the court can impose will be as great as the loss she is already suffering.' Speaking after the sentencing, Detective Superintendent Mathew Hutchinson of Humberside Police said: 'This was a very sad case where a small child was ultimately let down by the very person who he should have been able to depend on.' 'Riley’s death was needless and preventable... He was a normal, healthy little boy but tragically, the choices made by Kerry Abel in respect of her drug taking, resulted in his premature death.'Hull City Council said it was conducting a Serious Case Review 'to see if there are any lessons which can be learned to improve the way in which local agencies work together.' Paul Dyson, independent chair of the Hull Safeguarding Children Board, said a report would be published in September.","Kerry Abel, 38, was high on cocktail of drugs when her son died in bath .

Earlier this month, as Clifford anxiously awaited his fate, she was spotted without her wedding ring pottering about near her home. A friend said she was ‘very, very angry’ and ‘just waiting for guilty verdicts and then she’s going to divorce him for everything he’s got’. Mrs Clifford - his former PA whom he married in April 2010, seven years after the death of his first wife, Liz - declined to comment on the suggestion she has been speaking to top London divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth. At Clifford’s trial, she was not called as a character witness and did not attend court by his side as a show of support.

For the man never shy of supplying a quote in a 50-year PR career, he was silent when his downfall came and refused to apologise to his victims as he posed for pictures outside court. Over more than three decades, the millionaire publicist groomed and molested schoolgirls in his yellow Jaguar and young models in his office, threatening them: ‘No one will believe you.’ Scroll down for video . Support: A smirking Max Clifford last night faced jail after he was convicted of a vile campaign of sexual abuse against teenage girls. Above, Clifford is pictured with his daughter Louise outside court after his conviction . Charged with 11 counts of indecent assault, he was found guilty of eight. He was cleared on two other counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another. Last night one of the schoolgirls he molested told the Daily Mail: ‘It took me and other victims many years to pluck up the courage to seek justice. 'We were young innocent victims of a powerful, manipulative and dishonest man whom, over the years, we saw become crowned king of the kiss-and-tell industry.’ Sources close to Clifford, who spent £250,000 on his defence, said he had been urged by close associates several months ago to plead guilty. But he had insisted on fighting the charges, convinced he might go free. Convicted: For the man never shy of supplying a quote in a 50-year PR career, he was silent when his downfall came and refused to apologise to his victims as he posed for pictures outside court . Bailed: Clifford, pictured outside his mansion in Surrey, was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault . By doing so, he prolonged the agony of his victims who were forced to relive their ordeals in the witness box. Clifford is the first celebrity to be convicted under Operation Yewtree, the £2.7million Scotland Yard investigation sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile. The guilty verdicts will be seen as at least partial vindication by the Crown Prosecution Service for its controversial pursuit of 1970s celebrities, following a string of recent acquittals. Clifford was branded a grade-A paedophile and ‘every little girl’s worst nightmare’ during his eight-week trial at London’s Southwark Crown Court. Centre of attention: Clifford was cleared on two other counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another . Denial: Clifford insisted on fighting the charges, convinced he might go free. In doing so, he prolonged the agony of his victims who had to relive their ordeals in the witness box. Above, he leaves Southwark Crown Court . The PR agent, who turned 71 during the case, sat emotionless in the dock wearing an open-necked shirt as the verdicts were given. His disabled 42-year-old daughter Louise also showed no emotion in the public gallery – she had given evidence in his defence, but prosecutors said she was tainted by her blind loyalty to her father. Freed on bail, outside court Clifford was asked repeatedly if he would say ‘sorry’ to his victims. He smiled awkwardly but said, uncharacteristically, that his lawyers had told him ‘to say nothing at all’. Younger days: During the trial, Clifford admitted attending sex parties in his youth . Clifford had denied all the allegations and called his victims ‘mentally disturbed’ fantasists hunting compensation. Their accusations were ‘a fairy story that only you believe,’ he had snapped to the prosecutor. But after nine days of deliberations, the jury of six men and four women believed the women, finding Clifford guilty of eight counts of indecent assault: Four against a 15-year-old in 1977, one on a 19-year-old in 1981 or 1982, two against a 17-year-old in 1982 or 1983, and one on an 18-year-old in the early 1980s. He was cleared of another two allegations – one 18-year-old who said she was pushed up against a wall in his central London offices when he groped her and kissed her in 1975, and another, aged 19, who claimed she was groped in a taxi in 1979. The jury could not reach a verdict on a count involving a woman who claimed he groped her in his car after meeting her at a Wimpy bar in South London in 1966. In fact, there were 23 victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest cases. Clifford will be sentenced on Friday. The maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years at the time the offences were committed. He was bailed on the condition he spends nights at his £3.5million Surrey mansion. The judge told him: ‘You must realise that the fact I have given you bail is no indication of what the final sentence will be.’ Last night Jenny Hopkins, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, said the verdicts ‘provide a long-denied justice to the victims of serious sexual offences’. Many of the victims had told family or friends about their assaults up to 40 years ago, showing they had not made them up in what Clifford termed ‘the current climate’. Leaving court: Clifford is the first celebrity to be convicted under Operation Yewtree, the £2.7million Scotland Yard investigation sparked by the death of Jimmy Savile. Above, the publicist is pictured leaving court by car . From his twenties to his forties, the manipulative fixer boasted of his celebrity contacts to snare naïve young women, promising to make them Bond girls or leading ladies in Hollywood movies. He played mind games with his victims, using hoax phone calls to trick them into thinking they were speaking to famous directors. He treated his New Bond Street offices as his ‘sexual fiefdom’ and wandered around naked demanding sordid favours from visitors and secretaries alike. Womanising Clifford’s extraordinary defence was that he enjoyed so much sex by cheating on his first wife Liz with numerous mistresses that he did not need to abuse anyone.

"By . Sam Greenhill . Max Clifford's QC has told Southwark Crown Court his trial is 'haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Saville' Max Clifford's trial has been 'haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Savile', jurors were told yesterday. The Top of the Pops presenter's exposure as a paedophile after his 2011 death led to a succession of celebrities being arrested under the police's Operation Yewtree. Clifford's QC, Richard Horwell, told Southwark Crown Court his client's trial must be seen in this context. He said: 'What a time we live in. This trial has been haunted by the spectre of Jimmy Savile. 'The Jimmy Savile effect cannot be ignored. Why are wealthy celebrities the subject of these accusations?' Clifford himself has branded his accusers compensation-seekers and attention-hunters. The 71-year-old PR agent - who claims he never met Savile - has also said Operation Yewtree was set up 'to try and cover up the embarrassment Savile caused the Met police'. In his closing remarks to the jury yesterday, Mr Horwell rubbished suggestions the publicist was a 'sexual predator'. He said Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst would be spinning in her grave at the prosecution portraying women of the Sixties and Seventies as 'as lacking in all resolve'. Mr Howell accused Clifford's accusers of making up the allegations and telling their family and friends about them. The QC said: 'It doesn't matter if a complainant has reported the complaint to the Archbishop of Canterbury - an unreliable complaint remains an unreliable complaint, no matter how many times it is repeated.' He said the women would have felt 'substantial pressure' to tell police when Operation Yewtree was launched so they did not 'lose face' with the family and friends they had already told their stories to. Mr Horwell accused prosecutors of being 'obsessed with Mr Clifford's sex life' and portraying the PR agent as an 'Olympic-standard sexual athlete'. But he branded the prosecution case 'grubby voyeurism' that was a 'fifth-rate fiction of a standard not even Mills and Boon would countenance.' In his closing remarks to the jury yesterday, Mr Horwell rubbished suggestions the publicist, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court with his daughter Louise, was a 'sexual predator' He said: 'Yes, his sex life was not . conventional, whatever that may be. His sex life and adulterous . relationships are not on trial here. He liked sex. He had a number of . sexual partners. He worked in an environment in which most people were . having affairs. 'But . he told you the sex he had was consensual.' The publicist had earlier . confessed to having four long-term affairs with women while married to . his first wife Elizabeth. 'It doesn't matter if a complainant has . reported the complaint to the Archbishop of Canterbury - an unreliable . complaint remains an unreliable complaint' - Richard Horwell QC . The . court heard that while his accusers have been shielded by their legal . right to anonymity, Clifford's life had been plunged into turmoil since . his arrest in December 2012. Mr Horwell said their claims 'come not from a different time but quite literally from a different age - imagine having to deal with events going back up to 48 years, a time when many people in this court were not even born. Stories made up for whatever reason eventually become fixed in the minds of those who have concocted them.' But Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, urged the jury not to be fooled by the kiss and tell agent. She branded him a 'risk taker prepared for some danger' who indecently assaulted a string of teenagers over 20 years. She asked them why so many women - who do not know each other - would make complaints of such 'similarity', and why they would have confided in friends many years ago, unless they were telling the truth. The PR guru, pictured outside court yesterday,  denies 11 counts of indecent assault on seven teenage girls and women from 1966 to 1984 . Miss Cottage said Clifford used the same 'pattern again and again' of bragging about the celebrities he knew and the Hollywood careers he could forge before attacking his young victims. She said: 'He is a master in the art of intimidation and manipulation. No one would believe a silly girl. It was an elaborate art.' She added: 'These girls don't know each other but we have this pattern.' Wearing a sky blue blazer, white shirt and dark blue trousers, Clifford shook his head furiously in the dock as Miss Cottage spoke. He denies 11 counts of indecent assault on seven teenage girls and women from 1966 to 1984. The case continues.

"By . Sam Greenhill . Max Clifford attended sex parties hosted by Sixties siren Diana Dors and helped cover up other people’s orgies, a court heard yesterday. The celebrity publicist admitted he cheated on his first wife with four women, and had sex in his office with one of them. But he denied ever forcing himself on women, saying he had no need to. Accusations he molested children were ‘revolting lies’, he told Southwark Crown Court. On trial: Max Clifford revealed that he attended sex parties hosted by the actress and siren Diana Dors, right . Jurors heard that the celebrity publicist told police the ‘Swinging Sixties’ were a wild time but he claimed his accusers were only after him because he was rich, famous and successful. Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, denies 11 charges of indecent assault relating to seven females aged 14 to 20 between 1966 and 1984. Giving evidence for the first time in his trial, the 70-year-old said that in his ‘younger days’ he went to parties thrown by movie sex symbol Miss Dors – a friend – where revellers would often pair off. ‘There were parties and sometimes there was sex, but they weren’t orgies. Not everyone went there and took their clothes off,’ he said. ‘In most of these situations they were one-bedroom premises, there was kissing, caressing and flirtation.’ Court case: Millionaire Max Clifford denies 11 counts of indecent assault at Southwark Crown Court . However the millionaire PR expert, who took to the witness stand wearing a navy blue suit and white open-necked shirt and swore his oath on the Bible, said he did help cover up orgies elsewhere. He told the court: ‘The sex orgies I have covered up over the years for other people were at different places in the West End, people’s homes.’ - What Max Clifford told police when accused of historic sex offences . He revealed that he had affairs with two work colleagues and a five-year relationship with a TV dancer, named in court only as Vicky. Clifford, who was married to his first wife Liz at the time, also had a ten-year liaison with a French fashion model named Anne Marie.He never hid the fact he was married. ‘I always said, “I love my wife”,’ he said. ‘I knew what I was doing was morally wrong. I didn’t think I would be found out. ‘Just about everybody I knew in the business was having affairs so it seemed pretty natural and normal. ‘Most of the women I had relationships with are still friends to this day. ‘I never, ever pretended I wasn’t married, I never, ever pretended I was leaving  my wife.’ Liz, whom he married in 1967 when he was 24, died from cancer in 2003. He has since remarried. When he was arrested in December 2012, Clifford had told police of ‘slap and tickle, kissing and cuddling’ in his office but denied sexual intercourse had taken place. 'I never needed to boast': Clifford said he had affairs with four women, including a model and a TV dancer . Yesterday, he told the jury: ‘Did I ever have sex in my office? Yes, but with someone I was having an affair with. ‘As and when and if something happened in the office it would have been very, very occasional, spontaneous, after work with the doors locked. We went to hotels and motels, we went abroad.’ In interviews, he told police he was not a ‘grubby little whatsit’ who needed to use his fame and power to lure women, adding: ‘Because it was a different era, doesn’t mean to say I had to mislead women to have sex with them. I had personal pride in myself and ego.’ Asked by Richard Horwell QC, defending, if he had ever had sexual contact with a woman without consent, Clifford replied: ‘No.’ Asked if he had ever been sexually attracted to children, he said: ‘No, no. It is just revolting. It’s really revolting. Utterly untrue. Disgusting. Lies.’ Firm denial: Asked by his defence if he had ever had sex with a woman without consent, Clifford replied: 'No' Clifford said the 1960s and 1970s was a time of sexual revolution in Britain and he had ‘open access’ to Top Of The Pops for 20 years. ‘If I really wanted to impress young girls, it would have been easy,’ he said. ‘There were young girls around pop stars all the time, waiting  at recording studios, television studios... trying to get into stars’ dressing rooms. That’s how  it was.’ His PR business would have been ruined if he had gained a reputation for touching women. Mr Horwell told jurors that the prosecution case was undermined by conflicting evidence given by the alleged victims. Denial: Clifford said he wasn't some 'grubby little whotsit' who needed to use his fame and power to get women. Two women had said Clifford had a tiny penis, while a third had described it as enormous. But a doctor had examined him and said it was of average size. Mr Horwell said that Clifford’s family members and former work colleagues would be called to prove that claims the publicist regarded his New Bond Street offices as his ‘sexual fiefdom’ were nonsense. Several showbusiness stars would also give evidence on  Clifford’s behalf. ‘We do not intend to turn  this trial into a celebrity extravaganza but it is important for you to know that such publicity- sensitive personalities, some of whom will be witnesses, have not abandoned him,’ he said. Asked about the first allegation of indecent assault, by a woman who claims he groped her in his car in 1966 when she was 14, Clifford said that at that time he could not drive and did not own a car. The trial continues. 'If someone was impressed with the Walker Brothers, I would have introduced them to the Walker Brothers': Clifford said he had 'open access' to Top Of The Pops for 20 years had he wanted to impress women .

"By . Sam Greenhill . A string of celebrities from David Beckham to Andrew Lloyd Webber face having to pay the taxman a total of £1 billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme. They each paid a minimum £100,000 to invest in a movie venture that promised to combine box office hits with tempting tax breaks. Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson and Victoria Beckham are also among the 1,000 household names affected. A string of celebrities from David and Victoria Beckham to Andrew Lloyd Webber face having to pay the taxman a total of £1 billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme . The Ingenious Film Partners 2 LLP scheme qualified for tax breaks under rules designed to stimulate the British film industry. Hit movies such as Life of Pi, Avatar and Girl With a Pearl Earring all benefited from tax relief. But HMRC now argues such schemes were not legitimate investment opportunities but a means of avoiding tax. Now a confidential letter, seen by the Sunday Times, has been sent by Ingenious Media Investments to its celebrity investors warning them of ‘draconian’ plans by HM Revenue and Customs to make them pay up to £1billion they had received in tax relief. The newspaper claimed the tough new approach reflected HMRC’s frustration at dealing with a backlog of some 65,000 individuals and businesses it suspects of using tax avoidance schemes. The Ingenious film scheme is soon to be tested at a tax tribunal, but HMRC is asking investors to repay money even before their case comes to court. Gary Lineker, Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson and Victoria Beckham are also among the 1,000 household names affected . The letter from John Boyton at Ingenious Media Investments tells clients: ‘This proposal would accelerate the payment of the tax repaid to you by HMRC, in advance of the outcome of the current legislation.’ Other household names who invested in the firm’s ventures include the singers Geri Halliwell and Annie Lennox, television presenters Ant and Dec and Davina McCall, and England football manager Roy Hodgson, along with football stars Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard. Ingenious denies HMRC’s claims and intends to fight for its scheme in the tax tribunal scheduled for November. Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being ‘almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films’, adding: ‘At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.’ A spokesman for the Beckhams said: ‘They have always paid the taxes they have owed in full.’ Last night Ingenious said the HMRC’s demands were ‘indiscriminate and unfair’. A company spokesman said: ‘Ingenious has been trying to obtain a definitive ruling on the tax status of its film and games partnerships for many years. The company requested a hearing before the tax tribunal in 2011 to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible, but HMRC has repeatedly used stalling tactics to delay a hearing. ‘Ingenious is proud of its record in financing hit films, including Avatar, Life of Pi and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which have generated more than £1 billion of taxable revenue for the UK Treasury, with a further £1 billion of taxable revenue expected over the life of the films.’","Bob Geldof, Anne Robinson and Victoria Beckham said to be also among the 1,000 household names affected .

"By . Sam Greenhill . A Bond girl told a London court how she kicked Max Clifford, pictured, 'really hard' between the legs after he allegedly sexually assaulted her . A Bond girl told a court today how she kicked Max Clifford between the legs ‘really hard’ after he sexually assaulted her. The woman, an extra in the James Bond film Octopussy, said the celebrity publicist had shoved her on to a sofa and thrown himself on top of her. She said: 'He lunged towards me. He pushed me down. He was on top of me. His hands were all over the place and he was trying to kiss me. I just remember his smelly breath. 'Then I got very frightened and I kicked him between the legs really hard.  He held himself. I jumped up, grabbed my things and ran.’ The woman, now 52, said the assault came in Clifford's New Bond Street offices after he had persuaded her to wear stockings and suspenders for a photo shoot. It was 1981 or 1982 and Clifford was offering to become her agent, she said. She had ready been given a role in the Roger Moore movie. He promised to make her famous and said she could get her a part in a new film by legendary Hollywood actor and director Charles Bronson, but needed some photographs of her in lingerie first, Southwark Crown Court in London heard. She told jurors she had just landed the role in Octopussy and was aged about 20. ‘Max Clifford contacted me or I was given his number and I went to his office. He congratulated me on being in Octopussy,’ she said. ‘He had a script for a new Charles Bronson film and he thought I would be perfect [for that too].' After their meeting, she said she received a bizarre phone call at home from a man named 'Terry Denton' who claimed he worked for Clifford and told her the publicist was 'in love’ with her. Then, at their next meeting, again in Clifford's office, she said the PR man pretended to be on the phone to Charles Bronson. 'He said he was speaking to Charles Bronson and that he needed photographic evidence from me,' she said. Trial: The publicist stopped to pose for photographers as he arrived at Southwark Crown Court today . An extra from the James Bond Octopussy film told the Clifford trial that the publicist sexually assaulted her . Defendant: Clifford, 70, faces 11 counts of indecent assault on seven teenagers but denies the charges . She claimed Clifford gave her money and sent her to a nearby Dorothy Perkins shop to buy lingerie, and she came back with a bra, a pair of knickers, a suspender belt and stockings. She thought he would take professional photographs but instead of using a studio, he made her pose in an office while he snapped away with an 'Instamatic' camera with 'no film in it', she told the court. 'He asked me to do the ""James Bond gun pose"" and asked me to sit on the sofa and put my legs apart. 'I realised things weren't right at all.' She got dressed to leave but claimed Clifford then molested her. Asked by Richard Horwell QC, defending, if she was making her claims up, the woman said: ‘What I'm saying is, to my best knowledge, the absolute truth and anything that deviates from that as such - it's such a long time ago. And it did happen.’ Barbara Broccoli, daughter of film producer Cubby Broccoli, said that her father did not even know Clifford . The jury in the PR guru's trial is now 11-strong after one juror dropped out because she knew a witness . The court later heard from James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli, the daughter of Bond movie franchise owner Cubby Broccoli. The court previously heard that Clifford claimed he represented Cubby Broccoli, and told one alleged victim she would have to sleep with the producer so she could be in one of his films. But Miss Broccoli said she did not think her father knew Clifford, telling the jury: 'As far as I know he did not know him.' Wearing a navy blazer, white shirt and jeans, Clifford listened from the dock. The 70-year-old, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges. The jury trying him is now 11 strong after one woman juror was discharged because she said she knew one of the supporting witnesses.

"By . Sam Greenhill And Harriet Arkell . and Lizzie Parry . and Sam Greenhill . On trial: Publicist Max Clifford outside Southwark Crown Court today . Max Clifford played a ‘tickling game’ with a 12-year-old girl before sexually abusing her in a Jacuzzi, a court heard yesterday. He had invited the girl to join him and his daughter Louise in the Jacuzzi during a holiday in Spain in 1983, it was alleged. The woman, now 43, said she was staying at a villa with her parents and had made friends with Louise, who was about the same age, around the communal swimming pool. She told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that Clifford ‘liked to play a tickling game with me’. She said: ‘He would play it in the swimming pool. He would just tickle me and ask where I was ticklish, like people do with a child. I didn’t think much of it. ‘Then he would ask me to tickle him and he would say, “Guess where I am ticklish”, and I would guess the obvious – like the armpit – but I never got it right.’ She said on the final day of the holiday she and Louise and Clifford went to the Jacuzzi together, but that at first she was alone in the pool with Clifford. The woman said: ‘He started asking me again if I wanted to know where he was ticklish, and I said yes. He then started touching me. He put his hand down my bikini bottoms and asked me if I was ticklish there. 'I knew it was wrong': The court heard one alleged victim claim she was abused by Clifford while on holiday in Spain in August 1983. The woman, who was 12 years old at the time, told the court she was in a jacuzzi with the media mogul when he forced her hand down his swimming trunks and made her masturbate him. She told the court she 'knew it was wrong' ‘I said, “No, no, I’m not ticklish . there”.’ Then she said Clifford gripped her hand and forced it on to . him, under the water, for several minutes. She added: ‘I was shocked. I . was scared. He just smiled.’ She told the court that Clifford only released her when his daughter returned. As . they walked back to their villa later, she told Louise where her father . had made her touch him. ‘She told me not to be so silly,’ said the . woman. She did not tell her . parents at the time or for years afterwards, because ‘they might blame . themselves and I didn’t want to put that on them’. Richard . Howell QC, defending, suggested the woman’s account was ‘quite false’. He said Louise had suffered from severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a . condition that would have made it ‘extremely difficult’ for her to walk . and get in and out of a Jacuzzi. Tickling game: Clifford, pictured left outside . his Puerto Banus apartment in Spain, and right in his younger years, . played the 'tickling game' the alleged victim told the court . The . woman replied: ‘I don’t remember the fine detail. I remember what has . given me nightmares for 30 years. I have not made this up. I didn’t want . to be here today.’ Earlier . the court heard Clifford sexually assaulted a teenager while on the . phone to his wife, then promised to make her a Bond girl. The . blonde former model said she had gone to see the PR guru in 1983 . because she wanted to get into fashion. But once in his Bond Street . office, she claimed Clifford locked the door and boasted of sleeping . with singer Diana Ross. He made the 17-year-old remove her dress and . began fondling her chest, saying he was ‘turned on’ by the ladders in . her tights. Then he took a . phone call from his wife and at the same time exposed himself before . forcing her to perform a sex act on him, she claimed. Afterwards, . he offered to introduce her to James Bond director Cubby Broccoli over . dinner, but in return she would have to give Clifford sexual favours . under the table while he sat next to his wife, it was alleged. Clifford, 70, of Hersham, Surrey, denies 11 counts of indecent assault on teenagers aged  14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984. The trial continues. Jurors at the trial of PR Max Clifford, 70, were sent out by the judge today after they started giggling during a discussion about the size of his penis . The . Max Clifford jurors were sent away and warned to 'settle down' by the . judge today after some of them were overcome with giggles during a . discussion about the publicist's 'small willy'. A . former model had been telling Southwark Crown Court she had thought . Clifford was 'well-endowed', but added: 'I have a small mouth. I do, my . dentist has always said...' As a blonde female juror burst into laughter, Judge Anthony Leonard said: 'Whoa whoa...we are going to have a short break.' After the jury filed out, hoots of laughter could be heard from behind the closed door. When they returned, the judge said: ‘Members of the jury, it is inevitable in a case dealing with this sort of graphic detail that there will be times when members of the jury want to burst into laughter... but we have got to remember that this is a court of law and we are considering serious allegations. 'Can I ask you to settle down?' The jury disruption happened after the court was told that Clifford, 70, groped a teenage model who went to him for career advice in 1983. The . woman, one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault by Clifford, . told the court that she was advised to go to see him when she was about . 17. Clifford . told her how important he was to the press, that he made people’s . careers, and that he had had sex with Diana Ross, she said. 'For me, Diana Ross was a very beautiful, famous woman, I couldn’t imagine why she would sleep with him,' she said. Clifford told her that she needed to get some publicity, and it was very important she was seen with the right person. She said: 'I thought, this is not what I . want to be involved in, I couldn’t think of anything worse than being . in the papers, or being on TV - I wanted to be a fashion model.' Defendant: A former teenage model told the jury that Clifford boasted to her that he had slept with Diana Ross . He said he wanted to . see her figure and told her to take her dress off, which she did . reluctantly, partly because she was wearing a thermal vest and holey . tights, as she was 'poverty stricken' and had only one pair. 'I hadn’t gone there thinking ""I’m going to see a photographer"", I thought I was going to get career advice.' She . took her dress off and Clifford was 'overcome', she said, adding: 'It . was the tights, he was absolutely riveted about the tights.' She . said he groped her chest area and arms and added: 'At this point I’m . feeling utterly stupid, totally in shock, I’m just not doing anything.' Then . the telephone rang, and it was his wife, the court heard. He motioned . to the teenager to sit down, and she put the dress back on. She said he then performed a sex act on himself while on the phone to his wife. Courthouse: The jurors at Southwark Crown Court were asked to 'settle down' by Judge Anthony Leonard . She said she thought . Clifford was well-endowed, but when questioned over the issue because . the court had already heard claims that his penis was 'tiny', said she . had only seen one penis before, and not at such close proximity. Order: Judge Anthony Leonard sent the jury out, telling them to 'settle down' The . witness, who is now 48, said Clifford told her he wanted her to come to . dinner with him and his wife and film producer Cubby Broccoli, saying . that if she slept with Broccoli, she would get a part in a Bond film. She . told jurors she went back to the hotel where she was staying, and . stayed in bed for a number of days, telling staff not to put Clifford’s . calls through as he rang 'relentlessly'. The . woman said she told her sister and some friends what had happened, but . rang police years later when she saw that Clifford had been arrested. Later, . the court was told by Clifford's defence barrister, Richard Horwell QC, . that the media mogul had never claimed he had slept with Diana Ross. The woman replied: 'He absolutely did, you don't forget that.' Pressing . the point, Mr Horwell said: 'I suggest that's complete fantasy', to . which the women retorted: 'No, it absolutely isn't.' And . he said it was 'absurd and an invention' to say that Clifford had told . the then-teenager she would have to sleep with Cubby Broccoli to get a . part in a James Bond film. Clifford, . from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault . against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Ian Drury . and Claire Ellicott . Athlete: Kirsty Wallace, pictured in 2011, narrowly missed out on a spot in the Olympic team in 2012 . The Royal Navy ‘drunken sailor’ paid £1million after injuring her back during alcohol-fuelled antics is now a Paralympic sports star. Lieutenant Kirsty Wallace, 32, is in Team GB’s wheelchair basketball side and is described as an elite athlete. Despite fears she would be paralysed from the waist down after the accident seven years ago, she managed to stand with splints after just six weeks and did without her wheelchair to walk down the aisle at her wedding in 2011. Determined to live life to the full, she is still in the Royal Navy and has even been able to go scuba diving and snowboarding with special equipment. She narrowly missed out on representing her country at the London 2012 Paralympic Games and has become a poster girl for the navy which celebrates her sporting achievements on its website. In 2007, Lt Wallace plunged from the top of a human pyramid built by alcohol-fuelled troops as they larked about in the mess. Following a six-year legal battle she won a payout of £1million – nearly double the maximum £570,000 compensation given by the Ministry of Defence to soldiers with the most severe battlefield injuries such as paratrooper Ben Parkinson. He lost his legs when he was blown up by a mine in Afghanistan in 2006. Lt Wallace argued her accident happened at an Armed Forces function on her base on land where top brass had responsibility for her well-being. But critics said it ‘seemed utter madness’ to pay so much taxpayers’ money when there was ‘at least some negligence on the part of the person concerned’. Sources told the Daily Mail that . during the evening Lt Wallace became involved in ‘drunken high jinks’ with high-spirited troops climbing on each others’ shoulders. The human tower collapsed and she fell up to 30ft. Tests at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth revealed she had broken her back. Surgeons fused five of the vertebrae together but she was left unable to move her legs and was told she might never walk again. However, following treatment at a spinal injuries centre, she was able to stand with splints after six weeks. Then she was treated at Headley Court, the military’s specialist rehabilitation centre for injured servicemen and women, and a year after the accident was well enough to go snowboarding. In 2010 she went scuba-diving in the Maldives with fellow serviceman Scott Wallace who proposed under water by holding up a board on which he had written: ‘Will you marry me?’ Although she uses a wheelchair, she was determined to leave it to one side when they married in May 2011. Her father Calum Archibald walked her down the aisle at Wedderburn Castle in Berwickshire. News of her payout sparked controversy as it was nearly double that handed to severely injured paratrooper Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs when he was blown up by a mine in Afghanistan in 2006 . Lt Wallace, who is from Ardrishaig in western Scotland, took up wheelchair basketball in 2009 and made her debut representing Great Britain at the BT Paralympic World Cup in Manchester in May 2011. In 2012, she was a reserve in the GB women’s basketball team for the London Paralympics. Last year, she competed for Team GB in the European Wheelchair Basketball Championships in Frankfurt. The official website of British Wheelchair Basketball says Lt Wallace ‘balances the requirements of being an elite athlete with working full time’. Until recently she was based in the Communication Information System Training Unit at HMS Collingwood, a land base near Portsmouth. She and her husband recently moved to the Bristol area, and could not be contacted for comment yesterday. An MoD spokesman declined to comment.","Lieutenant Kirsty Wallace injured after falling of human pyramid in 2007 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Former Page 3 girl Jilly Johnson described Max Clifford as a ‘gentleman’ yesterday as she defended his reputation. She told the publicist’s sex assault trial that he was a ‘very honourable man’ who had never behaved inappropriately. Clifford winked at the ex-glamour model from the dock as she tottered past on high heels after finishing her evidence. Scroll down for video . Jilly Johnson, 60, said Max Clifford, 70, was a 'perfect gentleman' who helped her with her career in the 1970s . The 70-year-old PR mogul is standing trial accused of 11 counts of indecent assault – all of which he denies. He allegedly groped, molested and abused a succession of girls as young as 12 between 1966 and 1984. His accusers have claimed he wandered around his office naked and made them perform sex acts on him. But . yesterday, a woman famous for taking off her clothes told Southwark . Crown Court in London that Clifford had always behaved impeccably. The jury had been promised Clifford’s ‘celebrity’ friends had not abandoned him, and blonde Miss Johnson was duly sworn in. She met Clifford when she was 17 and in 1975 she became the first woman to appear topless in the Daily Mirror. She . said she had dressed as ‘provocatively as you could imagine, in mini . dresses and boots’ when she knew the celebrity fixer in the 1970s. Now a 60-year-old grandmother, Miss Johnson wore an above-the-knee skirt and a smart jacket as she sat at the witness stand. Asked . to explain how Clifford behaved around her, Miss Johnson, a . twice-married mother-of-one, said: ‘Respectfully, nothing untoward or . inappropriate. ‘Literally as . a mentor, as a guide and as a great help. Yes, he was marvellous.’ She . told the jury of six men and five women: ‘I think he is a very . honourable man. I don’t see that he could be – in any way, shape or form . – not that. He is very much a gentleman.’ The . former model, who was also a member of girl band Blonde on Blonde, said . Clifford had been crucial in helping her make the transition to . actress. She subsequently appeared on popular television programmes . including The Jim Davidson Show and The Des O’Connor Show. Next . up in the witness box was a former secretary of Clifford, who attacked . suggestions that he regarded his offices as his ‘sexual fiefdom’. Jilly Johnson, 60, pictured left in 1977 and, right, last year, said Clifford gave her 'helpful' career advice . The . ex-model, who cannot be named, told jurors it was ‘absolute nonsense’ to suggest the offices in New Bond Street, central London, were . ‘sexually charged’. She said: ‘The atmosphere was great. A lot of laughs. Max was a practical joker.’ The . witness said that she  never saw him walk around  naked. She could not . recall a woman she knew telling her  that Clifford had exposed himself . to her in his offices. ‘If a . friend had said she had been assaulted, I think that is something that . would have stuck in my mind,’ she said. ‘The Max Clifford I knew would . never assault someone.’ Clifford, who listened from the dock with a hearing aid loop, smiled as the women gave their evidence . A . former teenage babysitter for Clifford’s daughter Louise told jurors . that he was ‘always very respectable’. Diedra Taylor said she came . forward to be a character witness after the publicist was arrested. Tina . Tolfrey, a mother who knew Clifford through his work as a patron of . Chase Children’s Hospice, said he was a ‘hero’ to young people who made . children’s ‘dreams come true’ by taking them on trips to Disney parks . and football matches. ‘The kids would look at him as an uncle figure,’ she said. ‘He’s the gentlest, kindest person.’ Clifford, wearing a bright blue blazer, white shirt and black trousers, smiled warmly at the women as they gave evidence. Earlier . in the trial, Clifford admitted he was a womaniser who cheated on his . first wife with four extra-marital affairs, including with a TV dancer . and a French model. He told . how the 1960s and 70s were a time of ‘sexual revolution’ and how he . attended sex parties with Hollywood sex siren Diana Dors. But . he described all his affairs as ‘meaningful relationships’ and insisted . he had never had any need to force himself on a woman. The trial . continues on Monday.

"By . Sam Greenhill . On trial: Max Clifford arriving this morning at Southwark Crown Court to hear evidence from a woman who claims he assaulted her in 1966 . A schoolgirl feared she would be raped or murdered when Max  Clifford drove her down an alley and lunged at her, a court heard yesterday. The 14-year-old was ‘frozen in fear’ and in a ‘blind panic’ as he allegedly groped at her school uniform and breasts. The celebrity publicist was said to have approached the girl in a Wimpy fast-food bar and lured her into his car, telling her ‘there is something I would like you to see’ that she would ‘really like’. The PR guru allegedly said she could meet her idols, US pop trio The Walker Brothers. But then he told her ‘this is what you’ve got to do’ as he threw himself on top of her, London’s Southwark Crown Court was told. The woman, now a 62-year-old mother of two and the first  witness in Clifford’s trial, said she was ‘frozen in fear’ in the alleged 1966 indecent assault in Morden, South London. He denies 11 counts of indecently assaulting seven women aged 14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984. She told the jury she used to go with friends to the Wimpy bar, where Clifford would sit on his own drinking coffee. Another witness described Clifford, then in his early twenties, as an  ‘oddball’ who ‘tried to hang out’ with teenagers in the Wimpy. On this occasion, the alleged victim said she went in alone but her friends were not there and Clifford offered her a lift home. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she refused because she only lived ‘round the corner’, but he said he had something to show her. He was insistent, she said, adding: ‘I gave in. I was just a silly girl and I said yes.’ But instead of taking her home, he drove in ‘totally the wrong direction’, parked in a cul-de-sac under a railway bridge and took out a book of photographs of famous people, she said. She added: ‘He got a book out and he was saying, “Look, there is me with all the stars”.’ Clifford as a young man:  Mr Clifford also laughed off suggestions his younger sibling might have borrowed his brothers' cars in 1966 or 67 - saying the PR agent didn't have a licence . Claims: Clifford allegedly offered to give a 14-year-old girl a ride home then groped her . Hearing: The PR guru insists he is innocent of all the indecent assault charges . He showed her pictures of  himself with . Sixties bands such as The Beatles and possibly the Rolling Stones, she . said. ‘He said, “Who do you want to meet?” I said I did not want to meet . anyone, I just wanted to go home.’ He then asked her if there was one . particular band she would like to meet and she named The Walker . Brothers. She added: ‘He said, “I can arrange that” and he said, “This . is what you have got to do” and he put my seat back. ‘When my seat was almost horizontal he lunged at me and put his body on mine and he was touching me all over.’ She said he touched her breasts while she was ‘on autopilot’. She . said: ‘I thought at the time that I was going to get raped if I did not . get out of the car, I was just thinking about escaping, about whether . the car door was locked or not.’ She said it was obvious that ‘it was a . sexual thing’ that he wanted her to do. Stars: Clifford showed the girl a photograph of himself with the Walker Brothers, pictured, the court heard . Showbiz: The witness said that Clifford had pictures of himself posing the Beatles . Glamour: Clifford allegedly had photographs of himself posing with the Rolling Stones . Venue: Clifford is alleged to have met the victim at the Wimpy restaurant in Morden, pictured . She said: ‘I did not know at that stage whether I was going to be raped or murdered. ‘If someone starts driving you the wrong way you know you are in trouble.’ WOMAN ONE: One indecent assault in January 1966 . WOMAN TWO: One indecent assault in 1975 . WOMAN THREE: One indecent assault between July 1977 and August 1978 and on three occasions outside that period . WOMAN FOUR: One indecent assault in 1978 . WOMAN FIVE: One indecent assault in 1982 . WOMAN SIX: One indecent assault between January 1982 and December 1984, and another outside that period . WOMAN SEVEN: One indecent assault between January 1983 and December 1984 . Eventually, . she managed to get free and ‘ran all the way home’, she said. She never . told police or her ‘strict’ parents, but says she did tell friends. Under . cross examination by Richard Horwell, QC, she denied ‘jumping on the . bandwagon’, and insisted her claims were ‘100 per cent true’. She . admitted the year of the incident might have been 1967, but denied that . ‘none of this ever happened’ and that Clifford ‘did not have a car’ in . 1966. She could not recall details of the car. The . court heard from four other witnesses, including her ex- husband, who . said she had told them years ago about her ‘bad experience’ with . Clifford. Clifford, in a navy jacket, white shirt and striped tie with grey trousers, listened through a hearing loop from the dock. The . 70-year-old ‘kiss-and-tell’ agent, who has represented music mogul . Simon Cowell and the late reality TV star Jade Goody, denies all charges . in the trial, which is expected to last up to six weeks.

"By . Sam Greenhill . David Cameron was the butt of jokes around the world yesterday for the ridiculous photo he tweeted of himself looking serious on the phone to Barack Obama. Where Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart had already boldly gone in mocking the Prime Minister’s attempt to look statesmanlike, countless others followed. Sir Patrick had tweeted a picture of himself holding a tub of Wet Ones instead of a phone and saying: ‘I’m now patched in as well. Sorry for the delay.’ David Cameron posted this picture of himself online on Wednesday with the caption: ¿I¿ve been speaking to @BarackObama about the  situation in Ukraine. We are united in  condemnation of Russia¿s actions' Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart was one of the first to mock the PM's picture - posing with some Wet Ones . Michael Moreno (left) mocked the PM's picture by holding a dog to his ear while comedian Rob Delaney used toothpaste in his selfie . Twitter users then flooded the site with images of themselves holding random objects to their ear. They included bananas, air fresheners, Lego characters, toy animals and a variety of household objects. Mr Cameron had tweeted his picture on Wednesday evening, writing: ‘I’ve been speaking to @BarackObama about the  situation in Ukraine. We are united in  condemnation of Russia’s actions.’ Now the joke has gone viral - with Twitter users across the world joining in on the fun . This picture of Putin with an ostrich was also posted online as part of the craze as was a dog on a phone . @suzannehinds (left) poses with a banana while a Lego man poses with a phone . Sir Patrick followed with his tweet  before Twitter user Michael Moreno held  up a dog to his ear and tweeted: ‘Ok, guys, thanks for holding.’ The teasing from British actor Sir Patrick, 73, prompted the Prime Minister into a good-humoured response yesterday. He posted a second photo, this time  showing him meeting Bill Clinton in  Downing Street, with a tweet to Sir Patrick saying: ‘Talking to another US President, this time face to face, not on the phone.’ US  comic Rob Delaney soon . posted a picture  of himself holding a toothpaste tube and telling Mr .

"By . David Williams . and Emily Davies . and Jonathan McEvoy . and Chris Pleasance . In tears and clutching a Valentine’s Day card for her boyfriend, Lizzy Yarnold yesterday received  Britain’s first gold medal at the Winter Olympics. The former grammar school pupil had dominated the skeleton competition in Sochi which saw her hurtle down an ice track at 80mph on a ‘tray’  nicknamed Mervyn. It was a sweet victory for the 25-year-old who had dedicated herself to winning the gold medal after being talent spotted as a future Olympic hero as a teenager. Scroll down for video . Lizzy Yarnold has won Britain's first gold medal of the Sochi Winter Olympics in the skeleton . With a time of 58.06, she beat American Noelle Pikus-Pace by just under a second . Victorious: Yarnold crosses the finish line 0.97 seconds ahead of her closest rival to claim the medal . Following her run Yarnold said the win was going to take a while to sink in . After the last of her four runs yesterday she admitted she had been so confident of winning that she had even learned how to say ‘I’m champion’ in Russian. She had been cheered on at the track by the ‘Yarnie Army’ – her former PE teacher mother Judith, businessman dad Clive, and her sisters, Katie and Charlotte. And she was in tears on the podium as she held a Valentine’s Day card for her boyfriend James Roche, who works with the technical team for British Bobsleigh. Miss Yarnold, from Sevenoaks in Kent, said: ‘As an athlete you give up so much, but on a day like today, with a victory like today it’s so worth it. ‘I wanted to do myself justice and I can’t believe I won the race. It’s lovely that it’s Valentine’s Day today as well, there’s lots of romance in the air. ‘My mum and dad coming to watch me, my sisters, my best friends, everyone’s here that I can share it with; I couldn’t do it without them.’ Valentine: Yarnold was handed a valentine's card during the flower ceremony after her win . Young love: James Roach gives his golden girlfriend a kiss during the celebrations . Team Yarnold: As well as being her boyfriend, Roach is also Yarnold's coach . Miss Yarnold had been determined to be a successful sportswoman from the age of seven when she would beat her farmer father Clive in races on the ski slope. After prep school she had chosen to go to Maidstone Grammar School rather than accept an independent school scholarship so she could finish at 3.30pm to train as a county standard runner and swimmer. She had hoped to be selected for the modern pentathalon but after attending a Girls4Gold programme aimed at identifying future Olympic athletes she was told she was suited to the skeleton. After winning yesterday Miss Yarnold urged others to follow her example. She said: ‘Have a go, follow your dreams. Never limit yourself, never limit yourself to what you can achieve.’ Mr Yarnold said he had taught Lizzy to ski at the age of seven and soon she was beating him in races. Support: Yarnold's family were there to see her win, including sister Katie, father Clive and mother Judith . Yarmy army: Yarnold was watched over the line by her parents, friends and fans . Tearful moment: Fans, friends and family of Yarnold wept and she crossed the finish line in Sochi . He said: ‘She would get to the bottom and tell me to hurry up. ‘She was always a hard working, determined and dedicated girl, so strong mentally.’ To win gold Miss Yarnold had to negotiate a 1,500 metre course with 18 corners, a vertical drop of nearly 132m and an average gradient of 9.3 degrees. Her sled is nicknamed ‘Mervyn’ after Mervyn Sugden whom she met when she took a summer job at Hardy Underwriting – an insurance syndicate of Lloyd’s of London – to fund her training. Yarnold said the final run was a bit shaky, but that she had been relaxed and enjoyed it . Time lapse: A trick of photography captures a perfect turn by Yarnold which would have passed in milliseconds in real life . Making it look easy: With a commanding overnight lead, it would have taken a major error today to rob Britain of the title . Mr Sugden, a retired underwriter, was so impressed with her determination he brokered a deal with Lloyd & Partners to finance the British skeleton team to the tune of £100,000. Miss Yarnold, who relaxes by knitting and listening to the Archers, had been sent his good luck message before she competed. Before travelling to Sochi she had revealed the lengths she had gone to in order to achieve her Olympic dream. She had said: ‘Champions don’t happen by accident. ‘My whole life I have dreamt about becoming a British Olympian and for the last five years since I took up skeleton, Sochi 2014 has been my primary focus. ‘It helps if you are a little bit mad.  You have to totally embrace what you are doing and accept your fate.’ Miss Yarnold is such an accomplished all-round sportswoman that she also represented Britain last year in team bobsleigh, finishing seventh at the 2013 World Championships in Switzerland. Convert: As a schoolgirl she competed in the pentathlon while still a teenager (left), and then converted to the skeleton in 2008 before winning gold today . Sporty: Yarnold (centre) collects a Sport Achievement Award aged just 15. Also pictured is Hannah Jelfs (left and Amy Barford (right) Making of a champion: Yarnold, who trained for five years to win the skeleton, competes in the long lump during an athletics meet in 2007 . Skeleton master: Lizzy took a commanding overnight lead in the skeleton, before clinching victory today . Home crowd: Pupils at St Michael's School in Otford, Yarnold's former school, cheer the athlete on . Winning moment: Yarnold's victory ensures Britain's second successive gold in the skeleton . Extra practise: Other countries are worried that Russia has a secret training base in the mountains . On . Thursday, in warm conditions which saw a group of Canadians walk around . bare-chested, Yarnold was the coolest competitor about. She observed . her usual patterns of listening to music and napping between runs. Her first 80mph descent immediately put her in charge. Her second run kept her there. ‘I was relaxed as soon as I got to the track,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘As soon as I stepped on to the start . line my coach really settled me. Once I started, everything felt so . natural and I loved it. ‘I . don’t feel the pressure, I’ve not been thinking about other people’s . expectations because I’ve got such high expectations of myself anyway. On Sunday Jenny Jones won Britain's first medal of the Games, with a bronze in the snowboard slopestyle . Jones (right) claimed the win after an Austrian competitor Ann Gasser fell over on her final run . With Yarnold's gold added to Jones' bronze, Team GB is now just one medal off of its three medal target . ‘I’ve . tried lots of different things in training and brought that through . into competition. I didn’t get curve 14 on the first run right and it’s . an uphill section so that bled my time. But the first and second runs . are the fastest I’ve ever gone. It’s not a bad day.’ Pikus-Pace, highly fancied coming into the Olympics but suffering a bad back, said: ‘It is hers to lose, I guess.’ Not everyone was quite as gung-ho as that. Nigel Laughton, GB team leader, called the margin a ‘good lead but not insurmountable’. The atmospherics will be different on Friday — Riviera conditions giving way to black skies and floodlights and adding a further frisson of excitement to the drama unfolding on the icy, twisting descent. None will feel the tension more than the  travelling ‘Yarny Army’, comprising Yarnold’s friends and family. Yarnold was the day’s top British performer, eclipsing Shelley Rudman, the skeleton world champion, who struggled with the fast technical course and ended the day in 11th place. Creditable: James Woods finished in a respectable fifth place in the Skiing slopestyle final on Thurday . Another letdown for those of us watching was James Woods’ marginal failure to win a medal in the ski slopestyle. He seemed thrilled not only to have finished fifth, despite so painful a hip injury that it crossed his mind he might need to withdraw, but simply to be part of the jamboree. No British male skier has ever been placed as high as Woods at an  Olympic Games. Congratulations to all the British slopestylists. Five out of six have made it into the top 10 here. Jenny Jones, has won the country’s only medal of these Games, a bronze. Now over to Yarnold to add the bullion. ‘It’s as good as it gets,’ she said. Not quite. God willing, Russian skulduggery notwithstanding, that comes on Thursday night.","Lizzy Yarnold has won Britain's first gold medal of this Winter Olympics .

"By . James Rush . Millions of Muslims across the world have been celebrating the start of the Eid al-Fitr holiday this week, which marks the end of the month-long fast of Ramadan. Celebrations have been taking place across the world for the three-day holiday to mark the end of Ramadan which sees observant Muslims refrain from eating or drinking anything from dawn to sunset in a show of spiritual devotion. The festival of Eid al-Fitr - the 'breaking of the fast' - sees devout Muslims meeting to exchange gifts, enjoy food and decorate their homes in a show of thanksgiving. While celebrations have been taking place across the world, the mood has been dark for millions of people affected by the Syrian civil war, the Gaza war and the militant advance in Iraq.

As well as the special prayers and celebrations, customs of Eid include dressing up in new clothes, eating special delicacies, giving presents and, for women, decoration of the hands with henna. This year's celebrations however have been darkened across many parts of the world. In Gaza City yesterday, streets were largely deserted, as residents huddled indoors for safety. More than 1,110 Palestinians have been killed, more than 6,500 wounded and tens of thousands displaced in the last three weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas, according to Palestinian officials. Israel has seen 53 Israeli soldiers and three civilians killed. 'All we think about is to stay safe,' said Fedaa Abul Atta, a nurse and mother of six. The family was grieving the death of her nephew, killed in an airstrike. Her house among hundreds demolished by Israeli fire in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah.

Beyond the Middle East, the few remaining Muslims in the Central African Republic's capital city ventured out to a mosque under the watchful guard of armed peacekeepers. Others like Aminata Baryn stayed at home, still too fearful to venture out for fear of attack from Christian militias who drove thousands of Muslims from the capital this year. In the Philippines, an insurgent group attacked people traveling to celebrate with their families, killing 21, including at least six children, in the bloodiest incident by the gunmen in recent years.

"By . James Rush . and Lydia Warren . and Matt Blake . Police have released further details of the moments leading up to Oregon mother Jennifer Huston's disappearance, saying she visited a store to buy trail mix and sleeping pills. The 38-year-old mother-of-two left her home in Dundee to run errands and never returned to her husband and their two sons, aged two and six. Her husband, Kallen Huston, reported her missing on Friday, July 25. Officers investigating her disappearance obtained surveillance footage of her withdrawing money from a local bank before heading to a gas station, it was reported yesterday. Police have now revealed Mrs Huston visited a Rite Aid after leaving the gas station. Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands last Thursday. Police have now revealed she visited a Rite Aid where she bought a sports drink, trail mix and sleeping pills before her disappearance . She bought a Gatorade sports drink, trail mix and sleeping pills at the store, FoxNews has reported. The . amount of sleeping pills bought at the shop was not believed to have . been enough to cause a fatal overdose, investigators told the website. Mrs Huston was spotted on cameras alone at a credit union in Newburg at around 6pm last Thursday, The Oregonian reported earlier this week. Ten . minutes later, she was captured on cameras at a nearby 76 gas station. After buying gas, her dark green Lexus LX-470 was seen driving off with . only her inside. At the time police had said she had not used her credit cards since and her cell phone has been switched off. Authorities have not said how much money she withdrew from the bank, only saying it was a small amount. Police released these surveillance footage stills of Huston's car at the gas station she visited after withdrawing money from a local bank . 'Amazing woman': Mrs Huston's father, Bill, said that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman' Police have now said her vehicle, with a full tank of fuel, could travel up to 350 miles, FoxNews has reported. Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car. 'I ask that anybody helping us, regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the side of the highways,' he said. 'See if you can tell if shrubs are . disrupted, maybe small trees knocked down where it would appear as if a . car had driven off or crashed. Her car is fairly large so it would make a . pretty good hole... Look to see if maybe her car is tucked away behind a . garage or something. 'I have the feeling she's in a ditch somewhere.' He added: 'This is totally unlike her. She's a devoted mother. She’s just a very good person, and for her to do something like this is completely out of the norm.' Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car . Detectives have said Mr Huston has cooperated with them during the investigation and had passed a polygraph test, KPTV.com reported. Her parents have also begged anyone who has any information as to her whereabouts to get in touch. Her . father, Bill Turner, said he and wife Deborah, were 'scared to death . ... absolutely scared to death' over the mystery of her disappearance. 'She's . a bright, vibrant person. She's a loving mom,' Turner said. 'She looked . like she could be a model. She's the person who everyone will gravitate . to and will want to talk to.' Speaking . of his daughter's marriage, he added: 'The best way to describe the . relationship, the way my wife describes it, is two old souls living . together.' Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information . He added that there were no conflicts at home, and that she would 'never leave her boys. She is an amazing mom and woman.'

"By . James Rush . A former student at a controversial special needs school is suing the center after she was given painful electrical shocks in a bid to alter her behaviour. Jennifer Msumba, who has autism, attended the Judge Rotenberg Center, in Canton, Massachusetts, for seven years, during which time she said she would be tied up and shocked as part of her treatment. The centre has said it uses the Graduated Electronic Decelerator (GED) shock treatment as an 'aversion therapy', in a bid to stop students from displaying aggressive or self-harming behaviour. Jennifer Msumba, who has autism, attended the Judge Rotenberg Center, in Canton, Massachusetts, for seven years, during which time she said she received numerous shocks . Students selected to receive the shocks wear backpacks with a device inside which can be activated by members of staff carrying a remote control . As part of her treatment, staff members would create a list of behaviors which would result in a shock, such as banging her head or making certain hand movements. Ms Msumba however, who left the centre in 2009, has said she felt like she received the painful shocks as punishment for being disabled. She told CBS News correspondent Anna Werner: 'It's not humane, you don't even feel like a person, you have wires all over your body. I would get five or ten shocks for just doing one thing.' Students selected to receive the shocks wear backpacks with a device inside which can be activated by members of staff carrying a remote control. The school faced a storm of controversy two years ago when a shocking video showing a disabled teenage boy being tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours was shown to a court. The video shows student Andre McCollins strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat. The school faced a storm of controversy two years ago when a shocking video showing a disabled teenage boy being tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours was shown to a court . Mr McCollins, who has learning difficulties, sued the centre in April 2012 for the treatment he had received ten years earlier. According to MyFoxBoston.com, the case was settled before a verdict was given by the jury. During the hearing his mother Cheryl told the court: 'I never signed up for him to be tortured, terrorised, and abused. I had no idea—no idea—that they tortured the children in the school. 'I couldn't turn Andre's head to the left or to the right. He was just staring straight. I took my hands and went like this (waves hand in front of her face), he didn't blink.' The video shows student Andre McCollins strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat . The centre has now said it no longer uses a restraint board when administering shocks. Andre McCollins sued the centre in April 2012 for treatment he had received ten years earlier. The case was settled before the jury delivered a verdict . Earlier this year, Ms Msumba gave testimony to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Panel, which had met to discuss the 'safety and effectiveness' of using shocks as a form of treatment. Four years ago the UN said the technique used at the school amounted to 'torture', and urged Obama's government to put a stop to it. In a statement to CBS News, JRC said Msumba 'did very well on the GED; she was receiving treatment for self-abusive behavior such as severe head banging.' The center goes on to say all other treatment had not worked and she also sent positive emails to the school after leaving five years ago. Established in 1971 to help 'fix' children who are disruptive and intent on self-harm, the school is known for their use of such tactics which they believe induces positive changes in behaviour. At the time of the McCollins case two years ago, MailOnline reported how according to literature provided by the school, children do not feel the electric shocks are anything for students or parents to be concerned about. 'This treatment, which feels like a hard pinch, has been extensively validated in the scientific literature... is extremely effective, and has no significant adverse side effects,' the paperwork said. Aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling. This form of encouraging 'learnt behaviour', as made famous in the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, has received much criticism over the years. Questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long-term while others have raised serious ethical concerns. According to SimplyPsychology, it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects, while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist. It is also said to have a high relapse rate.","Jennifer Msumba suing Judge Rotenberg Center following shock therapy .

"By . David Williams . and Nick Fagge . and Tom Gardner . and Mark Duell . The last letter written by  murdered British surgeon Abbas Khan from his Syrian prison cell proves that he was not suicidal, his family said today. Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself just days before he was due to be freed on the order of President Bashar al-Assad. But the doctor’s family have ridiculed the suggestion and say he was looking forward to Christmas with them. Family: Dr Abbas Khan's children Rurayya, seven, and Abdullah, six, (all pictured) had finally been preparing for his return when Syrian authorities told the family he had hanged himself in his cell . Claim: Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself just days before he was due to be freed on the order of President Bashar al-Assad . Determination: In this letter, written a few days before his death, Dr Khan thanks his family and friends for keeping pressure on the Syrian regime to release him after a year in prison . His family had been campaigning for his release and in the letter, dated December 7, he told them: ‘To everyone! Good work guys, seems they are now responding to the threat of a foreign delegation. ‘But keep up the pressure. We don’t want to lose the Christmas period “window”. Till I’m not released – I’m not free! They can release me immediately if they want.’ His sister Sara Khan, 23, said: ‘He was not sat there saying, “I will rot here.” He is not sat there moping, he wants to come home. He is advising us. That just shows he did not commit suicide. He was coming home to his family . . . to his children.’ Dr Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from south London, was arrested in November last year near the frontline city of Aleppo only 48 hours after he crossed the border from Turkey without a visa to help treat civilians in a field hospital. Heartfelt: Abbas Khan's daughter Rurayya, seven, begs Prime Minister David Cameron to 'please, help our Dad. Please, Please, Help!!!' Loss of life: Dr Abbas Khan, 32, pictured with his son Abdullah, had spent more than a year in jail . Touching: Abbas Khan's daughter Rurayya, seven, tells her father she wants him to 'come back very soon and safely', before signing off: 'You are my star' He was beaten and tortured while being held in an underground cell, and at one point his weight dropped to five stone. He was due to be released this weekend in a ‘Christmas-time gesture’ by Assad. Dr Khan’s children Rurayya, seven, and Abdullah, six, had finally been preparing for his return when, on Tuesday, Syrian authorities told the family he had hanged himself in his cell with his pyjamas. Tonight Dr Khan’s mother Fatima told ITV News: ‘They [the Syrian government] take out all of their anger with the British Government by killing a minor person who did not kill an ant in his life.’ The Foreign Office, whom the family have accused of ‘betrayal’ for not doing enough in the case, has said the ‘extremely suspicious’ death amounts to murder. Attacked: Dr Khan - pictured with his son Abdullah - was beaten and tortured while being held in an underground cell, and at one point his weight dropped to five stone . Claims: The final letter written by a British surgeon who died in a Syrian jail proves he did not commit suicide, his sister said today . Help: British surgeon Dr Abbas Khan, pictured, went to Syria with medical supplies to care for wounded children caught up in the civil war . Betrayal: Dr Abbas Khan's brother Afroze, left, and sister Sara, right, say the Foreign Office failed to act quickly . Syrian authorities claim their post-mortem showed Dr Khan, a hand and nerve specialist, killed himself and they say X-rays show no sign of mistreatment. They added that the family can carry out their own autopsy in Damascus. But one of Dr Khan’s brothers, Shahnawaz, said the family suspected the Syrians were trying to delay the release of the body. They want it returned immediately for a post-mortem in the UK. Sara Khan said her brother’s wife, Hana, 30, had not yet been able to tell the children that their father has died. ‘Words cannot describe what she is feeling.’ She added that Dr Khan had not planned to go to Syria, but took a sabbatical to work in refugee camps in Turkey.

Taken: Abbas's mother Fatima, pictured with Dr Khan, right, and his brother Afroze, left, in London in 1996, travelled to Syria to find her son, but never saw him freed . She said: ‘People were crossing the border with broken limbs and he knew he could help. ‘There was no religious element to his decision. He just could not just sit by and watch.’ Dr Khan was told by his daughter Rurayya in a letter that she wanted him to 'come back very soon and safely', before signing off: 'You are my star'. Rurayya also wrote a letter begging Prime Minister David Cameron to 'Please help our Dad. Please, please help!!!'","Dr Abbas Khan, 32, of South London, had gone to Aleppo to volunteer .

"By . James Rush . A Pakistani mob killed a woman and two of her granddaughters after a member of the religious minority group she belonged to was accused of posting blasphemous material on Facebook, police have said. Rioting erupted in the city of Gujranwala late last night following claims that a member of the Ahmadi community had posted a blasphemous photo on to the social networking site. The dead, including a seven-year-old girl and her baby sister, were Ahmadis, who consider themselves Muslim but believe in a prophet after Mohammed. Scroll down for video . Police arrive after the houses of a religious minority group  were torched by a mob following accusations of blasphemy, in Gujranwala, Pakistan . Rioting erupted in the city of Gujranwala late last night following claims that a member of the Ahmadi community had posted a blasphemous photo on to the social networking site, police have said . A police officer, who declined to be identified, said the youth accused of making the Facebook post had not been injured. A law passed in 1984 in Pakistan declared Ahmadis non-Mulims and they are considered by many in Pakistan to be heretics. Under Pakistani law, they are banned from using Muslim greetings, saying Muslim prayers or referring to his place of worship as a mosque. According to police, violence broke out in the town of Gujranwala, 140 miles southeast of the capital, Islamabad, following an altercation between young men, one of whom was an Ahmadi accused of posting 'objectionable material'. Firefighters try to extinguish fire at the houses of the religious minority group after a mob torched them, following accusations of blasphemy, in Gujranwala, Pakistan . Police stand guard beside the houses of the religious minority group after they were torched . A police officer told Reuters: 'Later, a crowd of 150 people came to the police station demanding the registration of a blasphemy case against the accused. 'As police were negotiating with the crowd, another mob attacked and started burning the houses of Ahmadis.' The Ahmadiyya (Ahmadi) community are persecuted in Pakistan and elsewhere and are considered non-Muslims under Pakistani law. Their status as 'non-Muslim' is recorded on their passports and they can be jailed for several years if they are caught 'posing as a non-Muslim'. The Ahmadi differ from mainstream Islam in that they do not believe Muhammad is the final prophet. There are several Muslim clerics who preach that a man who kills an Ahmadi earns a place in heaven. In 2012, 20 Ahmadis were murdered, up from 11 in 2009. Police official Zeeshan Siddiqi has said the victims died of suffocation and that another woman miscarried during the riots and was in hospital. Salim ud Din, a spokesman for the Ahmadi community, said it was the worst attack on the community since simultaneous attacks on Ahmadi places of worship killed 86 Ahmadis four years ago. 'Police were there but just watching the burning. They didn't do anything to stop the mob,' he said. 'First they looted their homes and shops and then they burnt the homes.' The police officer said they had tried to stop the mob. Accusations of blasphemy have rocketed in Pakistan - from one in 2011 to at least 68 last year, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. About 100 people have been accused of blasphemy this year. Human rights workers say the accusations are increasingly used to settle personal vendettas or to grab the property of the accused.","Rioting erupted in city of Gujranwala following 'blasphemy' claims, police say .

"By . James Rush . Horrified parents allegedly witnessed children as young as five being beaten in an unlicensed Romanian kindergarten after staff forgot to turn off CCTV cameras. Staff at the Little Kingdom nursery, in the Black Sea city of Constanta, used to leave cameras on each morning from 9am until 12noon so parents could watch their children playing and in lessons. The cameras were usually switched off at midday when the children were expected to go to sleep. But police and social workers investigating the incident say a parent who logged on after that time one day at the end of last year noticed the cameras were still running, and was shocked to see children allegedly being shouted at and abused. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Parents in Romania allegedly witnessed children as young as five being beaten in an unlicensed  kindergarten after staff forgot to turn off CCTV cameras . The cameras were usually switched off at midday when the children were expected to go to sleep . But police and social workers investigating the incident say a parent who logged on after that time one day at the end of last year discovered the alleged abuse after noticing the cameras were still running . Lawyer Stefan Roman, who is representing the parents, alleged they had found that children were given red wine in their fruit juice to make them sleep, and then given coffee to wake them up when the parents were supposed to come to take them home. On a number of occasions, parents had allegedly questioned why the children had come home with bruises, but were always told it was as a result of being hit by one of the other youngsters in the nursery group. Some of the CCTV images were recorded apparently showing the children being pushed, dropped and dragged across the floor when they either refused to sleep or did not want to wake up. At one point, a female nursery worker can allegedly be heard shouting: 'If you don't do as you're told you will get a punch in the head, just go to sleep or you will get hit so badly and then I will kick you outside in the cold.' The nursery is still running due to a legal loophole which meant a change in the law left nobody responsible for closing it down until the criminal case is complete, according to Central European News. Cristina Ivan, of the local School Inspectorate, said although the nursery was not licensed, there was nothing the authorities could do. Lawyer Stefan Roman, who is representing the parents, said they had found that children were given red wine in their fruit juice to make them sleep . On a number of occasions, parents had allegedly questioned why the children had come home with bruises, but were always told it was as a result of being hit by one of the other youngsters in the nursery group . She said: 'It is correct that it is neither authorised or accredited however we cannot go in and search the property and check it matches standards until they request a licence. Not being in our database means we have no authority to check them.' Mr Roman said the parents were also suing the owners of the nursery for compensation alongside the criminal investigation being carried out by authorities. He said: 'As you can imagine it was a shocking experience for the parents. 'There were 60 or so children at the nursery. We only have images from two days but it is clear from the injuries the children had that this must have been going on all the time.' Parents still using the nursery who saw the images on local television recently were told that they were manipulated by parents of a disabled child regarded as a troublemaker and that they were not to be trusted.","Staff at Romanian nursery used to leave cameras on throughout morning .

"By . James Rush . This is the uncomfortable moment a group of tourists put themselves 'directly in the line of danger' as they got close too close for comfort to a pair of fighting jaguars. Wildlife photographer Paul Williams was overjoyed when he came across the elusive big cats in their natural habitat, the Brazilian Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area, while filming for a television series. But Mr Williams, 34, who works for the BBC Natural History Unit, soon found himself becoming increasingly concerned as he watched tour boats jostling to see which could get closest. A group of tourists put themselves 'directly in the line of danger' as they get close too close for comfort to a jaguar . Wildlife photographer Paul Williams was planning on filming the animals but was blocked by several tourist boats who watched the animals as they fought . Mr Williams said the tourists 'went far too close for comfort. These cats have powerful legs and can jump several metres in one bound' Mr Williams had planned to film the animals, but was quickly blocked by several tourist boats wanting to get the best view. He said: 'I came across this group of young males on the corner of a river in the northern Pantanal - they appeared to be play-fighting. It wasn't long before a group of tourist boats also spotted the scene but I kept my distance knowing how dangerous jaguar are. 'The tourists went far too close for comfort. These cats have powerful legs and can jump several metres in one bound. In fact their name comes from the Native American word yaguar meaning ""he who kills in one leap"". 'At the time we guessed that they were about 5 metres away just of the edge of the bank. 'I was in the Pantanal to film various animals for a TV series. What I really wanted to film and photograph was jaguar - the biggest cat in the Americas and one of the most elusive and difficult to see. 'I couldn't believe my luck when we stumbled across a scene of four jaguar on a bend in the river (we only ever got a shot of 3 in the same frame) - a female and three large, but immature, males. We assumed that they were closely related and this would be a unique opportunity to film and photograph natural behaviour.' Mr Williams was overjoyed when he came across the elusive big cats in their natural habitat, the Brazilian Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area, while filming for a television series . Mr Williams said while the area is officially protected, it is down to common courtesy and an unwritten code between guides for good practice to be observed . Mr Williams said he was guided by a Mr Toto, who grew up navigating the waterways of the Pantanal. He said: 'His philosophy is very much the same as ours - to observe natural behaviour and not to influence it. So we did the safest and least intrusive thing we could and moved our boat to the opposite bank where we could use our long lens to capture the action from a safe distance. 'Unfortunately less than 10 minutes later several boats sped into the scene, straight in front of us, blocking our view and putting themselves directly in the line of danger. As the numbers of boats increased the drivers became more aggressive towards one another, cutting each other up to get closer and closer until they were too close for comfort. 'The cats were clearly disturbed by this and didn't stay around long - but had they been so inclined it would have been easy for one of the jaguar to run and leap straight into a boat.' Mr Williams said while the area is . officially protected, it is down to common courtesy and an unwritten code . between guides for good practice to be observed. Mr Williams counted himself lucky on the trip, having had 'seven stunning Jaguar sightings in three days', although he describes the experience as having an unsettling aspect . Mr Williams said at one point during the journey he 'had been following otter along a river in the northern Pantanal when I looked up and saw the transfixed eyes of a Jaguar staring out from the shade. It's one of the few times that I've looked an animal in the eye knowing that I was the prey' He said: 'Mr Toto said that many of these boat drivers had no training in good practice and did not realise, or care about how their behaviour influenced the animals. 'Sadly it's a scene that's too common in natural parks around the world, but it's important to remember that without tourism many of these areas would be under threat. Everyone has the right to experience nature and wildlife, but the organisations and companies who manage this have a responsibility to ensure that the welfare of the wildlife is paramount.'

"By . James Rush . Police have arrested or indicted ten suspected members of an international ring of cyber thieves who allegedly hijacked more than 1,000 StubHub users' accounts as part of a $1.6million fraud. Prosecutors have said more than 3,500 tickets were fraudulently bought by the thieves in a bid to make money by reselling them. Some of the tickets were for gigs by Elton John, Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z, sports events including New York Yankees baseball games and the US Open, and Broadway shows such as The Book of Mormon. Scroll down for video . Bryan Caputo, left, and Daniel Petryszyn sit during arraignment proceedings in New York state Supreme Court, yesterday. They are two of six people indicted yesterday in an international ring that allegedly took over more than 1,600 StubHub users' accounts and fraudulently bought tickets . A suspect is led away as City of London Police execute a warrant at an address in Peckham, London, in connection with the alleged fraud . The scheme spooled from Russia to London to Toronto to the New York area and to Barcelona, in Spain, where accused Russian ringleader Vadim Polyakov was arrested while on holiday earlier this month. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr announced the arrests on Wednesday following an operation which also involved the City of London Police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Polyakov, 30, was awaiting extradition, and it wasn't immediately clear whether he had a lawyer. Three other men indicted in the case hadn't yet been arrested; two are in Russia. Three suspected money-launderers were arrested in London while another was arrested in Toronto on local charges there. The case comes amid growing concern about data thieves targeting consumer giants.

While prosecutors said they were not certain how the alleged thieves got access, San Francisco-based StubHub said they got account holders' login and password information from key-loggers or other malware on the customers' computers or from data breaches at other businesses. StubHub, which is owned by eBay, said there had been 'no intrusions into StubHub technical or financial systems.' In the last few years, such major companies as Target, LinkedIn, eBay and Neiman Marcus have been hacked. Since many customers use the same email and password on multiple websites, thieves can use a combination from one site that works in many others, data security experts say. Joe Siegrist, the CEO of LastPass, which makes password-management software, warned it was like re-using 'the same key for every lock in your life - especially if you're giving that key out to everyone you meet.'

She said: 'It's very hard for me because I didn't grow up around this. 'I have had to watch Blaise riding on gators his entire life. Despite being bitten on numerous occasions, Mr Kliebert considers each and every one of his 2,500 alligators to be a part of the family . One of the team at Klieberts Alligator Farm feeds an alligator in Hammond, Louisiana . The biggest gator on the farm is around 15ft in length. Mr Kliebert has been known to wrestle even bigger animals that weigh in excess of 1,000lbs. Pictured is Mr Kliebert and his son Blaise with a 12ft alligator . 'He often comes home and tells me he has been bitten - not by a big one obviously, but it's still scary.' Mr Kliebert however sees no problem in allowing his young son near the creatures. 'If he is happy doing it then I want him to do it right,' the 29-year-old said. The family generates their income through selling the gator meat or their skin and showing visitors around the farm . 'He could end up making a mistake and getting hurt if he didn't know what he was doing. 'I've shown him everything I know about the gators.' Blaise meanwhile seems to be quite keen on the idea of following in his father's footsteps. He said: 'When I grow up I want to be tough like my daddy and wrestle gators.' Despite being bitten on numerous occasions, Mr Kliebert considers each and every one of his 2,500 alligators to be a part of the family. He said: 'It's not often that family want to kill you but these alligators are naturally predators. 'They don't actually want to hurt you - they're more afraid of you than you are of them but they will hurt you when it comes down to it - you corner them and they're dangerous.' The biggest gator on the farm is around 15ft in length. Mr Kliebert has been known to wrestle even bigger animals that weigh in excess of 1,000lbs. He said: 'I meet a lot of people who say I am stupid for doing this job but to me it is an everyday job. 'You do get hurt from time to time but that comes with any job. 'It's what I've always known and it's my passion, I wouldn't want to do anything else.' The family generates their income through selling the gator meat or their skin that can be used to make shoes, handbags and accessories. They also make a large amount of cash from showing visitors around the farm.","T-Mike Kliebert hopes his son Blaise will one day take over family gator farm .

Sam Wilson, also known as The Falcon, a crime-fighting partner of the original 'Cap' Steve Rogers, will be taking over the reins in the 'All-New Captain America' which is due to be released in November.

The news comes in the same week comic book fans were rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, when it revealed that Thor is now a woman. Marvel Comics has announced the new Captain America will be African-American for the first time in the comic franchise's history . Marvel executive editor Tom Brevoort said Wilson's move to become Captain America 'shouldn't be seen as revolutionary.' 'It's about time. In 2014, this should be a thing that we shrug off, it shouldn't be seen as revolutionary, but it still feels exciting,' the New York Daily News quoted him as saying. The move was revealed by Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada on The Colbert Report last night. The change however will only be made on the page at the moment, with actor Chris Evans due to continue portraying the superhero on the big screen. Writer Rick Remander told Marvel.com: 'I think that it’s important with these stories to do things that are natural and make sense and have an inherent logic to the universe, but are also constantly shifting and exciting, keeping the drama high. 'In order to do that it really comes down to creating new dynamics.'

On Tuesday it was reported that Marvel was experimenting with bringing in a new audience after revealing hammer-wielding superhero Thor is now a woman. Reaction to the proposed change was mixed, with fans taking to Marvel's Facebook page to rail against changes to their childhood heroes. Many questioned how the plot line will allow for this mysterious woman to take over the hammer of Thor, speculating on whether she is a long-lost relative. The news comes in the same week comic book fans were rocked by an unexpected move by Marvel, when it revealed that Thor is now a woman . But Marvel has said simply that the new character using the power of Mjölnir - the hammer - is Thor. 'This new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!' Marvel editor Wil Moss said. 'The inscription on Thor's hammer reads ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."" Well it's time to update that inscription.' In a statement Marvel said the new look Thor will be the eighth lead female protagonist, as the publisher tries to open up comics to more women.","Sam Wilson, also known as The Falcon, will be taking over the reins after Steve Rogers lost his special powers and youth last month .

We will produce him in the local court on Monday and seek his custody for further interrogation and investigation,' According to the International Business Times, Auradkar said 'most of the downloaded videos depicted children in uniform being raped.' Reports of the rape sparked protests outside Vibgyor School, near the city's Kundalahalli Gate, as hundreds of parents pulled down its gates and shouted slogans.

The International Business Times also quoted police claiming the man had been fired by another school after he was allegedly involved in a sexual assault case. The matter was, however, reportedly not passed on to the police. On Thursday, school chairman Rustom Kerawala addressed a meeting of the parents where he offered his 'sincere apologies' and promised 'full co-operation' with the police in the investigation. According to parents, this was allegedly the third sexual molestation case in the school in the last six months, and the girls had revealed the same following the latest incident. A new focus on sexual violence has swept the country since the 2012 gang-rape attack in which a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital New Delhi.

"By . James Rush . The defence team for Oscar Pistorius has closed its case in the murder trial of the Olympic athlete. Lawyer Barry Roux today said he had finished calling witnesses to testify in the trial before the court adjourned for a month to allow the legal teams to prepare and submit their closing arguments. 'We close the case for the defense,' said Roux. Scroll down for video . The defence team for Oscar Pistorius (pictured in court today) has closed its case in the murder trial of the Olympic athlete . He said some witnesses did not want to testify for the defence because of publicity surrounding the case, adding that he chose not to ask Judge Thokozile Masipa to compel them to appear. 'There's nothing that we can do about it,' he said in the Pretoria courtroom where the trial of the double-amputee runner has been held since March. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year. He could also be sentenced to a shorter prison term if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing. Additionally, he faces separate gun-related charges. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel says the prosecution will file closing arguments on July 30 and the defense will do so on August 4. He and Roux also agreed to return to court on August 7 to make final arguments before Judge Thokozile Masipa. A woman adjusts the tie of South African Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius during his ongoing murder trial in Pretoria, today . Pistorius' defence lawyer Barry Roux (centre) speaks to other members of the defence team during the trial today . The 27-year-old athlete says he killed Steenkamp by mistake, thinking an intruder was in the toilet and about to attack him. The prosecution says he shot her after a Valentine's Day argument last year. Pistorius was born without fibulas, the slender bones that run from below the knee to the ankle. Part of his lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old. Yesterday saw Mr Nel challenge the credibility of a physician who testified that the athlete has an anxious nature linked to his disability. Gerrie Nel, state prosecutor for the trial of Oscar Pistorius, smiles at the end of today's hearing . Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if he is found guilty of murdering his law graduate and model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot and killed at his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day last year . Mr Nel said the defense witness, physician Wayne Derman, could not be objective about the double-amputee runner. The defence maintains that Pistorius has a deep sense of vulnerability because of his disability and a fear of crime, and it was a factor in the killing because he opened fire after thinking an intruder was in his house. Under questioning, Derman acknowledged that his testimony did not amount to a 'forensic report' but disputed Mr Nel's assertion that he could not give credible evidence because he was too familiar with Pistorius, having treated him over many years and traveled with him extensively.","Lawyer Barry Roux said he had finished calling witnesses to testify in trial .

"By . David Mccormack . and James Rush . It started with a simple request - just $10 to make a potato salad. But four days after posting the straight forward-looking project to a crowd-funding website, its creator Zack Danger Brown has been inundated with offers of help. So far more than 2,000 backers have pledged over $16,000 on the project's Kickstarter page. Zack Danger Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, has received pledges of over $16,000 from 2,000 backers since posting the simple request of raising $10 for a potato salad four days ago . Brown, of Columbus, Ohio, has been . creating 'stretch goals' as the money continued to pour in after the . page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. The . initial request for $10 came with the simple pitch of: 'Basically I'm . just making potato salad. I haven't decided what kind yet.' He soon amended his goals to include a pizza party for $75 and two different potato salads at $100. The latest stretch goal however, which again has been easily smashed, was to organize a potato salad party for the 'whole internet' if the project managed to raise $3,000. Mr Brown has been adding 'stretch goals' as the amount of money raised continued to rise after the page was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter . $1 - A 'thank you' posted to the website and Mr Brown will say your name while making the potato salad . $2 - A photo of Mr Brown making the potato salad . $3 - A bite of the potato salad . $5 - Choose a potato salad-appropriate ingredient . $10 - Hang out in the kitchen while the potato salad is made . $20 - A potato salad-themed haiku, your name carved into a potato used in the salad, a signed jar of mayonnaise and the potato salad recipe . $25 - A potato salad-themed hat . $35 - A limited edition t-shirt . $50 - A Potato Salads Of The World recipe book .

Those who . pledge $3 will receive a bite of the potato salad, for $5 there is the . chance to choose an ingredient and those who pledge $25 will receive a . potato-salad themed hat.

"By . James Rush . and Associated Press . Oscar Pistorius and his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp had a 'loving and caring' relationship, his manager told the Olympic athlete's murder trial today. Peet Van Zyl said Pistorius and his model girlfriend called each other pet names and the athlete was making plans to take her away on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her. The defence called Mr Van Zyl to the stand in an attempt to bolster Pistorius' account that he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, providing testimony about a loving relationship and a fear of crime that may have pushed the Paralympian to fire through a closed toilet door. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius (pictured arriving at court today) had a 'loving' relationship with his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, his manager today told the trial . Oscar Pistorius greets a wellwisher during his murder trial in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria today . Peet Van Zyl said Pistorius and his model girlfriend called each other pet names and the athlete was making plans to take her away on international trips shortly before he fatally shot her . The agent faced tough questioning from . the chief prosecutor, however, about Pistorius' alleged egotism and . tantrums, high-speed driving and love of guns. Giving evidence at the trial, Mr Van Zyl told the court the athlete was nervous and 'fidgety' at home and had a 'heightened sense of awareness.' Mr Van Zyl recalled to the court how on one occasion Pistorius drove at high speed to the airport and, when told there was no rush, recalled a traumatic episode in which Mr Van Zyl was accosted at gunpoint while in his car in 2007. 'He wanted to ensure that we are safe and not being followed,' Mr Van Zyl said. He also remembered a time when Pistorius grabbed him by the arm in apparent fear when the pair heard a loud bang while walking in New York City, and described two occasions in which the runner lost his temper but was not aggressive under 'abusive questioning' from journalists. He also said he was assisting Pistorius in plans to take Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model, to races in Britain and Brazil, and a concert in Italy. Pistorius has testified that he fired through a closed bathroom door, killing Steenkamp, in the mistaken belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home . Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel tried to . pick holes in Van Zyl's testimony, pressing the agent for details about a . reported incident in which a South African athlete who was sharing a . room with Pistorius asked for them to be separated because Pistorius was . allegedly arguing frequently on his telephone. He . also referred to a 2012 Paralympics race in which Pistorius accused the . winner of breaking the rules by using prosthetic limbs that were too . long. Van Zyl acknowledged . that it was the 'wrong place and wrong time for him to react in such a . way' but noted there was a 'long lead-up' to the incident in which . Pistorius had expressed concerns that rules were being flouted. Mr Nel also described Pistorius' plans . to take Steenkamp on trips as an example of alleged narcissism after . Van Zyl quoted the athlete as saying he wanted his girlfriend 'to see . what my world is about, the pressure that I'm under' and 'how I need to . perform.' Earlier, the hearing focused on the screams that neighbours say they heard on the night the athlete killed his girlfriend. June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva Steenkamp, arrives at North Gauteng High Court for the trial of Oscar Pistorius . Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel (pictured) today cross-examined acoustics expert Ivan Lin, who gave evidence yesterday about the challenges of hearing accurately from a distance . Mr Nel questioned an acoustics expert who was called by the defence team as part of its effort to suggest some neighbours who testified they heard the screams of a woman were wrong. They argue the witnesses actually heard the high-pitched screams of the double-amputee runner. The acoustics expert, Ivan Lin, testified that he conducted tests that showed ambient noise and other factors can make it difficult to hear accurately from a distance. Mr . Lin questioned whether neighbours 177 metres away could have . heard screams coming from the toilet, or identified them as a man or . woman. ‘At 177 metres . away, if the scream was from the toilet, it is highly unlikely that the . listener can hear the screams, let alone interpret the sound source . reliably,’ he said. Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if found guilty of premeditated murder, and could also face years in prison if convicted of murder without premeditation or negligent killing . Mr Nel said . the screams of a woman have a 'tonal character' and referred to the . testimony of the neighbours who were convinced they had heard a . screaming woman. Mr Lin responded that he could not say whether they were 'correct or incorrect'. Pistorius has testified that he fired . through a closed bathroom door, killing Steenkamp, in the mistaken . belief there was a dangerous intruder in his home. The prosecution has alleged that Pistorius, 27, killed 29-year-old Steenkamp after a Valentine's Day argument.

This is an abhorrent violation of his freedom of thought and belief.' While detained, Mr Bala told online he was detained because of a 'personality change' after he became atheist despite having been raised a Muslim.

"By . Martin Robinson . A neighbour from hell kept people awake up to a mile away because of the 100 birds he had cooped up in his back garden, a court heard. Michael Hall, 53, caused problems in his suburban cul-de-sac and beyond for six years with his noisy flock of ducks, chickens, guinea fowl and pheasants. Residents complained Hall's huge collection of birds stopped them sleeping because of their constant clucking, crowing and quacking. They also said they attracted pests such as foxes and flies because they lived in squalid conditions. Noisy neighbour: Michael Hall kept at least 100 birds in his garden and locals were so upset about six years of noise they took him to court . Upsetting: The birds were kept in filthy conditions that has led to a total ban for Michael Hall . Disturbance: The constant noise from birds such as these chickens forced neighbours to take legal actions as Hall just ignored them . Argument: Neighbours built a case against Hall and said the birds kept them awake at night and their filth attracted foxes and flies and polluted the air with their foul-smelling droppings . At the height of the disruption even people living in nearby streets a mile away were knocking on the door of Hall's £190,000 detached . house in Nottingham to complain about the noise. After pleading with him to get rid of the birds his fed-up neighbours' pleas fell on deaf ears and they launched legal action against Hall. They amassed a catalogue of evidence against him, including photos and videos of his back garden and even audio recordings of cockerels crowing. And locals were celebrating today after magistrates prohibited Hall - who had already cleared the enclosure - from keeping animals in future. Hall denied causing a statutory nuisance under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act but was fined £100 and ordered to pay legal costs of £437.60 and a victim surcharge of £20. Nottingham Magistrates Court heard how residents in Borman Close suffered frequent rat infestations after the pests were attracted by cast-off bird food. Witnesses also told the court their sleep would be interrupted by the noise of panicked ducks whenever a fox squeezed through hall's garden fence. Happy day: (R-L) Laura Sheridan and Julie Robinson are among the neighbours who have had to put up with 6 years of nuisance from neighbour Michael Hall . Sweet relief: Laura Sheridan, 29, represented herself and the rest of her neighbours in court, and can now have her windows open again . Laura Sheridan, 29, who represented herself and the rest of her neighbours in court, presented evidence against Hall at the one-day hearing. After the case Mrs Sheridan hailed the verdict as a victory for her street after years of 'sleepless nights'. Yesterday, she said: 'We are absolutely thrilled at the outcome. 'We just wanted the magistrates to agree with us so we could get our gardens back, sleep and sanity, and enjoy our lives.' Moving forward: The garden that was once filled with birds and filth has now been cleared . Julie Robinson, 44, another resident who was in court, described the constant battle to curb the problem of the birds. She said: 'It started about six years ago with a dog and then just escalated from there. 'I've lost count of the number of times we approached him - you'd have a perfectly amicable conversation and he said he'd sort it out - but nothing ever came of it. 'He must have been oblivious to the noise and the smells but they were very obvious to everyone else. 'Despite threatening him with legal action it never seemed to spur him into cleaning the place up. 'We were extremely pleased with the court's decision but it's a shame it had to come to this. 'We used to have a nice, neighbourly relationship but that's sadly not the case now.' Reacting to the verdict, Hall said he was disappointed by the magistrates' decision. He said: 'I feel like a goldfish in a bowl. I go home. I'm watched. I'm recorded.'","Michael Hall, 53, kept people awake up to a mile away in Nottingham .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A welder has received a five-figure compensation pay-out after his neck was sliced open with an angle-grinder as he cut steel for his employer. Alan Bailey, 48, from Birmingham, West Midlands, had to undergo emergency surgery to stitch up the 12-inch wound after the machine slashed his throat in August 2011. Despite wearing full protective gear at the time, Mr Bailey was 'millimetres from dying' when the machine 'kicked back against a piece of steel' and cut close to his major veins and arteries. Alan Bailey, 48, from Birmingham, West Midlands, spent nine weeks recovering from his injuries and had to be cared for by his wife Tracy (pictured together above) after the angle-grinder slashed through his neck in 2011 . The welder was 'millimetres from dying' after an angle-grinder he was using to cut steel for his employers 'kicked back' and slashed through his neck, close to his main arteries. He had been wearing protective gear . The father-of-three had to undergo emergency surgery and needed 17 staples to hold the deep wound together . The father-of-three, who was treated at Russells Hall Hospital, West Midlands, was left needing 17 staples to hold the deep wound in his neck together and suffered psychological issues as a result. He has now won a five-figure settlement from his employer Pressvess Ltd, after the firm admitted liability for the incident. Mr Bailey said: 'I couldn't believe it when the accident happened. I was wearing full protective gear when the machine sliced my neck . 'I was shell-shocked and I grabbed my neck to try to stem the bleeding. 'I was in complete agony and a friend took me to hospital where I had emergency surgery to clear debris from the wound and repair the muscles which had been severed. 'The doctors told me I was literally millimetres from having a fatal injury which was horrifying to hear.' Mr Bailey spent nine weeks recovering from the incident and had to be cared for by his wife Tracy. The welder has now received a five-figure settlement from his employer Pressvess Ltd, after the stainless steel fabrication business  admitted liability for the incident which occurred on site in August 2011 . Mr Bailey has  physically recovered from his injuries but suffers from psychological issues since the ordeal . He said: 'I needed help with every part of my daily routine which was horrific - I couldn't do anything around the house or even wash and dress without the help of my wife and three boys. 'It was an incredibly difficult period of my life. Mrs Bailey said the ordeal had been a 'tough time' for the family. She said: 'I'm so glad I still have a husband and my boys still have their father. 'It was such a horrific accident and it has been a really tough time for Alan and the family. Mr Bailey, 48, said he just wants to 'look to the future now' after receiving the five-figure compensation . 'I am just so glad he has recovered from it and we still have him with us.' Katy Bailey, from law firm Irwin Mitchell, who represented Mr Bailey, said: 'This is a horrific case which highlights the terrible consequences which can emerge as a result of health and safety failings in the workplace. 'While we are delighted to have helped Alan get the support he needed following the problems he faced, it is important that a case like this is held up as an example as to why employers need to following health and safety legislation and ensure they are doing everything they can to protect their staff. 'Too many people are injured as a result of failings which could and should be avoided and it is vital lessons are learned to ensure the same problems are never repeated in the future.' Mr Bailey said he was relieved the incident was behind him and said he just wanted 'to look to the future now'. He said: 'Knowing that we have secured this settlement is a massive relief and a weight off my shoulders. 'I'm hopeful that this means I will now be able to move on with my life and put what I've been through behind me.' Now having recovered fully from his injuries, Mr Bailey continues to work for Pressvess Ltd. A spokesman for the stainless steel fabrication business said: 'Pressvess takes its responsibility for health and safety very seriously and expects all employees to do the same. 'Following a full and thorough accident investigation improvements have since been made. 'Alan returned to work following his recovery and continues to be a valued member of staff at Pressvess.'","Alan Bailey, 48, was 'millimetres from dying' when angle-grinder slicked neck .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wake-up call: Helen Rogers, 57, is being prosecuted for her cockerel's 'particularly noisy' crowing . They say the early bird gets the worm, but all Big Bird the cockerel manages to do is irritate his neighbours. Chicken breeder Helen Rogers, 57, is being prosecuted for the animal's ‘particularly noisy’ crowing. Villagers say he wakes them at 3am and goes on ‘incessantly’ until 11pm, starting a chain reaction of crowing in Hambledon, Hampshire. Officers from Winchester City Council have visited the site five times - and served Mrs Rogers with a noise abatement notice in August last year. But she now been summoned to Fareham Magistrates' Court on Thursday accused of breaching the order on three occasions. Mrs Rogers has denied the four-year-old Light Sussex cockerel is a nuisance or crows throughout the night. And she claims she followed the council's advice to cover the coop with a black-out blanket at dusk and remove it no earlier than 9am. 'Several people in the village own cockerels and they all make a noise. That is what cockerels do,' she said. 'I don't understand people who live in the countryside and then complain about country noises such as animals and farm machinery. 'We have a school opposite the land where you can hear the children playing, and a church where the bells ring regularly. 'If you don't like this sort of thing you should move to the town or city instead. My cockerel is no more noisy than any other cockerel in the area and it is certainly not a nuisance. 'I keep it covered, so it does not crow at unreasonable hours. I am also unsure how anybody can tell the difference between my bird and any other. Animal lover: Villagers say he wakes them at 3am and goes on 'incessantly' until 11pm, starting a chain reaction of crowing in Hambledon, Hampshire. Above, Mrs Rogers is pictured with two of her other birds . Action: Officers from Winchester City Council (pictured) served Mrs Rogers with a noise abatement notice in August last year. But she now been summoned to court accused of breaching the order on three occasions. 'It is ridiculous and upsetting that I am being taken to court over something like this.' Mrs Rogers breeds rare cockerels, chickens, and ducks on the land, previously known as St Peter's Farm. It is home to seven ducks, 21 rare breed chickens, three normal chickens, two cockerels, six horses, one rabbit, and two dogs. Denial: Mrs Rogers has denied Big Bird is a nuisance or crows throughout the night. Above, she is pictured with her rare breed cockerel, Henry . But the animal lover lives around 20 miles away in Chichester, West Sussex. Mrs Rogers said she had received letters from the council, in which they said neighbours had complained about the 'incessant crowing'. 'One neighbour has said he would like to see Big Bird ""dispatched"" but there is no way I am doing that,' she said. 'If I have to I will move him elsewhere, but I won't kill him or give him away.' Councillor Tony Coates, who represents the village on Winchester City Council, said the noise 'has been annoying half the village'. He added: 'The countryside is noisy, smelly, and occasionally dangerous, and people who live here should put up with that to some extent. 'But this cockerel is an early-riser and particularly noisy. When it crows it starts a chain reaction among the other cockerels in the village. 'In this instance, it is a nuisance. It needs to be kept in a darkened coop, and its perch should be put higher up so it cannot extend its neck and crow."" Caroline Dibden, vice chairwoman of Hambledon Parish Council, said: 'It is a particularly noisy cockerel and wakes people up very early in the morning. 'Our single biggest attended parish council meetings are when St Peter's Farm is on the agenda. 'This particular issue is a real problem because it affects a lot of people.'","Helen Rogers, 57, is being prosecuted for Big Bird the cockerel's crowing .

The three Polish men were among those remembering 76,000 people who died at two sites in central Germany - hanged, starved or riddled with disease, mostly for the crime of being different. They were forced to make munitions at Mittelbau-Dora, where the ceremony took place, and 50 miles away at its parent camp Buchenwald, both of which were liberated by U.S. troops 69 years ago this week. As early as 1937, Nazi leaders sent some 250,000 people to Buchenwald, Mittelbau-Dora and dozens of other sub-camps, where they lived in terrible conditions with little food. The majority of those who died collapsed from exhaustion. At Buchenwald, 8,000 Soviet prisoners of war were shot in a specially-made killing facility. This year's ceremony focused on the genocide of Hungarian Jews in the Second World War, and saw the former prisoners lay flowers and examine the crematorium where the bodies of their friends were burned. After lying forgotten in disrepair for decades, Mittelbau-Dora, near Nordhausen, Germany, was reinstated in 2005 as a memorial site and museum to the atrocities of Nazi Germany, with the message that they should never be forgotten. Tears for the dead: Nazi concentration camp survivor Boleslaw Pieniazkiewicz, from Poland, mourns during a ceremony today to commemorate the 69th anniversary of the liberation of former Nazi concentration camp Mittelbau-Dora near Nordhausen, Germany.

Emotion: The prisoners at Mittelbau-Dora and its parent camp, Buchenwald, were forced to make German munitions for the war in terrible conditions . Shadows of the past: The camp was stripped bare in 1947 and reinstated as a full memorial site in 2005, to ensure the horrors of the Nazi regime are not forgotten . Comfort: Bertrand Herz, President of the International Committee of Buchenwald-Dora and Sub-Camps, left, with Nazi concentration camp survivor Ed Carter-Edwards, who travelled to the service from Canada. Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and the homeless were sent to the camps, among many others . Poignant: With their prisoner numbers still visible to remind them how they were dehumanised, the survivors examine tributes at the new memorial in Mittelbau-Dora . Horror: Nazi concentration camp survivor Chasten Bowen and his wife Jeanie Bowen travelled from California. Here they examine the ovens where bodies were burned .

Federal agents seized the website and raided a house, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Northern California, believed to be connected to the online directory yesterday.

Omuro, who is due in court on Friday, has been released on $500,000 bond and Lanoce was released on $250,000 bond. A U.S. attorney's spokeswoman did not know if they had attorneys. The federal raid stems from a national crackdown on child sex trafficking this month, the Associated Press has reported. Authorities say 168 children have been rescued and 281 alleged pimps arrested. An unnamed law enforcement source told CNN officers were able to identify a number of the rescued children through myredbook.com. The website has now been seized and features an FBI notice saying: 'This seizure is based on probable cause to believe that this domain name was involved in money laundering derived from racketeering based on prostitution in violation of state and federal law.' The front page of the website has now been replaced with this message . According to the indictment, Omuro, of Mountain View, has been charged with numerous counts of money laundering while both he and Lanoce, of Rocklin, were charged with interstate travel in the aid of a racketeering enterprise. Sex worker rights advocates in the Bay Area have expressed their concern that the free site had been seized.

With a sleek blowdry and cut-glass vowels, the 40-year-old is middle class from the top of her head to the tips of her pedicured toes. Scroll down for video . Lidl and Aldi were once names to be avoided, but have won over leagues of middle class shoppers by stocking items such as prosciutto and Parmesan for knock-down prices (file pic) She is exactly the sort of shopper one sees wandering the spacious aisles of Waitrose.

Figures this week revealed that the combined sales of Lidl and Aldi are likely to overtake those of Morrisons — a rise driven by middle-class shoppers deserting the likes of Sainsbury’s, Tesco and even Waitrose, for the discount chains. Lidl now has more than 600 shops in the UK, and Aldi more than 500. Aldi expects to generate record sales of £7 billion this year, while Lidl UK expects to enjoy a similar turnover. And the secret to their seduction of the mid-market shopper? They have undercut British supermarkets on the luxury goods middle-class shoppers can’t bring themselves to go without. When British shoppers fell in love with Mediterranean food, from the Seventies onwards, all the supermarkets fell over themselves to stock it. They saw an opportunity to sell Parmesan cheese and such like as ‘deli’ foods, and made shoppers pay through the nose for them. Aldi and Lidl have cottoned on to middle class values, promoting affordable win and dinner-part show-stoppers at bargain prices . Meanwhile, in Germany, Aldi and Lidl were sourcing foods that are seen as everyday items in the countries where they originated, for example ham from Parma and the Black Forest, gouda from Holland, Brie de Meaux from France, and ice cream from Italy. As staples, they were priced reasonably, and the shops flourished, expanding across Europe to Britain. The realisation over the past few years that Aldi and Lidl sell similar foods to Waitrose and Sainsbury’s, but at the price enjoyed by shoppers in France, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Portugal, has sent British shoppers flocking to their stores. But the rise of cut-price shops hasn’t happened overnight. Ever since 2008’s financial crash, the chat at dinner parties has been less about where everyone will be going skiing and more about that great bottle of extra virgin olive oil from Aldi. ‘So cheap, you’d never know,’ boasted one friend, soon after her conversion to bargain-basement shopping. Low-cost supermarkets are also thriving because we have lost faith in leviathans such as Tesco. Shoppers are tired of expensive advertising campaigns and BOGOF labels that only mean we end up with more than we can chew — and wasting a shameful amount of food. The opening of Aldi and Lidl stores now attract queues of people waiting to get inside first . The sight of a superstore stuffed with thousands of lines feels decadent, while Lidl and Aldi, with their smallish buildings and modest ranges — Aldi and Lidl stock between 1,000 and 3,000 lines, compared with more than 50,000 at a superstore — seem positively intimate. For cash and time-strapped middle-class shoppers, this simplicity is appealing. Shrewdly, Aldi and Lidl have since cottoned on to other British middle-class values, producing dinner-party show-stoppers at bargain prices. The fashionable steak of the moment is Wagyu, a Japanese method of producing tender, fat-marbled beef involving feeding the cattle with beer and massaging its rump. The meat is famously decadent, but Aldi sell Wagyu beef Sirloin Steaks for just £6.69. Locally sourced produce has become fashionable with the middle classes in recent years, and again Aldi and Lidl were quick to catch on. For Christmas 2012, Aldi launched the Roly Poly  free-range bronze turkey, reared near the ancient Thetford Forest, which straddles Suffolk and Norfolk, in portable sheds with access to grassy fields. At £37.99 per turkey, Aldi undercut the competition by £10 and produced something of equal standard to Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. The rest of the year, Lidl sell whole free-range chickens for £5 each. Both chains are also brilliant at capitalising on short-lived trends. In this sport-obsessed summer, with the Tour de France in Britain, Wimbledon and the World Cup all on our screens, Lidl launched a limited range of high-end bikes and cycling equipment at discount prices. Aldi launched a £65 GPS watch in June that measures your heartbeat and tells you where you are — as well as what time it is. No wonder Tesco is having a crisis of confidence. Aldi and Lidl are tapping into the interests and tastes of shoppers almost effortlessly, while the giant retailer throws them 10,000 lines and get barely a bite. And the best thing about Aldi and Lidl? They are taking the snobbery out of grocery shopping, selling delicious foods at the price paid in European supermarkets and not marking them up as luxuries for the rich. Cheers — or Prost! as our German friends would say — to that!","Shoppers deserting Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Tesco for Aldi and Lidl .

"By . Mark Duell . A mother claimed today that her three year-old son was left with burns and bruises when a new £3 football exploded on his lap. Nikki Thomas, 28, bought ‘two for £6’ balls from a Sports Direct store in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, for Codey and his four-year-old brother Tod. Her partner Tom Winn asked a member of staff to inflate them both before they left the store - but when they got in the car, Miss Thomas claims one of them ‘spontaneously exploded’ as Codey held it.

Buckinghamshire, said the youngster suffered friction burns on his legs . and bruising and claims the explosion was so big it even damaged her . car’s speakers. She said: . ‘They were selling the balls at two for £6 so we bought them and my . partner took them to the counter and a member of staff put air into . them. ‘When we had paid we got into the car and as we were driving into a supermarket car park to pull up we heard a huge bang. ‘We . stopped the car and I got out and when I opened the back door I saw . that the football had literally split into two while it was on Codey’s . lap. ‘He was in tears and he . had bruises and burns on his leg. It’s so lucky that it wasn’t his . face. I then took the football off Tod because it looked as though it . was splitting at the seams as well.’ Ripped apart: Miss Thomas claims the explosion was so big that it even damaged her car's speakers . Miss Thomas and builder Mr Winn, 30, returned to the store to complain and were given an apology and their money back. 'When we had paid we got into the car and as we were driving into a supermarket car park to pull up we heard a huge bang' Nikki Thomas . Miss Thomas, who lives in a £240,000 house and also has 15 week-old son Ronnie, made a second trip later when she discovered her car speakers had also been damaged. She added: ‘We then got into the car to drive home and after my partner decided to put some music on we heard crackling from the speaker. ‘We had a look and because Codey’s leg was next to the speaker at the time the ball exploded it had burst the speaker as well, all the inside lining of it had been ripped. Outside home: The family returned to the store to complain and were given an apology and their money back . Retailer: Miss Thomas bought the football from this Sports Direct store in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire . ‘I went back because I wanted to make it really clear that it wasn’t just a little thing, it had really hurt my son. We were told staff are supposed to undertake training to inflate the balls. 'He was in tears and he had bruises and burns on his leg. It’s so lucky that it wasn’t his face' Nikki Thomas . ‘I don’t know if it was down to the member of staff over-inflating the ball or whether they were just really poor quality balls, I think it was probably a combination of both. ‘Codey usually sits next to our newborn son, Ronnie, so we are lucky that wasn’t the case this time. I also dread to think what could have happened if the ball had exploded in Ronnie or Codey’s face.’ A Sports Direct spokesman said today: 'Sports Direct is aware of the incident and is investigating.'","Nikki Thomas, 28, bought 'two for £6' balls from a Sports Direct store .

"By . Mark Duell . ITV is set to increase the number of black, Asian and ethnic minority actors on its drama shows by introducing quotas, it was claimed today. The US-style diversity system would give guaranteed roles to an agreed number of minority actors, and will reportedly be announced later this month by ITV television director Peter Fincham. It comes after ITV drama director Steve November branded the all-white casts on some of the channel’s most-watched shows including Mr Selfridge and Doc Martin as ‘frankly dull’. All-white: The US-style diversity 'quota' system would see an agreed number of minority actors guaranteed roles. The cast of ITV period drama Mr Selfridge are pictured . No black actors: ITV medical drama Doc Martin, with Men Behaving Badly star Martin Clunes pictured centre . A campaign supported by British ethnic minority stars including David Harewood, Meera Syal and Lenny Henry has called on more to be done to get non-white actors into the TV industry. And an ITV source told the Sunday Mirror: ‘There is going to be a real push here to get more black and Asian people on some of the biggest shows on the channel.’ BBC Director-General Tony Hall said last month that the Corporation would set up a new £2.1million 'diversity creative talent fund' to help 'fast-track' shows by ethnic minority talent onto the screen. He also announced that the BBC would create a series of development programmes aimed at encouraging future commissioners and executives from ethnic minority backgrounds. Changes: A campaign supported by British ethnic minority stars including Lenny Henry (left) and David Harewood (right) has called on more to be done to get non-white actors into the TV industry . Diversity push: Some shows like Downton Abbey have managed to introduce black faces in later series . However, earlier this month British actor Ricky Whittle - a former star of Hollyoaks and contestant on Strictly Come Dancing - said he believes UK television is ahead of the US in terms of diversity. 'There is going to be a real push here to get more black and Asian people on some of the biggest shows on the channel' ITV source . The 32-year-old Manchester-born star is in the cast of hit new US drama The 100 but said he feels ‘typecast’ by the roles he is being offered across the Atlantic since moving to Los Angeles. His comments come in the wake of claims that the reverse is true, with some British black actors saying they were finding more opportunities in the US than at home. Harewood has said in the past how he has struggled to find roles at home despite drawing acclaim and an enhanced public profile for his appearances in US drama Homeland. Changes: The quota will reportedly be announced this month by ITV television director Peter Fincham (pictured) Today, he told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Quota is not an ugly word. We have to look at the concept, look at the American model, see how it worked and encourage - maybe even by law - the employment of a specific number of Bame (black and minority ethnic) actors to start pushing those people through.’ 'Quota is not an ugly word. We have to look at the concept, look at the American model, see how it worked' David Harewood . Last month Henry told MPs that Britain had been ‘haemorrhaging’ talent to the US because of the mistaken belief over in the UK that ethnic minority actors do not have enough star power. The acting chairman of the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - has also recently said that it should do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . Diane Coyle, who is in the running to replace Lord Patten as head of the trust, admitted its flagship soap EastEnders is 'almost twice' as white as the real East London. The ITV press office did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline today.","US-style 'quota' system would give minority actors guaranteed roles .

"By . Mark Duell . This is the moment an 80-year-old grandmother was nearly killed when a shop sign fell 8ft, knocking her unconscious as she strolled down a busy high street. The four-stone (25kg) sign broke free from the fascia of a Mountain Warehouse store in Falmouth, Cornwall, and landed on Patricia Tutton - who suffered a fractured cheekbone and spinal damage. Three years on the company that fitted the heavy sign - New Life Signs Installations, of Swindon, Wiltshire - has only been given a police caution for its sloppy work that led to Mrs Tutton’s injuries. Scroll down for video . Could have killed her: CCTV still capturing Patricia Tutton (green coat) who was injured by a falling sign (top left) Begins to fall: The 4st sign broke free from the fascia of a Mountain Warehouse store in Falmouth, Cornwall . She said her wounds wrecked her quality of life, leaving her unable to drive and barely able to dress herself. She added that doctors told her if the sign had fallen on a child it would have killed them. Mrs Tutton said: ‘I can only remember walking down Market Street and the next thing I knew I was in hospital. I don’t remember anything else. ‘My face was black and blue, I had four fractures around my right eye, a cut on my eye and my head and quite a dent on my head. My spine has got a kink in it.’ Cornwall Council found that New Life Signs Installations had not fulfilled its basic duty of care to the public, with investigators discovering that the sign had been poorly fitted. They also found the fixings used to attach it to the store’s flimsy MDF (medium-density fibreboard) frontage were inadequate. Injuries: The pensioner said that doctors told her if the sign had fallen on a child it would have killed them . Coming to her aid: She said her wounds wrecked her quality of life, leaving her unable to drive .

Outdoor clothing chain Mountain Warehouse was not implicated in the accident on November 29, 2011, which saw the sign fall on her head. It left Mrs Tutton unable to do her activities such as bowls, gardening and ballroom dancing. She said: ‘I was very fit and active. I used to be a busy and active person, which has changed dramatically. I feel like a different woman. ‘My life has come to a complete . standstill. I feel lucky to be alive. I’ve still got my family around . and I can still see my grandchildren.’ Lee McDowell, senior environmental health . officer at Cornwall Council, said: ‘I was shocked at how poorly the . sign was fitted, and it was only luck that prevented it from killing . someone. ‘You didn’t need to be an experienced . sign fitter to realise screwing a heavy sign to a thin fascia board made . up of predominantly MDF was not going to stay in place for long and . would present a danger to passers-by.’ After the accident: It left Mrs Tutton (pictured) unable to do her activities such as bowls and gardening .

"By . Mark Duell . Twin brothers who carried out a £1.6million property scam after promising people foreign properties that did not exist have been jailed for more than four years. Paul and Peter Aspden were co-directors of a firm called Independent Property Consultants (IPC) based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, which sold overseas developments to investors. But the 54-year-old brothers have now been imprisoned, after a court heard they brazenly offered properties in Bulgarian developments and took more than £620,000 from clients. Scam: Paul (left) and Peter Aspden (right), 54, were co-directors of a firm called Independent Property Consultants (IPC) based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, which sold overseas developments to investors . An Insolvency Service investigation - launched after complaints from clients - discovered those homes never materialised. Clients had also handed over £1million for apartments in the Sal Vista resort development in Cape Verde which they never got their hands on. Andrew Haslam, prosecuting, told the court that the charges dated between September 2004 and May 2008. He said: ‘Some people were looking to invest money and rent out the property while others wanted to fulfil their dream of owning a home abroad. ‘Some invested their life savings and others remortgaged their family home. Paul deceived customers and provided them with wholly false statements on the progress of the build and went on to ask for further money.’ Leeds Crown Court heard that when investors approached Paul Aspden - who held a 75 per cent share of the company - to ask why their properties had not been completed, they were met with excuses regarding the standard of the building work not being satisfactory. Homes never materialised: A court heard the brothers brazenly offered properties in Bulgarian developments and took more than £620,000 from clients. The Princess apartments in Bulgaria are pictured . In the Cape Verde development, investors were led to believe that IPC owned the land where the development was to be built - and that their money would be used to fund the development. 'The investors paid over large amounts of money and got nothing in return. All the money paid by investors was spent on buying the land' Andrew Haslam, prosecuting . Mr Haslam said: ‘Both defendants mislead customers as to the true position of the ownership of the land. The reality of the situation was that their money went to buy the land on which their property was to be built. ‘The investors paid over large amounts of money and got nothing in return. All the money paid by investors was spent on buying the land. Yet again Paul Aspden made wholly false and misrepresentations.’ The court heard that many victims suffered a devastating financial loss from their investment and many of them are suffering from personal health problems as a result. In a summary of seven investor statements, Mr Haslam told the court that one victim who lost £78,500 is suffering from ill health and depression - and has debts that he is unable to pay. Development: An Insolvency Service investigation - launched after complaints from clients - discovered the homes never materialised. Pictured is the site for the Tordoroff Apartments in Bansko, Bulgaria . One 67-year-old victim remortgaged her home and was left with huge amounts of debt, while another victim is now suffering from anxiety. The court also heard that one victim had to tell her sister that both of them had lost all of their inheritance money left to them by their mother. 'Your recklessness was at the extreme end of the scale. You showed calculated and persistent dishonesty over an extended period' Recorder Robin Mairs . The fraud involved 72 victims who lost approximately £1.6million. Sentencing Paul Aspden yesterday, Recorder Robin Mairs said: ‘Your recklessness was at the extreme end of the scale. You showed calculated and persistent dishonesty over an extended period.’ Paul Aspden, of Lytham, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading in Bulgaria and offered an alternative plea of making a false and misleading statement as to services, contrary to section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in respect of investments in Cape Verde, which was accepted. Peter Aspden, of Cape Verde but originally from Lancashire, offered a plea of making a false and misleading statement as to services, contrary to section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in respect of Cape Verde only. This was also accepted. The fraudulent trading offence in respect of Bulgaria was ordered to lie on file. Mugshots: Paul Aspden (left) was sentenced to 42 months in prison and Peter Aspden (right) for 10 months . Paul Aspden was sentenced to 42 months in prison and Peter Aspden was jailed for 10 months. After the case, Detective Inspector Ian Wills of North Yorkshire Police said: ‘Complainants started to come to North Yorkshire Police back in 2009. They were complaining that they had invested through IPC in property in Bulgaria and Cape Verde and retrieved nothing for their investments. 'A huge number of people have nothing to show for their investment. It's caused financial ruin' Detective Inspector Ian Wills, North Yorkshire Police . ‘The investigation kicked off in 2009 and we’ve had the job of unravelling exactly what was going on and where clients’ money was going to and that investigation has taken several years to complete. ‘The way the contracts were structured with IPC was at various points during the build customers were required to pay the next instalment.  A huge number of people have nothing to show for their investment. ‘It’s caused financial ruin and a lot of investors are suffering significant health problems and in some cases it’s caused financial ruin to people whose dreams have been completely shattered by the actions of these two who have lost everything. ‘People aged in their late 60s re-mortgaged their homes and are having to continue working to pay off mortgages they otherwise wouldn’t have had.’","Paul and Peter Aspden were co-directors of a company in Scarborough .

"By . Mark Duell . and Jo Knowsley . Teachers at a Muslim faith primary have allegedly referred to clapping hands as ‘Satanic’ - and had discussions about whether music in school might be un-Islamic. Footage was obtained for a Channel 4 documentary at The Olive School - a Muslim faith primary for 600 pupils in Blackburn, run by the Tauheedul Islam Faith, Education and Community Trust. It is also claimed that footage shows staff talking about how ties could be turned into snakes and that gay people should be stoned to death. The Trust has labelled the discussions as ‘staff room gossip’. Investigation: Footage was obtained for a Channel 4 documentary at The Olive School - a Muslim faith primary for 600 pupils in Blackburn, run by the Tauheedul Islam Faith, Education and Community Trust (pictured) Channel 4 did not say what footage from the school would be aired. Officials at the Trust contacted the Department for Education after learning of the allegations, reported the Blackburn Citizen. The Trust invited inspectors to visit the school, and the DfE ordered an emergency ‘no notice’ Ofsted inspection last week. The Trust later insisted that this inspection went ‘very well’. The Trust also confirmed that Dispatches had filmed undercover at the school and promised to act if anything on the film ‘is shown to undermine our progressive vision, ethos and approach’. A Tauheedul governor said: ‘The Trust’s schools provide a first class education for young people in modern-day Britain… We need to look at what these schools have achieved for their pupils.’ Blackburn MP Jack Straw said:  ‘I reserve final judgment until I see the programme. From what I know the allegations are groundless.’ He told the Blackburn Citizen: ‘I am sure Channel Four has recordings of what has been said. This appears to be what individuals have expressed in the course of conversations in the staffroom.’ Meanwhile, a Muslim father has revealed he warned the Prime Minister’s office of worrying Islamist practices at one of the scandal-hit ‘Trojan Horse’ schools – but got no reply. Mohammed Zabar's daughter attends Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, one of the schools investigated in the Trojan Horse plot . The Mail on Sunday has learned that David Cameron’s office received an email in February from Mohammed Zabar, whose ten-year-old daughter attends Oldknow Academy. Oldknow is one of the schools investigated in connection with an alleged fundamentalist plot to take over Birmingham schools. Mr Zabar warned the Government that he believed the school over-emphasised Islamic teaching at the expense of other faiths. He said the school closed for a Muslim festival but had no Christmas celebrations. Downing Street did not respond to Mr Zabar’s email. Instead he was advised by the Education Funding Agency to ‘contact Oldknow Academy directly and make a complaint’. Mr Zabar had already met the school principal, whom he says did not deal with his concerns. News of the Trojan Horse plot broke in March and Mr Cameron spoke about it for the first time in April after claims that non-Muslim members of staff were being isolated, male and female pupils were segregated and assemblies were used to promote the teachings of Al Qaeda. The Prime Minister promised to take ‘swift action’ to ensure schools could not be used to spread the ideology of terrorists, and an investigation into schools in Birmingham started. One report later uncovered allegations that pupils as young as six at Oldknow were taught to treat Western women as ‘white prostitutes’. And there were claims that extremists pushed out the head teacher because she opposed the ‘Islamisation’ of the school. Mr Zabar believes the Government should have acted on his guidance much earlier. He said: ‘I was angry and frustrated that my concerns had been so easily dismissed. ‘When the Trojan Horse scandal broke I wrote to them again saying perhaps they might want to reassess my information in light of recent evidence. I never had a reply to that one. It was distressing and disappointing to have my concerns ignored.’ Peter Clarke, former national head of counter-terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, was appointed in April to investigate the Trojan Horse plot to hijack the schools by Islamic extremists. His report is due to be handed in to the Government imminently. Last night shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt accused Mr Cameron of ‘shocking complacency’. He said: ‘The Government was warned about the problems in Birmingham’s schools as long ago as 2010. Now it is revealed that warnings by parents were being fobbed off by No 10.’ A DfE spokesman said: ‘We were already investigating Oldknow by the time this letter [Mr Zabar’s] was sent. The email alert about Oldknow is also revealed in the Dispatches documentary Faith Schools Undercover: No Clapping In Class, to be screened tomorrow night.","Teachers at school 'had discussions about whether music is un-Islamic'

"By . Mark Duell . A couple went away on holiday and left their four dogs so desperate for food that one had half its face eaten by another, a court has heard. Martin and Rebecca Clifton forced the four pets to live in their own faeces in New Houghton, Derbyshire, as they enjoyed a seaside break. But following an anonymous call, RSPCA inspectors were called to the house where the walls were caked in blood and mud and a dead Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found to have had its face mauled. Cruelty: Emaciated Rottweiler Rox (pictured) was left locked in a small metal cage and all the animals were severely malnourished, with cuts and bite marks to their faces . An emaciated Rottweiler was left locked in a small metal cage and all the animals were severely malnourished, with cuts and bite marks to their faces, Mansfield Magistrates’ Court was told. David Payne, prosecuting, said the dead dog, called Braken, was pregnant and had been killed fighting with the other two Staffies - Tyke and Dude - that had been left free in the house. Braken had then been eaten by the Rottweiler, called Rox, out of desperation. He said: ‘When the RSPCA entered the property the walls were splattered with blood and faeces and the base of the crate was also covered in faeces. ‘The Rottweiler was pulling at the head of the dog and eating it. Dogs will resort to cannibalism if they are extremely hungry and this shows that they were not getting enough food. ‘The owners caused the dogs to suffer by keeping them in confined spaces and by preventing them from demonstrating normal canine behaviour.’ Mr Payne added that when the surviving dogs were taken into care in October last year, the Rottweiler was less than half its normal weight and the two Staffies were also severely malnourished. Avoided jail: Martin and Rebecca Clifton forced the four pets to live in their own faeces in New Houghton, Derbyshire, as they enjoyed a seaside break in Skegness, Lincolnshire . The RSPCA brought a private prosecution against the couple, who admitted cruelty. Mr Payne said the couple had been away in Skegness, Lincolnshire, for a few days when the dogs were found. It was heard that a neighbour had been coming in to look after the dogs, but she had been interviewed by police and not prosecuted. 'When the RSPCA entered the property the walls were splattered with blood and faeces and the base of the crate was also covered in faeces' David Payne, prosecuting . Mr Payne said that the condition of the dogs had been caused by weeks of neglect, rather than just the few days the owners had been on holiday. A post-mortem on the dead dog confirmed that found she had been pregnant at the time of her death. The court was told that during an interview with police, Mr Clifton said he had fed the dogs dried food twice a day, and had sought advice on the Rottweiler because she was still thin. Defending the couple, Sarah Neale, said both had held down responsible jobs - him working as an assistant manager at a recycling centre, and her as a support worker for vulnerable adults. Pets: The dead dog, called Braken, was pregnant and had been killed fighting with the other two Staffies - Tyke (pictured) and Dude - that had been left free in the house . Both admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, each failing to address the cause of the dogs being underweight, and confining them to an unsuitable environment. 'The Rottweiler was pulling at the head of the dog and eating it. Dogs will resort to cannibalism if they are extremely hungry and this shows that they were not getting enough food' David Payne, prosecuting . Ms Neale added that the Cliftons had two autistic sons who would not cope if they were sent to prison. The husband and wife walked free from court after they were both sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 18 months. They were also banned from keeping dogs for seven years and ordered to pay £2,000 towards prosecution costs. Speaking after the sentencing, RSPCA investigator Mick Darling said: ‘I think the sentence reflects the severity of the offences. ‘It was a really difficult case but it sends a clear message to people to take care of their animals and to ensure that their needs are met.’","Martin and Rebecca Clifton forced four pets to live in their own faeces .

"By . Mark Duell . A British Army sniper was fatally shot by a US fighter jet in Afghanistan after a mistake by the pilot meant he attacked the wrong site, an inquest heard today. Forces on the ground had called in air support after being attacked by insurgents in Helmand province. However, as well as having difficulty identifying landmarks when speaking to ground troops, the F18 pilot failed to enter coordinates for the strike. Fatally shot: New Zealand born Private John Howard, 23, was hit as he took cover in a ditch and died instantly . As the pilot swooped to attack, Private John Howard, 23, was hit as he took cover in a ditch and died instantly, the inquest in Salisbury, Wiltshire, was told. New Zealand-born Private Howard, known as Jack, was serving with 16 Air Assault Brigade’s Reconnaissance Force when he was killed. The force had been sent to the Nad-e Ali district of Afghanistan to target ‘compounds of interest’ which could be linked to insurgent activity. But on the day of the soldier’s death the weather deteriorated and three groups were sent from their base to hold a reassurance meeting with local elders, rather than carry out manoeuvres. As this took place at around 12pm on December 5, 2010, one of the platoons came under fire and attempts were made to perform a pincer movement and repel the attackers. Major Frank Reeves told the inquest: ‘Two platoon couldn’t move from their position because they were pinned down and we were trying to do a manoeuvre to relieve some of that.’ As the battle continued, the insurgents . were forced back to an area identified as compound 15, about 100 metres . (328ft) from another building where the British forces had made their . way to. Background: The force had been despatched to the Nad-e Ali district of Afghanistan to target 'compounds of interest' which could be linked to insurgent activity. A file photo of Royal Marines in the area is pictured . They received intelligence from an unmanned aircraft that insurgents were in compound 15 and agreed to call in air support. Major Reeves said: ‘A strafing run was suggested and I was immediately very happy with that.’ An American F18 which had been circling the area was called in to carry out the attack, but a fault meant the pilot could not share his map with the ground commander, making it harder to be sure they were looking at the same point. Commander Paul Tremelling told the inquest this would not necessarily have been a problem had the pilot and ground commander established clear markers on the ground so they both knew what they were talking about, which they did not. However Commander Tremelling said the biggest mistake was the pilot’s failure to enter coordinates for the attack into his onboard computer. ‘You would always, always, always put that grid into the machine,’ he said, adding that he may not have done so because he thought his targeting pod was faulty. ‘In that situation what he should have done, had he thought there was an error in the equipment, it should have been the first thing he mentioned,’ said Commander Tremelling. Commander Tremelling said it was not clear why the pilot did not realise friendly troops were within a danger zone of 60 metres from the intended target, as he should have seen them as he approached. Plane: As well as having difficulty identifying landmarks when speaking to ground troops, the F18 pilot failed to enter coordinates for the strike. A file photo of an F18 aircraft is pictured . He said: ‘I don’t know why he didn’t say ""by my reckoning friendlies are 40 metres away"".’ Commander Tremelling said the pilot appeared to think the British troops were in a completely different compound because he and the ground commander were not talking about the same site. He said: ‘They have formed a mistaken belief that they’re both looking at the same battle.’ On the ground, the troops took cover, with Private Howard and a few others in a ditch near the compound that the rest of the group were in. Major Reeves said: ‘We were quite buoyed . because we knew we were taking it to the enemy at this stage. We were . almost looking forward to getting amongst it.’ 'They have formed a mistaken belief that they’re both looking at the same battle' Commander Paul Tremelling . At that point the jet fired 205 rounds into the area, hitting the compound the British troops were in and the ditch. Major Reeves said there was a lot of confusion, dust and burning as they took in the situation. Outside, Lance Corporal James Appelt, a trained medic, was in the ditch with Private Howard. He said it was clear that the sniper died instantly. ‘I was desperate to do something but I knew I could not do anything for him,’ Lance Corporal Appelt said in evidence. In the air, the pilot, who was described as ‘very experienced’, realised a horrible mistake had been made. Commander Tremelling said at this point the pilot entered the coordinates and the targeting device instantly focused on the compound where the insurgents were thought to be. There was no further fighting and Private Howard’s body was removed from the scene, with two other injured troops also evacuated. Coroner David Ridley recorded a narrative verdict into the death of Private Howard. Mr Ridley said although the sharpshooter died as a result of being shot by the jet, communications issues contributed to his death. The coroner described how the pilot indicated that he had identified insurgent forces in one of the compounds. 'We thought it was a very thorough investigation and it certainly answered all our questions and we are grateful that the coroner devoted time to getting to the bottom of what happened' Roger Howard, father of Private John Howard . Mr Ridley said: ‘Unbeknown to the pilot and those on the ground, the pilot had identified compound A [where British troops were]. ‘The aircraft attacked at 13.41. However the compound under attack was not compound 15 but was the unmarked compound A. ‘Jack, who had been laying in the ditch just short of the compound along with his comrades, was struck and Jack was instantly killed by one of the rounds.’ Private Howard, who had been deployed in Helmand since September 2010, was officially declared dead at the field hospital at Camp Bastion at 2.57pm. Mr Ridley said: ‘Whilst the cause of Jack's death was the 20mm round fired from the attacking jet plane, communication issues between the forward air controller and pilot directly contributed to the incident.’ The coroner said these included the pilot failing to put attack coordinates into the on-board computer, the lack of video downlink allowing the controller to see what the pilot was looking at and the failure to agree common correlation points so they knew they were talking about the same thing. Mr Ridley offered his condolences to the soldier's family. Speaking after the inquest, Private Howard's father, Roger, said: ‘We thought it was a very thorough investigation and it certainly answered all our questions and we are grateful that the coroner devoted time to getting to the bottom of what happened.’","Forces on ground called in air support after being attacked by insurgents .

"By . Mark Duell . A gang of rogue traders fleeced elderly people out of more than £1million by overcharging them for shoddy building work. Among their victims was widow Grace Gibbs, 87, who had bladder cancer and lost at least £123,000 as a result of unnecessary and often-duplicated work on her home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. Investigators managed to record a conversation between gang members - who picked vulnerable targets and checked bank statements to assess their assets - in which they celebrated her death. Accused: Van Purdy, 60, (left) and Anthony Symes, 59, (right) outside Chelmsford Crown Court today. They are two of the six men who traded as East Coast Builders, Complete Building Services and AJ Builders . Arrested: Investigators managed to record a conversation between gang members - who picked vulnerable targets and checked bank statements to assess their assets - in which they celebrated one victim's death . Taken away: Police and trading standards officers found 18 victims but say up to 120 more were never identified . Police and trading standards officers found 18 victims but say up to 120 more were never identified. The gang went back time and time again over four years, demanded more cash and ‘mined’ their accounts, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Led by ringleader James Brown Snr, they pressurised them into handing over life savings and discouraged them from talking to concerned relatives and neighbours. Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said: ‘James Brown Snr, William Brown, James Brown Jnr and Anthony Symes appeared to be celebrating the death of Mrs Gibbs. ‘She was the person they were . concerned had sufficient evidence to convict them. Anthony Symes . referred to a previous acquittal due to the unavailability of an elderly . witness. ‘The reality was she had given them so much money she couldn’t meet her standing orders for basic needs.’ Victim: Andrew Millar, 86, registered blind, fears the gang conned him out of £300,000 for building work, dodgy investments and loans  to pay for James Brown Snr's mortgage . Investigation: The gang went back time and time again over four years, demanded more cash and 'mined' their victims' accounts, a court heard . Probe: The gang members were arrested after an investigation between Essex Police and Essex Trading Standards in July last year . Nasty work: The gang pressurised victims into handing over life savings and discouraged them from talking to concerned relatives and neighbours . Some . of the victims and their families listened to the evidence in the court . room yesterday. One left sobbing as a transcript of the conversation . was read out. A convicted killer is among the defendants. Peter Biddle was jailed for killing his wife in 1988. He was also subject to a suspended sentence for rogue trading at Maidstone Crown Court three years ago. James Brown has 19 offences on his record, including 16 for fraud, and was also subjected to a suspended sentence for rogue trading. William Brown has 38 offences on record and Van Purdy has 25. James Brown Jnr and Anthony Symes were of previous good character. Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said: ‘These defendants operated as builders who cold-called vulnerable elderly people and persuaded them to part with substantial sums of money for unnecessary building works or, where the work was justified, demanded extortionate sums of money. ‘Often the work was of poor quality. These cannot be the only victims of this gang and a conservative estimate is that they obtained at least £1 million.’ The gang members were arrested after an investigation between Essex Police and Essex Trading Standards in July last year. Six men, who traded as East Coast Builders, Complete Building Services and AJ Builders, have admitted various charges linked to the fraud and appeared in court yesterday. They are William Brown, 49, of Colchester; James Brown Jnr, 21, of Tiptree; Peter Biddle, 66, of Ardleigh; Van Purdy, 60, also of Ardleigh; James Brown Snr, 45, of Colchester; and Anthony Symes, 59, of Weeley Heath. Judge John Dodds said: ‘It seems that once they got their claws into their victims, they would not let go.’  He will continue to hear the evidence and mitigation today before sentencing the gang tomorrow. Helen Reeve Smith, who suffered from dementia and died last year aged 93, was invoiced for work totalling £30,000 and handed over £10,000. James Brown Jnr, who one victim called ‘Smarmy Jim’, and fellow gang member William Brown were caught on CCTV in a bank with Mrs Reeve Smith as she withdrew money days before being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Christopher Ramsay, 58, who lived alone and was described as vulnerable, was initially quoted £650 for some bathroom tiling, which was carried out to a poor standard. He eventually handed over about £15,000, much of which was withdrawn after James Brown Snr drove him to cash points. Kenneth Petford was ‘groomed’ into handing over £81,000 - his entire life savings - after one gang member offered to powerwash his patio before convincing him further work was needed. Andrew Millar, 86, registered blind, fears the gang conned him out of £300,000 for building work, dodgy investments and loans to pay for James Brown Snr’s mortgage. James Brown Snr, who had known Mr Millar for 25 years, paid for a coy carp pond on one occasion, but ended up with a hole in the ground. Prosecutor Andrew Shaw said: ‘Just a few days before the police interview he thought James Brown Snr was the victim of a witch hunt by trading standards.’ The court heard transfers had been made from Mr Millar to the company New Horizons, which James Brown Snr was the registered owner, referenced ‘Dad’ or ‘love Dad’ but Mr Millar said he cannot know what he was signing.","Picked vulnerable targets and checked bank statements to assess assets .

"By . Mark Duell . Living in a tiny converted yellow water tank on Britain's loneliest outpost, this married father has certainly found himself a location away from the crowds for a two-month summer holiday. Nick Hancock, 39, of Ratho, Edinburgh, is living in the ‘RockPod’ for 60 days on Rockall - an eroded volcano which lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, and is just 100ft wide and 70ft high. But the chartered surveyor is enduring 30mph winds as his quest continues to raise money for Help for Heroes, and he is learning to play the harmonica to pass time as he makes it 27 days there today. Charity adventure: Nick Hancock, 39, of Ratho, Edinburgh, is living in the 'RockPod' for 60 days on Rockall . Remote: The eroded volcano lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides, and is just 100ft wide and 70ft high . Mr Hancock said: ‘I retreated to the RockPod and the wind continued to build through the day until it was up past 30mph by evening. It's just not sensible to be out and about in those conditions. ‘[That is] even with a harness and life line, especially when the rock is wet and slippery, so I was pod-bound for the rest of the morning and all of the rest of the day. ‘This meant more reading: I finished Jay-Z's 'Decoded' and started Steven (Aerosmith) Tyler's autobiography, before completing some more harmonica lessons. ‘The basic tunes I'm on at the moment sound to me like they're supposed to, and there's some basic technique work at this stage too, which seems to be going well.’ Mr Hancock also recorded an interview for NBC via Skype with fellow adventurer Ben Fogle, who shot to fame living on Taransay in the Outer Hebrides for a year during BBC series Castaway in 2000. Pulling up the pod: Mr Hancock hopes to spend 60 days on the rock after landing on it last month on June 5 . Current home: The father - who has a son Freddie, two, with his wife Pamela, 41 - has taken all food and water with him and plans to live in his shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record . Mr Hancock hopes to spend 60 days on the rock after landing on it on June 5. Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11ft by 4ft. FOOD AND DRINK: He is eating army-type rations, split into 24-hour ration . packs, which are spread over two days. Each pack has 4,500 calories – with the . average man for a normal day needing about 2,000. Drinks are a combination of straight water, tea, coffee, hot . chocolate, and isotonic powder in water - all of which come in the ration packs. He is boiling water and heating the rations on a gas-fired . camping stove, but says that he misses pizza. The father - who has a son Freddie, two, with his wife Pamela, 41 - has taken all food and water with him and plans to live in his shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record. Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of more than 95ft were recorded there in 2000 - higher than Rockall itself. Being in such an isolated location, less than 100 people have landed on it - and only five have spent a night, including Mr Hancock. The first long record for time spent on Rockall was 40 days in 1985. That expedition saw former SAS soldier Tom McClean live on the rock from 26 May to 4 July - to affirm Britain's claim to the islet, which has been disputed by Ireland, Iceland and Denmark. His occupation record was broken in . 1997 by three Greenpeace activists who stayed there for 42 days in . protest at North Atlantic oil exploration. Those countries who lay claim to Rockall have one eye on the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it. West of the Outer Hebrides: Being in such an isolated location, less than 100 people have landed on Rockall . Plan: He hopes to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history . Difficult conditions: Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95ft were recorded there in 2000 - higher than Rockall itself . In 1997, Britain accepted Rockall was a . rock, with no impact on the UK's maritime territory. The current dispute . is over the wider Rockall-Hatton basin. 'I've already had winds in excess of 30mph, but only for short periods, so this promises to be the worst weather I've experienced yet' Nick Hancock . Ownership is being examined by the United Nations in the light of the competing claims. Mr Hancock hopes to set both the longest solo occupation of Rockall and the longest occupation in its history. But he faces his roughest week yet. He said: ‘From Tuesday there are forecast winds in excess of 30mph, gusting up to 50mph, with rain, and remaining that way for several days. ‘I've already had winds in excess of 30mph, but only for short periods, so this promises to be the worst weather I've experienced yet.’","Nick Hancock, 39, has done 27 days of his 60-day target in the 'RockPod'

"By . Mark Duell . A mother and daughter locked in a bitter £150,000 court battle over the family estate agency have had their claims thrown out by a judge. Nicola Low, 71, of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, had been sued by Caroline Baines, 40, who claimed her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave. A stream of angry letters then culminated in Mrs Low making a complaint to police and the arrest of her daughter’s innocent business partner, who was held in a police cell for five hours. Family feud: Nicola Low (left), 71, of Knebworth, Hertfordshire, had been sued by Caroline Baines (right), 40, who claimed her mother reduced her salary while she was on maternity leave . In a counter-claim, Mrs Low, a postmistress and boss of Halcyon House lettings agency, sued her daughter for £100,000 for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients. Mrs Baines, who now runs Mint Lettings and Management, and her business partner Susan Mogridge, accused Mrs Low of harassment and asked for £50,000 damages. Last Friday - after an 11-day High Court hearing - Judge Richard Seymour QC lamented the ‘most unhappy family discord’ and dismissed both mother and daughter’s claims. Criticising Mrs Low’s behaviour in making a ‘malicious’ complaint to police, the judge said there was ‘no obvious reason’ for taking legal action against her daughter ‘other than spite’ After relations between the two women fell down in 2010 and their business relationship parted, Mrs Low contacted Hertfordshire Constabulary to accuse Mrs Mogridge of thieving. The judge said: ‘The contents of the police statement strike me as outrageous. It contained a number of bare-faced lies. Office: Mrs Low, a postmistress and boss of Halcyon House lettings agency (pictured) in Knebworth, Hertfordshire, sued her daughter for £100,000 for setting up a new agency and allegedly stealing her clients . ‘Mrs Low was setting out not merely to be mischievious, but malicious, in making complaints to the police which she must have know were totally without any justification. ‘It reflects further discredit upon her that she was also fairly obviously seeking to implicate her daughter in the allegations of theft against Mrs Mogridge. The whole strategy was extremely nasty. 'The decision of Hertfordshire police even to investigate the complaints of Mrs Low, still less to arrest Mrs Mogridge, was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned' Judge Richard Seymour QC . ‘It is obvious that, by making her complaint to the police, Mrs Low was setting out to cause trouble for Mrs Mogridge and also, if possible, for Mrs Baines.’ And criticising the local force, the judge added: ‘The decision of Hertfordshire police even to investigate the complaints of Mrs Low, still less to arrest Mrs Mogridge, was not a tribute to the intelligence of the officers concerned. ‘Mrs Mogridge was detained for some five hours after her arrest before being released on bail.’ In February 2010, Mrs Low told Mrs Baines that she would receive only her statutory minimum maternity pay just a few days after the caesarean delivery of her grandson, Henry. That was a ‘dramatic reduction’ in Mrs . Baines’ usual salary, said the judge. The younger woman was furious and . the incident was a crucial factor in her decision to set up Mint . Lettings in direct rivalry to her mother. Thrown out: After an 11-day hearing at London's High Court (pictured) - Judge Richard Seymour QC lamented the 'most unhappy family discord' and dismissed both mother and daughter's claims . The court heard Mrs Baines had been managing director of Halcyon House, owning 45 per cent of the shares, and her mother, who founded the business, had always intended that her daughter should eventually take full control. However, James Purnell, for Mrs Baines, said that, by the time she gave birth to Henry, her mother had ‘wanted to take her out of the equation’. 'Mrs Low was setting out not merely to be mischievious, but malicious, in making complaints to the police which she must have know were totally without any justification' Judge Richard Seymour QC . Mrs Low accused her daughter of making use of confidential company information to ‘pinch’ many of her best clients, but the judge ruled that Mrs Baines had in no way breached her employment contract or duties as a director. Also dismissing Mrs Baines’s harassment claim, the judge said some of her accusations against her mother were ‘frankly ludicrous’. ‘Irritating, annoying, unattractive or unreasonable’ behaviour could not, by itself, amount to harassment, nor could the ‘manoeuvring for commercial advantage’ that would be expected in the estate agency industry, the judge said. He said he was ‘entirely satisfied’ that Mrs Low’s complaint to the police against Mrs Mogridge, who formerly worked for Halcyon House, was ‘malicious’ and made ‘with a view to causing alarm, distress and anxiety’. But that single incident, he ruled, was not a ‘course of conduct’ that could be called harassment.","Nicola Low, 71, of Hertfordshire, sued by daughter Caroline Baines, 40 .

"By . Mark Duell . Undertaker: Michael O'Brien, 59, is pictured arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester . An undertaker was behind bars in disgrace today for swindling thousands of pounds out of the elderly as they planned their own funerals. Michael O'Brien, 59, mis-sold several funeral plans during his five years of scams and even pocketed cash donations left in envelopes by grieving well-wishers intended for charities. O’Brien - who also stole £1,000 which a grieving family had paid out for a headstone - was arrested after various complaints over his shady practises at his family firm Murray’s Funeral Services in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester. Police raided the funeral parlour last October to find a large haul of cheques dating back to 2005 which well-wishers had asked to be forwarded into charities including Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation. Cash donations were never received by the intended recipients. Human ashes were also seized by police and handed to council officials who stored them at a nearby crematorium. Inquiries revealed O’Brien, who owned a number of funeral homes over the last 30 years, carried out the frauds after his business which was previously run by his father ran into difficulty. At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, he hung his head in shame as he was jailed for eight months after admitting three charges of fraud and nine offences under consumer protection regulations. Judge Andrew Lowcock told O’Brien: ‘It’s very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court. You had, prior to these events, led a blameless life. Yet you conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour.’ Earlier the court heard how O’Brien’s firm was already sliding into bankruptcy when he targeted elderly people who did not want to burden surviving relatives with their funeral costs. Four victims including an elderly couple aged 86 and 92 agreed to pay between £2,300 to £3,000 each for funeral plans not realising they were worthless as they were not backed by any insurance. They were also unaware O’Brien was not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority due to his financial difficulties. Intended recipient: Between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received . It meant families didn’t realise they would lose their money once O’Brien’s business went bankrupt in January 2013, meaning no funds were available for customers seeking refunds. One widower who took out a £3,019 plan with O’Brien after his wife died, tried to get a refund after getting a deal with Age UK - only to get nothing. Another family paid out almost £5,000 to O’Brien including £1,080 for a headstone in memory of a retired builder who died aged 64 of cancer. The funeral went ahead but no headstone materialised. O’Brien was called in by police for interview but said he could not attend because he was in hospital. Failure to attend another interview forced officers to contact the hospital to find out he was not currently a patient there and he was arrested at home where officers found paperwork relating to the charity donations. During inquiries police discovered between June 2010 and February 2013 O’Brien had received donations totalling £945 intended for Macmillan Cancer Support. In February 2011 he had received £190 worth of donations for Tameside General Hospital in memory of a local lady who died. And between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received. Prosecutor Miss Leila Ghahhary said: ‘These persons were vulnerable, through age, infirmity or bereavement. In addition the victims have suffered stress and anxiety. ‘In selling the funeral plans, the defendant falsely advised them that there would be insurance to back them up. In fact none of the plans had security and were effectively worthless. Kept the money: In February 2011 he had received £190 worth of donations for Tameside General Hospital (pictured) in memory of a local lady who died . ‘He took money from plans when he knew his business was in difficulty and been made bankrupt. In 2005 his father and business partner had died and the defendant ran into financial difficulty. ‘In 2011 he had difficulties with various loans and credit cards. Since the death of his father he was incapable of keeping up the finances, robbing Peter to pay Paul and to meet his financial commitments.’ The court heard the cost of the frauds totalled £13,234 with the total sum of mis-sold funeral plans - £10,219, the cost of the head stone £1,080 and the total known sum of charity donations - £1,935 of which £530 was cash. 'You conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour' Judge Andrew Lowcock . The court heard O’Brien always provided a funeral but the money he received for the plans went into propping up his business and not into the holding accounts of customers. In mitigation for O’Brien, defence Simeon Evans said: ‘He has never been in trouble previously and was considered a pillar of the community - both him and his father before him. He provided funerals as affordable as possible. ‘He would have done everything in his power to provide funerals for the people in this case. ‘He had always intended to pay these cash sums across to the various charities. He instead used them to pay for the day to day running, for the funerals he was contracted for. ‘His financial situation has been disastrous for many years. He would say he is a very good undertaker and a very bad business man.’ But after the case Fiona Smith, 39, who was never provided with a headstone for her late father Francis Hancock, 64, said: ‘We trusted him completely. Seeing this man jailed is justice for my dad. It was his money. He would have been fuming.’ Ian Saxon, Tameside Council’s assistant executive director of environmental services, said ‘Mr O’Brien caused a great deal of misery and heartache for a number of individuals and families who have suffered financial loss as result of his fraudulent actions.’","Michael O'Brien mis-sold several funeral plans during five years of scams .

"By . Mark Duell . Painful: Megan Billingsley, 13, had an allergic reaction due to her eyebrows being waxed . A 13-year-old girl fears she will be left scarred for life after her eyebrows were burned off when she suffered an allergic reaction during a botched beauty treatment. Megan Billingsley had been taken to a salon in Selly Oak, Birmingham, as a treat to get her eyebrows waxed before a family holiday. But she was left in tears and needing medical attention when she suffered an allergic reaction when she was given tinting dye on June 18 which caused her eyebrows to 'melt'. Megan said: ‘I just wish I hadn't gone to the salon. I really hope my eyebrows grow back normally but I might have to live with this for the rest of my life.’ Her mother Caroline, 31, is now considering suing Hair Heads salon after Megan was told she might be scarred for life. She said: ‘Megan went to the salon to get her eyebrows waxed as she was going on holiday with some of our family. I was down the road at a different salon on a sunbed but she went with a friend of mine who was looking after her. ‘When they were done the friend asked if she fancied getting her eyebrows tinted. They never got a parental consent form signed and never asked my friend to check if this was okay. ‘As soon as I saw her I realised she had had them tinted and we went back and washed out as much of the dye as I could.

Worried: Megan (pictured before the reaction, left; and then after, right) fears she will be left scarred for life . ‘We got as . much out as possible and she flew off to Greece. When . she was there I got a call saying she was in a bad way and they sent me . some pictures and I was horrified. 'Her face was so swollen, she could . barely see out of her left eye and her eyebrows had melted off. My . stepdad who was on holiday with Megan was so worried about her, he hired . a car himself to take her to the hospital. 'I just wish I hadn't gone to the salon. I really hope my eyebrows grow back normally but I might have to live with this for the rest of my life' Megan Billingsley . ‘They gave her some cream, but they told her she couldn't go out in the sun with it because it would react. ‘She had to stay inside for the rest of the holiday. She was crying down the phone to me asking if she could come home, but there was no way. ‘She still hasn't fully recovered and the doctors say she might be scarred for life. We had only just got her over a bullying episode at school and now she's getting picked on again. She doesn't want to go back to school now.’ Location: Hair Heads in Selly Oak, Birmingham, where Megan's eyebrows were waxed earlier this month . Miss Billingsley, a hospital cleaner who has two other children, now has to draw on Megan's eyebrows every morning using a make-up pencil while her eyebrows grow back. 'Megan is normally such a happy, outgoing kid but this has really affected her. She is withdrawn and doesn't want to go out' Caroline Billingsley, mother . She added: ‘Megan is normally such a happy, outgoing kid but this has really affected her. She is withdrawn and doesn't want to go out. ‘Even when her eyebrows do grow back there is no guarantee they will cover the scars. ‘I went to the salon to ask them about it and the woman kicked me out and refused to talk to me. I want Megan's experience to be a warning to other parents.’ The owner of Hair Heads, calling himself Saab, said: 'I have seen the photographs of this girl and I cannot say this did not happen but I will only respond formally to solicitors.

"By . Mark Duell . A dramatic video has revealed how domestic violence rises by more than a third when England are knocked out of the World Cup. The clip, which shows a woman anxiously watching a football match on TV, claims domestic abuse increases 38 per cent when the national side exit the competition. This figure is cited from research by the University of Lancaster which showed the rise in domestic violence in Lancashire when England lost - as well as a 26 percent rise when the team won or drew. Scroll down for video . Campaign: The clip, which shows a woman anxiously watching a football match on TV, claims domestic abuse increases 38 per cent when the national side exit the competition . The 40-second video, which has already been viewed more than 300,000 times on YouTube, includes the strapline: ‘No one wanted England to win more than women.’ A Tender spokesman said: ‘Though research on the rise of domestic violence during the World Cup is relatively new and for lack of a better word, sparse, the trend is alarming and impossible to ignore. ‘The weather is getting warmer, more drinks will be consumed, emotions will be heightened, and none of this excuses violence. We ask that individuals and organisations to stand together this World Cup season and say “No excuses”.’ Tender, a charity based in Belsize Park, north-west London, was set up in 2003 to educate young people through theatre and the arts on preventing violence within relationships. Reaction: The 40-second video, which has already been viewed more than 300,000 times on YouTube, includes the strapline: 'No one wanted England to win more than women' TV remote: Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played . Its video - released last Tuesday - came after England exited the World Cup having lost their first two group games 2-1 against Italy and Uruguay. They drew their last game 0-0 with Costa Rica. 'The weather is getting warmer, more drinks will be consumed, emotions will be heightened, and none of this excuses violence' Tender spokesman . Before the World Cup began two weeks ago, MailOnline reported how police were launching a crackdown on domestic abusers after research showed violence soars after a match. Forces across Britain drafted in extra resources, launched hard-hitting poster campaigns and even paid personal visits to known offenders. In Essex 117 fans, seven of them women, were reportedly handed warnings after officers analysed their history of domestic and footballing crime. Going home: England applaud the supporters at full-time following their last match at this year's World Cup in Brazil, on Tuesday against Costa Rica at Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte . A similar tactic was being employed in Northumbria, where officers warned they would be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a risk. Elsewhere posters in single-sex toilets and on bus stops depict distraught women next to slogans including 'Leave the striking to the players' and 'What time is kick off in your house?' Officers were keen to stress the vast majority of football fans would cause no problems at all. But the move comes after a report found a steep increase in domestic violence during the tournament. Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played. In Surrey the increase was far more dramatic - with a 61 per cent leap in domestic violence reports on the day England drew 0-0 with Algeria in South Africa four years ago.","Video comes days after England were knocked out by Italy and Uruguay .

"By . Mark Duell . Eric Clapton has revealed he is ready to retire from touring after more than 50 years on the road. The 69-year-old British musician said travelling has become ‘unbearable’ and he has concerns about his health, adding that he fears he could end up 'embarrassing' himself. Father-of-four Clapton, who also became a grandfather last year, claimed in addition that he has lost much of his love for touring because most countries are now a ‘different version of America’.

He told Uncut magazine: ‘There are tons of things I’d like to do but I’m looking at retirement too. I’m 70 next year. I think what I’ll allow myself to do, within reason, is carry on recording in the studio. ‘I don’t want to go off the boil to the point where I’m embarrassing myself. The road has become unbearable. It’s unapproachable, because it takes so long to get anywhere - and it’s hostile. ‘Everywhere. Getting in and out of airports, getting on planes, travelling in cars.’ Clapton added that there could soon be a day when he is no longer able to play the guitar, saying: ‘Maybe.

"By . James  Nye . Recovered: Constance Murray (pictured with her husband, Christopher) was found in a park near her Northeast Philadelphia home on Tuesday morning after failing to return from her evening jog . Police confirmed on Wednesday that the 46-year-old married mother-of-two found dead in a Philadelphia cemetery on Tuesday morning was strangled to death. Autopsy results released in the afternoon revealed that Constance Murray was murdered while jogging in Pennypack Park, however she was not sexually assaulted and evidence shows only a minor struggle took place. This indicates an overwhelming and sudden attack after she left her home at 9pm on Monday on her usual jogging route, but nonetheless has left police confused by the bizarre circumstances. Police also revealed that the smartphone and headphones that Murray was wearing when she was attacked have not been recovered. Her husband Christopher and daughters Elizabeth and Emily have not made a statement but Philadelphia homicide Captain James Clark confirmed that police have no current leads in the case. Clark told The Philadelphia Daily News that Murray's husband went out to look for his wife at midnight after she failed to return from her usual jog through the park. When he did not find her on the route or at home he filed a missing-person report with the police at around 2am. Then, at around 6am, a member of the public walking in Pennypack Park found the body of Murray and emergency workers pronounced her dead at the scene. Reporters noted a large gathering of friends and family - including her two young daughters - outside the Murray home on Wednesday and witnessed a series grief-stricken hugs. Scroll Down for Video .

Women out there walking or jogging should have someone else with them for protection, just until we find out what went on,' said Clark to CBS 3. Across Murray's Facebook page her friends wrote messages of sympathy to her family and neighbors said her death is a worrying tragedy. 'It’s really close to home. We are raising our kids here, you know, so it’s just a little bit frightening,' said neighbor Jessica Nigro to CBS 3.

A 13-year-old boy in Florida has died after apparently playing a deadly game of Russian roulette with a 15-year-old friend on Sunday night.

The father of the shooter, Don DeHayes told WTSP that his son accidentally pointed the pistol in her direction and the gun went off. 'We feel terrible about the whole thing,' said Don DeHayes. While police have begun an investigation, neighbors reacted with skepticism about the incident. 'It's very hard to believe it was an accident, especially point blank in the temple, that's hard to understand,' said neighbor Josh Hady. The weapon accidentally fired when it was being admired by the group of friends at around 6.45 pm. Hoover was taken by ambulance to Bayfront Health Brooksville and from there was airlifted to Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point. Gun enthusiast: Katherine Hoover was shot while going through William DeHayes (pictured) gun collection and his father claims the tragedy occurred when he pointed the .22 revolver at her by mistake and it went off .

"By . James  Nye . A Kentucky teenager is recovering from second-degree burns after he set himself alight after copying a dangerous new trend online dubbed the 'Fire Challenge'. The 15-year-old, who declined to be identified for CBS Affiliate WKYT, poured rubbing alcohol over his chest and filmed himself on Friday. Videos of people doing the same have started appearing online and the teen admitted he was not thinking of the consequences when he decided to imitate them. Suitably chastened: The Kentucky teenager, 15, is pictured here with bandages after his lucky escape after setting himself on fire to satisfy his need to copy the 'Fire Challenge' game that is sweeping the Internet . 'I just poured alcohol on it, and lit it, and it just automatically went and burst,' said the teen to WKYT. 'Unbearable, yea, basically,' the teen said about the pain, according to CBS Cleveland. 'Literally after it got put out it was already blistering, it’s just hard.' Firefighters arrived at the home of the boy's aunt and took to hospital for treatment to severe burns on his chest and abdomen. The lucky teenager said that he had no idea of the likely effects because in the videos he had seen, the person who did the 'fire challenge' never kept the camera running long enough afterwards. Response: Lexington, Kentucky firefighters rushed to help the boy who set himself on fire at his aunt's house . Firefighters in Lexington said they hope others listen and don't try to copy the teenager. 'What they don't show at the end of the videos is the consequences of doing this, getting second and third degree burns,' Lexington Fire Department Captain Chris Harrod said to WKYT. The 'Fire Challenge' is the latest internet phenomenon in the same vein as the the gallon milk and cinnamon challenge. However, while those are relatively safe, this is far more serious. Crazy: The 'Fire Challenge' has seen many upload videos of themselves setting fire to their arms, legs, chest and even genitals . Dangerous: Some undertake the challenge in a shower so that they can douse themselves with water immediately . Videos online reveal a number of young men either using an aerosol canister or alcohol as an accelerant and then light their chest, legs, arms or even genital areas. Most scream and shout as the flames ignite and thrash wildly to put the fire out while friends who are filming laugh out loud. Others undertake the challenge in a shower, with close access to water should they need it. Covered in bandages now, the chastened Kentucky teen told WKYT that he has been left feeling slightly foolish. 'Just watching it and never seeing what ended and just being childish,' said the 15-year-old. 'I don't know, I wasn't thinking really.' the teen admitted to WKYT. The Cinnamon Challenge . The idea of the cinnamon challenge is take put a tablespoon of powdered cinnamon into your mouth and try to swallow it. Water is not allowed. Admittedly humorous videos uploaded online show people trying and failing to complete this challenge. However, doctors have warned not to try it because of the danger of choking due to the drying effect of the powdered spice.The gallon of milk in an hour challenge . Made popular by television show Jackass, the point of this is to drink a gallon of the white stuff in an hour and then not vomit. While obviously disgusting, the seemingly innocent nature of milk had many trying and failing to complete the challenge. While doctors warn that drinking one gallon of anything, including water in a hour is dangerous, most fail the milk challenge because it curdles in the stomach and the body simply needs to expel it. Neknominate . This particular online challenge is prevalent in the United Kingdom and began as a drinking game between two people. The challenge would be to drink a particularly strong alcoholic drink in one go and then ask another person to accept or deny the gauntlet. However, it expanded to include dangerous dares to be done after drinking and at least five deaths in Britain have been reported in Britain as a result of this.","Kentucky teen, who declined to be identified set himself on fire copying latest new online trend .

"By . James  Nye . The mysterious murder of a prominent Harvard educated Florida law professor in his home took a worrying turn on Monday when police announced that Dan Markel was the victim of an 'assassination'. Tallahassee police said that killing of Professor Markel, 41, who was shot in the head at his home on Friday, was not a random act of violence - rather he was the intended target of an attack. Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, died one day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far. Scroll down for video . Intentional? Police are investigating the possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside his Tallahassee home on Friday morning . Devoted: Professor Dan Markel with his two sons, age five and three, was known as a proud father with shared custody despite his divorce from his wife, Wendi, last year. Friends and colleagues have raised $50,000 for his sons . Discovered: The Harvard and Cambridge educated professor was found with a gunshot wound to his head on Friday morning after neighbors called the police upon hearing a loud bang . 'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway. Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am on Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries. 'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.' Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father . Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013 . Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic. Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming. He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg. Markel, the father of two young boys, ages 3 and 5, is divorced from fellow FSU law professor Wendi Adelson. Her attorney, Jimmy Judkins, said that Adelson is cooperating with police and he told USA Today she is 'distraught, devastated, scared to death.' Adelson, 35, currently is the director of Florida State University's Public Interest Law Center. Police have admitted that the Harvard and Cambridge educated professor's death has left them mystified. They are still working to find any witnesses who may be able to shed any light on the troubling case. Contributor: Professor Dan Markel has worked with Atlantic magazine and The New York Times writing articles on interpretation of the law . 'The initial investigation has provided no indication that this case is connected to a burglary or robbery, and investigators are assuring residents there is no evidence this was a random act,' said the Tallahassee Police Department in a statement on Monday. 'Neighbourhood residents should continue to be vigilant, but it appears at this time that Mr. Markel was the intended victim in this incident.' Judkins said that the uncertainty was causing Adelson to become frightened. 'She’s devastated by it,' said Jimmy Judkins, her lawyer to The Globe and Mail. 'She’s a basket case over the plight of her children now. She’s scared because she doesn’t know who did this or why it occurred and it’s got her thinking the worst in so many different ways.' Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year. They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues. Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect. A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel. Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by their friends death . 'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read. 'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous. 'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.' His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key. Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. 'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.' Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened. 'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail. And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught. 'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire. 'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'","Professor Dan Markel, 41, was found with a gunshot wound to the head in his Tallahassee home on Friday morning .

"By . James  Nye . Haris Suleman knew that flying around the world carried risks. But like adventurers before him, the 17-year-old pilot from Indiana also believed dreams aren't achieved without taking chances. 'Why does any explorer undertake the necessary risks in order to accomplish their dream? Because that person has a drive, they have a focus, and they have a need to explore that dream,' he wrote in a July 15 blog for The Huffington Post. That dream turned to tragedy Tuesday when his plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean en route from American Samoa to Honolulu. Crews recovered Haris' body but were still searching for 58-year-old Babar Suleman on Wednesday. Scroll Down for Video . Recovery: Emergency medical personnel prepare to transfer the body of 17-year-old Haris Suleman to shore after it was recovered at sea early on Wednesday, July 23, 2014 . Search: A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 from the Coast Guard Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii circles just south of Tutuila Island, American Samoa, searching to locate further debris and Babar Suleman . As plans for welcome-home celebrations shifted to mourning, family and friends defended the father-son team and their mission, saying they had known the dangers when they set out to break a record while raising money to help build schools in Babar Suleman's native Pakistan. 'It was an absolutely noble cause that they took this journey on, and they knew the dangers,' said family friend Azher Khan, who spoke during a news conference Wednesday in Plainfield, Indiana, where the Sulemans lived. This comes as a C-130 pilot spotted sections of the plane's fuselage and other aircraft components Wednesday night in a remote section of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of American Samoa, spokesman Gene Maestas in Honolulu said, and ships later recovered some of that debris. The body of 17-year-old Haris Suleman was found shortly after Tuesday's crash. Crews are still searching for 58-year-old Babar Suleman, who was traveling with his son on his around-the-world flight, Maestas said. That search is still considered an active search and rescue case, he said.

Family spokeswoman Annie Hayat said Thursday the Suleman family ""keeps asking for prayers for the safe return of Babar Suleman."" Haris Suleman had hoped to set the record for the fastest circumnavigation around the world in a single-engine airplane with the youngest pilot in command. His journey was also a fundraiser to help build schools in his father's native Pakistan. The Sulemans, who lived in suburban Indianapolis, left on June 19 and were expected to arrive back in the U.S. on Saturday. Babar Suleman had long dreamed of flying around the world. He and his son decided to make the adventure a fundraiser for the Citizens Foundation, which has built 1,000 schools in Pakistan.

They also hoped to set the record for the fastest circumnavigation around the world in a single-engine airplane with the youngest pilot in command to do so. The duo planned the trip carefully. They took classes in how to survive an ocean landing and packed a life raft with food and other supplies in case they had to bail out over water. They calculated their fuel needs and plotted their course, arranging stops in Europe, Africa, Asia and the South Pacific, before setting out June 19. 'With a trip like this, there's always a risk, and they did prepare for that risk,' Hiba Suleman said of her brother and father. 'You can plan all you want, but sometimes things just don't happen the way you planned.' Tragic end: Haris Suleman's plane went down shortly after leaving Pago Pago in American Samoa.

Shared journey: Haris Suleman shared every stage . of his journey online including photographs from his plane's window . including a shot of his final sunset on Pago Pago, pictured left, and . the view of the ocean, pictured right . Love of flying: Both father and son had a passion for planes and flying with Haris joining Babar on his many journeys . But others questioned the wisdom of putting a 17-year-old at the controls for such a grueling journey. 'I would put it along the lines of a 17-year-old behind the wheel,' said Carol E. Giles, a private aviation consultant and former Federal Aviation Administration official who noted that younger pilots have less experience coping with emergencies. An inspector for the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in American Samoa will be looking into the cause of the accident. National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Terry Williams said the agency will work with local authorities on the investigation, but he couldn't confirm if the NTSB would send an investigator too. Babar Suleman had flown for more than a decade and had experience with emergency landings. In 2008, he landed his plane on an Indianapolis highway after its single engine died. Last days: Babar and Haris Suleman shared images of the final stops on their record-breaking attempt before tragedy struck . 'Beauty and culture': The 17-year-old shared photographs on Twitter and his blog during the round the world trip . His son had flown with him since the age of 8 and received his pilot's license and instrument rating in June. He emphasized preparations with his son, both before and during the journey. 'Hope is never a good plan,' the elder Suleman told NBC News before setting off. 'We have to plan for all kinds of eventualities.' Babar Suleman expressed frustration with his son in a July 9 blog post chronicling their journey over Haris' failure to know the exact location of an airport. 'I have been harping on Haris that an instrument pilot always flies with precision, always maintains the center line while taxiing, landing and takeoff, never busts the assigned altitudes ... and is always way ahead of the plane. Not knowing the exact location of the Walton airport was rather unsettling,' he wrote.","The body of Haris Suleman, 17, has been recovered off Pago Pago .

"By . James  Nye . A Maryland couple in their 50s have been arrested and charged with sickening abuse of their 22-year-old autistic twin sons. Montgomery County Police said that 57-year-old John Land and his 59-year-old wife Janice Land kept their two boys prisoner in a fetid, urine soaked basement that was 'not fit for animals'. According to court documents the two parents would lock their sons - who are unable to speak - downstairs from 10pm to 5am each day and had been doing so for the past six years. Police discovered the suburban house of horrors on Friday when they arrived at the house to serve a search warrant on an unrelated matter. According to their report, officers came across a padlocked basement room with no light and when they broke inside found the two men who had one comforter covering the tile floor between them. Officers said the room stank of urine and the floor and ceilings were crawling with cockroaches. Scroll Down for Video .

The couple allegedly kept their autistic, twin adult sons locked up at night in small basement room . When officers asked the Land's how they would know if their sons needed anything, they allegedly replied that their screams and yells would eventually wake them. The couple were booked into the local county jail on Friday and were later released on bond and have denied all the charges - claiming their boys were locked away to stop them from leaving the house. John Land told police that one of his sons had been violent in the past, causing him to keep him in the basement room, locked from the outside. The Lands were each charged with two counts of abuse of a vulnerable adult and two counts of false imprisonment.

'I don't know how anyone would think that's an acceptable way to keep anybody,' she said to Fox 5. Another neighbor, Sharon Drennan said that her son was friends with the Lands other children and knew about the alleged abuse. She said that she had tried to contact the authorities as long as three-years ago. 'There were cops in that house several times and never removed the children. And it came to this?

"By . James  Nye . and Associated Press . A North Texas police department has fired a jailer and released unsettling video of an man arrested for public intoxication being slammed face-first to the floor during booking. Denton Police Officer Ryan Grelle said that Wednesday's release of the 20-minute video is a way to apologize to the public and to transparently show what happened. Jailer Darius Porter was fired last Friday when police concluded he used excessive force during the July 19 booking of Jason Bishop. Bishop says he suffered a broken nose, two black eyes and a cut on the head. Scroll Down for Video . Battered: Jason Bishop (seen here in before and after pictures) was left with shocking injuries after landing face first on the floor of a jail in suburban Dallas . Smash: In this grainy footage from the cell, Bishop can be seen to fall to the ground after a leg swipe performed by Darius Porter (not clearly made out in image) Police say Porter misapplied a technique called a leg sweep that tripped Bishop, whose head struck the concrete floor. Bishop, 38, who was treated at a hospital, told the Denton Record-Chronicle on Wednesday that his head still hurts but he's otherwise healing. In the video at the Denton Police Department jail, Bishop is initially seen not following any of the directions given to him by police following his arrest near to the University of North Texas. He is then lifted off the bench he is sitting on, slammed down onto a desk, hitting his head and then taken into a holding cell. Start: The video begins with Bishop, seen standing with the red cap on, is asked to comply with instructions . Slammed: Bishop does not comply with instructions and is rammed down onto the desk at Denton Police Office's jail . It is inside the cell that Porter applies a leg sweep that causes Bishop to crash face first down onto the floor. In the video, which Denton Police released to refute any rumors or accusations that Bishop was beaten, he is seen to lie down for two minutes. When rolls over, a pool of blood can be seen. Eventually, Bishop is taken to Denton Regional Medical Center where he was treated for a facial contusion, cut lip, wrist injury and broken nose. Sorry: Denton police spokesman Ryan Grelle apologized for the actions of one jailer in his department . The resulting investigation by police discovered that Porter did not apply a leg sweep properly and because of this, he was fired. 'We are absolutely sorry that it happened to him,' said Grelle to NBC DFW. 'That is not a normal takedown that we usually do.' He admitted it was up to Bishop to decide if he wanted to pursue any charges against Porter. However, Grelle added that police have had more than 20 run-ins with Bishop and that he is notorious inside the department. 'There's a lot of rumors going around that he was beaten in the jail, he was handcuffed in the jail, that it wasn't a leg sweep that took him down and caused the facial injuries. We wanted to be transparent and let people see that this is what happened,' said Grelle.","Jason Bishop, 38, was left bruised on July 19 after being arrested in a Dallas suburb .

A rather sheepish Baldwin replied, 'Sure, sure.' The judge then gave him an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. 'Be a good boy from now on,' Delury bantered. 'Have a good day.' Prior to his the two traded friendly verbal blows as Baldwin's latest courtroom appearance went off smoothly. 'You were in the ‘Search for Red October’?' the judge asked according to the New York Daily News. 'No, ‘Hunt for Red October,’ Baldwin corrected him. 'That’s a good movie,' commented Delury as he surveyed the charges. 'Looks like you have a short fuse.' Baldwin said he wanted to pay a fine and Delury replied, 'I'm asking for an apology.' 'I'd rather pay a fine,' retorted Baldwin. Taken away in handcuffs: Alec Baldwin was detained by officers in New York in May and taken away in a cop car . Volatile: The volatile actor reportedly 'went ballistic' on cops during the incident which led to him being led away by cops . Delury ordered an adjournment for Baldwin for the actor's latest public spat when he was arrested by a pair of women city cops after riding the wrong way up Fifth Avenue on May 13. The volatile actor was handcuffed by police officers and taken away in a squad car, with one witness telling In Touch he 'went ballistic on the cops, screaming at them' during the incident which led to his arrest. He was asked to provide ID which he didn't have on him. Officers said that he then started to argue with them and was taken into custody. A source told the New York Daily News he became enraged because the young police officers failed to recognize him. According to the insider, Alec said: 'How old are these officers? They don't even know who I am.' Sombre: Alec looked downcast as he left the precinct and made his way home after his chastening arrest in May . Sullen: Baldwin refused to comment as he arrived home that day but it didn't take him long to start tweeting about the incident . Hitting out: Alec took to Twitter as soon as he got back to his New York apartment to tell his side of the story . A police source added to the publication: 'He became belligerent, yelling and screaming at the officers, 'I don't have ID. Just give me the f***ing summonses.' Although Alec argued with officers, by the time he was cuffed he was 'calm and quiet', an onlooker told In Touch. In a fit of rage in the hours after he was released by police that afternoon, the 30 Rock star returned home to take to Twitter and launch one of his now-famous rants. The star, who was once tipped to run for Mayor of New York, wrote: 'New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.' Recent appearance: Alec Baldwin and his wife Hilaria Baldwin at the opening night of 'Clever Little Lies' in New York on July 19 . In February Baldwin threatened to leave New York because he wanted privacy. He told New York magazine he would 'probably' have to pack his bags and bid farewell to his beloved hometown sooner rather than later. He talked about beginning to 'crave' Los Angeles after over 30 years in the Big Apple because he thinks he would be able to give wife Hilaria and their nine-month-old daughter Carmen a more peaceful and private life. However, despite his demands for privacy, he often poses for his wife's public Instagram page, where she shares intimate family moments. Meanwhile, Alec has faced controversy in the past few years for repeatedly being accused of using homophobic slurs. In November his newly-launched cable show was pulled off the air  after the actor was caught calling a photographer a 'c***sucking f**'. It came after a rough week for Baldwin, as he appeared in court for the trial of his stalker and then got in at least four arguments with journalists and photographers in front of his Manhattan apartment in the following days. As the suspension was announced, Baldwin even threatened to quit showbiz for good. 'If quitting the television business, the movie business, the theater, any component of entertainment, is necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family, then that is an easy choice,' he wrote in a blog post on the Huffington Post.

In 2011, he was accused of calling a Starbucks barista an 'uptight queen.' In 2012, he called the New York Daily News editor an 'English queen.' Finally, in June 2013, he tweeted out a homophobic rant directed at a MailOnline reporter, calling him a 'toxic queen' and said he would 'stick his foot in the reporter's a**,' except that the reporter would 'dig it too much.'

"By . James  Nye . Police are investigating what appears to be a human head found in a Long Island town where two severed arms were discovered about a week ago. Hempstead police say the head was found at about 5 p.m. Thursday on Boylston Street, close to where the two arms were found dumped on residential lawns. Authorities are trying to determine if the body parts are linked to the disappearance of Brooklyn mother of four Chinelle Latoya, 27, who was reported missing on July 5, according to police. Scroll down for video . Fears: Police are working to determine whether the scattered human remains found close by to one another in Long Island belong to missing mother of four, Chinelle Latoya . Mother: Chinelle Latoya with her four children and a friend. Fears are growing that the Brooklyn mother may have been killed . Last Wednesday, a Hempstead homeowner discovered a human arm with women's clothing attached to it in his front yard on Webb Avenue according to the New York Daily News. The very next day, another homeowner found another human arm in their yard about a half-mile away, near Stewart Avenue and Cornell Street. Scene: The Hempstead police said the head was found around 5 pm Thursday on Boylston Street, close to where the two arms were found dumped earlier this month . Police have begun looking into whether the arms are linked to to the discovery of a partially dismembered body in a public parking lot in Bay Shore on Tuesday. A tattoo found on the body matched one Browne had, police sources said last week.","Authorities investigate whether remains found over the course of last week on Long Island are those of Chinelle Latoya, 27 ."
"By . James  Nye . The prominent Harvard and Cambridge educated criminal law professor gunned down in his own home on Friday was shot point-blank in the side of the head, police said on Thursday. However, police would not confirm whether he was shot in the front of his head or the back, which if it was the later, would indicate it was an execution-style killing. Professor Dan Markel, 41, lost his life at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida and Tallahassee police have confirmed that there were no signs of forced entry. This suggests to investigators that the Florida State University professor opened the door to his killer and almost certainly knew them. Scroll Down for Video . Devoted: Professor Dan Markel with his two sons, age five and three, was known as a proud father with shared custody despite his divorce from his wife, Wendi, last year. Friends and colleagues have raised $50,000 for his sons . Shot dead: Detectives say Florida State University law school professor Daniel Markel was shot in the head inside his garage at home in Tallahassee, Florida last Friday . However, they have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of a white Toyota Prius and have said that they are interested in speaking to the driver. 'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent. 'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.' However, with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will volunteer and incriminate themselves. 'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said. Last Friday's shooting of the popular lawyer has stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in Florida's state capital, who demanded to know whether Markel had surprised an armed burglar or robber. No, Police Chief Michael DeLeo said - this was a premeditated murder. Touota Prius seen nearby: The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway released photos of a vehicle of interest Wednesday and asked for anyone with surveillance in the area to contact police. The car appears to be a silver or light green Toyota Prius, though police will not confirm that. Earlier this week, police in Tallahassee said that the killing of Professor Markel, 41, who was shot in the head at his home on Friday, was not a random act of violence - rather he was the intended target of an attack. Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, died one day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far. 'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway. Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am on Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries. 'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.' Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father . Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013 . Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic. Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming. He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg. Markel, the father of two young boys, ages 3 and 5, is divorced from fellow FSU law professor Wendi Adelson. Her attorney, Jimmy Judkins, said that Adelson is cooperating with police and he told USA Today she is 'distraught, devastated, scared to death.' Adelson, 35, currently is the director of Florida State University's Public Interest Law Center. Police have admitted that the Harvard and Cambridge educated professor's death has left them mystified. They are still working to find any witnesses who may be able to shed any light on the troubling case. 'The initial investigation has provided no indication that this case is connected to a burglary or robbery, and investigators are assuring residents there is no evidence this was a random act,' said the Tallahassee Police Department in a statement on Monday. Intentional? Police are investigating the . possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside . his Tallahassee home on Friday morning . 'Neighborhood residents should continue to be vigilant, but it appears at this time that Mr. Markel was the intended victim in this incident.' Judkins said that the uncertainty was causing Adelson to become frightened. 'She’s devastated by it,' said Jimmy Judkins, her lawyer to The Globe and Mail. 'She’s a basket case over the plight of her children now. She’s scared because she doesn’t know who did this or why it occurred and it’s got her thinking the worst in so many different ways.' Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year. They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues. Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect. A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel. 'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read. 'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous. 'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.' Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by their friends death . His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key. Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. 'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.' Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened. 'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail. And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught. 'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire. 'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'","Police in Tallahassee release fresh details about mysterious murder of Professor Dan Markel .

"By . James  Nye . Arrested: Mike Doster was charged with domestic battery after a violent argument with his wife while jet skiing during which she accused him of performing oral sex on another man . A Florida wife was rescued from a remote sandbar wearing nothing but a lifejacket on Sunday after her husband dumped her there following a blazing drunken row on their jet ski. The violent argument was sparked by Pamela Doster, 45, accusing her husband of two-years, David Doster, 49, of engaging in a sex act with another man. Pulled from the Passage Key sands - a famous offshore nudist beach popular with swingers - by boat, Pamela Doster's testimony led to the arrest of her husband for domestic battery. According to the Manatee County Sheriff's report, Doster and his wife Pamela were on a Sea-Doo jet ski near to the Passage Key sandbar when they began fighting. According to the report, Pamela told her husband that she had seen him and another man performing oral sex on one another. The report does not specify when and where this occurred, but the arresting officer said that Pamela claimed it involved the men 'giving each other a blow job'. The report seen by Smoking Gun states that Doster, who was riding the Sea-Doo, threw his wife off the jet ski four times and 'During the last time she was pulled off she hit her head against the side of the jet ski. No clothes: Passage Key sandbar (not pictured) hosts some nudist beachgoers off the coast of Tampa, Florida . She refused to get back on the ski with him and stayed on the sandbar which rests under knee deep water. Her husband tried to get her back on the jet ski but she flat out refused and eventually Mike Doster rode away, leaving her there. When he reached shore he did call 911 and informed rescue services she was out at sea and when they pulled her back in, emergency workers noticed she had a 'bruise/bump' on her head, a bruise on her biceps, and a 'large swollen area to her left hip area.' She was transported to a local hospital for treatment. Speed: The Doster's (not pictured) were riding around Passage Keys on a jet-ski when they had their argument . The beach at Passage Key plays host to many nude swimmers in the warm waters of the Gulf all through the year. It is not known if Mike Doster was piloting the jet ski in the nude at the time of the altercation. He was released from a Florida jail on Tuesday after posting $5000 bond on a misdemeanor count.","Mike Doster, 49, charged with domestic battery after leaving his wife, Pamela, 45, on Florida sandbar .

"By . James  Nye . A military fiancée who proudly boasts an 'I Love My Soldier' bumper sticker was shocked to find a spiteful letter slapped on her windshield that attacked her and threatened violence for supporting the army. Savannah student, Ellen Wilson, 23, was in a Target parking lot earlier this month when she found the anonymous note that labeled her a 'b***h' and implied that her future husband, Chase Nye, was guilty of committing 'unnecessary murders'. The venomous letter personally attacked Wilson's fiancee for not being the hero she believes him to be and then frightened her when it finished up by calling her lucky, because 'I didn't slash your damn tires!'. Scroll down for video . Shocked: Ellen Wilson returned to her car to find a vindictive note attacking her fiancee's service in the US Military . Gross: This is the letter than Wilson discovered on the windshield of her car earlier this month that so disturbed her . Quickly driving away in case someone was watching her, Wilson returned home and posted the hate-filled letter to Facebook, drawing an instant and stunned response. 'I got in my car and noticed the paper on the windshield,' Wilson told WTVM-TV. 'I drove off in case someone was watching, and then I grabbed it and read it and saw this lovely letter from this person.' The vitriolic letter must have been written and posted onto her car in the short time she was inside Target on an errand. 'So I noticed your ‘I love my soldier’ decal,' it reads. 'I’m sure he is your ‘hero’ too right? I feel bad for you and how blind your must be to what is really going on in this country. First off he is not a hero. Your ‘man’ is a pawn being used in the immoral game of wholesale murder.' Happy couple: Chase Nye and his fiance, Ellen Wilson (together, right) are upset at the response to her proud bumper sticker . Frightened: As soon as the contents of the letter dawned on Wilson, she drove away quickly in case she was being watched . Controversial? This is the bumper sticker on the back of Ellen Wilson's car . The letter closed with this: 'There is nothing heroic about blindly following immoral orders for an undeserved paycheck, especially when such orders involve the unnecessary murder of others!!! 'It’s people like you and your ‘soldier’ who are destructing our country, shame on you b****! You’re lucky I didn’t slash your damn tires!!' Wilson told WTVM that she was stunned someone would author such a letter. 'How could someone do this?” she said. “I’m not mad. It’s fine what you believe in and what I believe in, but I’m not going to hate you for it. But to attack somebody else, especially someone close to me, is a different story. 'This is real, and it happened, and I just don’t want it to affect another military spouse,' she added. Indeed, Wilson's fiancée has now asked her to remove the I Love My Soldier bumper sticker because he doesn't want her to become the subject of anymore abuse. The Savannah, Georgia, American Legion and Veteran's Council member, Marine Jimmy Ray said he was disturbed by the whole episode. 'If they are so concerned, why didn’t they sign it?' 'So I noticed your ‘I love my soldier’ decal. I’m sure he is your [sic] ‘hero’ too right? I feel really bad for you and how blind you must be to what is really going on in this country.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Josh Gardner . Facebook has deleted trophy photos showing rhinos, elephants, lions and leopards killed or tranquilized by a Texas Tech cheerleader. Kendall Jones, 19, has sparked outrage across the social media site for sharing images of herself with the big game she has hunted through Africa. On Thursday, Facebook removed some of the images that violated their standards. In a statement, it said it removes 'reported content that . promotes poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for . organized fight or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'. Removed: Facebook had taken down this photo of Kendall Jones, 19, with a lion that she hunted in Africa. The social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards . Following the removal of the images, she shared a Fox News Channel montage of . the deleted photos but by Friday, there was no sign of the montage. It came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles . proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from . extinction. 'For the sake of all animals,' the petition against Jones reads as it implores . animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' After starting the social media firestorm, the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife. In a typo-laden defense that invokes . the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, she claimed . killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them. 'This . is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become . extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook. Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse' '[Roosevelt] . was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now . chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, . how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from . the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never . understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless . Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't . always space for threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' 'This is a conservation effort!': The Texas Tech cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them . Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed. One . particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely . endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the . Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The . vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, . treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to . be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino . population through conservation,' she wrote. However, . Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, . elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a . white rhino, which number around 20,000. Because . of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her . dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be . banned from hunting in Africa completely. Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Cruelty': Critics say she is not . a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures . Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall . Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has . been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads . the petition. It . continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television . hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as . a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.' But she also has her supporters. A Facebook account, Support Kendall Jones, has also started. 'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Josh Gardner . Shamed celebrity chef  Paula Deen continued to butter up fans for a comeback attempt on Wednesday as she announced plans for a subscription-only internet network. Paula Deen Ventures, a new company formed to help launch a comeback for Deen, says the Paula Deen Network will launch in September and will be accessible by computer, smartphone or tablet. ‘You can throw out your TV, now,’ gushed the fallen Food Network star. 'You can throw away your TV, now': Deen announced last week that she'll be launching a digital cooking and entertainment network for subscribers only to stream on tablets, phones and home computers . Comeback: The Paula Deen Network will become available in September and become part of the fallen Food Network star's attempt at a comeback following her scandal over racist remarks that destroyed the 67-year-old's career last year . The network will feature daily programming in an unscripted format with new recipes, episodes and cooking tools. ‘We're going to have so much fun being together and cooking up some wonderful new and classic dishes,’ Deen said. ‘Y'all can get my recipes, tips and cooking anytime you want — this is for you. I can't wait to crank up the oven and get cooking for the people I love: my family, my friends and my fans!’ Production for the network began last month at a new studio in Savannah that has been designed to look like the set of her first television show, Paula's Home Cooking. The set was built to accommodate a live studio audience, and guest appearances are planned. The announcement of the digital network is the latest step in a comeback strategy Deen kicked off in February when she announced a deal with the Najafi Companies, an Arizona-based private investment firm that's putting millions into rebooting her public career.

'O.J.’s desperate for face time with Kris and has been laying it on thick in his letters, telling her how beautiful he thinks she is and what wonderful memories he has of their time together,' revealed an insider to The National Enquirer. 'Obviously her power and money is a huge attraction to him, as well as her looks – and he’s clearly got it in his head that her cash could get him an early release.' However, another source that spoke to The National Enquirer has said that OJ's letters are 'Kris' worst nightmare! 'She wants no part of O.J., 67, but he’s pleading with her to visit him in jail and go over some very important issues that he wants to discuss with her in person.' 37152 . 74560 . 31881 . 35225 . 27586 . 89513 . 62120 . 30186 . 52803 . 36224 . 32671 . 46115 . 44815 . 49087 . 29768 . 38685 . 33646 . 61278 . 44258 . 114560 . Old friends: O.J. Simpson and girlfriend Paula Barbieri, nine-year-old Khloe Kardashian and other celebrity golfers attend a pairings party in his Frank Sinatra Celebrity Golf Tournament in Palm Springs, California after OJ Simpson's 1995 not-guilty verdict . Indeed, Kris and OJ would party with OJ's wife Nicole and Robert Kardashian before the tragic train of events that led to Nicole's death in 1994. Their friendship soured after Robert Kardashian helped his friend escape conviction for his estranged wife's murder and that of Ronald Lyle Goldman. Indeed, Kris's former husband, who died in 2003, was once OJ's most trusted confidant and member of his 'Dream Team' of lawyers. A few years after Simpson. was found not guilty of the double murder, Fred Goldman and his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and on February 5, 1997 the civil jury unanimously found the former NFL Hall-Of-Famer guilty of battery against Ron and  Nicole. Lives cut short: Ron Goldman was 25 and Nicole Brown Simpson was 35 when they were viciously stabbed to death in front of her condominium on North Bundy Drive. Ron was stabbed almost 60 times . O.J. Simpson is surrounded by his 'Dream Team' defense attorneys including Robert Kardashian (right) Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. (left) and  Robert Shapiro (center) Fred was awarded $33.5 million in damages; he and his family have seen only a fraction of the money. In February 1999, an auction of Simpson's Heisman Trophy and other property raised almost $500,000, which went to the Goldman family. After realizing Goldman was never going to stop pursuing the multi-million judgment, Simpson moved from California to Florida because the state law there says a person's residence cannot be collected to satisfy a debt. The Goldman family  also tried to seize his annual NFL pension of $25,000 a month but failed to collect any money. The bloody glove: 'If it doesn't fit you must acquit,' said defense attorney Johnnie Cochran about the bloody glove found at the guest bungalow in back of OJ's Rockingham home. Simpson is pictured at his murder trial in 1995 . In 2007 Fred and Kim went to court to fight for the rights to the profits from OJ Simpson's book 'If I Did It' and they won. Simpson was reportedly paid an $800,000 advance by the publisher and immediately laundered the funds through the accounts of his four children so the lawyers could not trace the payment and collect it towards the civil judgment. Simpson is currently serving his 33-year sentence with the possibility of parole after nine years. He went back to court in 2013 hoping to get his conviction overturned due to poor legal representation but his request was denied by the court stating there was no merit for his accusations. His earliest possible release date from the Nevada prison will be in 2017.","New report claims that OJ Simpson is trying to get his former friend Kris Jenner to visit him in prison .

"By . Martin Robinson . A professional boxer laundered money for rogue builders as he prepared to fight for the British title, a court has heard. Welterweight Lee Purdy, 27, is accused of cashing cheques on behalf of his father Van  Purdy and his friend Jim Brown in 2011. He and his stepmother, Rachel Poole, are alleged to have passed cheques, which had been paid to a gang of rogue builders, through their bank accounts. Purdy told a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court that he was being paid around £25,000 a match at the time of the alleged offences. In court: Professional boxer Lee Purdy  and his stepmother Rachel Poole are alleged to have passed cheques, which had been paid to a gang of rogue builders, through their bank accounts . Star:  Lee Purdy celebrates his English title victory over Adnan Amar after their British Welterweight Championship bout at the Sheffield Motorpoint Arena in March 2012 . The jury heard he was arrested two years after the alleged offences and chose not to  have a solicitor when interviewed by police because he had 'done nothing wrong' When asked about paying in the cheques he said: 'I didn't place a great significance on doing it for my dad. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.' He said there was no reason not to do what his father had asked him to do. Purdy, 27, from Colchester, told the jury when he was in training, he would be at his gym in Romford for up to six hours a day. 'It's a lifestyle, it's what I do day in and day out,' he said. Anticipating a title fight was the most important thing in his mindset', he added. Well paid: Purdy said he earned around £25,000 a fight and denied that he was laundering money . He won the British title in April 2011 after knocking out his opponent but lost it 2013. The court was told his career is now on hold after he suffered a detached retina at a match in December 2013 . Purdy said he was blind in that eye and had undergone five operations this year. It is hoped he might regain some sight. Poole, a 48-year-old nurse and care agency manager from The Nursery, Bromley Road, Ardleigh, told the court she had no reason to doubt her partner Jim Brown when he asked her to pay in some cheques. The prosecution has alleged Poole used her bank account to launder a total of £11,650 while Purdy's alleged involvement amounted to £12,140. Both deny the charges. The trial continues.

"By . Martin Robinson . The strike on ISIS today came after . U.S. forces spent the last two months moving ships, jets and troops . within striking distance. After . President Obama gave the go ahead last night, two F/A18 fighters flew . off from an American 'supercarrier' in the Persian Gulf to fire 500lb . laser-guided bombs on a group of Islamic militants outside Kurdish . capital Erbil. The jets were . on the USS George H.W. Bush, which was ordered to travel 1,000 miles . from the Arabian Sea to the Persian Gulf seven weeks ago. Surrounded: The U.S. has spent recent months moving its ships, jets and troops within striking distance with today's attack on ISIS coming from the Persian Gulf . It begins: One of the two F/A-18C Hornet fighter jets that bombed the ISIS artillery position prepares for takeoff from the USS George H. W. Bush in the Persian Gulf before the dawn mission this morning . Ready for action: And as soon as the first two jets returned from their successful bombing run on ISIS fighters marching on Erbil this morning, the flight deck of the George H. W. Bush aircraft carrier came alive as more warplanes readied for action . It . joined the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet - two aircraft carriers -  the USS . Carl Vinson and USS Abraham Lincoln - and several nuclear submarines . armed with Tomahawk missiles. Each . carrier typically carries 64 aircraft, including the F/A-18 Super . Hornet fighter jets, EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft, E-2 . Hawkeye surveillance planes and SH-60/MH-60 Seahawk helicopters. There are also five other U.S. ships believed to be in the Arabian Sea of needed. Obama's operational choices are limited to launches from bases outside Iraq's borders. Among . them are Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which already houses command and . logistics hubs for U.S. Central Command and was ground zero for air . sorties over Afghanistan and Iraq since the early days of the George W. Bush administration. Al-Udeid is still used for some air missions over Afghanistan and houses long-range B1-bombers. Closer . to Iraq's northern provinces is an American air base in Incirlik, . Turkey. After 2011, that facility inherited much of the airborne . surveillance hardware – including drones – that the U.S. once launched . from bases inside Iraq. 'We're coming to help': President Obama meets with the National Security Council yesterday in the Situation Room of the White House, hours before his address to the nation in which he vowed to help the thousands of Iraqi civilians being driven from their homes and slaughtered by the Islamic State extremists running rampant through the country. That help came in the form of targeted airstrikes on key ISIS positions today . Unmanned attacker: The United States has its MQ-9 'Reaper' drones that can deliver Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles away . Gone in a cloud of smoke: A dust cloud rises where the first US bomb struck ISIS artillery being towed by a truck outside Irbil . The airstrike marked the first time US forces have taken direct action against ISIS since it began taking control of huge swathes of the Middle East . In . addition, the U.S. commands a detachment of F-16 fighters in Jordan, . where it has 2,000 troops based, according to a Pentagon official. The . superpower also has a massive arsenal of MQ-18 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper . drones, capable of delivering Hellfire missiles more than 1,100 miles . away. The Reaper drones can also deliver 500-pound bombs. The United States has around 800 personnel on the ground in Iraq - but not enough to launch an attack. In . late June it was announced that the U.S. was sending another 300 troops . to Iraq to beef up security at its embassy and around Baghdad. Response: On the ground, a Kurdish armoured vehicle rushes towards the site of the U.S. air strike to meet ISIS . Rolling tanks: Peshmerga fighters are pictured yesterday patrolling their territory in an operation against the ISIS fighters . It does have 10,000 troops in Kuwait and stores millions of rounds of small arms fire, . thousands of rounds of tank ammunition, helicopter-fired rockets, . machine guns, grenades, flares, sniper rifles, M16s and M4 rifles. Britain has a RAF base in Cyprus, less than 100 miles from from Syria and 650 miles from Baghdad. RAF Akrotiri was built in the mid 1950s and first used in the Suez crisis. More recently the base was used as a supply post during the Iraq wars and also used to support the attacks on Libya in 2011. Before intervention in Syria was voted down by the Commons, this is where the strikes would have come from. Now it could be used for air drops to the Yazidi tribe who are trapped in the mountains of Iraq or the British could share American bases.","U.S. forces have spent last two months moving ships, weapons and troops within close proximity of conflict zone .

The man who has not been identified was too fast for bystanders to stop as he sped into a burning 30-foot tall effigy built to represent a character from the book 'Where the Wild Things Are.' The apparent suicide at the Element 11 off-shoot of Burning Man in Tooele County happened around 11 pm after the art project was set on fire. Scroll down for video . Prior event: Element 11 is part of the series of events that leads up to Burning Man in Black Rock, Nevada and just like that famous event - effigies are burnt (the one pictured is not the effigy that the deceased approached) 'The nature of the fire is such that our volunteers were not able to get close enough to the fire for risk of their own safety,' said Element 11 spokesman J.P. Bernier. Element 11 hosted more than 1,200 attendees and is a precursor to the famous Burning Man, held in held in Black Rock City, Nevada. 'He was very fast; he was very motivated. It wasn't an accident or any act of negligence on anybody's part. He had a very deliberate objective to get past our volunteers, past our safety perimeter.' Grantsville police confirmed that a man had died, but would not confirm it was suicide nor his identity. Effigy: The theme for this years Element 11 is Where the Wild Thins Are' Many at the event on Saturday night were left distraught by what they saw, including a photographer named Christian who spoke to Deseret News. 'I did see that a lot of the community was shocked and traumatized,' he said. 'There's a lot of questions, a lot of facts that are unknown.' Officials said there were between 25 and 40 volunteers forming a perimeter around the fire to prevent people from getting too close. Precursor: Element 11 comes before the massive Burning Man festival - which plays host to tens of thousands of people . Those nearby attempted to shout at the man and even chase him, but could not stop him. Element 11 officials delivered a verbal statement Sunday to FOX 13 News’ Robert Boyd regarding the incident: . 'This is a deeply upsetting event with tragic results, our hearts go out to the Utah community and the attendees of Element 11.

"By . Martin Robinson . A teenage boy racer on drugs was pulled over by police minutes before he killed two teenage best friends, it was revealed today. Unemployed football coach Samuel Etherington, 21, who is serving a nine year prison sentence, was stopped at 3.25am last November after officers saw a broken rear light on his modified Honda Civic. But at 4.15am  he crashed into and killed Jasmine Allsop, 14, and Olivia Lewry, 16, while driving 65mph in a 30mph zone. The speeding driver had taken horse tranquilliser ketamine and mephedrone in the 24 hours before the crash in Gosport, Hampshire. Crash: Samuel Etherington, 21, who is serving a nine year prison sentence, killed Jasmine Allsop, 14, and Olivia Lewry, 16, last year. Today it emerged police had pulled him over 50 minutes earlier . Tragedy: The best friends were at a party when the dangerous driver knocked them down at 65mph in a 30mph zone . Jasmine's heartbroken mother Rose Allsop, 38, says her daughter would still be alive if the officers who pulled Etherington over had tested him for drugs. Ms Allsop said: 'If they'd have pulled him over the accident wouldn't have happened in the first place. 'They should have done some kind of test on him. 'They must have known he was on drugs. That's what makes me angry - they don't know anything about it.' But Hampshire Police maintain they carried out stop-check procedures correctly and Etherington had been driving normally before they stopped him. A court heard there is no evidence his drug consumption impaired his driving. Etherington, from Gosport, pleaded guilty to two counts of death by dangerous driving and was given a nine-year prison sentence in February. Fury: Rose Allsop says her daughter Jasmine and her best friend Olivia would have been saved had police taken Etherington off the road before the crash . The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the jail term last week. The fact he was pulled over before the crash emerged today and police have today confirmed the sequence of events . Rose's son Reece, 16, created drug-driving awareness posters after his sister died at the scene, just yards from their home on November 3 last year. He said: 'The police should have drug checked him. I think it's just stupid that they didn't. 'Now I'm trying to get the word out there and make people aware not to do drugs and go out and drive. 'It's just as bad as drinking.' Olivia was taken to hospital where she later died. The pair had been at a party at Jasmine's home. Hampshire Police stopped Etherington at 3.25am but he was 'behaving normally', a spokesman said. A force spokesman said: 'The driver, Samuel Etherington, was reported for the defective rear light and he was seen to be behaving normally. 'No inappropriate driving was observed either prior to or following this stop check by these officers. 'The driver was observed as behaving normally at this point and as such no roadside test for intoxication was required.'","Samuel Etherington jailed for killing friends Jasmine Allsop and Olivia Lewry .

"By . Martin Robinson . Facing jail: Emily Fox, 26, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust . A lesbian PE teacher faces jail today after admitting having sex with a 15-year-old student  she taught at a £24,000-a-year private school for girls. Emily Fox, 26, who can be named for the first time, pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual activity with a child while in a position of trust. She met the girl when she taught her at the Royal Masonic School for girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. The games teacher taught there for a year. Today, Fox of Bath, Somerset, admitted the charges at St Albans Crown Court. Defence barrister Dee Connelly asked for the case to be adjourned for a pre-sentence report. She said the sentencing guidelines starting point for the offences was four years in jail with a range of three to seven years. Judge Michael Baker QC adjourned sentence until 5 September and granted Fox bail. He said she must now register as a sex offender. He said bail should continue with the condition that Fox does not attend the Royal Masonic School and has no contact with anyone aged under 16. The girl cannot be identified, but Judge Baker lifted a contempt order that had prevented publication of the defendant’s name and the name of the school. The judge said: 'It is clearly in the public interest to identify the school as well as the defendant. It is, to my knowledge, by no means a small school. 'I don’t see how the identification of the school leads to the identification of the child.' The Royal . Masonic School for Girls takes both day and boarding pupils aged seven . to 18, with a pre-school which takes pupils from the age of two. It was founded in 1788 to educate the daughters of Freemasons who were unable to support their families. Its famous buildings have been widely used in films and television including two Indiana Jones films, in Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Last Crusade. The site was used as one of the locations for a film called Me and Orson Welles starring Zak Efron. It also featured in an episode of Inspector Morse. Famous former pupils include Wendy Richard, who played Pauline Fowler in EastEnders, and actress Amelia Warner.

"By . Martin Robinson . Elite consultants earning up to £3,000 a day are being employed by the Government at the taxpayers' expense, it was revealed today. New figures have revealed that at least 30 of these highly-paid specialists were given work by six different Whitehall departments last year. Ten were taken on by the Department of Transport, eight worked at the Ministry of Justice, five at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, four at the Home Office, two at the Treasury and one at the Ministry of Defence. All earned between £1,000 and £2,000 a day. The MoD has admitted it was recently paying a consultant £3,000-a-day - which equates to an annual salary of more than £1million. High price: Departments on Whitehall (pictured) spent £317m on consultants last year with the Ministry of Defence paying £3,000 a day . The Government told the BBC it paid £317 million to consultants in 2013, but insisted overall spending on them had dropped by three quarters since 2009. Separate figures show the MoD spent £137 million on technical consultants over the same period above and beyond that total, Newsnight said. It also told the programme it had recently employed someone earning up to £3,000 a day. The figures, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, prompted a backlash from campaigners and unions who questioned the high fees and urged ministers to set out in detail how many people were being hired and for how long. Transport 10 . Justice 8 . Energy 5 . Home Office 4 . Treasury 2 . Defence 1 . Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'I think people will be extremely concerned about the number of consultants being paid vast amounts of money for a day's work in government. 'Government is rightly reducing the headcount of the civil service but you cannot negate that by paying huge amounts to consultants instead. 'I think there are big questions about whether we are getting value for money not least because there is a severe lack of transparency about what they are actually doing.' Leslie Manasseh, deputy general secretary of Prospect, the union which represents professionals across the civil service, said there was confusion about how the Government did its sums. He said cuts in Whitehall had led to departments hiring a 'growing' number of consultants and managers. 'This is taxpayers' money and they have a right to know how it is being spent,' he added. 'We know how much the Prime Minister earns, we know how much senior civil servants and other politicians earn, we have little or no idea how much individual consultants are earning.' The Government would not give Newsnight details about the number of consultants earning more than £1,000 a day, but it said it had brought this kind of spending under control. A spokesman said: 'This Government has scrutinised spend by departments like never before. Already it has put an end to excessive spending on consultants and interim staff by establishing stringent controls. 'Certain departments do however have a requirement for specialist roles, especially where they are undertaking complex transformative projects. Such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within the civil service.'","30 consultants were paid between £1,000 and £2,000 a day last year .

A daughter is heartbroken after a hospital said she could say a final goodbye to her mother if she rushed to the ward even though she was already dead. Cheryl Bacon, 35, is angry she missed her beloved mother Karen's final moments, despite rushing to her bedside at Leicester Royal Infirmary. She was called at 6:06am on February 28 by the hospital and was told her mother was dying. But 15 minutes later when arrived  she discovered her mother had already died at 6am - six minutes before the call was made telling her to rush in. She said: 'I promised my mother I would be there when she passed away and I wanted a chance to say goodbye. 'When I got the call to say she was fading fast I got to the hospital as soon as I could. 'I could not believe it when they told me she was already dead. I feel like I really have let her down badly and it's so sad.' Her mother was told she had terminal lung cancer on New Year's Eve. Ms Bacon said: 'We knew she only had 12 months or less to live but she fought on. 'She went into Leicester Royal Infirmary on February 21 as she was coughing up blood. She was in a lot of pain. 'I was with her on February 27 and left at about 9.30pm. I think the hospital could have kept me better informed of her condition.'

Carole Ribbins, director of nursing at Leicester's Hospitals said: 'We take every opportunity to be as open and honest as possible when delivering bad news, with an ultimate aim to be as sensitive to the care needs and emotions of not only the patient, but also their relatives. 'As part of national training, nurses are advised to deliver bad news face-to-face where possible. However, we continue to review this and offer advanced three-day communications training to our nurses with Loros, specifically around end-of-life care.

"By . Martin Robinson . A nurse sent this selfie of himself clutching an axe to a 14-year-old girl he planned to have sex with, behead and eat, a court heard. This picture taken in Dale Bolinger's bedroom in Kent was messaged to the girl 'Eva Gonza' on a website called the Dark Fetish Network. The father-of-four bought the axe with a three foot handle from Homebase in Ramsgate on the day before he went to meet the 14 year-old. Bolinger wrote in a chatlog with Eva: 'It's big enough. And very sharp. How wide is your neck then?' This selfie shows nurse Dale Bolinger posing with an axe which he sent to a 14-year-old he wanted to have sex with, kill and eat . Canterbury nurse Dale Bolinger pictured in 2007, before the alleged offences came to light . The following day in September 2012 he went to Ashford International rail station in Kent expecting to meet the girl but she failed to turn up. A jury heard his plan was uncovered by the FBI who found him chatting on the internet about rape, murder and cannibalism calling himself 'meatmarketman'. His chatlogs also included boasts he had already eaten a 39-year-old black woman and a five year-old child. The Crown said Bolinger talked about how much more tender the meat is from children and got sexual gratification from his fantasies about cannibalism. But Bolinger told Canterbury Crown Court he had never murdered or eaten anyone and his online boasts were pure fantasy. He said he thought of 14-year-old 'Eva Gonza' as a 'man, probably in his 40s, sitting in a room somewhere surrounded by pizza boxes'. Denial: Bolinger is said to have told police his cannibalism was 'less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger' during an police interview conducted when he was first arrested in February last year . No show: The male nurse is alleged he planned to meet up with Eva Gonza, 14, at Ashford International station, pictured, but she never arrived . When asked about Eva, Bolinger said he was only 95 per cent sure she was not actually a 14-year-old girl. 'Someone was asking to speak to a real cannibal so I thought I could play that role,' he said. 'I wanted to shock her and was going to meet her fantasies and then take them to the extreme.' Initially Bolinger told police the axe was to chop two trees in his garden. But he changed his story and told the court  he bought the axe for Eva. 'Initially, I was thinking about getting one and they were also on sale,' he said. 'She [Eva] said she wouldn't come unless I bought one. She pushed me and I pushed her. We fed off each other.' When Bolinger was asked if he would like to act out a beheading in reality he said: 'No, not only would it be murder but it would be very messy.' The jury has heard that he has already pleaded guilty to an offence of administering a poison or noxious substance 'with intent to injure, aggrieve or annoy' on a woman in July 2, 2010. He is now on trial accused of 'attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming', which he denies. The trial continues.

"By . Martin Robinson . A teacher who held a knife to a student's throat and then joked he would kill him after he got an answer wrong has been banned for two years. John Holmes grabbed a 12-year-old pupil, put him in a headlock and pulled a blade from his pocket during a lesson at Landau Forte College in Derby in the summer term of 2012. The 53-year-old had said it was 'jovial' fun with his geography class. But a National Council for Teaching and Leadership panel found Holmes guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' As a result he has been banned from the country's classrooms for a minimum of two years. John Holmes has been suspended for a minimum of two years for holding a knife to a pupil's throat and threatening to kill him if he failed to answer a question . The panel, who only identified the victim as 'pupil B' said: 'Mr Holmes made physical contact with pupil B by placing his arm around pupil B's neck, and then took his knife from his pocket and pushed it open so that the blade locked into place. 'Mr Holmes then made a pretend threat to kill pupil B.' Paul Heathcote delivered the panel's decision and said: 'Mr Holmes' actions were not perceived by pupil B or other pupils in the class to be a genuine threat. 'Mr Holmes is an experienced and successful teacher, valued by the school and many of its pupils. His current employer has provided a positive testimonial. 'However, his conduct represents serious departure from the personal and professional conduct elements of the Teachers' Standards. 'He was in possession of a bladed or pointed article on school premises and there is a strong public interest in deterring the carrying and use of knives in schools. 'He has not shown clear insight into the implications of his behaviour.' Incident: Mr Holmes argued he was having  'jovial' fun with his geography class at Landau Forte College in Derby but a panel said it was 'unacceptable conduct' Pupil B had stated that Holmes had 'placed him in a headlock during a geography lesson whilst holding a knife and threatening to kill him for giving the wrong answer'. Holmes left the school following the incident, but continued to contact colleagues commenting on the circumstances, which was in breach of his suspension. The panel said Holmes received a caution on August 2, 2013, from Derbyshire Police for possession of an article with a blade or sharp point on school premises. The panel also found the teacher previously received a verbal warning from the school in April 2010 after a pupil injured himself on a door. The pupil claimed he was pushed by Holmes, but accepted the collision could have been the result of Holmes trying to prevent him from leaving a classroom. Stephen Whiteley, chief executive of Landau Forte Charitable Trust, said: 'Following the reporting of the alleged professional misconduct of a member of staff, we as a responsible employer, investigated and dealt with the matter under staff disciplinary and safeguarding procedures. 'Following detailed internal and external investigations appropriate employment procedures were then followed. Mr Holmes ceased to be employed at Landau Forte College as of August 31, 2013.'","John Holmes, 53, said incident at Landau College in Derby was 'jovial' fun .

Nathan Ould, 39, was sitting in his boat when the barb was cast towards him and pierced his cheek in a row over mackerel. Detectives say the culprit meant to hit him and positioned himself at Hope's Nose, in Torquay, Devon so Mr Ould was within reach. The attacker then fled with the rest of his angling equipment and left his victim needing medical treatment to remove the metal hook from his left cheek. Brutal: Nathan Ould was in his boat fishing for mackerel when a rival angler cast towards him and left a hook in his cheek . Rod rage: Medics had to help remove the two inch hook and police are sure that the act of violence was deliberate . Mr Ould has described the moment the two-inch hook suddenly hit his face and believes he is lucky not to be blind. His boat was several hundreds yards from of a group of recreational anglers and Nathan is certain one of them aimed at him intentionally. The married father-of-two said: 'I could see some weights in the water a little way inside of me but I wasn't paying too much attention. 'The next minute there was an almighty bang as a weight hit the boat and as I turned to see what the noise was, whack, I got one in the side of the face. 'The hook was well and truly wedged in my cheek. It was bleeding badly. It could have hit me in the eyes. There was a group of lads standing laughing and joking but they denied it was any of them. 'Anglers are always casting towards the boat, in fact they try extra hard to hit you. It's to put you off and make you move on. They just object to you trying to earn a living there. 'It's not just fisherman who they are doing it at, kayakers are also being targeted.' Incident: Mr Ould said that anglers object to commercial fisherman so they 'try extra hard to hit you' Picturesque: The assault happened here at Hopes Nose, near Torquay, Devon, where a gang of anglers were fishing . Devon and Cornwall Police say the popular angling spot was teeming with fisherman who may have seen the attack that happened at 6:30am Sunday. A spokesman said: 'Police are appealing for witnesses following an assault on a fisherman. 'It appears that the boat was deliberately targeted by a shore based fisherman by ""casting"" his rod in the boat's direction. 'On this occasion the victim was struck and a hook was embedded in his left cheek. 'There were a large number of shore based fisherman in the area at the time and police are appealing to them for information to identify the offender who is believed to have left prior to police attending. 'Police are also advising anglers of the seriousness of such actions and the injuries that it can cause.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Fisherman left with hook in face in attack .

"By . Martin Robinson . A former private schoolboy who admitted taking potshots at children with a BB gun has had his sentencing delayed for seven months because he is going to Fiji on holiday. Jack Hewitt, 17, fired at primary school pupils in Edinburgh as they played last May and told police he 'was letting off steam' during exams. Several of the children, aged between eight and ten, were shot with pellets and one girl was struck on the forehead and another was hit just below the eye. Others had red marks and bruising on their arms, legs, stomach and heads. Off on his hols: Teenage gunman Jack Hewitt arrives at court with his father Grant for his sentencing today, which was deferred for seven months so he can go on a gap year break to Fiji . Admission: The 17-year-old said he fired at primary school pupils to 'let off steam' during his exams . But the former pupil at £10,000 a year George Watson's College in Edinburgh, who pleaded guilty to the shooting, had his sentencing adjourned in January so he could complete his  Scottish Higher exams. And today at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, Sheriff Isobel McColl delayed it again, for seven months, and said it will now take place in February 2015. She wanted to defer it for six months because she felt sentencing would be 'premature' now, and extended it to seven months after learning he was off on his gap year break to the south Pacific. The teenager is now free to fly to Fiji in September and won't return until the new year. The Scottish Conservatives have today criticised the decision, saying it sent out the 'wrong message' to the public. The party's justice spokeswoman, Margaret Mitchell MSP, said: 'This latest deferral sends out completely the wrong message. 'The public will be mystified and alarmed that there has still not been an official sentence handed down for the crime committed. 'The parents of children who suffered as a result of this incident will also rightly be angered by a further delay. 'Rather than allowing a gap year holiday in Fiji, the Criminal Justice System should be dealing with this case, as opposed to bending over backwards to accommodate the perpetrator.' Victim: This ten-year-old, who cannot be named, was shot in the arm, right. His friends were also shot in the head and body . Prestigious: Hewitt was a student at the £10,000-a-year George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and first had his sentencing delays so he could take his Scottish Highers . Anger: Critics have said the 'public will be mystified and alarmed' that the boy, right, remains unsentenced . Hewitt, who has left Watson's, is taking a gap year, part of which involves travelling to the South Pacific. The prolific social media user recently revealed he had been on holiday in Lanzarote, and was at T in The Park at the weekend. In December last year Hewitt pled guilty to 'culpably and recklessly discharging a firearm'. He shot at and hit a group of young children who were playing in the grounds of Gilmerton Primary School during their lunch break. One parent described the January decision to defer sentence as a 'joke'. At the hearing earlier this year, the court was told that Hewitt had accepted responsibility for his actions. Police visited Hewitt's home following the incident last year. Officers said that a tearful Hewitt had admitted opening fire from the bathroom window but was unable to explain why he had done something 'so stupid.' Hewitt told the police at the station: 'That was me. I was just letting off some steam. I'll never do it again.'","Jack Hewitt admitted shooting at children aged between 8 and 10 last year .

"By . Martin Robinson . Tragedy: Amy Ratnett had beaten self-harm and was helping others with their problems but died after binge drinking with a friend . A woman who won a battle with self-harming died after she went out binge drinking with a friend while on medication because 'she just wanted to be normal', an inquest heard today. Before her death Amy Ratnett told a magazine she had self-poisoned for years, taking mini-overdoses, but was now helping others with mental health problems. But she died two months later following a night out drinking with a friend, an inquest heard. A coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure after hearing how the four cocktails and half a bottle of vodka she drank that night fatally combined with her medication. The 29-year-old had travelled on the train from her home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to stay over with friend Fay Trezise in Reading, Berkshire, on January 17, the inquest heard. Miss Trezise told the inquest in a statement that they had gone out for dinner and had four cocktails before returning to her flat and drinking vodka together. She then told how her friend became 'paralytic' and she put her to bed, only to find her slumped up against the bedroom door the following morning. 'I was shaking her, saying her name repeatedly but I got no response,'  Miss Trezise said. 'I then realised her skin was cold to the touch. I called my mum for advice because she is a doctor and she said, 'call 999 straight away,' The paramedics gave me the awful news that Amy had died.' Weeks earlier Miss Ratnett had given the interview about her battle with mental health problems and her bid to raise public awareness with a blog she had started. She talked about self-poisoning - taking mini-overdoses regularly - and told Cosmopolitan: 'I had no idea self-poisoning was a thing, I thought I was the only one doing it. 'But now, through my blog, I receive at least one email every week from young women telling me they're thinking of taking a mini-overdose. And I tell them not to - the risks are too high.' Tributes: Miss Radnett was described as charismatic and brave, but her heartbroken father Paul told the inquest that 'she just wanted to be normal' She had been making marked improvements in the months before her death, according to mental health experts. However, she was still taking a heavy mix of anti-depressants and sleeping pills when she went out drinking on the eve of her death. Her devastated father Paul told the coroner: 'She just wanted to be normal.' The inquest heard Miss Ratnett was still taking the anti-depressant fluoxetine, olanzapine, which is used to treat schizophrenia, zopiclone for insomnia, and diazepam for anxiety. A pathologist concluded the drugs proved fatal when mixed with alcohol, causing her vital organs to shut down while she slept. Peter Bedford, the Berkshire coroner, said: 'Effectively, alcohol has caused her to become unconscious. She would never have woken up.' Miss Ratnett's parents, Paul and Diane, were present at the inquest in Reading but did not comment afterwards.","Amy Ratnett, 29, 'self-poisoned' for years but stopped and helped others .

"By . Martin Robinson . and Lizzie Edmonds . On trial: Paramedic Christopher Bridger is accused of raping one woman and groping four others after gaining their trust by claiming he was gay . A paramedic told a female student he is alleged to have raped he 'didn't want to be gay' moments after he attacked her, a court today heard. Christopher Bridger is accused of raping one student and fondling four others after gaining their trust by telling them he was homosexual. It is alleged he carried out two of the attacks while he studied at St George's University Hospital in London and the other three were while he worked for South East Coast Ambulance Service. Today in court, one woman told how the 25-year-old said he 'just wanted to fancy girls' after he had raped her in his student bedroom. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Bridger started crying after he had carried out the attack. 'I asked him why he was crying,' she said in her video interview played to the jury. 'He said he was sorry. He doesn't want to be gay. 'His family won't accept he's gay and he just wanted to fancy girls.' Bridger, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, . denies one count of rape, two of assault by penetration, three of sexual . assault and one of causing a person to engage in a sexual activity . without consent, between September 2009 and October 2012. Earlier in court, Caroline Carberry, prosecuting, told the . jury at Guildford Crown Court: 'Christopher Bridger is a sexual predator . and confidence trickster who used the cover or ruse of pretending to be . gay in order to befriend and become close to, and then take advantage . of young female friends and colleagues when they were at their most . vulnerable.' The jury then heard how Bridger had attacked the woman after a fresher's week party when he accompanied her back to their halls of residence in September or October 2008 after she had got 'very drunk' and became upset. The court heard he began by cuddling her in his bed, before he started kissing her despite her asking him to stop. He then allegedly raped her. 'Finally he did stop and she said that he started crying and she felt she had to comfort him even though she knew he was in the wrong,' Mrs Carberry said. 'He told her he said he wanted to like girls and was having problems with his family'. The alleged victim told a friend who shouted at Bridger and the court heard that he later apologised to her. Mrs Carberry said that in February or March 2009, the same woman who had shouted at Bridger had got drunk with friends in her kitchen and texted him saying he was missing a good night while at work. Bridger allegedly arrived and attacked her as she was laid in bed, despite repeatedly telling him to stop. The court heard the woman began having panic attacks and left the university hospital at the end of the year. Three more women made allegations of sex attacks after he began working at the South East Coast Ambulance NHS Service. One, a lesbian, accused him of attacking her in a hotel room after she had got drunk at a work Christmas party in December 2011. Her partner told police that they had gone to their shared room after she got very drunk and had argued. Her partner began recording her on her phone to show her what she was like when drunk the next day. The court heard Bridger turned up and insisted he stay to make sure the woman was alright. 'She went into the bathroom and the phone was still recording and it picks up what Bridger said to (the alleged victim),' said Mrs Carberry. 'She was so drunk or asleep that she is almost incapable of speech. 'The defendant can be heard moving her along the bed and telling her that he loves her more than she will ever know. When she slurs to him that she is asleep, he can be heard to kiss her.' Allegations: Guildford Crown Court (pictured) heard that Bridger repeatedly attacked colleagues or students when they were extremely drunk and 'incapable of speech' The court heard that he left to speak to the woman's partner, at which point the recording stopped, before going to bed in between the two of them. The woman woke up to find Bridger abusing her and eventually she managed to wake her partner. 'She saw Bridger become agitated and he said they had kissed and touched each other,' said Mrs Carberry. The next day he was said to have sent messages apologising to his alleged victim. A hospital receptionist who had known Bridger claimed he attacked her in June 2012 after a night out when she went back to his home for a few drinks. She fell asleep in bed with him but awoke to find him trying to kiss her and later taking her trousers off. His final alleged victim said he groped her after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in September or October 2012. The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay. After the incidents were reported to the South East Coast Ambulance Service, Bridger was suspended, pending an internal investigation. Despite being told not to contact any of the alleged victims, he left a voicemail message with the final complainant on Christmas morning 2012. She handed the message to her supervisor. Mrs Carberry said: 'In that recording, his tone was threatening and he was full of self-pity, completely different to his tone when he was later arrested by police.' Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling police he was a gay man who had had several same sex relationships. He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student. He claimed he had fallen asleep with an arm on the lesbian complainant in the same bed as her partner, awoken and went to his room. The court heard he could provide no explanation for what he apologised to the woman for or the phone recording. Bridger claimed to have had consensual sex with the first student and penultimate colleague alleged victim, while also claiming to have fallen asleep with an arm on the last alleged victim chronologically. He said the second alleged student victim had tried to come onto him while drunk but he had 'been her knight in shining armour' and looked after her. The trial, before Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith, is expected to last two weeks.

"By . Martin Robinson . The 'Canterbury Cannibal' Dale Bolinger was an idol to a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape, murder and the 'eating to death' of women. But his obsession with consuming human flesh and death started as a six-year-old and may have been strengthened by the death of his son, Martin, as a one-year-old baby. The 57-year-old, who was today found guilty of grooming a girl for sex online, told his trial that his fetish was also driven by anger towards his domineering mother, who made drunken passes at him while he was a teenager. The father-of-four, who was married for more than 30 years, had a secret double life as 'meatmarketman', a stalwart user of the sinister Dark Fetish Network where he got pleasure from fantasising about the most sickening crimes. Investigation: Dale Bolinger, pictured with a snake draped around his shoulders, was arrested after his  connection to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case emerged, which revealed how he was at the centre of a worldwide network of men obsessed with the rape, murder and eating of women . His closest confident was the 'Cannibal Cop' Gilberto Valle, who was convicted of plotting to kidnap, murder and eat women, although this verdict was later overturned. The pair bonded as they discussed a joint plan to kidnap a schoolgirl 'slut' in America. Bolinger . had regularly boasted he had eaten the 'sweet' flesh of a white child . and a black woman, but when arrested said these claims were 'jokes' and . 'all a fantasy'. He . maintained his perversion 'never went beyond the chat room' but later . it emerged he had set up a meeting with a German 14-year-old he planned . to slice up and eat. Bolinger began having fantasies about cannibalism at the age of six and would daydream at nursery about girls being taken to the kitchen to be cooked and eaten. 'By the time I got to 14, I turned into the villain of the piece and I wondered what it would be like to eat a girl,' he had said. He blamed his 'very domineering' and 'weird' mother for his behaviour, particularly because she made drunken sexual advances towards him when he was a teenager. Bolinger's U.S. Air Force father was absent, so he says he was suppressed by his mother. His cannibalism fetish 'was less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger', he said. 'I think it was more to do with disliking my mother more than hating women.' He trained as a nurse at the The Princess Alexandra School of Nursing in 1979, later working on the cardiac ward in Margate. He married his wife Rosemary in Stepney east London and they were together until two years ago. They had four children, . including a boy called Martin who had died before the age of one. Bolinger told his trial that his sexual fantasies were limited to cartoons of cannibalism, but these led him to the Dark Fetish Network where he spoke to people 'willing to accept anything'. Gilberto Valle, who could have faced life in prison, was acquitted of kidnapping conspiracy charges, the most serious count he faced . Evidence: Emails and message exchanged between Dale Bolinger, 57, a NYPD police officer Gilberto Valle, 28, where they discussed their fantasies to abduct women and cook them in the oven or on a spit . Desires: Both men talk about who they would eat and meatmarketman said the meat of black women is 'very very good' He . claimed he would say things to try to shock the people he was chatting . and enjoyed how people came to him for advice where he claimed he would . fabricate gruesome stories about eating women and children. He . told the jury: 'Initially, I was looking to find people with like minds . and to see where they came from, but it soon spiralled down into trying . to shock people'. It was there he got to know Gilberto Valle, who he spoke to regularly when he was not working for the NHS on the Kent coast. An email in Bolinger's name said he would be happy to fly to Valle to help him kill and butcher a . woman, offering to bring anaesthetic gas and a meat cleaver. Valle . responded that he had 'measured the oven' and would cook her after they . hit her over the head with a baseball bat and kept her 'naked...trussed . and gagged' in the boot on the drive from Maryland to the police . officer's home in New York. The nurse's plan was uncovered by the FBI - who found him posting about murder, rape and cannibalism on a site called Dark Fetish Network. The organisation then alerted British police who arrested the man last year . The . Canterbury resident had egged on his American associate, also using the . alias Moody Blues, and even recommended eating a victim alive, saying . 'I think of it as eating her to death.' By . kidnapping and eating a variety of women they could evade capture, . unlike the Yorkshire Ripper, he added, saying, 'Girls go missing all the . time'. But it never . happened because Bolinger, who also called himself Christopher Collins, . said: 'I've been let down before, that's why I tend to work alone.' However, they still chatted before and after work about their fantasies of cutting living victims' feet off and barbecuing them . before their eyes. Feet meat was a delicacy, Bolinger claimed. When . Valle suggested a particular woman as a victim. Moody Blues said he . would like her liver 'lightly cooked to keep it sweet and tender'. Valle replied: 'I'm dying to taste some girl meat.' Moody Blues responded: 'The meat isn't quite like pork, but very ""meaty"" ... I've eaten a black woman and a white person'. The . English cannibalism enthusiast also bragged about his own eating . habits, spelling out a recipe for 'human haggis' using lungs and stomach . and how he used the fat . from female breasts to make Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes. Their transatlantic relationship ended last year when Valle was arrested. His trial heard that among his intended victims were his . wife and other acquaintances, one a New York primary school teacher. Valle insisted to his British correspondent he was . serious about his plans and also discussed them with other Americans and a butcher in India who said there was an oven to cook . Valle's wife in in Pakistan. In March 2013 he was convicted of plotting to kidnap, murder and eat women and also was found guilty of accessing a national crime database. He was told he faced life in prison and had served 21 months when a federal judge overturned his conviction for a plot to kidnap, kill and eat young women because he believed it was 'role-play'. Judge Paul Gardephe ruled that insufficient evidence to support the conviction and his 'Internet communications . about kidnapping are fantasy'. It led to Valle apologising for his views, but reiterated the argument of his legal team that 'ugly thoughts' are not a crime. New York City police officer Gilberto Valle was charged with plotting to kidnap, rape, torture and cook women alive before eating them - but a judge overturned his conviction because he believed it was all a fantasy . Warped: The websites visited by Valle contained images of women with apples in their mouths . During the trial FBI agents had alerted British police to the internet exchanges between Valle and his friend Bolinger. He was arrested at the Kent hospital where he worked . and police found photographs of him posing with the axe on his computer. Police searched the 57-year-old suspect's garden sheds and started digging in his garden. Bolinger was released on bail and returned to his rented £100,000 end-of-terrace former council . house to find the international press at his gate. Asked if he had plotted to murder and eat his victims he said: 'I do deny them. None of this is real. It is all fantasy. I have . spoken to the police and they are undertaking inquiries.' He . added: 'It was my stupidity. Because of going online and saying stupid . things and putting stupid things about, thinking that it was funny.' This month his trial started at Canterbury Crown Court and heard how he planned to to kill and eat a 14-year-old girl as he groomed her for sex online. Haunting:  Bolinger sent this selfie showing him posing with an axe which to a 14-year-old he wanted to have sex with, kill and eat . Dale Bolinger's home in Canterbury, Kent, where police began digging up his garden and in a search for clues . In September 2012, he exchanged messages with a girl called ‘Eva Gonza’, whose true identity has never been discovered. The pair agreed to meet at  Ashford International rail station, Kent, but the teenager did not appear, the court was told. Bolinger told officers he would have called police and social services if the girl had turned up and He denied sexually grooming a child. His arrest and trial cost him his family life, after he split with his wife in 2012 after 32 years of marriage. The director of a company linked to the disability charity Scope, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy 15 years ago. She has long lobbied for . better access for the disabled, even appearing on Radio 4 and in . newspapers, as well as pressing Gordon Brown for change when he was . premier. Speaking at the . former marital home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, she said: 'I don't know . anything about the arrest. We are separated. I haven't seen him for over . a year. He is my husband in law only'.","Dale Bolinger, 57, GUILTY of grooming a girl he thought was 14 online .

"By . Martin Robinson . The bloodshed on Downing Street after David Cameron's extraordinary reshuffle today left Sky News' political editor so open-mouthed he swallowed a fly live on air. Adam Boulton, 55, began gurgling and was then forced to stop speaking as he told how at least 13 ministers had lost their jobs or resigned. But after three seconds of choking  the veteran broadcaster swallowed down the insect and described how the Prime Minister had sacked 'stale males' and many replaced with women. Scroll down for video . Fly in the ointment: Sky News' political editor Adam Boulton began choking live on air today after a fly flew into his mouth as he described David Cameron's reshuffle . Down the hatch: After a few seconds the broadcaster looked revolted as he swallowed the insect, left, and after gasping for breath he continued with his piece . Sky presenter Dermot Murnaghan was so concerned he asked Mr Boulton whether he wanted to 'take a pause'. But he responded: 'No no no I'm fine. I swallowed a fly but that's alright'. Later he joked the fly must have come from a nearby public toilet, tweeting: 'At 50p a time you'd think @CityWestminster could maintain their stinking Whitehall Public Loos'. The incident has already gone viral, with the Mail's political editor James Chapman calling it the 'undisputed highlight of the reshuffle so far', which was retweeted by Boulton himself. Professionalism: The Sky journalist smiled when he was asked if he was okay, and said: 'No no no I'm fine. I swallowed a fly but that's alright' It is not the only extraordinary thing to happen while Mr Boulton has been broadcasting. The veteran, who has been with Sky News since it started in 1989, had a legendary row with Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell, which almost came to blows. After the 2010 election Mr Boulton had asked him whether it was in the ‘national interest’ for Gordon Brown to spend four more years ‘limping on’ as Prime Minister. Mr Campbell retorted that Mr Boulton was obviously ‘upset’ that David Cameron had not been elected Prime Minister. An angry Mr Boulton then starting yelling: ‘I am not upset. I’m fed up with you telling me what I think'.","The veteran journalist starting spluttering when insect flew into his mouth .

"By . Martin Robinson . Victim: Author Alex Wheatle says a paedophile ring targeted the children's home he was in in the 1980s, but abuse was covered up when it was linked to a Labour MP . An MP in Tony Blair's government was part of a paedophile ring which infiltrated a council children's home where an award winning author was abused in care, it was claimed today. Alex Wheatle, 51, said he was attacked at Shirley Oaks in Surrey, which took youngsters from Lambeth in south London. After moving there as a three-year-old, a doctor abused him during an appointment where he was forced to strip naked, while he said that a swimming instructor, a football coach and even staff groped and even raped boys and girls. Mr Wheatle was also beaten with hair brushes, belts and boots, because 'suffering violence was as much a part of my day as eating toast', he said. The father-of-three said that the abuse was covered up when a Labour MP was named as being an alleged member of a network of child abusers targeting the borough. Mr Wheatle, who was attacked at Shirley Oaks near Croydon in the 1980s, where the politician also visited regularly in the same period. The author, handed an MBE five years ago by the Queen, said paedophiles also targeted the South Vale centre in Lambeth, where children were assessed before being sent to Shirley Oaks. Describing his life there he told the Daily Mirror: 'We would see strange nameless men within the Shirley Oaks grounds. 'I'm convinced there was a paedophile ring operating in both South Vale and Shirley Oaks and that the authorities knew about it at the time but did nothing'. Success story: Mr Wheatle rebuilt his life, became a celebrated author and received an MBE in 2008, but says that many children who were abused could not cope with what happened to them . Mr Wheatle said he and other children feared speaking out in case they were sent 'somewhere worse', and several killed themselves after suffering unspeakable abuse. The south Londoner, who has written bestsellers including Brenton Brown and Brixton Rock, has demanded Theresa May's inquiries are 'thorough' and will go to the police himself. Yesterday it was claimed senior Tory politicians took part in drink and drug-fuelled sex parties with underage boys during seaside conferences. Former activist Anthony Gilberthorpe says he was handed cash and told to ‘fetch entertainment’ - code for young boys – by members of Margaret Thatcher’s government. But the claims were today rejected as ‘tittle-tattle’ by former Conservative minister David Mellor, who insisted those named were dead and unable to defend themselves. Westminster has been gripped by claims of an Establishment cover-up of allegations of child sex abuse over several decades. The government has appointed former High Court judge Baroness Butler-Sloss to lead a wide-ranging panel inquiry into abuse at every level of society. Former activist Anthony Gilberthorpe, left, claims he was asked to find underage boys for sex during Tory party conferences when Margaret Thatcher was leader in the early 1980s . Mr Gilberthorpe says he will give the inquiry the names of former Tory ministers, some of whom are still alive, who he claims he saw with young men at party conferences. He claims he sent a 40-page dossier to Mrs Thatcher in 1989 detailing Cabinet ministers who took part in the sex parties, but says he was warned off by a senior civil servant. He told the Sunday Mirror how boys as young as 15 were plied with alcohol and cocaine at Conservative gatherings in Blackpool and Brighton in the 1980s. He named former former-Education Secretary Keith Joseph, ex-local government minister Rhodes Boyson, and Michael Havers, the former attorney general who is the brother of Baroness Butler-Sloss. All of those Mr Gilberthorpe names are now dead.","Alex Wheatle says he and others were abused at council children's home .

"By . Martin Robinson . Police are digging up a patio in a suburban London garden today looking for human remains that may have been buried up to 30 years ago. Scotland Yard say they are excavating in Searle Place, Islington, although it is not clear whether they are investigating a murder. Detectives received information about a body in the garden in July last year and have spent 12 months attempting to corroborate the tip-off. Scroll down for video . Police probe: Detectives are digging up this patio in North London today looking for human remains . Inquiry: Scotland Yard say they have been told that a body may be in the garden of this home, but say it has nothing to do with the current owners . Forensic search: Officers started digging this morning, and have a wide range of equipment and a skip . They even spoke to people abroad before deciding to excavate the garden. One neighbour told MailOnline: 'The police turned up this morning. There are loads of them. 'They're digging up the patio for a body. It's like something from Brookside or Eastenders. It's really creepy. 'We got a letter through the door from police saying they needed to dig up a garden and it had nothing to do with people living in the house now. That's all we know.' The force said the allegations do not relate to the current homeowners or any other ongoing investigation. Specialist teams were today carrying out a 'systematic excavation' of the area but police were unable to say how long it could go on for, with the search being reviewed on a daily basis. Investigation: Police say they are carrying out a 'systematic excavation' and don't know how long it will last . Islington borough commander Gerry Campbell said: 'Detectives in Islington have carried out a thorough investigation in order to corroborate the allegations made. 'I have made the decision that it is appropriate to excavate the garden. Until the conclusion of the search it would be inappropriate of me to comment further.' Scotland Yard said the search could take a matter of days. Dismantling a shed was one the tasks being carried out by police handymen who were preparing the ground for the search. They were seen carrying out planks of wood from the back of the house. Uniformed officers were standing at the front of the house which is in a small square that is backed on to by a row of garages.","Scotland Yard spent 12 months on investigation before digging up patio .

"By . Martin Robinson . A mother waited 10 hours to go to hospital with her badly injured baby son who later died because of a violent beating inflicted by her housemate, a jury was told today. Seven-week-old Thomas Gacek suffered broken ribs and began bleeding from both eyes while his Polish mother, Katarzyna Gacek, was out shopping, but she failed to take him to A&E, a court heard. Gacek returned to their home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and she noticed a cut and bruising around her son's lip. Katarzyna Gacek, 24, of Oldham, Greater Manchester, is accused of causing or allowing the death of a child . She was told by fellow Pole, Dawid Mokrzanowski, he had fallen asleep and that Thomas must have banged his mouth on the frame of his cradle. Preston Crown Court heard the youngster was admitted to Royal Oldham Hospital  late on January 25 with multiple bruises all over his body, severe retinal bleeding in both eyes and was noted to be pale, unresponsive and having a seizure. He was transferred to Manchester Children's Hospital but was pronounced dead two days later. Prosecutor Raymond Wigglesworth QC said Thomas's body was examined by a number of medical experts including a consultant paediatrician who concluded the number of bruises - 25 different sites - were 'suggestive of inflicted injuries and are not consistent with accidental injuries to a non-mobile baby'. Gacek is accused of waiting ten hours before taking her baby son to hospital after he suffered fatal injuries . He added: 'In particular she noted that the injuries to both ears were unusual and would suggest either an impact with a hard surface or that he had been slapped across the face.' The post-mortem examination also revealed that Thomas had four fractured ribs said to have been caused in the days before he suffered the fatal head injury. Mr Wigglesworth said the expert view was that the most probable cause was non-accidental and the amount of force required would be 'considerable, even on a baby of this age'. There was also evidence of a minor bleed to the brain in the same period as the broken ribs, the jury was told. The prosecutor said Gacek, 24, came to the UK in 2010 but had no contact with Thomas's father who was unaware the child was his. Mokrzanowski, 26, lived with them and often acted as carer for her son, as did Gacek's boyfriend, Darren Butterfield, 35, a frequent visitor to the address. Mr Wigglesworth said: 'The prosecution say that up to and including the health visitor's examination of Thomas on January 17 he was a healthy, growing baby with no medical problems. 'We know at some stage between January 22 and January 25 someone within that household unlawfully caused injury to Thomas either by striking him or squeezing him, causing four fractures to the ribs on the left side of his body.' On January 25, Gacek left the baby in the house with Mokrzanowski at 9am and did not return until 1pm, the jury heard. Seven-week-old Thomas Gacek was taken to Manchester Children's Hospital, pictured, but was pronounced dead two days later . She found Thomas in a rocker in the downstairs bedroom of her compatriot who was asleep and when she confronted him about the injuries to his face he told her it must have been an accident. Butterfield later arrived at the house just after 2pm, said Mr Wigglesworth. All three defendants initially told medics and police that Gacek was alone in the house all day and she accidentally tripped on the stairs, dropped her son and then fell on him. Each later changed their accounts but the prosecutor said the jury was entitled to ask whey they had told 'a pack of lies'. Mr Wigglesworth said: 'Why did the three defendants agree to lie about what happened to Thomas? Was it because they feared the Social Services coming in asking questions or was there some other motive for shielding the truth from the hospital staff and police?' It emerged that Gacek and Mokrzanowski made a number of Google searches in the hours before Thomas was taken to hospital in which they inquired about head injuries to babies. Butterfield told police that during the internet searches his co-defendants were sat on the sofa with his girlfriend reading out the symptoms, including 'the baby staring in one place'. Mr Wigglesworth told the jury: 'The prosecution case against these three defendants is that they were each involved in a series of events which led to the unlawful killing of this baby.' All three defendants deny causing or allowing the death of a child. Mokrzanowski has also pleaded not guilty to manslaughter. The trial is expected to last up to three weeks.

"By . Martin Robinson . Victim: The 16-year-old accused of murdering teacher Ann Maguire has 'accepted responsibility' for her unlawful killing but will face trial in November . The sisters and brother of Ann Maguire were in court today to watch the teenager accused of her murder admit he stabbed the teacher to death in front of her class. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared via video-link at Leeds Crown Court and 'accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing'. He is accused of murdering the 61-year-old teacher at Corpus Christi Catholic College, in Leeds, in April. No pleas were entered but Richard Wright QC, defending, said: 'He has accepted responsibility for the unlawful killing of the deceased'. A trial on the murder charge is scheduled for November. The teenager appeared on two video screens in the packed courtroom and Mrs Maguire's  sisters Denise and Shelagh, and brother James watched from the public gallery. The boy was wearing an orange T-shirt with blue trousers and spoke twice - to confirm his name as the 10 minute long hearing began, and to acknowledge he understood what was happening, when the judge asked him at the end. Members of Mrs Maguire's family watched the proceedings from the public gallery. Mr Wright, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, and the judge, Judge Peter Collier QC, all sat in court without their normal robes. The court heard that expert psychiatric reports would now be prepared before the trial. Mr Wright said: 'The defendant accepts that he unlawfully killed Ann Maguire. 'The issue in the case will be whether or not a partial defence is available to him.' Mr Greaney said: 'It does not amount to an admission he is guilty of murder. It does amount to an admission he's guilty of manslaughter.' Scroll down for video . Family Ann Maguire's sisters Denise, behind, and Shelagh, front are followed by brother James into court today . Tragedy: Ann Maguire's death shocked the world and was the first time a teacher was stabbed to death in a classroom . Both the judge and Mr Greaney asked the public to be extremely careful about using social media to discuss this case and stressed there could be heavy penalties for naming the defendant or other details about the case ahead of the trial. Mrs Maguire's death was the first time a teacher has been stabbed to death in a British classroom and the first killing of a teacher in a school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre. She first went to Corpus Christi as a student teacher and last year the school held a celebration of her 40 years of service. This year, she had moved to working four days a week ahead of her planned retirement. Mrs Maguire, who was head of Year 11 at the school for more than 10 years, lived in the Moortown area of Leeds with her husband, Don, who is a former maths teacher and landscape gardener. The teenager was told he will appear again for a hearing on September 26. He was remanded in custody.

"By . Martin Robinson . Thief: Paul Leighton stole £250,000 from his opera house employer and spent it on cars, holidays and even a Manchester United season ticket . A 'greedy' finance director stole £250,000 from an opera house run with charitable donations and spent it on luxury cars, holidays and even a Manchester United season ticket. Paul Leighton, 48, began defrauding the Buxton Opera House in Derbyshire five days after starting work there and spent a year siphoning cash into his own account. He then blew the money on his lavish lifestyle and servicing his debts but was caught when unpaid suppliers complained to a colleague while he was away on another holiday. After discovering the huge hole in their accounts The High Peak Theatre Trust, which runs the opera house, called in the police. Leighton was jailed for two years at Derby Crown Court yesterday. Prosecutor Sarah Slater said after starting his job he transferred £7,000 into his account, followed by a further £25,000 just a few days later, . Leighton then set up a regular payment direct into his own account which he hid under the title 'payment ledger three'. Between April 2012 and June 2013, he took a total of £244, 515.31. The last transaction was on June 24, five days before the thefts were discovered. 'It wasn't sophisticated, he was simply paying amounts into his personal account,' added Ms Slater. As a result of the thefts the theatre lost £50,000 in Arts Council funding and the trust was concerned it may not survive. Ms Slater said: 'A lot of people in the community rely upon the opera house in the Buxton area.' Leighton, of Sale, Greater Manchester, who had no previous convictions, had earlier admitted fraud. Sara Haque, defending, told the court the case had cost her client everything. Before starting work at the opera house, he had decided to become self employed but it didn't work out, leaving him in debt, she said. 'The consequence was that at the time he began employment with Buxton Opera House he was in significant debt. He received a repossession order for the family house in February 2012.' On the edge: Leighton's fraud left the Buxton Opera House, which is funded by charity, on the brink of going bust . He told his wife it was a misunderstanding and once he started work at the theatre, he began to steal in order to pay off his mortgage arrears and avoid having his house repossessed, Ms Haque said. But he couldn't stop and became 'greedy', she added. 'He simply said once he paid off the debts, he would stop and then he found he couldn't. He began gambling in order to try and win the money back, but of course it couldn't be done.' Sentencing him, Recorder Stephen Linehan QC, said: 'In 2012 you were employed as finance manager for the High Peak Trust who run the famous Buxton Opera House and as such you were given total control of finances. 'To do that you had access to the online banking system you had the passwords for that system and you were able to pay out at will. 'Within a few days of starting there you began to use your power to enrich yourself. You continued taking money until you had transferred just short of a quarter of million pounds in a period just under 12 months.' The judge said he accepted the crimes began to pay off mounting debts, but he added that the evidence showed he then started using the cash to find a lifestyle way beyond his means. 'This was a gross breach of trust. It is not a rich organisation. You could not do what you did without causing serious financial damage and you knew it.' Buxton Opera House was built in 1903 when the Derbyshire town was a popular spa and resort for Victorian holidaymakers. It was designed by Frank Matcham, who later drew up the plans for the London Palladium.","Paul Leighton, 48, siphoned off charity cash meant for Buxton Opera House .

"By . Martin Robinson . Fixers willing to fake payslips and bank statements for cash are helping desperate househunters secure out-of-reach mortgages, an undercover investigation revealed today. Bablu Khan was secretly filmed agreeing to pretend to be a homebuyer's employer and produce bogus documents for £400. Khan bragged that he was doing the same for at least four people every day as banks become more strict on how much Britons can borrow and as prices, especially in London, go through the roof. Scroll down for video . Denouement: This is the moment Bablu Khan was confronted by journalists after he had offered them fraudulent documents to help secure an out-of-reach mortgage . Deal: In return for £400 Khan said he would produce fake payslips like this one proving that the mortgage applicant worked for him . Investigative journalist Paul Connolly exposed him for the Channel 5 series Black Market Britain: Undercover Sting. Khan, who advertised himself on Gumtree, showed him fake letters of employment and backdated payslips he would use to 'prove' that he earned a larger salary and would transfer money into his account so the back were not suspicious. It is getting harder to secure a mortgage with banks demanded more paperwork and evidence of spending before agreeing to lend. In June house prices surged to another new record high of £188,903 in June as they jumped nearly £20,000 in just a year. In the footage, to be shown in the series that starts tomorrow evening, Khan says: 'I can show you that you are working for us. I can fill this form, send a P46 and fax to Inland Revenue tomorrow morning and I can show that you are working with me backdated. Tomorrow morning (I can) give you three months’ payslips.' He adds: 'Bank will give you straight away the money' (sic). He boasts: 'In this country you need to use your brain otherwise you are working hard, hard, hard.' Pledge: The fraudster promised lenders would never learn the journalist was cheating the system because he could produce back-dated payslips showing he earned at least £30,000 . Changing hands: The documents worked for at least four people a day the con artist said, making him at least £5,000 a week . On the run: As soon as he was confronted Khan fled the scene refusing to face the fact he had been breaking the law . He even hinted that lenders were in on his scam saying: 'I have a thousand lenders I know so I can call them, provide them with all of this and they can give you the mortgage. 'If you go the straight way, they’ll not give it to you… I can go… to the interview and we can talk in the restaurant. Anything you need, he can tell me and paperwork – I can get it for you. 'When everything is ready… you can go to the bank and he’ll tell you which branch is better and who to ask for. If everything is done you can give him £200 in his pocket.' But after being handed the fake documents, the undercover reporters turn the tables on the fraudster and confront him with their real identities. They then chased him down the street but according to Black Market Britain producers he refused to answer any questions. Paul Connolly said: 'I was amazed at how busy he claimed to be and how much money he said he was making. But he was incredibly casual about what he’s doing. 'Anyone tempted to go with someone like him could end up saddled with a loan or mortgage they couldn’t afford. 'He seemed to think he was invincible – but we showed him, and now we’ll show the viewers, that he was far from untouchable.' He added: 'I've got a dossier of evidence about this guy. If police want to pursue this, they know where I am.' The first in the series of Black Market Britain: Undercover Sting will be broadcast on Channel 5 at 8pm on July 10, 2014.

"By . Sam Webb . Two luxury homes squeezed onto a plot in exclusive Sandbanks in Poole Harbour, Dorset,meant for one have gone up for sale for £13million - three times the value of the former property. A three bedroom house occupied the 3,000 square metre site  until it was bought for £4.25million and then promptly demolished. A development company decided to eke out every square inch of the plot by splitting it in two and building a pair of four-storey beachfront houses worth £6.5million each. They each boast en-suite bedrooms, indoor swimming pools, balconies, lifts to all floors, direct beach access and magnificent sea views. They are being sold either individually or as a pair should a wealthy buyer wish to live in one and rent out the other. Alternatively, they may appeal to a wealthy couple who want 'his and her' homes. It is thought the developers have spent more than three million pounds building them. Scroll down for video . Double vision: These two properties - worth £6.5million each - are being built on a single plot of land bought for £4.25million in exclusive Sandbanks in Poole, Dorset . Snapped up: A view of the two properties from the road. The homes are nearing completion and are estimated to have cost £3million to build . Property in Sandbanks, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', is so sought-after developers are buying single plots and turning them into multiple residences . Tom Doyle, of estate agents Lloyds Property Group which is selling both properties, said: 'Development opportunities are becoming scarcer on Sandbanks and so prices for older houses are going up. 'Developers need to maximise the space available in order to make money. It is becoming harder to financially justify building one home on a plot and so we are now seeing two homes appear. 'Although a lot of the plots are quite deep you can't spread out or go beyond the existing building line so you have build upwards as much as the planning authorities will allow. 'Both these properties are built over four levels, with the bedrooms on the upper two floors. 'They are very much high end in terms of their quality. I can see these appealing to middle-age professionals who want them as a second home.' Beauty: The plot as seen from the air. By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London . The property before development began. It was in the 1960s that the peninsula first underwent a property boom . Property in Sandbanks, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', is so sought-after developers are buying single plots and turning them into multiple residences. One of them built two 16ft wide detached houses just 10 inches apart on a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre, replacing a single home that stood on the same site. Despite the homes being smaller than many other homes in the sought-after community the developers managed to fit three bedrooms, three bathrooms, an open plan kitchen, living room and a basement for storage into each of the 840sq ft properties, which also have their own driveways. The properties, named Tom and Jerry, were designed and built by Seven Developments, owned by former AFC Bournemouth chairman Eddie Mitchell, and have gone up for sale with an asking price of £745,000 each. Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property. By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs boasts the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Wasteland: The site after it was cleared ready for development. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million on the peninsula . Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century. Now it has turned into a Millionaires' Row, filled with luxury beachfront mansions . Sandbanks's popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. A developer built two 16ft wide detached houses just 10 inches apart on a plot that measures just a tenth of an acre, replacing a single home that stood on the same site . Before: The two three-bedroom homes have been built on this single plot once occupied by a simple bungalow . In May a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. Earlier this year a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' reputation has continued to grow. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie.

"By . Martin Robinson . One of Tulisa Contostavlos' friends today admitted supplying cocaine to an undercover reporter as the former X Factor judge went on trial for allegedly setting up the drug deal. Michael Coombs, also known as rapper Mike GLC, pleaded guilty to supplying the Class A drug when he appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court alongside the former N-Dubz star.

"By . Sam Webb . Helen Corbett flung boiling water at her boyfriend's groin during a row when she accused him of sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal . A mother threw a kettle of boiling water at her boyfriend’s groin after accusing him of having an affair - with her daughter. Helen Corbett, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, missed 46-year-old Peter Bailey’s genitals with the searing liquid but caused serious burns to his thighs which left his skin peeling off. Newcastle Crown Court heard the 45-year-old mother had heard rumours Mr Bailey was sleeping with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal. Prosecutor Neil Pallister told the court: 'The defendant was angry with him because she believed he had slept with her 24-year-old daughter Crystal. 'He doesn’t say whether or not that was the case. He was in the doorway, she was shouting at him ""have you slept with my daughter"". 'He heard the kettle click. 'She said ""I will show you how mad I am"", picked up the kettle, and threw boiling water towards him. 'He recalls she was aiming for his groin.' The court heard Mr Bailey suffered a large burn to his left thigh, which he reported to the police a few days later. Mr Pallister said: 'Officers described the skin having peeled off and there were clearly scalds or burns.' The court heard he needed nurses at the house twice per week to change his dressings. In a victim impact statement Mr Bailey said: 'I cannot believe what Helen did to me. 'Since the incident I have been in a great deal of pain, I have struggled to sleep, I have flashbacks of what she did. 'I loved Helen, although we had our ups and downs. I didn’t expect her to do that to me. 'Helen hurt me, both physically and emotionally. Every time I see my scar I think about what she did. 'It will be a lifelong reminder.' Corbett, formerly of Birtley, Gateshead, admitted causing grievous bodily harm. Sue Hirst, defending, said Corbett met Mr Bailey after her partner died in 2011. Newcastle Crown Court heard Mr Bailey has embarked upon, or did embark upon, a relationship with her daughter for some weeks after she went into custody . Miss Hirst said: 'In the weeks leading up to this she became concerned about Mr Bailey’s behaviour around her daughter. 'Whatever the reality of it in the lead up to this incident, that was her suspicion and that is what she was questioning him about on the day this incident occurred. 'She asks him if something had been going on, he denied it, she accepts she lost her temper and threw the water at him. 'While she has been in custody Mr Bailey has embarked upon, or did embark upon, a relationship with her daughter for some weeks. 'It is no longer happening, but there was clearly a huge amount of distress for Miss Corbett to be in that position.' The court heard Corbett has spent five months behind bars on remand. Judge John Evans granted her bail to live at an address in Sunderland so she can be assessed for an alcohol treatment programme. Corbett said from the dock: 'I have learned by being in prison.' She will be back in court to be sentenced on August 19. Judge Evans told her: 'This was a serious offence, it did cause serious injury and whatever the history, what you did could never be justified, I think you know that.'","Helen Corbett, 45, flung scalding liquid at Peter Bailey, 46, during row .

"By . Sam Webb . Dr Tasnim Arif failed to assess Harry Connelly's condition, it was said. He died three days after being sent home from hospital . A doctor sent a 19-month-old boy home from hospital three days before he died of dehydration and kidney failure, a tribunal heard today. Baby Harry Connelly was admitted to Northampton General Hospital suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea on April 28, 2011. But despite the concerns of his mother Lucy, paediatrician Dr Tasnim Arif failed to weigh Harry, take blood tests or properly assess the baby’s condition before sending them home, it is alleged. Little Harry was found dead in his cot by his father Raymond three days later in the early hours of May 1, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. At an inquest in 2012 Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by doctors and nurses at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service. Dr Arif is now facing a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester accused of allowing her care of Harry to fall ‘seriously below’ what was expected. Opening the case, Simon Phillips QC, for the General Medical Council, explained how Harry fell ill at his home on  April 23 2011 and was referred to the hospital by the family GP three days later. The boy was examined by paediatrician Dr Farhana Shamim, who said he was not dehydrated, but recommended that he be given Dioralyte, a rehydration treatment to boost salt and sugar levels. He was discharged the following morning by Dr Ayevbekpen Omorgie, who said the parents could have a ‘48-hour open access’ to the ward, meaning he would not need a referral to be seen again. At around 3.30pm on 28 April Harry was brought back to hospital by his mother after his parents felt his condition had deteriorated . Mr Phillips said: ‘The clinical treatment provided by Dr Arif to Harry Connelly on this date is the focus of attention in relation to this fitness to practise hearing.’ It is alleged that the doctor failed to fully record that Harry was still passing blood in his stool, that he had not eaten for five days or that he was lethargic, as Mrs Connelly had told her. Dr Arif, who was then a fourth-year specialist trainee paediatric registrar, has admitted that she failed to record how often Harry was passing stool and vomiting and did not ask for further clarity on the subject. The medic also confessed to not comparing his current weight to his weight when he was previously discharged on April 27. But she denies failing to adequately assess or record a number of clinical features when assessing the baby’s hydration status, including the overall summary of ‘well hydrated’ or ‘not well hydrated’. Harry Connelly's parents Raymond and Lucy begged for their son to be kept in hospital . Dr Arif is further accused of failing to arrange a longer assessment period, not arranging the duty consultant to review Harry’s clinical status and failing to arrange for blood tests, as the consultant had asked. The panel heard that Dr Arif did not think Harry was dehydrated before she discharged him at around 5.45pm on the afternoon of 28 April. The next day Harry’s condition had deteriorated again, to such an extent that his parents described him as ‘lifeless’. Grandmother Val Faulkner rang the hospital, but was told by a nurse they should take the toddler to their GP or accident and emergency. After phoning the GP out-of-hours service, the family spoke to Dr Mary McCracken who said they should bring him in to the out-of-hours service as he may be suffering from dehydration. At the out of hours service, Harry was examined by Dr Aboo Thamby who assessed that he was not dehydrated and did not need to be readmitted. At an inquest in 2012 Coroner Anne Pember catalogued a series of ‘failings’ by doctors and nurses at the hospital and a GP’s out-of-hours service . By 30 April Harry’s parents reported that he was ‘brighter’ but his fingers and toes were very cold. ‘Very sadly Harry Connolly died at home in the early hours of 1 May 2011,’ Mr Phillips said. He added: ‘The GMC’s position is that Dr Arif should have exercised a greater degree of caution when deciding the appropriate course of action towards Harry Connelly and when discharging him. ‘In regard to the care provided at the time, the GMC’s position is that the standard of care provided by Dr Arif fell seriously below that expected of a registrar.’ It is alleged that the doctor’s actions and omissions amounted to professional misconduct. Dr Arif spoke only to confirm her name and GMC registration number at today’s hearing, but her representative Andrew Hockton made several factual admissions on her behalf. If the three-person panel finds against her she could face sanctions including restrictions on her practise, suspension or being struck off the medical register. The hearing continues tomorrow.","Harry Connelly, 19 months, died from dehydration and kidney failure .

"By . Martin Robinson . A teacher is in hospital after he was beaten in the head and face with a hammer during a carjacking carried out in front of his students. Police are hunting for two masked men who battered Richard Knee, 41, in the car park at Kenilworth School and Sixth Form in Warwickshire yesterday afternoon.

"By . Sam Webb . The house where schoolgirl April Jones was believed to be murdered is set to be razed to the ground. The Welsh Government has bought the detached cottage in Ceinws, near Machynlleth, mid Wales, where child killer Mark Bridger took the five-year-old. Since the 2012 killing, the property has served as a grim reminder of the tragedy - with April's parents Coral and Paul leading the calls for its demolition. Scene: The house where April Jones was murdered will be torn down by the Welsh government after her parents pleaded for the heart-breaking reminder of their tragedy to go . Murder: Bridger, 48, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth on October 1, 2012 . A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'After discussions with the family, the Welsh Government has purchased the property connected to death of April Jones. 'The Welsh Government will now work with the local authority, the Jones family and the local community for the most appropriate future for the site - following demolition of the the property.' It is believed the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay have brokered a deal worth £149,000 with the owner of the cottage - which was rented by Bridger. The price paid is thought to be the 2008 market value of the house. April's parents Coral and Paul led the calls for the house to be demolished . Bridger, 48, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth on October 1, 2012. Detectives believe the former lifeguard dismembered the primary school pupil's body at his rented cottage before going on to dispose of her remains at numerous locations around the countryside. News that the house has been bought by the Welsh Government has been welcomed by April's family. A statement by her parents on Facebook read: 'This is a huge weight off our minds. 'The loss of our beautiful daughter was bad enough, but the house has been a constant reminder of the tragic events. 'Our family want to thank the Welsh Government for listening to us and for understanding our need to see the house demolished.'","House where April died has stood empty since brutal 2012 murder .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Sam Webb . A private school teacher has been arrested after the teenage girl was allegedly spotted hiding under a blanket in his car. John Wunderle, a maths teacher at the £15,000-a-year Bancroft's School in Essex, was already on bail after being accused of grooming the girl for six months and was arrested in May. But he was detained again when he allegedly attempted to drive off with a youngster in Woodford Green, north east London on Friday after the girl was seen in his vehicle. Wunderle was a maths teacher at the private Bancroft's School in Essex, pictured, but has now resigned . The 34-year-old, who is said to weigh 20 stone, has now been remanded in custody by magistrates and faces four allegations dating back to March of this year. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a man was arrested on Friday for breaching bail conditions and subsequently appeared at Redbridge Magistrates on Saturday. Wunderle had already quit his job at the school, where he has worked for the last six years, before the alleged offences. The school is described as an independent day school and caters for pupils aged seven to 18. It is believed he earns more than £40,000 in his job at the school but he had recently been living with his mother. Wunderle was remanded in custody after appearing at Redbridge Magistrates Court, pictured, on Saturday . Headteacher at the school, Mary Ireland said: '(Wunderle) had already resigned and had a job somewhere else. 'That was a couple of months before (the arrest) and he was working through his notice. As soon as we were made aware of the allegation we immediately contacted the LADO (Local authority designated officer, a council official acting to safeguard children). 'As soon as we contacted the authorities they took over until the police investigation was complete. 'The school couldn't take any disciplinary measures and he was suspended on full pay. We've continued to co-operate and we are trying to support the family of the girl involved at the same time.' She said Wunderle's resignation had nothing to do with any inappropriate behaviour towards the girl. The Good Schools Guide gave Bancroft's a glowing report in the 2013 edition, stating: 'A splendid school, catering for bright children and those who will seize opportunities. Deservedly over-subscribed. Brings glory to Essex well beyond its immediate catchment.' He is expected to appear at Snaresbrook Crown Court later this month.

"By . Sam Webb . A British Embassy convoy in Libya has come under fire in an attempted carjacking, as Britons were urged to leave the country immediately. Embassy staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred this morning between Tripoli and Zawiya, a city in northwestern Libya. Michael Aron, the UK's ambassador to Libya, wrote on Twitter: 'There was an attempted carjacking on a British Embassy convoy this morning. Shots were fired at our vehicles but all staff safe.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated its travel advice to state: 'British nationals in Libya should leave now by commercial means.' Violent: Embassy staff escaped unscathed from the attack which occurred this morning. In this photograph from Saturday, fighters from the Islamist Misarata brigade fire towards Tripoli airport in an attempt to wrest control from a powerful rival militia, in Tripoli, Libya . The battle for control of Tripoli's international airport began two weeks ago when Islamist-led militias launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan.  On Saturday, the U.S. evacuated its diplomats in Tripoli to neighboring Tunisia and shut its embassy . The United States closed its embassy yesterday and safely evacuated its diplomats by road to neighbouring Tunisia, escorted by F-16 fighter jets. Mr Aron said the attempted carjacking occurred between the capital Tripoli and Zawiya, which is en route to the Tunisian border. The British Embassy remains open but with reduced staff and a limited ability to provide consular assistance. The FCO warned about the 'greater intensity of fighting' in Tripoli and the likelihood of further attacks on foreigners. There are believed to be between 100 and 300 Britons in the north African country. Tripoli International Airport was closed a fortnight ago following clashes between armed groups nearby. Michael Aron, the UK's ambassador to Libya, wrote on Twitter: 'There was an attempted carjacking on a British Embassy convoy this morning. Shots were fired at our vehicles but all staff safe' A number of foreigners have been shot dead in Libya since December and further attacks are expected. There is a high threat of terrorism, and several foreigners have been kidnapped this year. The FCO warned: 'Violent clashes between armed groups are possible across the country, including in Tripoli, particularly at night. 'Fighting can break out in many places and at short notice. It can become serious quickly putting those in the area at risk. You should remain vigilant at all times. 'Keep a low profile and try to limit travelling around as much as possible, particularly at night. There is a high threat from crime.' Libya is now witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Colonel Gaddafi's regime was toppled, with US, UK and French military support. Gaddafi died in 2011 after rebels caught up with his convoy in Sirte. Evacuated: The entrance to the US embassy in Libya in seen here in a May 13, 2009 file photo. Staffers and Marines were evacuated on Saturday morning and taken to Tunisia . Smoke rises in Tripoli on Thursday July 24 . In Tripoli, the militias are fighting mostly for control of the airport. They are on the government's payroll since authorities have depended on them to restore order. The battle in Tripoli began earlier this month when Islamist-led militias — mostly from the western city of Misrata — launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan. On Monday, a $113 million Airbus A330 passenger jet for Libya's state-owned Afriqiyah Airways was destroyed in the fighting. The rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Gaddafi rebels, have forced a weeklong closure of gas stations and government offices. In recent days, armed men have attacked vehicles carrying money from the Central Bank to local banks, forcing their closure. Libyan government officials and activists have increasingly been targeted in the violence. Gunmen kidnapped two lawmakers in the western suburbs of Tripoli a week ago and on Friday armed men abducted Abdel-Moaz Banoun, a well-known Libyan political activist in Tripoli, according to his father.","Gunmen fired on the diplomatic staff this morning but none were hurt .

The boy was conscious but red-faced when he was finally discovered, though complained of being hot, his grandfather, Jimmy Clevinger, said last week. EMS took the child to the Buford Volunteer Fire Department, where he was flown to Carolinas Medical Center. On Thursday, doctors told the boy's family that he wasn't responding to stimuli like they wanted but that his condition would hopefully improve. Logan lived with his parents and grandparents at the home where deputies say he slipped undetected out of the front door and into the car where he was playing with the pet, a 9-year-old basset hound/pit bull mix.

Relatives then found Logan in the locked car when they noticed the hazard lights blinking. Clevinger said the boy had learned how to unlock the car door but was unable to push it back open to get out because the weight of the door was too much.

"By . Helen Pow . Nearly twice as many delinquent youths die violent deaths when they reach adulthood than U.S. combat troops who are killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new study shows. Shockingly, delinquent girls are most at risk of dying a violent death - some five times more likely than the general female population, while their male counterparts are three times more likely to die violently than men their age who didn't go through the juvenile justice system. Death rates in Hispanic males and females were five and nine times more than the general population respectively. The disturbing report by Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine found 68 per cent of deaths were homicides and 91 per cent were shootings. Disturbing: Nearly twice as many delinquent youths die violent deaths when they reach adulthood than U.S. combat troops who are killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new study shows (stock photo) 'Our findings are shocking,' lead author Linda Teplin, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, said. 'Early violent death is a health disparity. Youth who get detained are disproportionately poor and disproportionately racial and ethnic minorities. We must address early violent death the same as any other health disparity.' The study, which is published this month in the journal Pediatrics, used newly available data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1,829 youth (1,172 males and 657 females, ages 10 to 18 years at baseline) who were detained at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center in Chicago between 1995 and 1998. The authors interviewed participants and then followed them up using official death records up to 16 years after the initial interviews. This is the first large-scale study to look at death rates in delinquent females and also uses new data on Hispanics, the largest minority group in the U.S. The young people were selected at random before they were convicted of any crime. Detention: The study, which is published this month in the journal Pediatrics, used newly available data from the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a longitudinal study of 1,829 youths who were detained at the Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, pictured, in Chicago between 1995 and 1998 . Of the participants, 111 died, 75 of which were killed by others. Of those, 68 were killed by firearms. The study found black delinquent teens were 4.5 times more likely to die from homicide as adults than non-Hispanic whites. Violent death up to age 34 was predicted by three risk factors in adolescence: alcohol use disorder, selling drugs and gang involvement, according to the research. 'Prevention is key,' Teplin said. 'We need to reduce the likelihood that youth will become delinquent. And, if they are arrested and detained, we need interventions to reduce violence. Otherwise, perpetrators often become victims.' She said many delinquent youth commit crimes because of untreated psychiatric problems. For example, they may abuse drugs to self-medicate for depression, and then sell drugs to afford them, Teplin said. 'These youth may have fallen through the cracks of the health care system into the juvenile justice net,' she said. 'We should avoid the stereotype that delinquent youth are just bad kids. Many are not hardened criminals; but once detained, they are on a path fraught with risk.'","Delinquent girls are most at risk of dying a violent death - some five times more likely than the general female population .

Officers first went to Mitchell's home on Thursday after a postal carrier reported that her mail was piling up. Officials say they didn't find anyone and thought Mitchell wasn't home. Police say it wasn't until Friday that officials realized the first floor had collapsed. Medical examiners released the cause of death of the 66-year-old on Tuesday. Town Building Official Burt Schiaroli spent Monday assessing whether the 114-year-old home is a safety hazard. It was finally deemed 'unfit for human occupancy' and was boarded up with plywood. 'The safety of the public is paramount,' Schiaroli said Monday, according to the New Haven Register, before inspecting the home. Welfare check: Officers went to Mitchell's home on Thursday after a postal carrier reported that her mail was piling up . The home also has a hole in the roof. Cheshire Fire Chief Jack Casner said no decision had been made on whether to tear down the house. Authorities have said they believe the first floor of the single story home collapsed under the weight of all the clutter, which was stacked as high as the ceiling in some places. 'There is several feet of clutter throughout the entire house, anywhere from 4 to 8 feet high,' Casner said. Casner said there were holes in the roof that may have leaked water onto the floor and made it weaker. 'I was surprised with what I witnessed,' he said. 'It's unfortunate that someone was in those conditions.' Collapsed: Authorities have said they believe the first floor of the single story home collapsed under the weight of all the clutter, which was stacked as high as the ceiling in some places . Neighbors said Mitchell cared for her mother in the home for years until the older woman died about a decade ago. They said they saw Mitchell far less frequently after that. Last winter, police were called to her home after neighbors became concerned that they hadn't seen her following a heavy snowstorm, but eventually she came out. While the town's Social Services department couldn't address Mitchell's case, police said that the woman had declined multiple offers of help over the years. Casner said officials still haven't been able to find Mitchell's relatives and are taking out ads in local newspapers looking for them. The Cheshire Fire Department and the state Department of Emergency Services assisted police to get into the collapsed property by cutting their way into the home through a side wall.

"By . Reuters . and Helen Pow . Climate change could cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars a year by 2100, a new bipartisan report has claimed. Over the next 25 years, annual property losses from hurricanes and other coastal storms are expected to reach $35 billion; a decline in crop yields of 14 percent will cost corn and wheat farmers tens of billions of dollars a year and heat wave-driven demand for electricity is forecast to cost utility customers up to $12 billion annually. But the report, commissioned by a group chaired . by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Secretary of . the Treasury and Goldman Sachs alum Henry Paulson, and environmentalist . and financier Tom Steyer, claims the price tag could soar to hundreds of billions by 2100. Hurricanes on the rise: This November 15, 2012 photo shows a house in Sea Bright New Jersey that was destroyed by Superstorm Sandy. Over the next 25 years, annual property losses from hurricanes and other coastal storms alone are expected to reach $35 billion, a new report claims . The analysis, released Tuesday, 'is the most detailed ever of the potential economic effects of climate change on the U.S.,' climatologist Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University said. It comes three weeks after President Barack Obama ordered U.S. regulators to take their strongest steps ever to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including requiring power plants to cut carbon dioxide emissions to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Called 'Risky Business,' the report projects climate impacts at scales as small as individual counties. Its conclusions about crop losses and other consequences are based not on computer projections, which climate-change skeptics routinely attack, but on data from past heat waves. It paints a grim picture of economic loss. 'Our economy is vulnerable to an overwhelming number of risks from climate change,' Paulson said in a statement, including from sea-level rise and from heat waves that will cause deaths, reduce labor productivity and strain power grids. By mid-century, $66 billion to $106 billion worth of coastal property will likely be below sea level. Act now: On June 14, 2014, President Barack Obama told a graduating class at the University of California, Irvine that denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese, and issued a call to action on global warming . There is a 5 percent chance that by 2100 the losses will reach $700 billion, with average annual losses from rising oceans of $42 billion to $108 billion along the Eastern Seaboard and Gulf of Mexico. Extreme heat, especially in the Southwest, Southeast and upper Midwest, will slash labor productivity as people are unable to work outdoors at construction and other jobs for sustained periods. The analysis goes further than previous work, said Princeton's Oppenheimer, by identifying places that will be 'unsuited for outdoor activity.' Demand for electricity will surge as people need air conditioning just to survive, straining generation and transmission capacity. That will likely require the construction of up to 95 gigawatts of generation capacity over the next 5 to 25 years, or roughly 200 average-size coal or natural gas power plants. As utilities add the construction costs to customers' bills, people and businesses will pay $8.5 billion to $30 billion more every year by the middle of the century. The report does not make policy prescriptions, concluding only that 'it is time for all American business leaders and investors to get in the game and rise to the challenge of addressing climate change.'","The bipartisan report, released today, has been dubbed 'the most detailed ever' on the potential economic effects of climate change on the U.S.

The 30-year-old man driving a delivery that ran into a stationary car carrying a family-of-five, flipping on top and killing them all, was high on prescirption drugs at the time of the crash and fell asleep behind the wheel as a result. Joshua Smith had 'identifiable quantities of narcotics in his system at the time of the collision' on May 11 in Hesperia, California, according to blood results released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner Department on Tuesday. The horrific crash killed a mother, father and their children, who were on their way to Disneyland to celebrate both Mothers Day and their youngest child's 5th birthday. Tragic: Little Cynthia Jimenez, pictured, was killed traveling to celebrate her fifth birthday with her family at Disneyland when she was killed by a man allegedly driving under the influence of prescription drugs . Victims: Her mother, Angelica Garcia, left, father, Gerardo Jimenez, center right, and two brothers, Ivan, 2 and Freddie, 9, pictured, were all killed in the wreck, on Main Street in Hesperia, San Bernadino County on May 11 . Investigators believed that Smith lost . consciousness prior to the collision as a result of the medications, . causing the crash, according to KTLA. He was doing a delivery of flowers for Mothers Day. At the time of the crash he is believed to have said that he looked away for a second. The victims were identified as Angelica Garcia, 25, her father, Gerardo Jimenez, brothers, Ivan, 2 and Freddie, 9, and daughter Cynthia, whose would have turned five the following day. Smith is said to have swerved into the left-hand side lane and hit the Honda sedan carrying the family, who were stationary at a stop sign. He suffered only minor injuries.

The driver of the van, identified as Joshua Smith, 30, made it out with only minor injuries and was treated at the scene . 'I've been to scenes where families have suffered great loss (but) all at once, in such a violent manner, is very rare,' sheriff’s Sgt. Doug Hubbard told KTLA at the time. The collision occurred just before 7a.m. at Main Street and Balsam Avenue in Hesperia, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said. Investigators determined that the van was traveling eastbound on Main Street when it went into westbound lanes, collided with a Honda sedan that was stopped at a stop sign, and landed on top of the car.

"By . Helen Pow . A Houston firefighter has been suspended after he complained on his Facebook page about having to search for a 'drunk Mexican' who drowned in a lake last Friday. Victor Gonzalez's daughter said she was devastated when she saw Kerry Williams' alleged racist remarks about her 47-year-old father who jumped into Lake Houston while boating with a friend and failed to resurface. His body was recovered Saturday afternoon after an intensive search. Scroll down for video . Victim: Victor Gonzalez, pictured, drowned Friday when he jumped off a friend's boat in Lake Houston and didn't resurface . Offensive: Kerry Williams has been relieved of duty pending an investigation into his racist Facebook post, pictured . At 1:37 a.m. Saturday, Williams, an emergency medical technician, allegedly posted: 'So 45 mins after afore mentioned ""drunk Mexican"" jumped from his boat we go searching. An hour later HPD dive team and helicopter show up. We are done with our search no body recover and no ""drunk Mexican.""' 'When I saw it, I was devastated,' Gracie Gonzalez, the victim's daughter, told the Houston Chronicle. 'It makes the whole department look bad.' She added to ABC News: 'How dare you sit there and talk about my father like that? There's no words to describe the hurt I feel because you made the situation worse.' Williams has been relieved of duty, but is still getting paid in an administrative position while the department investigates the claims. According to ABC, Williams tried to defend himself saying the victim's friend had referred to him that way, which is why he put it in quotes. However, the friend, Thomas Watson, who called 911 disputes that. Devastated: The victim's daughter Gracie Gonzalez, pictured, said she was devastated when she saw the post . Suspended: Williams has been relieved of duty, but is still getting paid in an administrative position while the department investigates the claims. The victim is pictured above on the day of his death . 'I did not . tell anyone and wouldn't have told anyone he was a drunk Mexican. He was . a good friend of mine,' Watson told the TV station. This has further angered the Gonzalez family. 'He made a racial slur,' she said. 'And now he gets a mini-vacation while being investigated? What more investigation do they need to do?' She thanked other first responders for their efforts to rescue her father, but labelled the department's response to Williams' hurtful comments as tepid. 'There's no telling how many other people he's done this to,' she told the Chronicle. 'I feel like (the response) is a slap in the face.' Williams has worked for HFD since 2003. Fire officials said in a statement that they 'take violations of this nature very seriously.' 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the victim. Comments like these are not a reflection of the nearly 4000 men and women of the HFD who perform their jobs everyday with courage and compassion,' the statement reads.","Victor Gonzalez's daughter said she was devastated when she saw Houston firefighter Kerry Williams' alleged racist remarks .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The first female captain of a frontline Royal Navy warship has been removed from her post amid claims she had an affair with another shipmate. It has been confirmed that Commander Sarah West has been 'removed from command' from the ship. However, a spokesman added that she would remain in the service and would be re-appointed to another post. The Royal Navy has confirmed that Commander Sarah West has been removed from command of HMS Portland amid claims of an affair . Divorced Commander West, 42, took charge of Type 23 frigate HMS Portland in May 2012. However, she left the vessel last month following allegations that she had a relationship with newly-wed Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, who married his wife Melissa in December. Commander West recently described . herself as ‘single’, having been married to former Royal Navy pilot . Andrew Whitlum but the pair separated in 2006. At the time the Royal Navy said it would conduct an inquiry into whether she breached the armed forces' code of conduct, which governs personal relationships within the military. In a statement a spokesman said no details would be given of the inquiry or its outcome. However, he added: 'We can confirm that Commander Sarah West, Commanding Officer of HMS Portland, has been removed from Command. Commander West, left, left the vessel last month following claims that she had a relationship with Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, pictured right . 'This is an internal matter between the individual and her senior officers and we will not give further details of the removal. 'Commander West will continue to serve in the Royal Navy and she will be reappointed to a post where her skills and experience can be used to best effect.' The spokesman added that Commander West's second-in-command has taken over the running of the ship, which returned to the UK on Saturday after a seven-month deployment in the Atlantic and Caribbean. After her appointment two years ago Commander West described it as the greatest achievement of her career, but in an interview earlier this year she explained how work commitments made it difficult to have a relationship. Commander West, who was captain of HMS Portland, pictured, was the first woman to be in charge of a frontline Royal Navy warship . She told the Daily Mirror: 'I'm really proud to be the first woman but I'm not reinventing the wheel. Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. It's just that I happen to be newsworthy at the moment. 'There are drawbacks though. Years at sea probably explains why I'm single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.' Commander West, who was born and raised in Lincolnshire, studied maths at the University of Hertfordshire before joining Britannia Royal Naval College in September 1995. She was selected as a small ship navigator and joined HMS Cottesmore in 1997 and subsequent appointments included Officer of the Watch of HMS Sheffield and Navigating Officer of HMS Somerset. The ship recently returned to the UK following a seven month deployment in the Atlantic and Caribbean . In 2007 she joined the Permanent Joint Headquarters and was responsible for co-ordinating the UK contribution to operations in the Balkans, which included the period that saw Kosovo’s declaration of independence. Selected for sea command in 2008, she commanded minesweepers HMS Ramsey, HMS Penzance, HMS Pembroke and HMS Shoreham between April 2009 and December 2011. Her time on HMS Pembroke included eight and a half months deployed on operations in the Arabian Gulf. She was promoted to commander in January 2012 and assumed command of HMS Portland in May that year. Lieutenant Commander Gray is Portland’s operations officer, in charge of weapons and defence systems.","Commander Sarah West has been 'removed from command' of HMS Portland .

Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti dropped the F-bomb during a speech at the city's Staples Center Monday night as he congratulated the Kings for their Stanley Cup win.

F-Bomb: Eric Garcetti, pictured during a speech Monday night in which he dropped the F-bomb for emphasis . Big day: Having shed his pinstriped suit of choice for a hockey jersey Monday, Garcetti, pictured, stepped in front of the TV cameras and a full house at the stadium, and declared it a big day for LA . The shock remark brought 19,000 hockey fans to their feet, lit up the Twitterverse and left some people scratching their heads, wondering just what the normally soft-spoken elected official was thinking. Within minutes, Garcetti's comments were trending on Twitter and appearing uncensored on YouTube, just as Fox Sports West was apologizing for letting them get on the air. 'He said that?' Thomas Hollihan, an expert on political discourse, civil society and contemporary rhetorical criticism at the University of Southern California, asked incredulously. This was, after all, not some drunken musician accepting an award somewhere. Nor was it a celebrity caught up in a silly dispute captured by the cameras for TMZ. This was the mayor of the nation's second-largest city, gleefully shouting it to the masses. 'When you're an elected official, people have a higher expectation for your speech, your conduct and context than they would if you're an entertainer,' said Hollihan. He added he hoped Garcetti, whose public persona is normally about as mild as his city's weather, wasn't trying to boost his hipness cred. Although the F-word's shock value is declining, Hollihan said, it's never smart for a politician to toss it around in public, even in front of a crowd of screaming hockey fans. 'The little old ladies in the valley are going to hear this too,' he said, referring to the city's more conservative San Fernando Valley, where Garcetti grew up before moving to the hipper Silver Lake area. 'As are the church people in neighborhoods where they are not hockey fans, but they care a lot about conduct and character.' But where putting the word out over the airwaves once would have prompted a federal investigation, that's not so much the case anymore. Parade: Los Angeles Kings cheer as their team parades with the Stanley Cup trophy downtown Los Angeles, Monday. The parade and rally were held to celebrate the Los Angeles Kings' second Stanley Cup championship in three seasons . Victory: The city showed up to celebrate the Kings' victory on Monday . When David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox let it slip last year during a televised event honoring first-responders to the Boston Marathon bombings, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission himself Tweeted that it was no big deal. 'David Ortiz spoke from the heart at today's Red Sox game. I stand with Big Papi and the people of Boston,' said Julius Genachowski . And when, thanks to a bank of TV microphones, the world heard Vice President Joe Biden's whisper to President Barack Obama, 'This is a big f***ing deal,' as Obama was about to sign the Affordable Health Care Act, the slip was quickly forgotten. Of course Biden didn't mean for anyone but Obama to hear him. And Ortiz said afterward he got caught up in the moment and never meant to say what he said. But the mayor's official Twitter account did repeat much of what he said - with the hashtag BFD. Appearing on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' later Monday, Garcetti got a loud round of cheers when Kimmel told him 'I enjoyed your performance at the rally today.' Garcetti replied, 'I got a little ahead of myself. But you've got to remember, we didn't win at lawn bowling, we won in hockey.' The mayor added, 'Kids out there do not say what your mayor said today.'","Mayor Eric Garcetti used the swear word during a speech at the city's Staples Center Monday night .

"By . Helen Pow . Students at a northern California high school are petitioning for a security guard fired for beating a disabled student to get his job back, as a second video showing him kicking the teen has emerged. Security guard Marchell Mitchell, 23, was dismissed by Oakland High School officials on May 19 after he was caught on video beating Francisco Martinez because the student argued with him, slapped his hand and spit on him. However, classmates of the 17-year-old . victim are now calling for the security guard to be reinstated, claiming . Martinez is a troublemaker and deserved being taught a lesson. Scroll down for video . New video: Another video has emerged showing the security guards beating the disabled teen, center . Petition: Some teens at Oakland High School claim the 17-year-old victim, Francisco Martinez, is a troublemaker, and deserved being taught a lesson . Meanwhile, the school district released a . second video Tuesday that captures a beating just moments earlier near . an elevator - and another security officer has faced discipline. The latest video apparently shows Martinez slapping the hand of the second guard, identified by the school district as Shalandra Cotton, before Mitchell angrily dumps the student sideways out of his chair and kicks him. Mitchell then drags Martinez into an elevator, where the altercation continues for some time outside of camera view. Cotton has been placed on paid leave as the school investigates his involvement and why he didn't break up the fight. Students claim the wheelchair-bound teen who suffers cerebral palsy is a bully and regularly runs over people's toes. 'There are some students that like [the guard] and were sympathetic,' Oakland Unified School District spokesman Troy Flint told ABC News. 'I think part of the response stems from the fact that many of the students view the attack as a peer to peer situation and they are thinking about what they would have done in that situation.' Rough: On Tuesday, school officials released a second video, pictured, that captured another incident that happened moments earlier near an elevator . But he said students were 'overlooking the fact that the security guard is both an adult and a school employee with higher responsibility.' There is no consideration of reinstating Mitchell, however, despite the petition, Flint said. 'We're not giving it any consideration,' Flint said. 'There is no conceivable scenario under which Marchell Mitchell will work for Oakland Unified School District again. His fate rests with the judicial system now.' Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony corporal injury to a child. He's scheduled for a pretrial hearing on June 16, the San Jose Mercury News reported. Martinez said the attack in the original video has left him in pain. 'He slapped me,' Martinez told KTVU after leaving hospital. 'He hit me so hard, it threw me out of my chair. I hit the floor with my chin first.' Photos his mother took after the attack show scratches to his chin and head and bruises on his arms. Abuse: Marchell Mitchell is seen on camera lifting his arm to beat 17-year-old Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The security guard has now been arrested . No escape: The boy was unable to move due to the handcuffs and said the security guard cursed at him . Mitchell, a substitute school resource officer who had been employed by the school following a background check last November, was trying to get students to go to class before the May incident. Martinez 'either refused to comply or was slow to do so,' Principal Matin Abdel-Qawi said in a letter to parents seen by the San Francisco Chronicle. Mitchell pushed his chair and, after Martinez objected and tried to push the guard away, Mitchell handcuffed the teenager to the chair, he said. Martinez admitted that he then spit on the guard because he saw he had no other option. 'I was handcuffed, so I didn't have no way to defend myself but my mouth,' Martinez told KTVU. Hurt: 17-year-old Martinez, pictured, said he has suffered pain since the incident two weeks ago . Treatment: He is pictured leaving hospital. He suffered a scraped chin and face and bruised arms . The footage then shows Mitchell repeatedly lifting his arm and punching the teenager as they move along the hallway before dumping him out of his chair. He can be seen standing above the student, who is laid out on the floor, as other students stop to look before walking on. Martinez said that he was also hit and thrown to the floor in the school's elevator before the incident, although this can not be seen on the camera footage. Martinez, who has been undergoing therapy so he can strengthen his legs to be able to walk, added that when he told the guard he was in pain, he swore at him. 'He tells me like that, ""I don't give a ***! I hope you don't walk for two to three weeks"",' Martinez said. Arrest: Mitchell, 23, was fired from the school and faces felony charges of corporal injury to a child . After the incident, Mitchell was fired and arrested by Oakland police. He has been charged with felony corporal injury to a child. 'I'm shocked and deeply hurt by this behavior and apologize on behalf of the staff at Oakland High,' Abdel-Qawi wrote. 'This incident is not reflective of the kind of culture we cherish at our school or how we treat one another.' Francisco said he also wants the district to take action against a second security officer seen in the video, but it is not known what action they have taken, if any. Mitchell will appear in court on June 16 for a pretrial hearing. See below for video .","Oakland High School security guard Marchell Mitchell, 23, was dismissed by the school May 19 .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Four boys on a school trip have unearthed a 4,300-year-old hair tress which is being described as one of the most significant recent archaeological finds in the UK. The boys, Joseph Bell, Luca Alderson, Sebastian Alderson and Aidan Bell, were on a local dig in Kirkhaugh, Northumberland, when they saw a glint of gold in the soil. To their astonishment it turned out to be an ancient hair tress and one of the earliest ever pieces of metal work to have been found in the UK. Scroll down for video . Schoolboys Aidan Bell, Luca Alderson, Joseph Bell and Sebastian Alderson with the intricate metal hair tress they found on a school trip . The schoolchildren, aged between seven and ten, had been on a dig arranged by the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) Partnership's Altogether Archaeology project, when they stumbled across the treasure. The ornament may have been worn by a first-generation metal worker who could have travelled to Britain from overseas in search of gold and copper. The tresses are very rare and only ten finds have ever been made in Britain . Seven-year-old Joseph said: 'We were digging carefully in the ground and I saw something shiny, it was gold. 'Me and Luca started dancing with joy. It was very exciting.' The intricately decorated tress dates back to about 2,300 BC, a period known as the Copper Age, which is pre-Bronze Age . His friend, eight-year-old Luca added: 'When I first saw it I felt happy but I thought it was plastic. When I found out it was gold, I was very happy.' The intricately decorated tress, which dates back to about 2,300 BC, a period known as the Copper Age, which is pre-Bronze Age, was found in a burial mound alongside three beautiful flint arrowheads and a jet button. The boys went along to the dig, which took place at Randalholme Farm at Kirkhaugh, after taking part in an Altogether Archaeology project called Dreaming the Land, while at Alston Primary in Cumbria. During the project, the boys learned about local archaeology, which inspired them to attend the community dig. The ornament may have been worn by a first-generation metal worker who could have travelled to Britain from overseas in search of gold and copper . Sebastian, ten, said: 'We did some work on the Copper Age at school which was really interesting. 'But to take part in the actual excavation, and to find things, was awesome.' Aidan, also 10, added: 'We went to see the site before it had been dug up with our class. I can't wait to go back to school to tell everyone because they will never believe what we found.' The head tress, along with arrowheads and  button, will now be analysed by specialists. Paul Frodsham, who leads the Altogether Archaeology project said: 'All archaeological sites are important in their own way, but this is exceptional. 'It can be regarded as marking the very start of mineral exploitation in the North Pennines, leading in due course to Roman exploitation of lead and silver, and eventually to the vast post-medieval lead industry for which the region is internationally famous.'","Boys were on a local dig in Northumberland when they saw a glint of gold .

"By . Helen Pow . A baby who was born at 25 weeks when her teen mother was shot and killed in a botched robbery has finally been released from hospital and her little lungs are breathing on their own. Lailani Casara entered the world far too early on Christmas Day 2013 when doctors delivered the 1 pound 10 ounce baby by emergency cesarean as her mom Eva Mae Casara took her last breath. Kept alive on a ventilator, she had a better chance of dying than living, but she has defied the odds and after five months in the neonatal intensive care unit at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Chicago, she is now being cared for at home by her great grandmother and aunt. Love: Fannie Casara kisses great-granddaughter Lailani Paris Evamae Casara, at her home on the far south side of Chicago on June 19, 2014. The child was delivered at just 25 weeks after her mother was shot and killed . Lailana weighs a healthy 7 pounds now and is fed with formula through a tube in her stomach. She is tethered to oxygen most of the day to strengthen her lungs, according to the Chicago Tribune, but she is able to breath on her own. 'Everything now is geared toward that baby,' her great-grandmother Fannie Casara told the Tribune, adding that in between naps and feeding they tell the little girl about her mother. On December 25, Eva Mae was picked up by her boyfriend, 16-year-old Anthony Lee, and his half-brothers Diante Coakley, 21, and Darius D. Marshall, 19 to take part in a robbery, police say. But the intended victim ended up driving away with the pregnant teen in the car, prompting the brothers to shoot at the vehicle and one of the bullets flew through the window and pierced the back of Eva's head. Her boyfriend and his two half-brothers are in jail facing murder charges.

Marshall, 19, right, are in jail facing murder charges . A passer by found the teen lying in blood in the snow and she was rushed to hospital, where she was in shock and bleeding profusely. The baby's heartbeat dipped lower and lower to a near-death 30 beats per minute, according to the Tribune. This compared with the typical 120 to 160 beats per minute of a healthy fetus. Emergency room physicians performed CPR as obstetricians raced to cut the baby out of her abdomen - which took them just 30 seconds to deliver. The lead obstetrician, Dr. Fouad Al-Qawasmi, said the baby would certainly have died if Eva had arrived just 10 minutes later. But saving the infant was bittersweet, he told the newspaper. 'She won't . see her baby,' the father recalled thinking during the procedure. 'We . saved one, but we're not going to save the other.' As devastating as their loss was, Eva Mae's sister Autumn Vargas said there was no time to grieve. Stay strong: Autumn Vargas-Bell is overcome with emotion while talking about her sister Eva and niece Lailani Paris Evamae Casara, whom she's holding . Oxygen: Lailani is still receiving oxygen after her stay in the NICU following the shooting death of her mother, Eva, pictured in the frame, at left . 'You can't even break down,' the 35-year-old said. 'Because there's this pretty baby in front of you. And she needs you.' The family didn't approve of Eva's boyfriend, and wanted her instead to go back to school and graduate so she could attend college. Once upon a time she wanted to be a doctor, they said. Casara said she was elated when she found out shortly before her death that she was having a little girl, after being initially frightened when she found out she was pregnant. Kathy Graal, a neonatal intensive care unit nurse who cared for the tiny Lailana when she was delivered Christmas night, said she nor any of her colleagues thought the baby would survive, given how dangerously early she was delivered. Doctors remain concerned she may suffer setbacks in her motor and cognitive skills given the trauma surrounding her birth. But her loving family take heart in the fact she mimics their facial expressions and grabs for her toys. All they want for her now is a normal life, starkly difference from the violence she was born into.  'Normal. That's what I hope for her,' Vargas told the Tribune. 'A normal, beautiful life.'","Lailani Casara entered the world far too early on Christmas Day 2013 .

"By . Helen Pow . Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has taunted President Barack Obama, claiming that the U.S. no longer has the guts for battle. Speaking at an event commemorating the 25th anniversary of the death of his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khamenei, the 74-year-old Shiite Muslim cleric proclaimed that 'military attack is not a priority for Americans now.' He stood on a podium amid banners boasting 'America Cannot Do a Damn Thing' as he reacted to a speech President Obama gave to West Point last week. Chicken: Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, second from left, called President Obama a chicken in a speech during a ceremony marking the 25th death anniversary of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic Republic, in Tehran Wednesday . Speech: In this picture released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Khamenei waves to the crowd. He told the group that America has renounced military action . 'Since World War II, some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures - without thinking through the consequences,' Obama told graduating cadets. Khamenei took the president's message to mean, 'They have renounced the idea of any military actions.' 'They realize that military attacks are as dangerous or even more dangerous for the assaulting country as they are for the country attacked,' the ayatollah said in the Tehran speech Wednesday, the New York Daily News reported. The gibe comes as President Obama is being critisised for negotiating with Taliban to swap five hardened terrorists for suspected deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Obama still insists America can still use its military to resolve Iran's nuclear threat but in the West Point speech, he claimed 'Just because we have the best hammer does not mean every problem is a nail.' Soul of God: Khamenei speaks above Arabic writing in the centre in red that reads: 'Peace be upon you Ruhollah (Soul of God)' Not a priority: The 74-year-old Shiite Muslim cleric, pictured, proclaimed that 'military attack is not a priority for Americans now' Khamenei called the U.S. the 'Great Satan' and said its effort to bring Iran 'to its knees' have failed. He said: 'Despite the sanctions imposed upon it, Iran today is launching satellites and sending live organisms into space and is producing nuclear power.' Last week, the supreme leader launched another verbal attack on America, claiming his country's struggle will only end when it defeats U.S.-led oppression. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told members of parliament in Tehran that Iran must be armed and 'have the capability to defend itself' in a 'world full of thieves'. His comments came as negotiations with the international community over Iran's nuclear programme ran into a stalemate, with Tehran saying world powers were 'demanding too much'. 'Battle and jihad are endless because evil and its front continue to exist,' Khamenei told MPs, according to a translation by U.S. news site The Daily Caller. 'This battle will only end when the society can get rid of the oppressors’ front with America at the head of it, which has expanded its claws on human mind, body and thought. Reaction: The supreme leader was reacting to a speech President Obama gave to West Point last week, pictured . 'This requires a difficult and lengthy struggle and need for great strides.' The Daily Caller's translation of a Fars News Agency report is by a reporter pseudonymously bylined Reza Khalili, who claims to be a former CIA agent in Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Khamenei's address to Parliament on Sunday continued with veiled references to the actions of the West and Arab states as he justified Iran's continued defiance of international sanctions against its nuclear programme. 'Logic and reason command that for Iran, in order to pass through a region full of pirates, needs to arm itself and must have the capability to defend itself,' he said. 'They should stop demanding too much': Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who says the impasse in nuclear talks is not his fault . 'Today’s world is full of thieves and plunderers of human honour, dignity and morality who are equipped with knowledge, wealth and power, and under the pretense of humanity easily commit crimes and betray human ideals and start wars in different parts of the world.' There has been little progress in the latest round of nuclear talks between Tehran and the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China - the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - and Germany. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, speaking in Tehran today before a visit to Turkey for talks with European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, laid the blame for the impasse at the feet of the six powers. 'They should stop demanding too much. We have our red line, and they too want assurances that our nuclear programme will always remain peaceful. We believe these two add up,' he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA. 'I feel the realism awakened from the last round of talks will bring us closer to conclusion. We may be able to remove one of two of the previous hurdles, or rather face new ones. In any case, we should make an effort to pass through this phase.' Iran considers the right to enrich uranium for nuclear energy a red line but that levels of enrichment are negotiable. Enriched uranium provides fuel for nuclear generating stations but it is also, if refined to a high level, the key ingredient for atomic bombs. Western powers claim Iran's declared civilian nuclear energy programme is a facade for seeking a weapons capability. Iran denies this but it has a history of hiding activity from U.N. nuclear inspectors. The powers want Iran to agree to scale back enrichment and other nuclear activity and accept tougher U.N. inspections to prove it can't quickly build atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to economic sanctions. But Mr Zarif said world powers should refrain from additional pressure on the Islamic Republic to force it into concessions. 'Sanctions haven't served them any purpose, only led to our making 19,000 centrifuges,' he said, according to IRNA, referring to the machines that enrich uranium.","Leader was speaking at an event commemorating the 25th anniversary of the death of his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khamenei .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Organisers of the World Hen Racing Championship say they were stunned to find competitors using bizarre tactics in a bid to win the race. The race, which takes place at the Barley Mow Inn in Bonsall in Derbyshire sees chickens compete over a 20 yard course in a tradition dating back over 100 years. But with the race being completed in record times this year, organisers say people are taking to training their chickens, with contestants seen banging tins and garden forks, talking in strange tongues and even using a home-made tuning fork to egg the hens on. The World Hen Racing Championships  took place in Bonsall, near Matlock in Derbyshire in a tradition dating back over 100 years . Organisers of the race suspect that people have been training their chickens in a bid to make sure they win the race . Karen Glaves, with her hen Mustapha. Around 52 hens were entered into the race in a tradition dating back more than 100 years . The event saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend on the village of Bonsall for the event, with many bringing their own contestants . Around 52 hens lined up for this year's event on Saturday, which saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend upon the village. But rather than seeing a random chicken taking the title, it seemed as though the birds were being groomed for glory, with a new course record set, and even a photo finish at the end. Now pub landlady and one of the organisers Colette Dewhurst reckoned this year's form showed the ancient tradition had entered a new era. She said: 'It was great day which showed we have moved into the era of professional hen racing. People are quite clearly training the hens. The winning hen was Road Runner, front, owned by Oliver Keely and trained by his ten-year-old brother Harvey . Harvey Keely, with his trophy after his hen Road Runner won the World Hen Racing Championships . After winning the race, Harvey, holding Road Runner celebrates with his father Charlie Ablett who pops the champagne . After missing out on being crowned champion, Ric Allen gives his hen Phall the opportunity to drown his sorrows . 'We have a laugh about it. How do you get a hen to race? We thought it was a bit of fun. 'But this year there were five or six hens which have literally been trained to run to the other end. 'We had one girl tapping a tin which produced a high-pitched sound. She had lined it with tin foil and had a fork which was like a tuning key to make it stand out from the shaking of the tins everyone else had. 'It is a keen contest now with covert training methods. 'We also have people shouting in weird voices, placing buckets of fishing worms on the finish line and banging tins. It all seemed to work pretty well.' This year's winning chicken was three-year-old Road Runner, owned by 13-year-old Oliver Keely, who keeps the bird as a pet at the bottom of his garden. One hen is so keen to start the race, he escapes from his owner's hands at the start line . One of the organisers of the race sais it was clear some of the entrants had been groomed for glory by being trained by their owners . Around 52 hens lined up for this year's event on Saturday, which saw more than 600 locals and tourists descend upon the village . After a busy day racing his chickens, Steve Brown loads his birds back into his car to prepare them for next year's event . But it was Oliver's ten-year-old brother Harvey, who took the bird in hand and turned him into a champion. Salesman dad Charlie, 35, also ensured the bird was on good form by placing a pot of meal worms on the finish line. But at no one was quite sure which of the finalists was first past the post so there was stewards' inquiry. However, Ms Dewhurst added: 'It was a photo finish which had to be replayed on a phone to see which chicken's foot crossed the line first.' But Mr Keely never had any doubts explaining: 'Luckily it was wet. Our bird prefers wet going and soggy ground.'","Championships took place in Derbyshire in tradition dating back 100 years .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The terrifying moment two hooded thugs tried to batter down the door of a retired software engineer as he clung to the door handle to stop them breaking in has been captured on CCTV. Simon Barnsley, was awoken by a noise outside his £165,000 semi-detached home in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at 1am on a night last month. The 58-year-old then went to check his CCTV monitor to see what was happening and was stunned to see two trespassers lurking outside his property, trying to break into the basement. Scroll down for video . The two hooded men tried to batter down Simon Barnsley's front door by violently kicking and punching it . The two men tried to break down Mr Barnsley's front door as he held the handle to prevent them from getting in . He ran to the door completely naked and jingling his car keys, thinking the men would be scared off. But the chilling footage shows the yobs then try to break down the front door as Mr Barnsley held on to the handle, as his shocked wife Julia, 58, looked on in horror. He battled to keep the men out as they violently kicked and punched the front door causing it to splinter and glass to smash over their front hallway in an incident lasting nine minutes. The couple pleaded with them to leave during the ordeal while at the same time dialling 999 and eventually the pair walk off. West Mercia Police are now hunting the yobs who struck at the house, which sits by the bank of the River Severn in the Castlfields area of the picturesque town. Yesterday Mr Barnsley, who retired from London for a quieter life in the countryside in 2007 said the incident was a prime of example of Broken Britain. Mr Barnsley was first alerted to the trespassers outside his home when he was awoken by a noise . The retired software engineer went to check his CCTV cameras, which showed the two men attempting to break into his property . Describing the moment he fought to keep out the intruders, Mr Barnsley - who is the son of author Gabriel Fieldings and brother of famous mathematician Michael Barnsley - said: 'It was pretty brutal. 'I have never seen anything like this happen. 'This area has really deteriorated over the last year. I think people have tried to burgle us three or four times in the last year. 'About a year ago thieves broke in and stole a PlayStation and lots of gadgets and laptops and things, and that's when I decided to get the CCTV installed. 'It was quite terrifying and it all happened while I was completely naked. 'I was holding the handle and leaning on the door with my full weight but they were still breaking though. 'I told them I was recording them and you would think they would leave after that but they just got more irate. Mr Barnsley, right and his wife Julia, pictured outside their home had to fight to keep out the intruders while they waited for the police to arrive . 'We were so frightened and every time I moved away from the door a little bit it squeaked so I thought they were still there so I ended up hard against the door until the police arrived. 'At one point they left and then came back and picked up a little black canister which I think was pepper spray. 'I think they were wanting to break through the door, pepper spray my wife and I, then just rob the place anyway. 'I was OK because I'm quite fit for my age, but if it had just been my wife in it could have been so much worse. 'This area is nice during the day with mums and pushchairs, you hear a lot of laughing. But it's a different place after dark. It's changed my view of humanity.' The 58-year-old was forced to hold on the door handle of the front door, pictured, to stop the men from breaking in . The footage shows the men at first loitering outside the property and talking on their phones. Several times they come to the house and then walk away again - clearly showing their faces to the camera. After a while they return and open the gate at the basement of the house before repeatedly kicking the door. In the footage, after his wife says 'call the police Si' defiant Mr Barnsley can be heard calmly saying: 'I'm recording it. I want to catch his voice as well as his face. Before he adds: 'I'm recording you on a camera and I'm recording you doing what you're doing at the door and I'm going to report you to the police.' The thug then replies: 'You f***ing, f***ing idiot.' The force of which the men tried to batter down the front door caused the door to splinter and caused glass to smash all over their hallway . But Mrs Barnsley, who used to teach for the Open University, said the incident would not scare them away from the area. She added: 'We were petrified. The whole incident was terrifying. But we will not allow them to drive us out of this house. 'We moved here from Croydon, when we semi-retired and it is paradise. The CCTV does reassure me and we love living here. They will not make us leave.' A spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said that police were trying to identify the men, described as wearing light coloured jackets, one wearing trousers and trainers, the other wearing shorts. She added: 'We are studying the CCTV images and want anyone with any information to get in touch.'","Simon Barnsley was awoken by a noise in the night and went to check CCTV .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The brother of notorious prisoner Charles Bronson, pictured, claims that the criminals was approached to appear on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here . The brother of one of the Britain's most violent prisoners has claimed the criminal has been approached to be a contestant on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Mark Peterson, brother of notorious prisoner, Charles Bronson has said plans were discussed for his sibling to appear on the ITV reality show should he get parole. Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap at Full Sutton Prison in York, has been behind bars for 40 years mainly in solitary confinement due to his 'aggression' But using his brother's real name Michael, Mr Peterson says the prisoner had been asked to appear on the programme and believes he would have come across as a bright and charismatic man. He said: 'A few years ago he was approached to appear on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! should he ever get parole. 'And I can just imagine him on that. 'He'd be brilliant on that show because no matter what they'd find to throw at him he'd have already had it 100 times worse. 'The only downside would be that none of the other contestants would get a look-in. 'Come every bushtucker trial, Mickey would always be the first one with his hand in the air.' Originally given seven years for an armed raid on a Cheshire post office in 1974 - in which he netted just £26.18 - it was Bronson's violent behaviour towards guards and fellow prisoners while incarcerated, which led to his tariff being significantly extended. Over the years, he has been involved in at least ten jail sieges and the outbursts have seen him moved 150 times. Scroll down for video . Mr Peterson says that his brother, pictured, would have showed his bright and charismatic side if he appeared on the show . He was given a life sentence in 1999 for holding a prison art teacher hostage for 44 hours for criticising some of his sketches. Earlier this year, it was reported that Charles Bronson ‘smeared himself in butter before taking on 12 prison guards’ after Arsenal won the FA Cup. The Tottenham Hotspur fan admitted he had 'another rumble' with prison guards after the North London side beat Hull beat Hull at Wembley. Bronson, is currently serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap at Full Sutton Prison in York, pictured, where he has spent much of his time in solitary confinement . But Mr Peterson, 53, is hopeful that his 61-year-old brother will be successful in appealing against his sentence for a third time and that he should then spend his days with his brother near the Ceredigion coast in Wales. He added: 'I feel like this would be the best place for him, somewhere stable where he can rehabilitate slowly back into society. 'The world's very different now compared to the '70s and all the things we take for granted are totally alien to Michael. 'He's never even had a mobile phone.' A spokeswoman for ITV told the Daily Mirror that Bronson had not been approached to appear on the show and that they would not have put that request to him.","Mark Peterson says his brother was approached to appear on ITV show .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Associated Press . Scott A. Carmitchel, who has been arrested on suspicion of stealing $43,500 from the Bellagio casino and using the money on prostitutes. He refused to co-operate with police who had to hold his head in position for his mug shot . A suspect arrested in connection with stealing $43,000 at gunpoint from the Bellagio Casino allegedly celebrated the heist by blowing money on prostitutes on the Las Vegas Strip. Detectives say Scott A. Carmitchel, 34 from Kansas robbed a casino cashier of $43,500 at gunpoint on Friday night and later paid prostitutes at another hotel with the money still bound in Bellagio wrappers. He was arrested on Saturday night and is currently being held on $84,000 bail and is due to appear in court today to face charges of battery, grand larceny, burglary and robbery with a deadly weapon. The robbery occurred at 8.30pm on Friday when a man walked up to a Bellagio cashier's cage, pulled a gun from a backpack and demanded money from a clerk, who later told police she feared she would die if she didn't co-operate. The arrest of Carmitchel came after investigators were tipped off by a tourist from Texas who said he became suspicious after a man paid him $300 to rent him a $405 room at the Hard Rock Hotel. Police later detained four prostitutes who left the room, two carrying wads of cash with Bellagio labels. They told police the man was acting erratic, paranoid and delusional, according to a police report. Investigators said the suspect acknowledged his picture was on Bellagio surveillance tape, but he denied that he committed the robbery. He told them he went to the casino but didn't remember what happened, an arrest report states. Police eventually searched the room and found $10,000 in cash along with a BB gun that matched the description of the weapon used during the robbery. They also said they found a shirt they believe was worn by the robber, a $1,800 pair of black Louis Vuitton shoes, and an $800 Louis Vuitton belt, along with recent shopping receipts. Detectives say Carmitchel robbed a casino cashier at the Bellagio, pictured, of $43,500 dollars at gunpoint on Friday night . About half the money taken remained unaccounted for, the police report added. In his mug shot, police had to forcibly hold his head in position as he refused to co-operate in any way and was combative with officers throughout the booking process. Kansas Department of Corrections records show a Scott Alan Carmitchel served time for battery against a law officer and a robbery in 1998, and he was sent to prison most recently a year ago for making a criminal threat. Cartmitchel is accused of checking into a room at the Hard Rock Hotel, where police found four prostitutes, two of whom were carrying wads of cash with Bellagio labels . He was paroled in December and the department listed him as 'absconded' with his whereabouts unknown as of May 29. Las Vegas police spelled his last name 'Carmitchell' on a booking photo released on late Tuesday. Kansas authorities have spelled it both ways but list his true name with just one 'L,' and list the other spelling as an alias.","Scott Carmitchel arrested in connection with stealing cash from the casino .

According to the Times Live in South Africa, the buyer Louwtjie Louwrens, plans to retire to the property with his family. He told the newspaper: 'It is in a safe area and everyone I dealt with was very professional.

Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A wine bar is to open up within a French hospital with the aim of cheering up terminally ill patients. The Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital in central France will open the bar in September where it is hoped it will improve the quality of life of patients. Housed in the hospital's palliative care centre, patients will also be able to invite in their friends and family to share a glass of wine with them. The Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital in central France, where there are plans to open up a wine bar . The bar, which will be the first of its kind in France, will 'cheer up the difficult day-to-day existence of patients, according to head of the centre Virgine Guastella. She said: 'The aim is to re-humanise patients by improving the quality of their day-to-day existence and also by giving them the pleasure of being able to offer and receive. The bar in the hospital will serve wine, as well as beer, whiskey and champagne . The bar would also allow families facing bereavement to create moments of conviviality despite being in a hospital environment, she added. 'It's a little detail but it can make all the difference.' Staff at the hospital will receive special training from a social anthropologist on how to handle patients who come into the bar. In addition to wine, it will also stock beer, whiskey and champagne. If the bar in the hospital proves to be a success, it is thought bar could be open in other French hospitals. The news comes as last month it was announced that the French government were to allow bosses the right to ban alcohol from the workplace because it 'threatens the security and the physical and mental well-being of workers.’ France’s employment ministry is responsible for the directive, and a spokesman said ‘alcohol is the biggest psycho-active substance consumed in France’.","Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital to open a bar for terminally ill patients .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A Californian restaurant has banned crying children from its dining room saying they distract other diners. The Old Fisherman's Grotto on Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey has installed signs saying children making loud noises are a distraction to other customers. It adds that children making noise or crying will not be allowed in its dining room. The children's policy stated on the Old Fisherman's Grotto website, which says that children crying or making loud noises are a distraction to other diners . The restaurant's policy, which is also outlined on its website, has caused controversy among parents on the wharf who say that the signs are offensive. It is thought the restaurant put up two of the signs two years ago and have only recently added a third. It states that strollers, high chairs and booster seats will not be permitted in the restaurant. It then says: 'Children crying or making loud noises are a distraction to other diners, and as such are not allowed in the dining room.' One customer, Niki Rieve told KSBW that she was turned away from the restaurant because they would not provide her with a high chair for her six-month-old daughter. She said: 'Usually they cater, at least have a high chair for the child, but it seemed like they didn't want any child. They said the child can't make any noises so they turned us away.' The Old Fisherman's Grotto on Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey, California, which says despite the policy, the business is continuing to grow . But restaurant owner Chris Shake said he is backing the signs and that if customers don't like the policy they can eat elsewhere. He said: 'Let's put it this way, I haven't had a down year for over 20 years. Our business continues to grow.' The restaurant, which has won awards for its clam chowder, isn't the only one to have a policy on young customers. In 2010, the owner of the Olde Salty's in Carolina Beach, North Carolina said they would not tolerate screaming children in their restaurant. While last year The Sushi Restaurant, which opened in a shopping plaza in Alexandria, Virginia banned children from its dining room all together.","Old Fisherman's Grotto in Monterey has banned crying children .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The breastfeeding equipment vending machine, which has been installed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore . Instead of offering drinks and snacks, a vending machine thought to be the first of its kind to offer breastfeeding equipment has been installed at a Baltimore hospital. The machine stocks 14 different types of items including pump accessories, storage bottles and everything else working mothers need to breastfeed their babies. The machine, which took a year to develop has been up and running at the hospital for a little over a month, where it is reported that business has been steady. The idea to create the vending machine with a difference came from Meg Stoltzfus, an employee at the hospital working in the human resources department. And with staff at the hospital having to work unusual hours, she says that it can be a big problem when they have to pump milk during a shift. Walking through an airport she noticed a large number of items for sale in vending machines and she came up with a solution, according to the Baltimore Sun. She then set about putting her idea into practice, which resulted in the new machines. She told the newspaper: 'I worked and pumped as well, so I've made it sort of a mission to help other moms. 'You can get a vending machine company to build you a vending machine to do just about anything.' Working mothers wanting to use the machine just swipe their credit card and then select the product they need. In . addition the machine is linked to the computer of Ms Stoltzfus, meaning . that when it items start to run low, it reminds her to order in more. The machines stock 14 different types of items, meaning working mothers can find everything they need to breastfeed their babies . The new vending machines are part of the hospital's Breastfeeding Support Program, which helps nursing mothers when returning to work. The hospital has 14 dedicated nursing rooms, with the hospital revealing they are visited 23,000 times a year. If the machine proves popular, more could be rolled out in the hospital's other nursing rooms.","Vending machine in Johns Hopkins Hospital thought to be first of its kind .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone has offered to pay £20million in damages to settle his corruption trial in Germany where he faces ten years in prison, according to a local news agency. The 83-year-old's defence team filed a surprise motion at the Munich court today to dismiss the charges in exchange for paying the sum to BayernLB bank, German news agency DPA reported. State prosecutors indicated they were open to the proposal but would have to review it in detail, according to the report which cited Mr Ecclestone's lawyer Sven Thomas. Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone arrives at a court in Munich for his bribery trial earlier today . Today, Mr Ecclestone's defence team is said to have offered to pay £20million in damages to settle the corruption trial . Under German law, prosecutors may withdraw charges even during certain criminal trials if all parties agree to a settlement. The court later said in a statement that the talks between prosecutors and the defence 'on a potential early end to the proceedings have not yet reached a conclusion.' It did not confirm details of the defence offer on the table. Ecclestone is accused of paying German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky £26million in 2006 and 2007 to ensure his continued grip on the motor sports empire he had built up over four decades. Ecclestone is accused of paying German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky £26million in 2006 and 2007 to ensure his continued grip on the motor sports empire he had built up over four decades . Prosecutors allege that the money was a bribe meant to ensure BayernLB sold its shares to Ecclestone's preferred bidder, CVC Capital Partners of Britain, now the sport's majority shareholder. Mr Eccelstone, who went on trial in April and has pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum jail term of 10 years if he is convicted. He admits making the huge payment but says it was not a bribe but rather hush money after a blackmail attempt. Gribkowsky was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in 2012 after being found guilty of corruption. Mr Eccelstone, who went on trial in April and has pleaded not guilty, faces a maximum jail term of 10 years if he is convicted . Mr Ecclestone's lawyers argued today that the criminal case against their client was 'highly dubious' and called the trial 'extremely onerous' for the 83-year-old, whose bouts of ill health have led to delays in the proceedings, DPA said. They said they did not believe BayernLB had suffered any disadvantage related to the sale of the Formula One stake. But they added the settlement offer would stand until August 8 in the hope of wrapping up the trial as soon as possible, after which they would withdraw the proposal and continue to fight the charges in court.

Five-year-old Pomeranian mix Papi was critically injured after his owner Jackelyn Graciano was stabbed and then had her house set ablaze in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Ms Graciano is still in hospital recovering from stab wounds, while her pet has been treated after being rushed to Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston in a critical condition after the fire. Five-year-old Pomeranian mix Papi, who was critically injured and rushed to Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston for treatment . Papi has already underwent major surgery to remove dead tissue from his back and ears and needs another procedure to repair his ankle . He was admitted to the emergency and critical care unit, where doctors first administered pain relief and oxygen. But the extent of his injuries soon became clear after suffering second and third degree burns all along his back, his nose and the inside of his mouth. Earlier this month Papi underwent major surgery to remove dead tissue from his back and ears as well as have his tail removed, which was so badly damaged, it could not be saved. Dr Mike Pavletic who performed the operation said: 'The challenge with Papi is that most of his body is covered in second and third degree burns. He's lost a lot of tissue. The five-year-old Pomeranian mix suffered second and third degree burns all along his back, his nose and the inside of his mouth . It is likely that Papi's care will cost as much as $10,000 but an anonymous donor has already contributed $6,000 towards it . 'The goal of surgery was to use whatever healthy skin he has left to close the gaps.  I'm confident it's gone as well as possible but he'll need at least one more procedure.' His next operation will take place in the coming weeks, where doctors will attempt to repair a damaged ankle, which left untreated could make it difficult and painful for him to walk. The cost of Papi's care is likely to exceed $10,000 but an anonymous donor has already stepped forward with a gift of $6,000 to help offset the cost of the treatment.

New pictures of the inside of the stricken vessel have came to light following the close of the official inquiry into the incident . The Costa Concordia has remained stricken off the island of Giglio since it crashed in 2012 . It is thought that the Moldovan dancer was among several 'unauthorised' people who were on the bridge at the time the Concordia smashed into rocks off the Italian island of Giglio, tearing a 70m hole in its hull, just two hours after starting a Mediterranean cruise . The new pictures of the interior of the wreckage have been released to the media by the Court of Grosseto following the close of the official inquiry into the disaster. Schettino is currently on trial for manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, and abandoning the vessel before all passengers had evacuated. The images also show several other areas inside the crusie ship, which were destroyed in the disaster. In addition footage has also emerged showing divers attaching massive flotation tanks ready to raise the stricken vessel, which is set to make its final voyage to a scrapyard in Genoa on Tuesday.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A premature baby who was born 12 weeks early had to be dressed in teddy bear's clothes to avoid suffocation as she was so small. Mia MacCormack weighed just 2lbs 8oz when she was born in March and had a tiny 10 inch long body. The newborn was so small that even premature babygrows were too big for her and mother Emilie MacCormack was terrified she would suffocate her under layers of clothing. Mia MacCormack, who was born 12 weeks early and was so small, her mother dressed her in clothes for teddy bears . Mother Emilie MacCormack, was terrified of suffocating her daughter under layers of clothing, so dressed her in clothes made for toys . However, the 24-year-old of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire found a novel way of dressing her small daughter by using clothes from teddy bears and dolls. And now the social worker buys babygrows and outfits made for toys, which fit Mia perfectly. She said: 'Mia fitted in the palm of my hand when she was born. 'I tried dressing her in baby grows with drawstrings but they were still huge, and they were all so plain and boring. Even though Mia now weighs 7lbs, the same as the average newborn, her mother still buys her clothes from Toys R Us and she now has a princess outfit, left and her own raincoat, right . 'One afternoon I was struggling to dress her and looked up and saw a teddy bear dressed in a purple fairy dress. 'It seemed the perfect answer so I took it off the bear and gently put it on Mia. It fitted perfectly and I no longer panicked that she would suffocate herself.' In England and Wales, 7.2 per cent of births are to premature babies, who are born before 37 weeks of gestation, with 1.3 per cent born before 28 weeks of pregnancy. A baby born at 23 weeks only has a 17 per cent survival rate, but this increases for every week more the baby spends in the womb. By 26 weeks the baby has a 50 per cent survival rate, and by 28 weeks, when Mia was born, the survival rate is 90 per cent. Babies born after 34 weeks of pregnancy have almost the same rate of survival as a full-term baby. Survival rates of very premature babies born before 28 weeks of pregnancy have been rising, and have increased by 13 per cent since 1995. After making her discovery, the single mother began taking clothes from Build-a-Bears and Baby Annabelle toys and now Mia's wardrobe consists of outfits ranging from those for a princess to a pilot. She even has a miniature raincoat for the bad weather. Now at four months, Mia weighs 7lbs, the average size for a newborn. But unlike most mothers who turn to Mothercare for their children's clothes, Miss MacCormack is still shopping in Toys R Us. She added: 'People always think she's a doll, so that gave me an idea. I started buying Baby Annabelle clothes from Toys R Us because they're the same size. 'Also, once she grows out of the outfits I can put them back on her teddies, so it's cost effective too.' In May 2012, Miss MacCormack, then 22, was diagnosed with unicornuate uterus syndrome - meaning her womb is split in two, increasing her chances of miscarrying and premature labour. The condition came to light after the birth of her first son Kai, now two, who was born at just 27 weeks, weighing 2lb 2oz. Miss MacCormack also dressed Mia in clothes designed for dolls such as those meant for Baby Annabelle toys . Miss MacCormack says she got the idea of using clothes for toys after people told her Mia was so small, she looked like a doll . Though Kai pulled through after three months in hospital, doctors told her it would be almost impossible for her to conceive again. In spite of this she fell pregnant in November 2013 and decided to carry on with the pregnancy, despite fears she could miscarry or give birth early. Earlier this year, the now mother-of-two went into labour at 28 weeks and Mia was born. She spent the first six weeks of her life on the antenatal ward at Barnet Hospital. Mia had to spend the first six weeks of her life in Barnet Hospital and had a tiny 10 inch body . Mia, pictured shortly after being born, has also battled blood poisoning and two bleeds in her brain . But against all the odds, she has pulled through and now lives with her mother and her older brother. Mia has also battled blood poisoning and two bleeds in her brain which means she'll need regular brain scans for the rest of her life to check for damage. In addition, she is also awaiting open heart surgery to fix a 3mm hole in her heart. But Miss MacCormack added: 'Despite her health problems, doctors believe she's got a normal chance at life. 'We have to take every day as it comes but I'm confident her and her brother continue to grow into healthy, happy children.'","Mia MacCormack weighed just 2lbs 8oz when she was born 12 weeks early .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A woman who lost her engagement ring 38 years ago after her daughter buried it in the garden has finally been reunited with it thanks to posting an old photo on Facebook. Grandmother Jackie Cook, 66, never expected to see the treasured band again after her daughter Clare buried it in the garden as a three-year-old in 1976. Mrs Cook, and her husband Benjamin, 69, unsuccessfully scoured the grounds of their home but left the ring behind when they moved a new home in the same Kent village of Halling in 1983. Toni Crouch, left, returns the engagement ring to Jackie Cook, who lost it after her daughter buried it in the garden 38 years ago . She thought she would never see the ring again but amazingly she was reunited with it this week after the new occupants of her old house found the ring. The find happened after Mrs Cook came across some photos of her old farm where she lived and posted them on Facebook. They were then seen by Toni Crouch, 29, who recognised the farm as her own childhood home. She immediately messaged Mrs Cook, and told her how she had found a gold ring in the back garden of the property when she was a child. Miss Crouch, who now lives a short distance away in Sittingbourne, said she kept it because she thought it was special to someone. She then sent a picture of the jewellery to an overjoyed Mrs Cook, who confirmed it was indeed her long-lost engagement ring. Mrs Cook, a supermarket worker, said: 'When she told me she’d found it, I just filled up and cried and cried. I couldn’t believe she found it in that garden by sheer chance. The ring, left, was buried in the garden of Mrs Cook's old house, right. It came to light again after she posted this picture of the house on Facebook . 'I know it’s hard to believe but I had dreamed about the ring the week before and have to say I believe in fate. 'Toni said she kept it because she just had a feeling it was special to someone. 'She is such a lovely girl, she could have sold it but she kept it and I’m so grateful. 'Apart from when my grandchildren were born, this is the happiest day of my life. 'And the ring still fits. There diamond in it is missing, but we don’t care how much it costs to replace it. Finding my ring is priceless.' Jackie, who also has a son called Benjamin, 37, recalled: 'We were on a farm so when we were collecting chickens and doing all that sort of work I would keep my wedding ring on but put my engagement ring into my jewellery box. 'I took Clare out to the garden and asked her to tell me where she put it, but the garden is absolutely massive and she was all over the place, she was only three. Mrs Cook, a supermarket worker, pictured, said she cried when she was told her ring had been found . Benjamin Cook puts the found engagement ring back on wife Jackie's finger. They are now planning to get a new diamond for it . 'I just gave up all hope. It was of enormous emotional value to me and for years I did not replace it. 'Benjamin and I had chosen the ring together two years before we got married.' Mrs Cook's husband a former gamekeeper, is now planning to get a new diamond for Jackie’s ring. The couple have also given Toni a bouquet and bracelet to say thank you. Miss Crouch said: 'It’s so wonderful to make somebody so happy. 'We shall certainly be in touch. We shall be friends for life.” And Mrs Cook's daughter Clare, who is now 41 is also relieved her mother has been reunited with the ring. She explained: 'Not once did my mum tell me off. I actually remember doing it and I always felt bad about it and apologised. 'I’m so glad the ring was found again, it is so lucky.'","Jackie Cook lost her engagement ring when her daughter buried it in garden .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A man is recovering in hospital after being stabbed in the genitals outside a controversial Pound Pub, which offers pints for as little as £1.50. The victim, aged in his 50s, is thought to have been involved in a row in the pub in Atherton in Wigan on Monday night. The altercation continued outside the premises on Market Street just after 9pm and an ambulance was called after reports the man has suffered a stab wound to his groin. The man was stabbed in the genitals outside the Pound Pub in Atherton, Wigan, pictured, on Monday night . He was treated at the scene before being taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where his condition is not thought to be life-threatening. A spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service confirmed they had treated a man who had been wounded in 'his central location'. Greater Manchester Police also confirmed they were continuing to investigate the assault. A spokeswoman said: 'The man has been taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening.' One local, Joe Ross, 37, told the Leigh Journal: 'A lot of people have been talking about what happened but it has been turning into Chinese whispers. It is thought the man had been involved in a row inside the pub and the altercation continued outside the premises . 'The man’s injuries are a man’s worst nightmare. A man inflicting an injury like that on another man is just sickening, it’s wrong. I can’t think about it without feeling ill myself.' The Pound Pub, which sells half pints of beer, lager and cider for £1 and pints for £1.50 opened in Atherton in May. Concerns were raised from other licensees in the town fearing an increase in alcohol-fuelled trouble, while some residents of Atherton criticised the pub for taking advantage of 'vulnerable' drinkers and lowering the tone of the town. The local council had also raised fears that the pub would encourage 'irresponsible' problem drinking and threaten public health. But at the time of opening, publican Dave Sutton, 31, said: 'At the end of the day, if you can only drink ten pints at £3, you are still only going to be able to drink that if they’re £1.50. The Pound Pub, which sells half pints of beer, lager and cider for £1 and pints for £1.50 opened in Atherton in May . 'We don’t encourage people to get drunk and there’s been no more trouble. In fact the pub is already going very well and the customers seem to be happy. 'The other pubs in the town are not so happy but that’s not our fault. That’s just because throughout the day we have the majority of customers in the town in here. 'Pubs around the country are shutting all the time so something has to be done - and this could be it.' A second Pound Pub is also open in Stockton on Tees, with plans for more of the discount pubs to open nationwide.","Man was stabbed in the genitals outside the pub in Atherton, Wigan .
