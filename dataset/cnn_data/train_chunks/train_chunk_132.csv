"(CNN) -- Brazilian club Corinthians are champions of South America for the first time after a 3-1 aggregate defeat of Argentina's Boca Juniors in the final of the Copa Libertadores. After a 1-1 draw in last week's first leg in Buenos Aires, two goals from Brazil-born Qatar striker Emerson gave coach Tite's Corinthians a 2-0 second-leg win in Sao Paulo. Wednesday's historic win over six-time champions Boca ensured Corinthians' qualification for December's FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. It also means South America's premier club competition has been won by a Brazilian team in each of the last three years, following on from Santos in 2011 and Internacional. Are FIFA's world rankings fit for purpose? ""I am very happy because we know the history Boca Juniors have in worldwide football and in the Copa Libertadores,"" Emerson told Fox Sports. ""Our crowd represents 33 million fans. Since this year's Libertadores started, we have dreamt of clinching the title. We were all in need of this achievement."" Corinthians' undefeated campaign was powered by five goals from the 33-year-old Emerson, as well as four goals from attacking midfielder Danilo -- who won the title with Sau Paulo in 2005. On a disappointing day for Boca, midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme also announced Wednesday's game would be his final appearance for the club. The 34-year-old began his career with Boca before spending six years in Spain with Barcelona and most notably Villarreal. The former Argentina international returned to Boca in 2008, helping his first club to two domestic titles to go with his three earlier Libertadores successes (2000-01, 2007). ""This afternoon, I spoke with the president and informed him that I would not continue,"" Riquelme told reporters. ""I am very grateful to the club and the team, I know I am, but I have nothing left to give the club, I'm empty. The relationship I share with Boca is great, I'm a fan of this club but now I have reached the end of the road. ""Now I just want to go home, have a barbecue with my friends, see my children and greet them. All I ask is for forgiveness from my child that I could not win the cup again.""","Corinthians win the Copa Libertadores for the first time after beating Boca Juniors .

"(CNN) -- International envoy Kofi Annan said Tuesday he sees Iran as a factor in diplomatic efforts to forge peace in Syria, a stance not shared by the United States. ""I think Iran can play a positive role,"" Annan said during a news conference with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi in Tehran. His remarks came a day after he met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus. Annan said al-Assad agreed on ""an approach"" to ending the 16 months of bloodshed in his country. World powers have deplored al-Assad's government for its assaults against civilians. But the diplomatic wranglings, such as Annan's recent Action Group meeting in Geneva and the U.S. and Arab-backed Friends of Syria initiative, have failed to stop the killings of thousands since March 2011. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria recorded at least 68 deaths Tuesday. The U.N. and Arab League special envoy to Syria, Annan is visiting leaders in the region to find ways to implement his six-point peace plan, an initiative that has yet to gain traction. Annan said he believes Iran can play a key role in helping end the violence in Syria. Tehran is a friend and ally of the al-Assad regime, but the United States and other nations exploring peace moves in Syria have opposed Iranian participation in the diplomacy. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell cited ""Iran's destructive behavior in Syria,"" a reference to its support for the government's fierce offensive against its opponents. ""We want them to stop that destructive behavior,"" Ventrell told reporters Monday. ""And so, of course, Kofi Annan in Tehran, to the extent that he can stress to the Iranians the importance of cooperating with the plan, that's a good thing. But we haven't seen signs of that either yet."" ""If the Iranian regime wants to stop giving direct material support to the Syrian killing machine, then -- and play a constructive role -- we would welcome that. We're not at that point yet."" Annan, however, says that ""Iran has a role to play."" ""Here I am talking to Minister Salehi and seeking the support and cooperation of Iran in my efforts to resolve this conflict peacefully,"" he said. Asked about his meeting on Monday with al-Assad, Annan said the two discussed efforts to end violence, but he didn't want to mention details until he talked with opposition leaders. Al-Assad ""made a suggestion of building an approach from the ground up in some of the districts where we have extreme violence -- to try and contain the violence in those districts and, step by step, build up and end the violence across the country."" Peace moves have failed to get off the ground at the United Nations and among Western and Arab nations, despite world outrage over Syria's brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. ""The political process is yet to begin, a political process that would bring all parties to the table. And this is one of the key points of the six-point plan,"" Annan said. ""And I think that the essence of the six-point plan is stopping the violence, releasing detainees, allowing humanitarian access -- which should be seen as a package, a package that if complemented will help create the environment and the conducive climate for political talks -- political talks between the Syrians to determine their own political future."" Russia also supports an Iranian role in Syria. While members of the U.N. Security Council, which includes the United States, have called for an end to the violence and for al-Assad to step aside, efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by Russia and China, key Syrian trade partners. Moscow and Beijing are strongly opposed to armed intervention, saying the outcome in Syria should be decided by its people. Russia, in fact, said it will not deliver new weapons to Syria as long as the situation in that country is unstable, an official at the body in charge of monitoring Russia's arms trade said Monday, according to state media. It had been the longtime principal supplier of arms to Syria since the days when it was the Soviet Union. Two Russian military transport ships were scheduled to transit through the Dardenelles Strait Tuesday, on their way to their expected destination, the Syrian port of Tartous, a U.S. official said. The ships -- the the Filchenkov and Kunikov -- had been closely watched by U.S. intelligence for the last several weeks while docked in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. The Russians have said any weapons and personnel on board the ship are for reinforcement of the Tartous facility. Annan went to Baghdad later Tuesday for talks on Syria with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. As the conflict persists, Syrians are fleeing to neighboring countries such as Iraq and to safe places in their own country. There's been a ""significant increase"" in the flight of refugees to Jordan in the last two weeks and authorities are working on the development of large sites to accommodate them, Andrew Harper, head of the U.N. refugee agency in Jordan, told CNN Tuesday. He said there are about 130,000 Syrians in Jordan but not all of them are refugees. He said about 50,000 need assistance, but authorities are concerned that the number will continue to grow. Daraa, one of the major Syrian cities engulfed in violence, is near Jordan.

"Washington (CNN) -- An alleged Somali pirate leader has been indicted for the takeover of the yacht Quest and the kidnapping of four Americans who subsequently were killed during the incident. Mohammad Saaili Shibin, 50, appeared at a detention hearing in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, on Wednesday afternoon after the indictment against him was unsealed. He will remain in federal custody. ""Today marks the first time that the U.S. government has captured and charged an alleged pirate in a leadership role -- a hostage negotiator who operated in Somalia,""   said U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride in a written statement. MacBride went on to say the arrest and charges against Shibin should ""send a strong message to all pirates that they are not beyond the reach of the FBI, whether they board the ships or remain on-shore in Somalia."" According to the indictment,  one of the alleged pirates aboard the Quest identified Shibin as the person who would negotiate the terms for the release of the four Americans. The document says Shibin did Internet research about the hostages on the Quest ""to determine the amount of ransom to demand and the identity of family members of the hostages whom he could contact about the ransom."" An FBI official said Shibin was arrested in Somalia on April 4 by ""host nation security."" FBI agents were at the scene of the arrest, though law enforcement officials would not provide details beyond that the FBI worked with Somali forces on the ground. Shibin and 14 co-conspirators are charged with piracy, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and possession and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. The men are scheduled to go on trial November 29 and they face a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted. The U.S. military and an FBI negotiator had been trying to win the safe release of the hostages aboard the Quest. The February hijacking off the coast of Oman ended when some of the pirates on the yacht allegedly shot and killed Americans Scott and Jean Adam, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle.","Four Americans died during the hijacking of a yacht in February .

"Farnborough, England (CNN) -- Every second year, the small town of Farnborough in South East England plays host to the biggest names of the aviation world. Exhibitors and vistors mingle with the latest technology to hit the skies. While the economy remains bleak, a smaller number of orders from plane constructors like Airbus and Boeing than previous years is expected. But huge advances have been made in aerospace technology with Virgin Galactic (showing the SpaceShipTwo for the first time in Europe) and SpaceX looking to steal the show from other exhibitors. Not to be outdone, plane manufacturer Boeing returned to Farnborough with its first aerial display in 28 years staging a rare UK flypast of its new 787 Dreamliner. The Qatar Airlines-liveried Dreamliner roared into the skies over the Farnborough Airshow for an aerial demonstration lasting a brief seven minutes, before touching back down on the tarmac. The Qatar Airways version of the 787 will soon be entering service on Middle Eastern routes before operating on a Doha-London service -- although the schedule has yet to be confirmed.

"(CNN) -- Soon after I was elected to Congress, an issue came to the House floor to which I had given considerable thought and believed that my conclusions were sound, reasonable and persuasive. At the front of the House chamber, directly in front of the elevated rostrum from which the Speaker presides, are two lecterns. One is positioned to the right of center, facing Democrats, and one to the left of center, facing Republicans. Because I felt that most of my fellow Republicans would surely share my views, I decided to present my reasoning to the Democrats, who I had hoped to impress favorably. So, in giving my very first congressional speech I stood at the lectern facing the Democrats. I was greeted with an audible gasp from both sides of the aisle. Just as Republicans must drink their coffee, read their newspapers and slurp their soup in a room off the House floor, and Democrats do their reading, drinking and eating in a different room, members of the two parties must speak from different places, using different microphones positioned as an extension of their own side of the partisan divide. It surprises me still to hear people express amazement at the hyper-partisan nature of Congress and its resulting inability to deal collectively with the nation's problems. In a constitutional system that places most of the federal government's real power with the peoples' representatives, that is a serious problem. But it's not an accident. It's a direct result of the systems we've created to choose those representatives and the way Congress itself has been allowed to develop not as a single body of Americans but as a pit for rival power-seeking clubs to do battle. The leaders of the House and Senate are partisans; but they needn't be, and in other governments they aren't. The committee staffs are partisans; there's no need for that, either. Partisan leaders decide who sits on which committees, transferring enormous power over federal law to partisans who win their positions by pledging to support the party line and plowing hundreds of thousands of dollars into party treasuries (some of it raised from interest groups that are pleased to help out). But as they say on those late-night infomercials, ""Wait, there's more."" The problem doesn't begin in Congress. It begins with how men and women are elected to Congress in the first place. To even appear on the November ballot, candidates must navigate through primaries either entirely the province of partisan activists (closed primaries) or dominated by them (so-called cross-over primaries). Most states have ""sore loser"" laws (supported by the parties) that then prohibit anybody who ran in a party primary and lost from appearing on the general election ballot. If 30,000 supporters secure a primary victory for one candidate, anybody who lost that primary would then be unavailable as an option for the rest of the state's voters. In Delaware, that is precisely what happened to former governor Mike Castle. Except it didn't really happen to Mike Castle; it happened to the people of Delaware who were denied the chance to choose the person most would have wanted to represent them in the Senate. And it happened to Sen. Richard Lugar in Indiana, who, like Castle, was unacceptable to hard-line activists because he actually believed in the kinds of compromise that are necessary to govern a nation of more than 300 million people. In most states, candidates for the U.S. House run in districts shaped by partisan leaders for party advantage, regardless of the effect on the rights of the people to be represented by somebody familiar with their concerns and interests. That's how I, a city dweller with no rural experience, found myself representing farmers, ranchers and small-town merchants after a legislature dominated by a different party redrew my district to stretch from the middle of Oklahoma to the Kansas border and then, in an upside-down ""L"" halfway to Arkansas, all to strengthen their party in other districts. Even the new infusion of big dollars into political campaigns has a distinctly partisan flavor -- the largest super PACs are not really independent; they're being run by long-time party activists. Incentives work. We've created a system that rewards incivility and punishes cooperation. Is it any wonder that our government is a mess? Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison all warned us not to create political parties. We should have listened. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mickey Edwards.","Mickey Edwards: Don't be surprised at the hyper-partisan nature of Congress .

"(CNN) -- Early this year, comic book writer Nathan Edmondson set out to tell fictional stories based on the super-secret U.S. government paramilitary organization once named the Intelligence Support Activity (or ISA). But it turns out what Edmonson created from his wildest imaginations hues pretty close to reality about the little known, seldom discussed agency. His stories focused on a specialized subset of the organization that was a ""technologically advanced, mixed-gender team of first responders with backgrounds in a variety of military and spy disciplines."" In reality, the ISA has been around since the 1970s. Originally hidden from the Pentagon and Congress, its existence has never publicly or officially been acknowledged. ""The ISA is a secret kept from the Army, it's even a secret kept from itself,"" said Edmondson. ""If you're in the ISA, you may not know who else is in it. It's the military equivalent of telling a story about aliens in space. You're reaching out for that great mystery, that void to see what you can pull out of it."" The mystery around the group alone seemed like a natural for storytelling. Then a funny thing happened as Edmondson started publishing the Image Comics title: He got a lot of things right. ""There were parts of this group that we crafted as fiction that we later found out were not as fictional as we thought,"" the writer told CNN. Once Edmondson discovered this, he made a point to have the right people consulting on every issue. He reached out to a few contacts from his days having worked in Washington, as well as the U.S. Army Entertainment Liaison office. ""We're [often] working with some special ops group, whether it's Green Berets or PSYOPS Delta. We don't let an issue go by without consulting people to see how we can make the issue richer in terms of special ops activity."" The most recent issue, ""The Activity"" #7, had the participation of Navy SEALs, who co-plotted a major scene in the story. ""What happens in this particular scene has a domino effect on the rest of this book,"" he said. ""We contacted some rather elite Navy SEALs -- in fact, we can't say with whom we consulted. We were instructed not to,"" he said. ""We gave them our scenario and asked how we would go about doing it. They gave us a step by step of how they would execute this mission, down to things they would say or not say. The first 10 pages goes into what the SEALs told us, down to gear and weaponry too."" If you haven't heard about the ISA, that's by design, as Edmondson pointed out when describing how he researched this idea for a comic book. ""I'd been reading a lot about Delta Force or as they're more commonly referred to, 'The Unit' [the subjects of a recent CBS TV series]. In the course of reading about them I discovered some things about the ISA - their name changes every year to protect them. They are commonly known as Orange, the counter-terrorism of Delta Force -- they wanted a group in the army who could do all these things. You can go a lot of places with that,"" Edmondson said, talking about possible story ideas. Edmondson said that many of his ideas come out of conversations he has with those involved in various special ops areas. He has also done various panels at conventions with members of the special warfare community. Comic books and the military have been connected going back to troops reading them in World War II to Marvel Comics' recent special issues for service members. Edmondson's writing on this and other books such as ""Dancer"" has gained him a following in the comics world, but it goes beyond that with ""Activity."" ""We have an e-mail account set up into which we receive e-mails from soldiers all over who appreciate the accuracy and attention to detail. Officially working with the military on this is tricky as they cannot to this day acknowledge the existence of the ISA, but we have received much support in general regarding simply our respectfulness of the armed forces."" Edmondson will also be visiting a few military bases in the near future.","Nathan Edmondson set out to write fictional account of super secret U.S. troops .

"(CNN) -- The gunman who killed two others before police ended his life in a shootout near Texas A&M University had been battling mental health issues on and off for years, his mother said. Police say Thomas Caffall, known to his family as ""Tres,"" killed a constable and a bystander and injured four others Monday before police fatally shot him. His mother, Linda Weaver, said the family became worried after Caffall quit his job in January and announced that he would never work again. 3 killed in shootings near Texas A&M . ""We had been very concerned about him,"" Weaver told CNN. Caffall had withdrawn from the family, and the fear was that he might attempt suicide, his mother said. But she never imagined that her son would hurt anyone else, or that his end would come so violently. ""Losing a child is a parent's worst nightmare. This is worse,"" she said. Police said Caffall, 35, shot and killed Brian Bachmann, a constable for Brazos County, and Chris Northcliffe, an area resident. Bachmann had approached Caffall's apartment to deliver an eviction notice, and Northcliffe just happened to be nearby. Also nearby was Rigo Cisneros, a former Army medic who assisted both Bachmann and Caffall after the shooting. As he lay dying, the gunman offered an apology for what he had done, Cisneros told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""He did ask me to apologize to the officer he had shot,"" he said. Three College Station police officers and a woman were injured in the shooting, police said. The woman, Barbara Holdsworth, was in serious condition after undergoing surgery. Investigators on Tuesday continued to process the crime scene. The area covers ""a couple of blocks,"" College Station Police Chief Jeff Capps said. The suspect ""fired multiple rounds and investigators have recovered long guns and a pistol from the scene,"" he said. As the incident unfolded Monday, an alert warning of a gunman was sent out by Texas A&M, one of the state's flagship universities and a sprawling campus of nearly 47,000 students. According to his Facebook campaign page, Bachmann was a 41-year-old from College Station who had been a Brazos County sheriff's deputy since 1993. The county's website indicated that his four-year term as constable -- an elected position that involves, among other duties, serving court documents such as eviction notices and subpoenas to citizens -- was set to expire on December 31, 2014. Warning signs of violence: What to do . Bachmann was an up-and-coming law enforcement leader who some expected to run for sheriff one day, said Marc Hamlin, the district clerk for Brazos County and friend of the slain constable for more than 20 years. ""He was a true public servant,"" Hamlin told CNN. Whenever a group wanted a law enforcement officer or squad car for a community event, Bachmann was always the first to volunteer, Hamlin said. He also volunteered to help his friends. On Monday, Bachmann had lunch with his chief deputy, who had to deliver the eviction notice at the nearby residence afterward. Bachmann took the notice and volunteered to serve it himself, Hamlin said. A search of court records showed no record of Caffall having run-ins with the law except for a traffic violation. Caffall's mother described her son as an intelligent youth who wasted opportunities available to him. ""It's so hard to imagine that the really sweet kid you raised turned into a huge monster, and that is what he is now,"" Weaver said. He enjoyed collecting weapons and refinishing them, Weaver said, so his owning guns wasn't worrisome, his mother said. Weaver said Caffall had been very affected by the death of his father when he was 12. She said it is hard to comprehend how the same person would deprive Bachmann's children of their father. Bachmann's three children -- ages 19, 10 and 8 -- would accompany their father on mission trips in Texas. On a recent trip, they built wheelchair ramps and roofs, Hamlin said. ""He was strong in his faith and strong in his family,"" he said. Less is known about Caffall. He was divorced, and was in the constant companionship of a large Sheltie-mix named Lucy, his mother said. Lucy's fate is unclear. Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers .

"(CNN) -- Somebody in Michigan may be very happy soon. The winning ticket for the estimated $337 million Powerball jackpot was purchased at a Sunoco gas station in Lapeer, Michigan, said Andi Brancato, a spokesman for the Michigan lottery. The lucky person has not yet been identified. The winning numbers were 6, 27, 46, 51, 56 and 21. The $337 million jackpot was the seventh-largest ever in America and the third-largest for Powerball, Brancato said. Eight other tickets won the $1 million Match 5 prize. Two of those tickets were bought in Indiana, and the others in Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Virginia, lottery officials said. Why you keep playing the lottery . The prize for the national lottery -- held in 42 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia -- swelled Saturday after no one hit all six numbers. The game's largest prize to date was $365 million, which was awarded in 2006 to a group of eight co-workers at a Nebraska meat-packing plant. In 2005, a group of four in Oregon won a $340 million jackpot, considered the second-largest. Those record drawings happened when the cost for a Powerball ticket was $1. In January, the price increased to $2, with officials saying it would lead to an increased number of large jackpots. At the same time, the odds improved somewhat because officials reduced the number of red balls, the powerballs, from 39 to 35. Earlier this year, Louise White, an 81-year-old Rhode Island resident, came forward as the winner of a $336.4 million prize, the third-largest prize claimed so far in the game's history. ""I'm very happy and I'm very proud,"" she said. ""We are truly blessed. Thank you.""

He 's a good reporter and news anchor and the fact that he likes men, does not change my opinion of him."" But there was also an important discussion sparked by Cooper's decision to share his e-mail to Sullivan with the world: Why is it important for people to acknowledge their sexuality in the first place? • Commenter Puddin wrote the question this way: ""I have wanted to ask this question for a long time: why do people who are gay or lesbian, etc. feel they have to announce it? I have never heard a straight person do this. No one has a need to know!"" The responses, from fellow CNN.com commenters, were varied: . • Jeff: ""Because people ask. When people stop caring enough to no longer ask because it doesn't matter then gays will stop 'announcing it.' (coming out.)."" • wcbhwk: ""Couple of good reasons. First, the more people who do this, especially prominent people in our society, the more others will understand that being gay is not that unusual. Second, and more importantly, through our close mindedness and repression, both tacit and direct, we have forced many of those who are gay to live this aspect of their lives secretively. It takes courage to be openly gay, even today. While that is sad, it is still reality. So by showing courage to come out publicly, it sends a message to others to also have courage.""

"New York (CNN) -- Trinidad native Kareem Ibrahim was convicted Thursday of conspiring to detonate fuel tanks and a fuel pipeline at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to a statement from the U.S. Eastern District Court of New York. Ibrahim was one of three men arrested in the 2007 plot, after a government informant infiltrated the group and taped its conversations, and he now faces the possibility of life behind bars. Co-conspirators Abdul Kadir and Russell Defreitas earlier received life sentences in the plot. The leader of the Shiite Muslim community in Trinidad and Tobago, Ibrahim provided religious and operational support to the men plotting the attack, according to prosecutors. In one recorded conversation he advised that the men must be ready to ""fight it out, kill who you could kill and go back to Allah."" Defreitas, who authorities say was the mastermind behind the plan, had extensive knowledge of the JFK Airport where he worked as a cargo handler and in 2006 recruited Ibrahim, Kadir and Abdel Nur to join him in the plot . According to the statement from U.S. Eastern District Court of New York, Ibrahim ""believed the attack would cause extensive damage to the airport and to the United States economy, as well as the loss of innocent lives."" The specific charges Ibrahim was convicted of were conspiracy to attack a public transportation system, conspiracy to destroy a building by fire or explosive, conspiracy to attack aircraft and aircraft materials, conspiracy to destroy international airport facilities and conspiracy to attack a mass transportation facility, the statement said. Last August, Defreitas and Kadir were convicted by a federal jury in New York. Defreitas was found guilty on all six counts against him: conspiring to attack a public transportation system, to destroy a building or other real property by fire or explosive, to attack aircraft and aircraft materials, to destroy or damage international airport facilities and to attack a mass transportation facility, and surveillance of a mass transportation facility. Kadir was found guilty on five of the counts, but not guilty on the count of surveillance of mass transportation facility. In response to the decision in Ibrahim's case Thursday, U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch said in a statement, ""In pursuit of a radical terrorist agenda, bent on the destruction of John F. Kennedy Airport and the murder of innocent civilians, Imam Kareem Ibrahim abandoned the true tenets of his religion."" ""We will continue to seek out and bring to justice all those who plot to attack the United States and its people,"" she added. Nur pleaded guilty last June to providing material support to a terrorist conspiracy and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.","Imam Kareem Ibrahim was convicted of planning to blow up JFK airport .

"(CNN) -- Seven American service members were among the 11 people killed in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan on Thursday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. Three members of the Afghan National Security Forces and an Afghan civilian interpreter also died in the crash of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. Some of the U.S. troops killed are believed to be special operations forces, according to Pentagon officials. The cause of the crash is under investigation, ISAF said. Pentagon officials added that investigators will look into the possibility that the aircraft was shot down or suffered a mechanical failure. The helicopter was on patrol when it went down in the Chinarto area of Shah Wali Kut district in Kandahar province, the Kandahar governor's office said in a statement. It's not clear whether the helicopter was in the area because of military operations, the office said. But military analyst Bill Roggio told CNN he thinks the helicopter could have been involved in a raid, a resupply mission or some sort of special operation because both Afghans and Americans from two different commands were aboard the flight. Four of the Americans were classified as ISAF service members, and the other three were from United States Forces-Afghanistan. In a separate incident Thursday, ISAF said another service member died after a bombing in southern Afghanistan. The nationality of the victim was not released. The violence comes two days after one of the bloodiest days in Afghanistan so far this year, with three separate attacks leaving at least 47 people dead and as many as 145 wounded, according to government and police officials. Six other helicopter crashes involving Operation Enduring Freedom, the official name for the U.S. operation in Afghanistan, occurred this year, according to a CNN count. Sixteen Americans died in the first five crashes: six in January, four in April and two each in May, June, and July. Four of the crashes occurred in Afghanistan and one was in Oman. The ones in May and June involved hostilities, and the others have been classified as non-hostile, authorities said. And in March, 12 Turkish service members died in a helicopter crash in Kabul province. Last August, 30 Americans and eight Afghans died when the Taliban downed a helicopter near Kabul. Of the 30 killed, 22 were Navy personnel. Seventeen of them were members of the SEALs. The stories of those who lost their lives in the Chinook crash . The other eight U.S. troops killed were three Air Force forward air controllers and five Army helicopter crew members. Roggio -- the managing editor of Long War Journal, a blog that reports and analyzes the war against terror -- said ""historically, the number of crashes and shootdowns have been relatively low"" during the war. ""They are going to happen. They happen in training,"" he said. Current figures are low, he said, compared to the Afghan war against the Soviets in the 1980s when the CIA, he said, supplied and trained jihadis in the use of Stinger missiles, the surface-to-air weapons. What's different today, Roggio said, is that Taliban militants don't have the same level of equipment, coalition helicopter crews perform better and the aircraft receive excellent maintenance.

"(CNN) -- Great Britain and Ecuador remained in a standoff early Friday, following the South American nation's decision to grant Julian Assange asylum -- a decision British authorities are refusing to honor, saying they are committed to extraditing the WikiLeaks founder to Sweden. According to the official Twitter feed of WikiLeaks -- a website that's published hundreds of thousands of once-secret U.S. government documents -- there were ""over 35 police surrounding the Ecuadorian embassy in London"" soon after 12:30 a.m. Friday. Britain's foreign ministry, though, earlier countered that there was a larger ""police presence outside the British Embassy in Quito"" than at the Ecuadorian mission in London. Inside the latter embassy is Assange, the Australian national wanted in Sweden to face questioning over claims of rape and sexual molestation, as he's been since first seeking asylum in June. What's next for Assange's extradition battle? On Thursday, he thanked his ""courageous, independent"" Ecuadorian hosts for protecting him ""from persecution,"" after its Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño announced his nation was giving asylum to Assange and urged British authorities to let him travel freely to South America. Outlining why the asylum request was granted, Patiño said his nation has a credible fear Assange -- who was described as an activist for freedom of the press and freedom of expression -- will be silenced if sent to Sweden and, perhaps eventually, the United States. The minister specifically expressed concerns that if Assange were extradited to the United States, he might face charges of treason or espionage and, if convicted, be sentenced to death. In the United States -- where Assange hasn't been charged with anything, for now -- there are no guarantees Assange would receive a fair trial or that he wouldn't be subject to a military or secret tribunal, Patiño said. ""There are strong indications of retaliation by the country or countries who produced the information divulged by Mr. Assange, reprisals that could put at risk his security, integrity and even his life,"" the Ecuadorian government concluded. Timeline: Assange's extradition battle . U.S. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd on Thursday offered ""no comment on Julian Assange or the dispute over his asylum between Ecuadorian and UK authorities."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that the Justice Department is conducting an ""active, ongoing criminal investigation"" into the WikiLeaks disclosure of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents relating to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and about 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables. Assange and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. It is unclear if Assange could be charged with treason in the United States or what sentence he'd face if convicted. Those convicted of treason in the United States may be sentenced to between five years in prison up to death, according to federal law published on the U.S. House of Representatives' website. But the law only applies to those ""owing allegiance to the United States."" A death sentence also can be imposed on those convicted of espionage by communicating certain sensitive information to a ""foreign government"" or other such faction ""with intent or reason"" to harm the United States, according to U.S. federal law. But there are death penalty restrictions for that crime. Like other left-leaning Latin American leaders such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolivia's Evo Morales and Cuba's Fidel Castro, Ecuador President Rafael Correa has railed against the United States as an ""imperial power that has to be checked,"" said Robert Amsterdam, a Canadian international lawyer who's worked on high-profile cases involving Latin America, Russia and Thailand. Correa, an economist who earned two academic degrees in the United States and is up for re-election next February, said in an interview with Assange earlier this year on the activist's TV show: ""I love and admire the American people a great deal ... But I will always call a spade a spade."" The Ecuadorian president also hasn't hesitated to poke Britain, as he did in calling for sanctions in February against that nation over its long-running dispute with Argentina over who owns the Falkland Islands. That UK-Ecuador dispute is the focal point of the current tension, with both nations appearing firm in their positions. Assange embassy gamble follows famous precedents . Britain is disappointed by Ecuador's decision and will continue to ""carry out (its) obligation"" to arrest and extradite Assange to Sweden, with the UK Foreign Office saying ""the Ecuadorian government's decision this afternoon does not change that."" British Foreign Minister William Hague added his nation won't provide safe passage for Assange, and that the UK had ""painstakingly"" assured the Ecuadorians that his human rights would be protected. ""It is important to understand that this is not about Mr. Assange's activities at WikiLeaks or the attitude of the United States of America. He is wanted in Sweden to answer allegations of serious sexual offenses,"" Hagues said. Assange was arrested in Britain in 2010 because Swedish authorities wanted to question him about the allegations. Two women accused him of sexually assaulting them during an August 2010 visit to Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. Assange denies the allegations and argues they are in retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. Patiño jabbed British authorities for sending a written notice to Ecuador that they would ""assault"" his country's embassy in London if Ecuadorian officials failed to hand over Assange. The British say one of their laws allow for them to enter the embassy and arrest Assange. Patiño cited a laundry list of international treaties and conventions that he said make it clear that it is illegal to enter another country's embassy. The UK, in effect, is saying ""we are going to savagely hit you depending on how you behave,"" Patiño said. Why Assange needs Ecuador and Ecuador needs Assange . Yet the next confrontation may not be at the embassy, but in court. ""What the United Kingdom must do is apply the diplomatic obligations of the (U.N.) Refugee Convention and let him leave with a safe conduct pass,"" said Baltasar Garzon, a former Spanish judge who said he is working pro bono as coordinator of Assange's defense team, by e-mail from Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. ""If not, we will go to the International Court of Justice."" Garzon is a well-known crusading human rights judge who ordered the arrest of ex-Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in London in 1998. Spain's judicial authority removed him from the bench last February after his conviction in a case in which his home nation's Supreme Court determined Garzon had improperly ordered wiretaps while investigating a financial corruption case. Following Ecuador's announcement, Sweden said it took umbrage to the implication it does not guarantee the rights of those in its custody, and called the Ecuadorian ambassador there to a meeting. Opinion: Assange's stubborn grip hurt WikiLeaks . ""Sweden does not extradite individuals who risk facing the death penalty,"" a Swedish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said, implicitly referring to the possibility Assange could be charged with crimes eligible for the death penalty in the United States, with whom it has an extradition agreement. The Swedish ministry said on its official Twitter account that this was an ""unacceptable attempt by Ecuador to stop the Swedish judicial process and the European judicial cooperation."" Assange sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court in Britain dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden, his last option in British courts. He is subject to arrest for breaking the terms of his bail, which required that he spend his nights at the home of a supporter outside London, London's Metropolitan Police said the day after he entered the embassy. Publicly silent since last March, he's set to speak at 2 p.m. Sunday -- two months to the day since he sought asylum -- according to WikiLeaks official Twitter feed. That same day, foreign ministers from member states of the Union of South American Nations will convene in Guayaquil, Ecuador, to discuss the situation in London, Peru's foreign ministry announced in a statement late Thursday. Ecuador requested the meeting, after which representatives from UNASUR member states talked and agreed to meet, the Peruvian ministry said. Fake New York Times op-ed a WikiLeaks hoax .

"(CNN) -- By now, we're on the same page that Mitt Romney's pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy -- run to the conservative (or liberal) base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election. Ryan may be many things -- energetic, charismatic and geeky -- but no one familiar with his Full Monty conservative budgets would describe his selection as remotely moving to the center. Just the opposite -- Romney has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle. What gives? Did the looming prospect of defeat push Romney into a desperate gamble? Give Romney some credit. He's made a shrewd move. The Ryan choice adopts a strategy premised on supermobilizing the base and luring a smidgeon of others. Put on your thinking caps and grab an abacus, here are the numbers that could put Romney in the White House. Conservatives outnumber liberals 2 to 1 (40% to 21%). Rage against Obama has the GOP ready to walk over red hot coals to cast a ballot. A mainstay of Gallup's measure for determining who is likely to vote -- whether survey respondents are thinking a lot about the election -- shows not only that Republicans are more attentive than Democrats by 13 points but also more fired up than in recent presidential elections. To make sure they harvest the Ryan enthusiasts, the Romney campaign appears to be assembling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the Obama team for the early vote. What makes the Romney mobilization particularly threatening to Obama is that it targets his biggest challenge -- polls consistently show him ahead but there are ominous signs that a decisive group of those supporters won't actually cast a ballot. Even with Obama's pro-immigration shift and the growing number of Latinos in competitive states, their actual turnout may flag from their record numbers in 2008. Less than half of Hispanics eligible to vote are registering and only 64% of Hispanics say they will definitely vote as compared to their 77% response in 2008 and the national average of 78% today. Ditto on youth. The percentage of voters 18 to 29 who say they will definitely vote in November (58%) is currently running 20 points or more behind the national average today (78%) or the youth turnout in 2008 (78%) or 2004 (81%). Blue collar voters -- never drawn to Obama (think Hillary Clinton in 2008 Democratic primaries) -- may desert him in numbers that approach the ""Reagan Democrat"" defections in 1980. This possible weakness in the Democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among Obama's 2008 supporters (9%) than among McCain voters who won't vote GOP in November (5%). Bottom line: By picking the bona fide conservative Ryan, the Republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response, which may allow Romney to succeed in exploiting Obama's greatest weakness at this point. Before you conclude this is far-fetched, think back to Karl Rove's strategy in 2004 to move right with strident social conservatism on abortion and same-sex marriage, steep tax cuts and hawkish policies in Afghanistan and Iraq. Embracing the base and scorning the rush to the middle cost George W. Bush the independent vote. But Bush also supercharged conservatives and Republicans, who turned out in droves. Refuting the conventional wisdom that Democrats do best in high-turnout elections, it was Bush who most benefited from the 16% jump in the total vote. But -- there's always a but. Even as Ryan fires up conservatives, he may also mobilize votes for Obama -- including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like Florida. Alarmed by his draconian proposals to remake Medicare, they may boost their support of Obama. Another potential risk: A good number of voters may be primed to punish the incumbent for poor economic times. Pluralities of Ohio and Florida independents report that Obama's re-election would hurt their personal financial situation. But the coming hullabaloo over Ryan's budget proposals may distract the economically pained from punishing Obama. All in all, Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning. But using Ryan to ignite the Republican base is probably Romney's most plausible path to prevailing. And, it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates, service records and the other side issues of recent elections. Strap in, folks, 2012 may be much more interesting and close than we'd imagined. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lawrence R. Jacobs.","Lawrence Jacobs: Mitt Romney was shrewd in picking Paul Ryan as his running mate .
Jacobs: Ryan can supercharge conservatives, who outnumber liberals 2 to 1 .

"(CNN) -- The Organization of Islamic Cooperation suspended Syria Wednesday from membership. ""There is a strong concern over the massacres and the inhumane acts that are being committed against the Syrian people,"" said Nizar bin Obaid Madani, Saudi Arabia's state minister for foreign affairs. ""Therefore, the leaders agreed on the importance of preserving the unity of Syria, the immediate end of all acts of violence and the suspension of Syrian membership within OIC,"" the minister said after a two-day summit of OIC heads of state. Syria violence fuels kidnapping threats in Lebanon . Iran and Algeria were the sole opponents in the 57-nation body, which represents 1.5 billion Muslims. The organization's move sends a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that its members will not accept the regime killing its people, OIC Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu told CNN. He also called on the U.N. Security Council to approve tougher resolutions against the regime. Asked if OIC members supported military intervention, Ihsanoglu said he heard few such calls. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland commended the move. ""Today's action underscores the Assad regime's increasing international isolation and the widespread support for the Syrian people and their struggle for a democratic state that represents their aspirations and respects their human rights,"" she said in a statement. The development came as would-be rescuers searched for survivors amid the rubble left after Syrian government forces shelled a town in Aleppo province near the border with Turkey, killing 40 people, a spokesman for the rebel Syrian National Council told CNN. ""We have no special equipment to search or lift the wreckage,"" said the spokesman, Abu Omar, by Skype from the province. ""People are doing it using their bare hands and rudimentary tools."" Another 40 people in the town of Azzaz were missing after the shelling, which targeted a popular food market, Omar said. Among the dead were four Lebanese hostages who had been taken by an armed group called ""the revolutionaries of Aleppo"" that is not affiliated with the Free Syrian Army, he said. He described the victims as civilians, including women and children, and said the town was without electricity. The attack came after government had warned members of the al-Tawheed Brigade, the main rebel group fighting in the city of Aleppo, to pull its fighters out of the city or face shelling from warplanes, Omar said. Inside Aleppo, Syria's largest city, the rebels ""continued clashes today with the regime forces in Salaheddine district"" and Bab el-Nasr neighborhood, killing a rebel commander, he added. Opinion: To save Syria, work on Russia, Iran . Meanwhile, a United Nations commission concluded Wednesday that both Syrian regime forces and anti-government rebels have committed war crimes in the Syrian conflict. The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry said government forces and their Shabiha militia allies committed crimes against humanity such as ""murder and torture, war crimes and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including unlawful killing, indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and acts of sexual violence."" For Syria's neighbors, impact is growing with each refugee . In the town of Houla on May 25, the commission said, al-Assad's forces and militia allies were responsible for killing more than 100 civilians, nearly half of them children. The anti-government armed groups that have emerged over the past year also have committed war crimes, including ""murder, extrajudicial killings and torture,"" the report says. But the commission says these actions ""were not of the same gravity, frequency and scale as the ones perpetrated by government forces and the militia."" Since February 15, the report says, ""the situation in the country has deteriorated significantly with armed violence spreading to new areas and active hostilities raging between rebels and the government and the militias."" The violence continued Wednesday, with at least 205 people killed, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Ninety of them were in Aleppo province, and most of them were in Azzaz, a town near the Turkish border that was shelled by regime warplanes. Opposition activists have put the death toll in the 17-month crisis at more than 20,000. U.S. lifts sanctions on former Syrian prime minister .

"(CNN) -- China is facing its worst wave of labour unrest since a series of wildcat strikes at Japanese-owned car plants last year, as declining export orders force factories to reduce worker pay. More than 10,000 workers in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two leading export centres in southern Guangdong province, have gone on strike over the past week. The latest protests broke out on Tuesday at a Taiwanese computer factory in Shenzhen. ""There has been an intensification of labour unrest in the past week that is probably the most significant spike in unrest since the summer of 2010,"" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labour advocacy group that monitors unrest in China. The strikes come amid mounting concerns about the global economy, which is suffering from the European sovereign debt crisis and a weak recovery in the US. Fears about the Chinese economy grew on Wednesday after a manufacturing index compiled by HSBC fell to levels not seen since March 2009. Last week, Guangdong's acting governor said the province's exports dropped 9 per cent in October from the previous month. Provincial leaders are also contending with widespread protests by farmers over land seizures. On Monday nearly 5,000 residents in the town of Wukan marched on government offices in a peaceful protest. Factories are cutting the overtime that workers depend on to supplement their modest base salaries, after a drop in overseas orders. According to CLB, the average basic wage for electronic workers is about Rmb1,500 ($236) a month, but rises to Rmb2,500 with overtime. ""Their basic wage is never enough on its own without overtime,"" Mr Crothall said. Tuesday's protests followed a bigger demonstration last week at a shoe factory in Dongguan that supplies footwear to Nike and Adidas. About 7,000 workers at the Taiwanese factory, owned by Pou Chen, objected to a cut in their overtime and management's decision to shift some work to other factories in the Chinese hinterland and Vietnam, where labour costs are lower. ""We were forced to return to the factory,"" one worker told the Financial Times. ""But we just sit there. No one is operating machines."" The worker, who did not want to be identified, said the local government had taken a tough stance during negotiations and sided with the management.

"Beijing (CNN) -- On the eve of the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony in Oslo, Norway, CNN.com and CNN International are among the websites and television networks that have been blocked in mainland China. The winner of the prize is imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. What's going on? CNN's Beijing Bureau Chief Jaime FlorCruz offers some insight. Q: There are reports that users in China can't access the CNN website and the websites of other news organizations. What's the situation in Beijing and across mainland China? A: CNN.com is completely blocked as of today. Because when I use [a privately secured network] the site works ok. But if I'm using the normal broadband connection at home, that most Chinese have, an error message comes up. It says ""this website is not available."" It's sort of the standard thing that happens when a website is blocked here in China. Q: Is television news also blocked? A: Every time our reports are broadcast about Nobel Prize winner [Liu, who is serving an 11-year sentence in a Chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power""] the television screens black out. We are required to beam our signal through a Chinese satellite station before it is broadcast to mainland China. That creates a 12-second delay. Authorities use that time to black out specific parts of the signal. Whenever anything about WikiLeaks or the Nobel Prize is mentioned, the signal is blocked. Q: How common is this? A: They've been doing this many years. Usually anything having to do with the ""three Ts and one F"" -- Tibet, Taiwan, the '89 Tiananmen Square protests, and Falun Gong, a spiritual group banned in China. The process had abated for the last several months, and especially right after the Olympics. But in recent weeks we've noticed the practice has become more frequent. But now when anything about the Nobel Prize or WikiLeaks as it pertains to China is reported, our stories are blacked out. Q: Does this occur only in mainland China, or is it in Hong Kong as well? A: I believe it's just mainland China, that's what they can control. Q: How do Chinese authorities police this? A: They watch our stories and read our stories very closely. They probably have written directives over what kinds of stories need to be censored. I doubt that people pushing the buttons know English very well. But they probably base it on certain video they see, or key words that they hear. I think it's emblematic of how tightly controlled this is, and how sensitive authorities are about tomorrow's award ceremony in Oslo. Q: What are the Chinese sites saying about the Nobel Prize, if anything? A: The authorities are also blocking certain websites that may be touching on this or WikiLeaks. I think it's safe to say that most Chinese are not aware of the [Nobel Peace Prize winner]. And whatever they may have read about him has been through official talking points and state commentary. An update on the blackout from Jaime FlorCruz as of 0830 GMT Friday: . We have canvassed a few Chinese people -- students, functionaries, a homemaker, a filmmaker -- and have asked them to try to click on the CNN website using their regular broadband connections at home or in school.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A 13-year-old Chinese boy, who was assaulted by two adults with an air pump at an auto repair shop, is recovering and will likely survive, according to Chinese media reports. That boy, Du Chuanwang, who is from Shandong Province, suffered ruptures and multiple organ failure from the air pressure that was pumped into his body, according to Chinese media. By Monday, Du's condition had improved to the point he was sitting up and looking around, according to a microblog post from a charity that has been accepting donations for his care. Du had worked with an auto repair team that traveled to various shops, according to local police. On June 30, two workers at an auto repair shop pointed the nozzle of an air pump near the boy's anus for 4 to 5 seconds, according to police. The local police posted a message on Sina Weibo, China's microblogging site, saying that the two men pushed the boy to the ground during the attack, and that the incident was a ""prank."" The two workers, who are 20 and 27 years old, were arrested on July 12, police said. The incident sparked an online uproar, as Chinese netizens demanded punishment for the suspects. ""They don't deserve to be called human, they are worse than the animals,"" wrote one user. Du's tongue is infected, he has also lost some of his teeth and cannot speak, according to Chinese media reports. His infections have been treated with antibiotics. Images of the boy showed massive decay on his cheek and nose. Immediately after the incident, Du's stomach was so inflated that surgeons at a Shandong hospital had to cut his abdomen to deflate the gas, according to the China Daily newspaper. He also suffered internal bleeding in his digestive tract, according to news reports. Du was in a coma for eight days. He awoke last week and was transferred to the intensive care unit at the Bayi Children's Hospital in Beijing. The hospital did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Du was released from intensive care because of his improving condition, according to China Daily. Meanwhile, Angel Mom, a charity group that helped arrange Du's hospital transfer raised more than 650,000 yuan ($102,000) for his care. However, some people were skeptical about giving money to a charity and sought to directly donate to the family. Weibo users sent encouragements to Du, with posts like ""Little Chuanwang, you will be well! Hang in there,"" and ""We are here praying for you, cheer up Chuanwang."" The teen dropped out of school and was working as an apprentice, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. His mother died six years ago and the family said they earn around 5,000 yuan ($780) per year from a small plot of land. Du's family sent him to help out at the repair shop and was repaid in clothes and other items, his grandfather said last week. He did not work at the auto shop, but helped with simple tasks.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Hardly a day has gone by this year without news coming from China of mass protests, labor strikes or violent attacks. In a country where strikes and protests are taboo, these are bold, desperate actions by Chinese angry over low wages, land-grabs, abuse from officials, corruption, worsening pollution and other bread-and-butter issues. The Chinese labor front has been particularly uneasy. On May 17, more than 1,800 workers at a factory in southern Guangdong, which supplies parts for Honda Motors, went on strike, demanding better pay. After a two-week standoff, they won. Their victory has been contagious. Walkouts have paralyzed several factories across China, including three other plants that supply auto parts to Honda Motors. Foxconn, a huge Taiwanese-owned manufacturing group which produces parts for Apple, Sony and other companies, announced generous pay increases after a series of worker suicides this year put the spotlight on the plight of migrant Chinese workers. Chinese manufacturers face labor upheaval . Although China has emerged from the financial crisis stronger than most, it has not escaped economic and social disruptions. China is now grappling with a rise in social unrest, and the Chinese leadership is taking it seriously. Zhou Yongkang, a top communist party official in charge of peace and order, acknowledges that ""a wide range of social conflicts have occurred recently"" and calls for ""down-to-earth measures."" Foxconn firm seeks answers to rash of worker suicides . Speaking at a meeting in Beijing, Zhou said: ""Improving people's livelihoods should be the starting and end point of all our work. People should be able to share the fruits of the reform and development."" But not everyone has. Since China introduced market reforms in 1978, economic growth has averaged more than 9 percent every year and per capita income has more than quadrupled. Prospering the most are the booming coastal provinces, where shiny skyscrapers boast malls teeming with well-heeled shoppers. But in the rural interior, tens of millions of Chinese still live in poverty. Beneath the glowing statistics, China's leap to prosperity has left millions of its citizens behind. Seeking a better life, millions of farmers have left the land to seek work in the cities. According to 2009 figures from the State Statistics Bureau there were almost 230 million migrant workers in China. Over the past three decades, they came in waves, working long hours in sweatshops, construction sites and assembly plants, enduring poor working conditions in order to save a little cash to remit home. They are the unsung heroes of the Chinese economic miracle. But the second generation of China's migrant workers is a different breed. ""Their parents have lived through hardship and poverty, but the younger generation has seen nothing but economic growth and they feel they should benefit from the economic progress,"" says Wenran Jiang, political science professor at University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. ""They will not put up with poor working conditions, work-related stress and low wages."" Officials are now trying to pacify them. Without specifically commenting on the recent labor disputes, Premier Wen Jiabao urged better treatment for China's young migrant workers. Speaking to a group of young workers at a subway construction site in Beijing, he praised their work as ""a glorious thing"" and called on the government and society to ""treat them as their own children."" Wen's soothing remarks may be taken as an indication of how seriously the leadership regards a restive population. ""I think the government is very concerned about the unrest spreading and causing further disruptions,"" says Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Nixon Center in Washington DC. ""The workers' uprising undermines the Communist Party's legitimacy to some degree and that is most worrisome to the leadership. The restrictions on reporting on strikes and workers' dissatisfaction reflect that unease."" Authorities have so far allowed workers at the Honda plants to organize and agitate for better pay, but workers say the police are keeping them under close watch. Wary of the possible emergence of Solidarity-style independent trade unions in China, China's leaders are tightening controls in the political spheres as well. ""The new regulations increasing oversight of foreign funding for Chinese NGOs is an example of how ubiquitous government oversight is,"" says Thomson of The Nixon Center. ""One could argue that the government might be over-doing it to preempt turmoil, and in trying to exert complete control, it is eliminating checks and balances and other safety valves that allow the public to vent their frustration."" At the annual meeting of China's legislature in March, Premier Wen had promised to address the issue of social justice and the yawning gap between the rich and the poor. Shifting away from the growth-at-any-cost model that has prevailed over the past three decades, he promised more efforts on redressing the inequality and social tension that market reforms have engendered. One institution that is in place to help smooth labor disputes is the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (AFTU), an officially sanctioned labor union. Chinese leaders have called on official labor unions to do a better job of representing workers. But striking workers at the Honda plant in southern Guangdong said they distrusted the official unions as pro-management, not pro-workers. Instead of relying on the factory's official union, each department elected two workers' representatives who negotiated on their behalf the wage hike that they wished. Analysts say the AFTU now faces the choice of changing into a genuine workers' union or remaining marginalized.","China's leadership are grappling with a rise in social unrest among the workforce .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo will be represented Friday at the ceremony bestowing the honor by an empty chair, the second time such a symbol has been used in the event, the chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee said Thursday. Thorbjorn Jagland told reporters that the gesture is not a protest. ""It is a signal to China that it would be very important for China's future to combine economic development with political reforms and it is support for those people in China who are struggling for basic human rights,"" Jagland said at a news conference. Liu, a professor of literature, is serving an 11-year sentence in a Chinese prison for what the government called ""inciting subversion of state power."" He was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the prize, nor was his wife, Liu Xia. China has responded furiously since the Nobel committee announced its peace prize winner on October 8. Officials have repeatedly called Liu Xiaobo a common criminal and declared the award a Western plot against China. Beijing also put pressure on its allies and other countries not to attend the peace prize ceremony, and it hastily announced its own honor -- the Confucius Peace Prize, which was awarded Thursday to former Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan. That award was accepted by a 6-year-old girl on Lien's behalf. Lien did not know about the prize, his office said. Jagland said the pressure from China was not a surprise, and that it was up to Beijing to decide on its own behavior. ""There are several peace prizes in the world,"" he said. ""If someone wants to compete with the Nobel Peace Prize, I welcome that competition, it only makes us better."" The last time an empty chair was used to represent an absent winner was when German peace activist Carl von Ossietzky won the 1935 award, according to Geir Lundestad, director of the Nobel Institute. Ossietzky was under ""protective custody"" in Nazi Germany and could not come to accept the award in person, nor was he represented by anyone. Three other Nobel peace laureates were also unable to attend their ceremonies due to political reasons -- human rights activist Aung San Suu Kyi, Polish trade union leader Lech Walesa, and Russian Cold War dissident Andrei Sakharov -- but spouses or other relatives were able to accept the awards on their behalf. As for China's pressure on other countries to boycott the ceremonies, Jagland said the committee expected a ""harsh reaction"" from Beijing. But ""we are very glad to see that two-thirds of the nations that have embassies in Oslo will be attending the ceremony, and most of them are very big, very important countries,"" he added. Lundestad said of the 19 countries that declined to come to the ceremony Friday -- including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq and Iran -- two had now reconsidered: Ukraine and the Philippines. The ceremony will include songs by a children's choir -- a special request made by Liu through his wife, according to Lundestad. And Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann will read one of Liu's ""most interesting and beautiful texts,"" Jagland said. He predicted that keeping Liu, 54, in prison for the entirety of his 11-year sentence may prove to be impossible for China once the prize is awarded. ""The pressure from the outside world will be on China to release him. In today's world, it is totally impossible to close a country. We already know that a lot of Chinese know about the prize, and this is creating a huge pressure on China,"" Jagland said. ""I believe this is one of the most influential Nobel Peace Prizes that have been awarded through the years."" ""The demand now from the world community must be that these economic reforms (by China) are being followed up by political reforms,"" he added. Several foreign news websites -- including CNN and BBC -- were blocked in mainland China Thursday. Broadcasts of CNN International are being blacked out intermittently, when news of the peace prize is reported, according to CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Jaime FlorCruz. ""We are required to beam our signal through a Chinese satellite station before it is broadcast to mainland China. That creates a 12-second delay. Authorities use that time to black out specific parts of the signal,"" he explained. FlorCruz said most Chinese are likely not aware that Liu has been awarded the prestigious award. ""Whatever they may have read about him has been through official talking points and state commentary,"" he said. Amnesty International said it had received report that Chinese diplomats in Norway have been pressuring Chinese residents into joining anti-Nobel demonstrations when the award ceremony is held Friday. The human rights group did not say how it learned of this, only offering that it has been ""informed by reliable sources."" Answering critics who claim that the award is based on the Western standards of human rights, Jagland said the criteria are from the universal rights and values described in the United Nations International Declaration of Human Rights. ""All the dissidents in China, they are advocating over common universal rights,"" he said. ""Yes, there are different parts to a democracy, but one thing is absolutely clear: You cannot have democracy without freedom of expression, and that is clearly stated in the declaration of human rights."" CNN's Alanne Orjoux contributed to this report.","The last time an empty chair was used was for the 1935 prize .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for George Zimmerman, the Florida man charged with murder in the death of teenager Trayvon Martin, said Monday that they are appealing a judge's decision not to step aside in the controversial case. In a one-sentence order issued August 1, Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester said that defense lawyers' July request that he recuse himself was ""legally insufficient."" The same team announced Monday on a website they've set up that they'd since filed a petition for writ of prohibition asking Florida's fifth district appeals court to try to remove Lester from the case. The office of lawyer Mark O'Mara later confirmed to CNN that the appeal was filed Monday. ""Right now, of course, he is still the trial judge on the case, (and) we're still moving forward with whatever we have to do or need to do,"" O'Mara said of Lester on Monday, according to CNN affiliate WESH. ""But the appellate court will handle what's called this extraordinary writ as quickly as they can."" Judge in Zimmerman case says he won't step aside . On April 20, weeks after the February 26 shooting and nine days after charges were issued, Lester set a $150,000 bond for Zimmerman. But the judge revoked that bond in June, after learning that Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie, had misrepresented their financial situation during a court hearing, including failing to disclose more than $150,000 in donations from the public. In his order last month, Lester said that the new $1 million bail order was not a punishment but an amount that assured the court that Zimmerman would not abscond. In his ruling, Lester wrote about the first bond hearing and noted an undisclosed second passport kept in Zimmerman's safe deposit box. ""Notably, together with the passport, the money only had to be hidden for a short time for him to leave the country if the defendant made a quick decision to flee,"" the judge said. ""It is entirely reasonable for this court to find that, but for the requirement that he be placed on electronic monitoring, the defendant and his wife would have fled the United States with at least $130,000 of other people's money."" Lester wrote that the defendant's plans to flee were ""thwarted."" Days later, the defense team filed a motion in circuit court saying Zimmerman cannot get a fair trial because Lester used ""gratuitous, disparaging"" language in his second bail order. Florida prosecutors mistakenly release confidential Zimmerman case documents . ""Mr. Zimmerman has lost faith in the objectivity of this court and has a reasonable, well-founded fear that he will not receive a fair trial by this court,"" his lawyers said in the document. Zimmerman's attorneys particularly took issue with two of the judge's comments: ""Under any definition, the defendant has flouted the system,"" citing the definition of flout, and ""The defendant has tried to manipulate the system when he has been presented the opportunity to do so."" The 28-year-old Zimmerman is free after posting the more recent $1 million bond. He's charged with second-degree murder in the death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old black teen who was shot and killed while walking through Zimmerman's Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense during a struggle, but prosecutors say he ignored a 911 dispatcher's advice not to follow the teen. Zimmerman's wife pleads not guilty on perjury charge . CNN's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.","George Zimmerman is charged with murder in the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Fifteen passengers were killed and 18 others injured when a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims crashed on a hilly highway in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Sunday. The bus was heading to the city of Jammu when it skidded off the road and rolled down a steep gorge, said Anil Magotra, the district police chief. ""The bus hurtled 35 to 40 meters, killing 15 passengers on the spot,"" Magotra said. ""All the 18 injured passengers have been evacuated to Jammu for specialized treatment."" The 33 Hindu people onboard were returning from a pilgrimage to the Himalayan cave shrine of Amarnath. The cave, situated in the Himalayas at a height of 3,880 meters (12,729 feet), is one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in India. Vehicle accidents are common on the winding 300-kilometer (185-mile) Srinagar-Jammu national highway, which connects landlocked Kashmir to rest of India. State officials have expressed condolences at the death of pilgrims and announced cash relief to families of the dead and injured.","A bus with 33 people onboard skids off a highway and rolls down a steep gorge .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool announced on Thursday that they have reached an agreement with Dutch club Heerenveen for the transfer of winger Oussama Assaidi, on a busy day of transfer activity in the Premier League. With the new season due to start on Saturday, and just over two weeks left of the transfer window, several of clubs have moved to finalise transfers in time for the first fixtures. Assaidi's move is subject to a medical, but the Morocco international's transfer could still be completed in time for him to play against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. Elsewhere, former Manchester United, Fulham and Everton striker Louis Saha has signed a for Sunderland. The 34 year old striker left Tottenham Hotspur at the end of last season, and has agreed a one year deal with Martin O'Neill's side. ""Louis is a striker whose abilities have been proven at the very highest level and he brings with him a raft of experience of top flight football,"" O'Neill told the club's website. ""I'm delighted we have been able to complete a deal ahead of our first match of the season."" Sunderland's local rivals Newcastle United also added to their side on Thursday, finally completing the transfer of Ajax midfielder Vurnon Anita. The 23 year old has signed a five year deal to become the club's fourth signing of the summer. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew described Anita as ""exceptionally talented"" and said he hoped the young players ""best years"" will be at Newcastle. ""He has strengthened us. You need three top class central midfield players, which we now have. That is mainly where he will play,"" said Pardew on the official website. The Dutch midfielder was delighted with the move. ""I won almost everything in Holland so the step was not difficult to make. Now I think we can also win trophies with Newcastle and it's time to do that.,"" Anita told the club's website. ""In the Premier League especially, every game is tough so it can help me also to grow in my football skills."" ""I talked to the manager and the coach and they know that I want to play in a defensive midfield place and that's why they brought me here,"" he added.","Liverpool have agreed a deal for winger Oussama Assaidi .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is questioning the effectiveness of the manhunt for fugitive warlord Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army, saying African Union troops are short on equipment, food and transportation. In a 14-page report to the U.N. Security Council, Ban urged member nations to provide the needed resources, warning the troops would be able to carry out their mission. ""The initiative itself lacks adequate and predictable funding for its operations. Without the necessary resources, the African Union will be unable to execute this important task fully,"" Ban said in the report released Thursday. The African Union stepped up efforts this year to capture Kony, deploying 5,000 troops in March after a resurgence in attacks by the group left thousands dead and displaced 445,000 people in Uganda, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, according to U.N. estimates. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court at the Hague for war crimes and crimes against humanity, stemming in part from allegations of his vicious tactics to conscript children as soldiers and sex slaves in his army. President Barack Obama ordered 100 troops to central Africa last year to help in the hunt for Kony. The troops are advising regional forces. The four countries targeted by Kony's army have contributed troops to the manhunt, though Ban warned they are woefully short on resources. ""The political will notwithstanding, the national authorities highlighted implementation challenges, including the need for additional resources, equipment, training, transportation and food rations to enable troops to mount effective operations against LRA,"" Ban said, according to the report. Ban said the troops face additional challenges, including the need for the armies and governments of the affected countries to work jointly, both on a political and military level. The U.N. Security Council is awaiting a proposal -- by members of the United Nations, the African Union and other countries -- that spells out a strategy to combat Kony. The proposal, according to Ban's report, is expected to address how to better protect civilians from the attacks as well as disarm, repatriate and resettle those displaced by Kony and his army. Kony led a failed uprising against the government of Uganda and was pushed out of the nation six years ago. He has been moving around other countries in the region ever since. Stories of Kony's alleged atrocities date to the 1980s in northern Uganda and include accusations of slicing off ears, noses and limbs of his victims. There are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents. The U.S. has listed the LRA as a terrorist group and in October, Washington authorized the Special Operations trainers and military advisers to assist African forces searching for Kony and other leaders of the LRA. The activities of the group are tracked on a website that uses information from the Invisible Children's Early Warning Radio Network, U.N. agencies and local nongovernmental organizations to map and document recent crimes. A celebrity-backed video that went viral this year helped make Kony's alleged crimes more widely known. The half-hour documentary ""KONY 2012"" was viewed more than 89 million times on YouTube, but the video also spurred a flurry of questions about its producers' intentions, their transparency and whether the social-media frenzy was too little, too late.","Ban Ki-Moon warns the African Union forces are short on resources .

"(CNN) -- Spain's Luis Leon Sanchez gave his crash-ravaged Rabobank team a lift on Sunday as he secured victory in the Tour de France's 14th stage on a day marred by a series of punctures at the front of the field. The Spaniard made a decisive move with just over 11 kilometers of the 191 kilometer-stage from Limoux to Foix to finish in four hours, 50 minutes and 29 seconds -- 47 seconds ahead of a chasing pack including Slovakian Peter Sagan (Liquigas) and FDJ rider Sandy Casar. ""I started the day with victory in mind but given the company I was in I knew I'd have to attack from far out to have any chance,"" said Sanchez -- one of four remaining members of an original nine-man Rabobank team. The main peloton, including race leader Bradley Wiggins of the Sky team, finished 18 minutes later after several riders suffered punctures at the top of the final climb (Mur de Peguere) of the stage. ""One or two spectators had thrown nails on to the road,"" said race director Jean-Francois Pescheux. ""We don't know why, but there were around 30 punctures altogether. The nails were mainly thrown on the ground around 200 metres from the summit,"" he added. Tour de France 2012: The best photos . Last year's champion Cadel Evans was one of the worst affected by the apparent act of sabotage having to change wheels twice which delayed him for nearly two minutes before he could begin his descent. The BMC rider was the recipient of a sporting gesture from Wiggins -- the Briton waited for Evans and the other riders affected to make up the gap. ""Sky showed they are for fair play. They saw that something had happened and they slowed the peloton so that things could come together for the ride to the finish,"" Pescheux said. ""There are always some idiots out there. What else can I say,"" he added. ""I thought it was the honorable thing to do. Nobody wants to benefit from someone else's misfortune,"" Wiggins said after completing the stage. Wiggins, who is aiming to become the first Briton to win the event, still holds the overall lead with Sky teammate Chris Froome just over two minutes behind. Italian Liquigas rider, Vincenzo Nibali is third with Cadel Evans in fourth. Despite coming second to Spain's Sanchez, Peter Sagan extended his lead in the race to win the green jersey. The Slovakian rider picked up 17 points on Sunday to increase his tally to 333 -- 97 points ahead of Germany's Andre Greipel.","Luis Leon Sanchez wins 14th stage marred by punctures at front of field .

"(CNN) -- Paul Ryan is a bold and risky pick for vice president by Mitt Romney. Forget all the talk about the risk-averse Mitt Romney and his policy-free campaign. Romney just embraced a man whose deficit reduction plans are impressively specific -- and controversial. This is what a game-changer looks like post-Sarah Palin. Unlike many of his fellow Republican congressmen, Paul Ryan has not been content to just demagogue the deficit and debt. He's had the courage to put specific plans on paper that would actually deal with the problem. And Mitt Romney now owns those plans, for better or for worse. It may be the first time in American history when a nominee has outsourced policy to his VP candidate. Ryan's budget plan is serious and breathtaking in its scope. It seeks to take Republican rhetoric about reducing long-term deficits and debts and put it into specific policies. Conservatives applaud the combination of vision and details in the plan, which would reset the government's relationship with individuals on issues like Medicare, moving toward privatization. Ryan believes such changes are necessary to prevent Medicare from becoming insolvent over the long term. But for all Ryan's deficit hawk credentials, he did not vote for the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson plan, despite serving on the commission -- a serious disappointment. Zelizer: How Ryan could help Romney . Liberals find the plans ideologically odious -- and therein lies the debate we'll be having over the next three months. It makes this election a real choice between competing philosophies of government -- and that's a healthy debate to have during a presidential election. On the politics of this pick, Paul Ryan doesn't automatically bring a state into the Romney column, like Ohio's Rob Portman or Florida's Marco Rubio might have. Ryan's home state of Wisconsin has been trending safely for Obama, though the pick of the first district congressman will likely tighten that race. Moreover, Ryan is a lifelong politician, someone who embraced life on Capitol Hill at an early age. He was first elected to Congress in 1998 at the tender age of 28, but he'd already developed a reputation as a respected policy wonk, writing speeches for 1996 VP-nominee Jack Kemp and numerous congressmen. He has thought deeply about his political beliefs and has learned to explain them in ways that resonate with a swing district in a rust belt state. Not incidentally, this is exactly the kind of voter that Mitt Romney will need to win over to win the presidency. This ticket will invigorate the Romney campaign among the base in terms of both style and substance. The Romney-Ryan ticket represents generational change -- Paul Ryan, born in 1970, is the first pure member of Generation X to be on a national ticket. It is also the first presidential team to not have a Protestant on the ticket -- Romney, of course, is Mormon and Ryan is Catholic. It is another small sign of how our country continues to evolve. Democrats are said to be ""salivating"" over this pick because it allows them to draft sharp contrasts on politically popular programs like Medicare and Social Security. They believe that as the VP nominee, Paul Ryan makes this election a clear choice, rather than a referendum on President Obama. This is the framing of the election they have long wanted. But Romney's surprising pick of Paul Ryan shows seriousness about governing and adds policy depth to his campaign. As a sign of the kind of president Mitt Romney might be, it is impressive and confident. And hopefully it will represent a decisive shift in this presidential election -- away from ""attack and distract"" and towards seriousness and substance. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Mitt Romney's VP selection is a gamble that changes the campaign .
He says Ryan has very specific deficit reduction plans that Romney will have to back .
Ryan's focus on substance is a welcome change for a largely negative campaign, Avlon says ."

"San Jose, California (CNN) -- Ping-pong is a game most Americans play in their basements. But competitive table tennis is a different story. In fact, it's an Olympic sport, and the United States has a bright, new star representing Team USA in London: 16-year-old Ariel Hsing. Ariel's parents, Michael Hsing and Xin Jaing, immigrants to the United States, play table tennis. When her mother couldn't find a baby sitter, she brought a then 7-year-old Ariel along with her when playing at table tennis clubs. It was there that Ariel discovered her love for the sport and her talent. ""I love table tennis, and I love playing. I love to practice so I just kept practicing and there were tournaments along the way, but it just kind of happened gradually,"" said Ariel. iReport: Get involved with the Olympic Games . ""I never thought for one minute: 'OK, I am just going to dedicate my life to table tennis.' I really love it, and I'm really passionate about it so I just keep wanting to do it."" While other elite athletes focus solely on their sport and winning Olympic gold, Ariel is a junior at Valley Christian High School in San Jose with college on the horizon. She aspires to attend Stanford University. Ariel understands that table tennis is not as popular other Olympic sports and doesn't bring in the same kind of endorsements and money. She must split her focus between athletics and academics. To achieve success on the table and in the classroom, Ariel has a regimented schedule. ""I wake up at around 7 a.m. I'll go practice serves for half an hour, and then I'll start getting ready for school. My dad will drive me to school. After my classes, he'll pick me up with lunch and he'll drive me to a nearby club. ""And after I eat my lunch I'll usually take a nap in the car. And once I get there, at the club, I'll train for two to three hours and he'll drive me to another club and there I'll play another two hours, then I'll come home, eat dinner, do homework, and I'll finally get to sleep,"" Ariel said. Saudi Arabia names two women to Olympics team . All of the practice is necessary as Ariel notes her sport goes well beyond a friendly game of ping-pong. ""I think ping-pong is the kind of game that everyone loves to play. A lot of people have their table in their basement at home, and they just play around for fun but competitive table tennis is really different. ""It's not just about your arm, but you have to move your legs so much, it can be really tiring and when you're actually playing a match, it's just like a chess game. You have to beat the opponent mentally while they're trying to change their strategies,"" she said. Ariel's made several sacrifices to get her to her first Olympic Games, such as adjusting her diet. ""I've had to give up a lot of food for table tennis. I really love to eat, and I love to eat anything unhealthy, anything that will give you a heart attack, those are my foods, so I've had to give up a lot of those in order to maintain a good athletic shape."" With her intense schedule, Ariel has also sacrificed time hanging out with friends, but she's also gained a notable new friend: Warren Buffett. She met Buffett when she was 9 on Buffett's 75th birthday. Buffett received a table tennis lesson as a gift, and the local coach thought it be fun to bring a young phenom along to assist in the lesson. Ariel made such an impression on Buffett that he remains one of her biggest fans. Buffett offers her advice, encouragement and is a constant cheerleader, even watching her matches online from his office. ""Uncle Warren has just been so supportive of me. When I was playing the finals of the Olympic trials, he was there in his office, cheering for me, and everyone in his office didn't know what was going on. So that was really funny,"" Ariel said. She is appreciative of this special bond with Buffett, and it's clear the influence he's had on her. She hopes to major in business in college. But she says the best advice he's given her wasn't something he said but rather something she learned by example. ""He's just been so humble and just so down to earth, and I think that's really admirable, and I really want to be like that."" As she excitedly heads off to London, Ariel remains grounded in what her role is. She takes representing her country very seriously, but she also knows she bears a responsibility as a role model. ""I would just tell people to always fight for their dreams and just try really, really hard to go for it. Because when I was 8 years old, I had a dream of making the Olympics one day. I wrote this down on a little piece of paper, and I rolled it up and I put it in this little box. ... I convinced myself if I opened that piece of paper, my wish would not come true. So it's just been sitting in my room, and it's been a constant reminder of my dream and a constant reminder of what I was working for.""","Ariel Hsing, 16, is representing Team USA in table tennis .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is a multimillionaire who wanted elevators for his luxury cars and whose wife wears $1,000 designer T-shirts. Barack Obama, even before being elected president, was an academic intellectual who made millions writing books and then became a professorial media darling who hobnobbed with Hollywood celebrities and Wall Street investment bankers. Yet each candidate accuses the other of being out of touch, unable to connect with everyday people. Just look at their gaffes last week over the ailing economy. Romney called Obama ""out of touch"" on Friday after the president declared the ""private sector is doing just fine."" The Obama campaign hit back in a video accusing Romney of being insensitive to the middle class because ""he wants to cut jobs for firefighters, police and teachers."" Obama: They still like him, but will they vote for him? Both candidates are virtually tied in national horse-race polls, although Obama enjoys a sizable lead when it comes to ""likabilty"" among voters. Every quarter, they are outraising each other with millions of dollars in campaign contributions from big money and small donors alike. Their core supporters are passionate, although somewhat restrained early in the campaign. Still, there is a perceived distance between them and many voters. Obama can't shake the ""elite professor"" label, while Romney is seen as a rich guy's ""rich guy."" But if previous presidential candidates are any indication, America rarely elects ""everyday"" folks into office. In modern times, the voters tend to elect wealthy politicos -- often those who hail from political dynasties. The electorate seems to want a mix of personality and power, but only if they come with a pedigree and bank account to match. ""There isn't any connection between connecting with an average voter and being an average voter,"" said Julian Zelizer, a CNN contributor and history and public affairs professor at Princeton University who has written books on former Presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter. Take Bush, for example. He was a wealthy businessman and former Texas governor whose father, George H.W. Bush, was the nation's 41st president. The younger Bush owned a baseball team, grew up around big oil and was said to have a net worth of more than $25 million. Yet routinely he topped informal ""which candidate would you like to have a beer with?"" polls and was generally deemed an affable ""guy's guy."" Reagan was a popular actor-turned-governor who made his money as a spokesman for General Electric. Carter was a rich peanut farmer-turned-governor. John F. Kennedy was heir to a wealthy and powerful political leadership legacy. ""There's something instinctive that many voters think if you lived in the same circumstances as most Americans you can understand them,"" Zelizer said. ""It's a conventional wisdom that doesn't mesh with presidential history."" There have been some modern presidents who come from humbler beginnings. Both Bill Clinton and Obama were raised by parents who struggled to make ends meet. Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon also hailed from working-class roots. Stanley: Are politicians too rich to understand us? Neither Romney nor Obama could be considered ""everyday people"" by most measures. While the median U.S. household income is about $50,000 a year, only a few regular voters are worth more than $250 million such as Romney or have best-selling books and a personal wealth of up to $8.3 million such as Obama. Family net worth plummets nearly 40% . Still much ado has been made in this campaign cycle about Romney's disconnect with voters. His gaffes in name-dropping his NASCAR-owning friends and comments about owning more than one Cadillac may rub some voters the wrong way. For Romney, a lot of that may have less to do with his wealth than the perception of his stiff demeanor, said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor with The Cook Political Report. ""I don't think Romney is ever going to be seen as an average guy,"" Duffy said. ""Contrast him with Bush. In some ways they had similar backgrounds, but Bush was a regular guy. He loved baseball. You just saw him as a very regular guy. Romney, when he talks about NASCAR, he's talking about his friends owning. You don't see Bush talking about 'when I owned the Rangers.' "" Obama's had his share of awkward moments as well. The celebrity-themed fund-raisers with George Clooney and ""Sex and the City"" star Sarah Jessica Parker -- who cheekily referred to the president as ""that guy"" -- have struck some critics as opulent and overly elite. The American Crossroads super PAC poked fun at the president's chummy relationships with Hollywood types in an ad called ""Cool."" The ad says, ""America elected the biggest celebrity in the world,"" then proceeds to slam the president's performance on the economic and jobs front. ""After four years of a celebrity president, is your life any better?"" the ad asks in conclusion. The president has a 56% favorability rating, compared with Romney at 48%, according to a recent CNN/ORC International poll. Political experts said that in this era of celebrity worship and obsession with reality television stars, the ability to connect on some sort of personal level with everyday voters takes on heightened importance. ""Part of it is that there seems to be such gridlock (voters are) skeptical that (politicians) are going to do anything so they look at the 'who can I have a beer with?' factor,"" Zelizer said. Clinton hailed from humble beginnings to become governor of Arkansas and eventually president but then was impeached on perjury and obstruction of justice charges before his Senate acquittal. According to a recent CNN/ORC International poll, years after he left office, Clinton still enjoys a 66% approval rating. But the cult of personality and connecting with everyday voters will only carry a candidate so far. ""Even though it's an age of slickly packaged ads and messaging, people are transparent,"" Zelizer said. ""You can't force people to make them like you.""","President Obama, Mitt Romney both made recent gaffes about the economy .
Wealth, personalities may make them appear out of touch with average voters .
History shows Americans rarely elect presidents who are not wealthy ."
"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has approved the exhumation of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's body, an official said Monday. The approval comes days after investigators said they found high levels of a radioactive substance on some of Arafat's personal belongings. Last week, Suha Arafat, the former leader's widow, told CNN that she wanted his body exhumed to find out whether he was poisoned. ""The president is making all the contacts for the process to be done,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee. Medical experts from Switzerland will travel to Ramallah to take samples from the body, Ashrawi said. ""The remains will be exhumed for them to take whatever necessary samples to carry out the required tests,"" she said. The process could begin within weeks, she said. A Swiss doctor said last Wednesday that investigators had found high levels of toxic polonium-210 on some of Arafat's belongings, though it does not mean he suffered radiation poisoning. ""We have evidence there is too much polonium, but we also have hints from the medical records that this may not be the case,"" said Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""The only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body."" The Palestinian Authority said last week that it would not object to exhuming the body from its tomb if Arafat's family approves. If it turns out that Arafat, who died in 2004, was poisoned, ""Any result will be significant for us to help know the truth,"" Suha Arafat said. ""It is a form of closure for our family. Closing one wound but opening a new one, wondering who is responsible."" Bochud's research team tested Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the trademark black-and-white headscarf he often wore, Bochud said. A body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope, while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. A becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity. The fabric of Arafat's clothing, without body fluid, contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. Suha Arafat said she was requesting the body be exhumed ""to make sure 100% of the existence of polonium."" Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said he ""totally"" ruled them out. Two weeks after Arafat's death, his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death. Nasser al-Kidwa, who was the Palestinian observer to the United Nations, said toxicology tests showed ""no known poison"" -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle's death. ""The suspicion that he was killed, that he was deliberately murdered, has been there all along, and most Palestinians believe that,"" Ashrawi said last week. ""I personally believed it because I was with him; I saw him; I saw the transformation, and it certainly was unnatural."" Ashrawi said she had spoken with Arafat's doctors, who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned. ""But we didn't have any kind of thread, any kind of evidence,"" she told CNN. ""This report, in many ways, tells us our suspicions are founded, that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed, that he was assassinated using polonium."" But getting data from items like clothing ""is really tricky business,"" said Cham Dallas, a professor and toxicologist at the University of Georgia's Institute for Health Management and Mass Destruction Defense. ""We don't have enough information to make any definitive statement, but it does seem a bit of a stretch"" to conclude that Arafat was poisoned by polonium-210, he told CNN in a telephone interview last week. Dallas questioned how much confidence the Swiss scientists could have in their measurements and said he is looking forward to results from tests carried out on the body after it is exhumed. ""I'd have a lot more confidence if you could give me a bone sample,"" he said. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Schams Elwazer contributed to this report.","NEW: The exhumation could begin within weeks, an official says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With top consultancy firms charging thousands of dollars for a day's work, employing their services is a luxury most companies simply can't afford. Wharton's MBA students can act as consultants at the Small Business Development Center. But some business schools offer student consultancies for a fraction of the price, making their expertise available to a whole range of organizations. Student consultancy groups are a feature of many MBA programs, letting companies hire teams of MBA students to solve their business problems and giving the students a chance to put their education into practice. The Wharton Small Business Development Center (SBDC) is part of Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, ranked by the Financial Times as the having the world's joint best MBA program. The center employs around 40 MBA students and 40 undergraduates at any time, offering their knowledge and experience to local firms completely free of charge. Wharton SBDC says it receives hundreds of applications each year from businesses wanting their help, with more than 20,000 small businesses taking advantage of its services over the past 10 years. Leslie Mitts is managing practice leader at Wharton SBDC. She told CNN that the SBDC works with companies of all types and sizes, including small businesses that would never have the resources to hire a large consulting firm. ""Last week we worked with a lady who was running a dance center for underprivileged kids. As much as she wanted to give away lots of scholarships the school wouldn't exist if she gave so much free service away,"" she said. ""We made a couple of changes to her business, consolidated a couple of classes so teachers didn't have classes with only two students, and increased the fees by $10 a semester which isn't much, but it is when multiplied by many students. ""Now the center can not only teach all the underprivileged kids in that neighborhood and continue to give scholarships, but it also has a plan for sustainability that keeps it in business."" At Cambridge University's Judge Business School, part of the MBA program requires students to take part in the Global Consulting Project (GCP). The project sees teams of five MBA students spend three to four weeks offering free consultancy services. Margaret O'Neill is projects manager at Judge and says non-profit companies are among those who have benefited from its services. But it's not just small businesses that can see the advantage of student consultants -- Microsoft, Toyota, Procter and Gamble and Shell International have all taken part in the project. O'Neill told CNN that companies using the GCP benefit from the students' knowledge of up-to-date research methodology gleaned from the course and the fact that students have diverse backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. And with an average age of 32 the students can offer a wealth of experience. At Temple University's Fox School of Business in Philadelphia, MBA students can participate in the Enterprise Management Consultant Practice (EMCP). The EMCP charges companies $20,000 for a consultancy, but managing director TL Hill estimates this is only a tenth of the commercial going rate. Hill says the fee is offered on a sliding scale for non-profits, charities and smaller companies. He gives the example of a project working with a Philadelphia arts program that has created more than 2,000 murals around the city. Hill says the MBA consultants helped the arts program think about ways of using its copyrighted artwork images to generate extra revenue, including selling prints and T-shirts featuring the artworks. Robert Parikh is an MBA student at London Business School. Along with seven other students, he forms part of the London Business School (LBS) Consulting Team, a project that runs throughout the summer vacation. ""The idea is to take the skills we're developing and offer them at a reasonable rate,"" Parikh told CNN. ""The people involved with the team often go on to work for the likes of McKinsey and BCG. By hiring us for a short period over this summer our clients will get very high caliber people before they get too expensive."" Parikh points out that the LBS Consulting Team has a strong background in the field. Parikh, 27, has nearly five years of experience as a general manager for BAE Systems, while other team members have worked for IBM, and in real estate and consulting. The team is run as a business and profits are kept by the students, but money isn't the motivation for Parikh. Each year the project starts from scratch and Parikh hopes that being involved from the start will teach him entrepreneurial skills, as well as providing sales and marketing experience he believes will be useful when he finishes his MBA in 2010 and embarks on his chosen career -- in consultancy.","Some business schools offer student consultancies at affordable prices .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's angry response to a reporter who interrupted his Rose Garden remarks Friday was the latest salvo in what some political experts see as an era of incivility. Neil Munro, a White House correspondent for the Washington-based website The Daily Caller, asked the president about his administration's dramatic policy shift on immigration while the president was in the middle of delivering prepared remarks. ""Excuse me, sir. It's not time for questions, sir,"" Obama fired back. ""Not while I'm speaking."" Munro later told CNN's Brianna Keilar, ""I have to ask the questions you all won't ask,"" referring to the reporters gathered who regularly cover the White House. Obama calls policy 'the right thing to do' ""I always go to the White House prepared with questions for our president. I timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks, because naturally I have no intention of interrupting the president of the United States,"" Munro said in a statement on the Caller's website. ""I know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium. When I asked the question as he finished his speech, he turned his back on the many reporters and walked away while I and at least one other reporter asked questions."" The president and journalist's terse exchange reflects the heightened polarized climate, political experts say. ""We are in an era of incivility,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""There's been an erosion of respect for government officials post Watergate."" That erosion of respect also extends to the media. ""Part of the reason journalists have a bad reputation is that we're seen as rude and pushy, but in general you probably don't interrupt your mom if she's talking and you probably don't interrupt the president,"" said Jerry Ceppos, dean of the Manship School of Mass Communication at Louisiana State University. Romney: Immigration change makes long-term fix harder . Obama has faced his fair share of heckling. In 2009, South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson yelled ""you lie"" during the State of the Union address. The resulting controversy resulted in Wilson being formally taken to task by the House of Representatives. The lawmaker later offered the president an apology. Earlier this year, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer was seen wagging her finger at Obama while on a Phoenix airport tarmac during his visit there. Last year, Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner said first lady Michelle Obama ""has a large posterior,"" a comment critics called racist and sexist. He, too, offered an apology. Also in 2011, Colorado Rep. Doug Lamborn apologized for comments he made on a radio program; he used the word ""tar baby"" to refer to the administration's policies. Then there were all those derogatory and racially tinged signs at tea party rallies during summer 2010. Noorani: Obama's immigration move good policy, good politics . Previous presidents have also faced heckling and rude comments. A gathering of those attending Obama's inauguration booed former president George W. Bush as he and his wife departed the White House by helicopter. In 2008, an Iraqi journalist threw a shoe at Bush during a press conference in Baghdad and yelled, ""This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, you dog."" But as the nation's first black president, the nature of Obama's heckling often feels as if there is something else lurking beneath the surface, Gillespie said. ""This is the dark undercurrent to the increased diversity of American culture,"" Gillespie said. ""Usually when you have periods of progress there's some sort of backlash."" It's very difficult to parse out what is an undertone of disrespect from actions that have tinges of racism, said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and the author of several books, including ""New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity."" ""I don't think you can separate the two,"" Neal said. ""Even if it were a more civil moment Obama would be dealing with race in his presidency. The incivility piece is incredibly important here because I think that's largely been lost.""","Reporter from conservative website interrupts Obama during his remarks on immigration .

"(CNN) -- This year marks the 70th anniversary of ""Casablanca,"" and although we are a long way from 1942, watching the film's romantic leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, sacrifice their wartime love still touches us. The backstory on ""Casablanca"" is a good one, offering complex lessons in patriotism even today. Few films have benefited as much from the real-world geopolitics surrounding them as ""Casablanca,"" which opened on Thanksgiving 1942, when the nation was well into World War II, at New York's Hollywood Theater. Just 18 days earlier in Operation Torch, the Allies had invaded North Africa with a force of 65,000; among the cities they quickly captured was Casablanca. A film that had finished production on August 3 suddenly became inseparable from actual events, as Jack Warner, whose studio produced ""Casablanca,"" acknowledged in a November 10 memo, observing that the ""entire industry envies us with picture having title 'Casablanca' ready to release, and feel we should take advantage of this great scoop."" (Editor's note: Warner Bros., like CNN, is a subsidiary of Time Warner). ""Casablanca"" was helped even further by the politics surrounding Operation Torch, which at its outset involved getting French Vichy forces in North Africa to accept a ceasefire through a deal with Adm. Jean-Francois Darlan, who had collaborated with the Nazis after the defeat of the French army in 1940. The intrigue of ""Casablanca"" thus had its real-life counterpart in intrigue Americans had read about in their papers. ""Casablanca"" reminded Americans of how completely their thinking had changed in the months since Pearl Harbor. Prewar America had much to apologize for in its international affairs. In 1939 the United States government failed to aid the Jewish passengers on the German ocean liner St. Louis when they were denied entry into Cuba and forced to return to Europe, and two years later the country was still not anxious to face facts about the wars raging in Europe and Asia. In August 1941 the House of Representatives only reluctantly voted to renew the peacetime draft, passing it by a single vote, 203-202. Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine is the embodiment of an America that has finally grasped the threat of fascism. On the surface, Rick is little more than the owner of a cafÃ© in French Morocco, who insists, ""I'm the only cause I'm interested in."" But as his personal history emerges, Rick turns out to be anything but the cynic he pretends to be. Before arriving in Casablanca, Rick fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War and ran guns for Ethiopia in its fight against Mussolini. At his cafÃ© he has made a point of hiring European refugees. He has a Dutch pastry chef, a German refugee headwaiter, and a bartender from the Soviet Union. When a young Bulgarian woman asks for his help in getting her and her husband to America, Rick comes to their rescue by allowing them to win the money they need for papers at his gambling table. The turning point in ""Casablanca"" occurs when Rick's former lover, Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, shows up at his cafÃ© with the Czech resistance leader, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), her husband. Rick faces a dilemma. He still loves Ilsa, who acknowledges that she also loves him, but if he wants to help Laszlo escape from the Nazis, he cannot resume his relationship with Ilsa, who is Laszlo's main support. Rick's solution to his dilemma comes when he tells Ilsa that she should stay with Laszlo, then supplies the two of them with stolen letters of transit that will get them safely to Lisbon. Rick's refusal to put his own needs before those of Laszlo -- and by extension the war effort -- reflects his priorities and his patriotism, but what makes Rick's sacrifice so powerful is that it is unaccompanied by chest pounding or sentimentality. ""I'm no good at being noble,"" he tells Ilsa, ""but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" To help Ilsa and Laszlo escape, Rick must shoot the ranking German officer in Casablanca and reach an arrangement with the corrupt French chief of police. Neither decision bothers Rick, who at the end of ""Casablanca"" heads off to a free French garrison with the police chief while telling him, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" The remark is filled with irony and humor, but remains serious. It reflects Rick's refusal to let the ambiguity of his choices get in the way of his waging war to the best of his ability. Today, ""Casablanca"" speaks to audiences very differently from how it did in 1942 or even when it was part of the Bogart revival that began in the late 1950s at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge. ""Casablanca's"" call to arms and Bogart's cool no longer resonate as they once did. But what does resonate in our post-9/11 world is Rick's complexity. Rick is a loner who won't let his idealism get the better of his pragmatism. He will not give in to the Germans, who are the real power in Casablanca, but he refuses to do anything that needlessly exposes him to arrest. He walks a moral tightrope with understated brilliance. These days it is easy to imagine Rick applauding America's decision to aid Libya's rebels, worrying about our ongoing war in Afghanistan, and wondering what we might do to get other countries to help us stop the bloodshed in Syria. Given Rick's choice of friends, it is clear that he would not be overly fastidious about choosing allies -- if he believed their cooperation could save lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills: ""Casablanca"" turns 70; film had backstory, resonance that mirrored reality .
He says Operation Torch had just resulted in Allies' capture of Casablanca; gave film currency .
He says Bogart character had version of patriotism that was heroic, accepted ambiguity .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer's reputation as one of the finest tennis players of all time was cemented on Monday, as the Swiss broke Pete Sampras' record for the most number of weeks at the top of the world rankings. Federer returned to the No. 1 spot for the first time in over two years with a record-equaling seventh Wimbledon men's singles triumph, a victory which was also gave him an unparalleled 17th grand slam title. The 30-year-old has now spent 287 weeks at the summit since turning pro in 1998, one more than 14-time grand slam winner Sampras managed between 1993 and 2000. By comparison, Steffi Graf holds the women's record total of 377 weeks at No. 1, with Martina Navratilova second on 332. ""It is really an amazing feeling for me to have regained the No. 1 ranking,"" Federer said on the ATP Tour website. ""I had set a goal with my team to try to get back to the top of the rankings, but I never thought with the depth in the game this year that I would have been able to get it back so quickly. ""I am extremely proud and honored to have beaten Pete's record as he was my childhood hero and I have always looked up to him."" Sampras, who retired in 2002, congratulated Federer on his achievement. ""Great effort. The hardest thing to do in sports is the ability to stay on top. Roger has been able to do so by great play and durability,"" the American said. Behind Federer and Sampras on the list are eight-time grand slam winners Ivan Lendl (270 weeks) and Jimmy Connors (268 weeks) while John McEnroe, a winner of seven major titles, was at the top for 170 weeks. Federer is ""the greatest ever tennis player"" Despite dropping out of the top three in October 2011, Federer has still maintained his incredible run of reaching 33 grand slam semifinals in a row stretching back to the 2004 French Open. Federer spent a record 237 consecutive weeks at No. 1 between February 2004 and August 2008, whereas Sampras only managed 102 weeks in a row. One record Federer is yet to claim is that of the oldest man to win a major. Andre Agassi achieved that feat by winning the 2003 Australian Open at the age of 33 years and 131 days. In the women's game, Wimbledon champion Serena Williams equaled older sister Venus' total of 43 WTA Tour titles by beating fellow American Coco Vandeweghe in Sunday's final of the Bank of The West Classic in California. The dominant Williams sisters now share the record for the most tournaments won by players still active. The 30-year-old Serena has won 28 of her last 29 matches and is now joint sixth on the all-time list of WTA Tour title winners. The legendary Czech Martina Navratilova tops the list with 167 titles, ahead of American Chris Evert with 154. Germany's Graf, the wife of Agassi, has 107, while Lindsay Davenport of the U.S. collected 55 titles during her career. The Williams sisters are level with Switzerland's Martina Hingis and Justine Henin of Belgium. For former world No. 1 Serena, her recent run of form comes off the back of a 2011 season which was blighted by life-threatening blood clots on her lung. ""I've never felt this fit, this strong, this happy to play -- and I think I can be even better,"" fourth-ranked Williams told the WTA Tour's website after her 7-5 6-3 win over the 20-year-old Vandeweghe, who made it into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying. ""I want to sustain this momentum and build on what I did at Wimbledon. I'm going to get back on the grass now for the Olympics -- I'm not sure when I'm heading back to London, but I'll do it as soon as I can."" Williams will be looking to win her third gold medal in the British capital, after clinching the doubles title alongside Venus at the 2000 and 2008 Games.","Roger Federer surpasses Pete Sampras' number of weeks at world No. 1 .

"(CNN) -- Four men and three women have been arrested in connection with shootings that left two Louisiana sheriff's deputies dead and two others wounded, police said Friday. Their arrests, and the preliminary charges they are facing, follow a pair of allegedly linked shootings early Thursday in LaPlace, a community of about 30,000 people located roughly 25 miles west of New Orleans. Five of those arrested are now in jail, while the two others remain hospitalized for treatment of gunshot wounds, Louisiana State Police spokesman Melissa Matey said Friday. St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff Michael Tregre called the slain and wounded deputies ""heroes"" and described those arrested as ""some very violent individuals."" ""The people that (the deputies) lost their lives for, that we have in custody, I believe are some of the most violent, evil people on the planet,"" Tregre said Friday. All the charges levied against the suspects, thus far, apply to the first shooting that occurred around 5 a.m. in a parking lot near the Bayou Steel plant in LaPlace, according to police. A man there shot Deputy Michael Boyington from the St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff's Office -- who was directing traffic at the time -- several times, Tregre said Thursday. Despite his injuries, Boyington told dispatchers about the suspect. His description, along with a civilian report of a speeding car, led responding officers to a nearby trailer park, the sheriff said. Col. Michael Edmonson, superintendent of the Louisiana State Police, said Friday that investigators have determined that five of those under arrest were in the car that sped from the scene. Boyington is at University Hospital in New Orleans, where Tregre said he had visited him and found him to be ""very good, upbeat, very positive, very strong."" A law enforcement source who was not authorized to speak on the record said Thursday that the deputy had been shot in the shoulder and is expected to survive. ""He just wanted me to tell everyone that he'll be back to work Monday,"" Tregre said Friday. Brian Lyn Smith, 24, will be charged with attempted first-degree murder of a police officer tied to Boyington's shooting, police said. Four others -- 44-year-old Terry Smith, 22-year-old Derrick Smith, 28-year-old Kyle David Joekel and 21-year-old Teniecha Bright -- each face charges of being a principal to attempted first-degree murder of a police officer. Chanel Skains, 37, and Brittney Keith, 23, have been charged with being an accessory after the fact to attempted first-degree murder of a police officer, authorities said. Brian Smith and Joekel will be formally charged after their release from the hospital, according to information released Friday by the parish sheriff's office. ""Once ... the hospital says, they're OK and they can leave the hospital, believe me, they're going straight to jail,"" Edmonson said of the two hospitalized suspects. All those facing charges lived in one of three nearby addresses on the same street in LaPlace. And they could face additional charges tied to the second shooting later Thursday at a trailer park in that same city. In that incident, deputies who had gone there to investigate the initial shooting were questioning two people when a man ambushed them, Tregre said. Multiple weapons were used and at least 20 shots were fired in this shooting, according to Edmonson. St. John the Baptist Sheriff's Deputies Brandon Nielsen, 34, and Jeremy Triche, 28, were killed in the gunfire. Nielsen was married with five children and Triche had a wife and a 2-year-old son, Tregre told reporters. Deputy Jason Triche -- who is not related to Jeremy Triche -- was wounded in that shooting, according to Louisiana State Trooper Evan Harrell. Jason Triche is ""recovering very, very well"" at LaPlace's River Parishes Hospital, where Tregre visited him and said he believes that he was taken off a ventilator Friday and ""couldn't really speak, but he could write."" As to the overall investigation, the state police superintendent stressed Friday that ""there are a lot of things that we don't know and that we will find out,"" vowing that authorities will ""very tediously, very delicately"" compile evidence and interview witnesses. ""We'll build our case on what we know now, (including about) the individuals in the car. And now we are going to work our way back to the scene where those two deputies were killed,"" Edmonson said. ""It's going to take us a while to do that."" The slain and wounded sheriff's deputies will be honored Friday at a candlelight vigil, which starts at 8 p.m. (9 p.m. ET) in front of the Percy Hebert Building in LaPlace, Tregre said. In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans will be lit in blue Friday night and there will be a moment of silence to remember Nielsen and Jeremy Triche before the New Orleans Saints take on the Jacksonville Jaguars in an NFL pre-season game, according to the sheriff. CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: The suspects are ""some of the most violent, evil people on the planet,"" sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- Fallout from a job discrimination lawsuit filed by the head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New York has led to at least a temporary shakeup at the agency's headquarters in Washington. Suzanne Barr, chief of staff for ICE Director John Morton, voluntarily stepped down this week and is on paid leave because of allegations made against her as part of an ongoing civil suit filed by New York ICE chief James Hayes. In the suit, which is leveled at the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, Hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women, some of whom used to work for Napolitano when she was governor of Arizona. As part of his lawsuit, Hayes cites behavior by Barr in an attempt to prove an alleged culture of sexual discrimination against men, according to Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Maryland. In his lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington last May, Hayes says Barr ""created a frat house-type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and intimidate male employees."" ICE Public Affairs Director Brian Hale said in a written statement this week that ""ICE has referred these allegations to the DHS Office of Inspector General and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility for review. Ms. Barr has voluntarily placed herself on leave pending the outcome of this review."" On Thursday, DHS filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint and denied allegations of discrimination and retaliation. Its attorneys also argued ""unfounded allegations"" made against Barr are ""irrelevant"" and an ""attempt to embarrass or harass senior government officials."" However, a federal official calls the allegations about Barr ""serious."" In his lawsuit, Hayes also cites Dora Schriro, who was appointed to serve as special adviser to Napolitano on detention and removal, and immigration and customs enforcement; and as director of the office of detention policy and planning. After about a year, Schriro left DHS in September 2009 after being recruited to run New York City's Department of Corrections. Hayes claims Schriro was not qualified for her DHS appointment because she lacked experience running a federal law enforcement department. Previously, Schriro served as head of both Missouri's and Arizona's Department of Corrections. In the mid 1980's, she was Assistant Commissioner of Corrections. In the lawsuit, Hayes blames Barr for ""sexually offensive behavior."" In one alleged incident, Hayes says Barr called a male employee at a hotel and screamed at him using crude language to say she wanted to have sex with him. Hayes also states Barr moved the office contents of three male employees into a men's bathroom at ICE headquarters in 2009. After his client's lawsuit was filed, Fischer says he was contacted by other federal employees who heard about Hayes' claim. They provided affidavits to Hayes and his lawyer alleging more sexually charged comments made by Barr, according to Fischer. ""We've been getting calls and e-mails from all over the country from people who want to come forward with information that may be helpful on this case,"" Fischer told CNN. In an affidavit provided to CNN, another ICE employee describes a 2009 meeting in the office of ICE Director Morton during which employees were discussing personal plans for Halloween. The male employee says he overheard Barr ask a ""senior ICE employee"" about the size of his genitals. ""You're a sexy mother-(expletive),"" she allegedly said. Over 17 years, Hayes rose through the ranks from Border Patrol agent to a top position at headquarters in charge of Detention and Removal Operations, overseeing a $2.5 billion budget, his lawsuit states. Hayes claims he was removed from that job because of gender discrimination. Hayes is suing to recover $335,000 in moving costs and lost bonuses he says he incurred when he was transferred to New York in 2009 from Washington . His lawyer says other ICE employees have been reimbursed for similar expenses. His lawsuit also claims he faced retaliation after threatening to file an Equal Opportunity Claim against DHS and cites six internal investigations which were all unfounded. However, all but one of those investigations against him involving complaints by fellow employees were initially filed before Napolitano took office in 2008. In his court documents, Hayes says the complaints were reviewed after he began complaining. Hayes' lawsuit is filled with ""false and unsubstantiated"" allegations against Barr and other DHS employees, according to a federal official who defended ICE as an agency of ""dedicated law enforcement professionals."" Hayes' allegations ""do not align with the fact that Mr. Hayes has routinely held high-ranking assignments, including his current position as head of ICE's second largest field office in New York, the official added. DHS plans to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit before the end of next week, the official said. Barr could not be reached for comment. Schriro was on vacation Thursday, but a spokeswoman for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office issued a statement on her behalf and also praised Schriro's work. ""In an arena that has historically been run by men, Commissioner Schriro is proud to have served a combined 14 years as the first woman Director of Correction for the States of Missouri and Arizona. Her selection and service at DHS were based on merit,"" Samantha Levine, deputy press secretary in Bloomberg's office, said in the statement. ""(Schriro) served with distinction in Washington, D.C., and New York City is fortunate to have her as our Department of Correction Commissioner."" Hayes declined comment on his lawsuit. His lawyer indicated Hayes would like to stay with DHS and issued a statement calling his client a victim of ""frat house behavior."" In the same statement, Hayes' lawyer is asking the House subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations, and Management of DHS for a bipartisan investigation. Mike Rosen, a spokesman for Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee, called Hayes' allegations ""certainly of interest."" In a statement, committee chairman Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said the committee ""has made no decision to initiate an investigation"" but will monitor the lawsuit. The subcommittee has held five previous hearings on DHS management and leadership.","A discrimination suit was filed by the man who heads ICE operations in New York .

"New York (CNN) -- It wouldn't be shocking to see cats or lions on Broadway. Many have flocked to Broadway to see these animals, in plays of course. But how about a horse running down Broadway dodging Manhattan traffic while dragging terrified tourists? That's what happened Thursday afternoon in a horse-drawn carriage accident that had even the most hard-to-startle New Yorkers gawking. ""The horse got spooked and rolled the carriage,"" NYPD Detective Martin Speechley said. ""There were two passengers and a driver. All of them have nothing but minor injuries, if there are any injuries at all."" Witnesses said the horse was moving westward along Central Park South when it entered Columbus Circle, a traffic rotary at the park's southwest corner, and bolted. As it ran, it struck an object, which split the carriage in two parts and freed the horse to run free, they said. ""I saw the horse at a full gallop with either people or a person in the carriage,"" said CNN's Soledad O'Brien, who watched the incident unfold in front of the network's New York bureau. ""Then the carriage separated and the horse ran up Broadway."" As paramedics tended to the carriage riders, the panicked horse was stopped and controlled by police. ""We corralled the horse and took it into custody, and it was taken back to its stables by the mounted police,"" Speechley said. A veterinarian examined the horse; it was not known whether the horse or riders sustained any serious injuries.","""The horse got spooked and rolled the carriage,"" a detective says .

"(CNN) -- A 6-foot-4 football player is more than a million times the size of a typical Staphylococcus bacterium. But under the right conditions, that athlete could find himself defenseless against the microscopic bug. Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up. The problem came to the forefront last week with Cleveland Browns player Kellen Winslow, who recently had his second staph infection. He is reportedly the sixth player to acquire staph among the Browns in five years. Winslow recently said the Browns treated him like a ""piece of meat"" when he was hospitalized for the condition, and he claimed they covered up the cause of his illness. After Winslow spoke out, the organization suspended him for one game, then rescinded the suspension after a settlement with Winslow over the weekend. The Browns said in a statement Saturday that the team and Winslow had worked through their differences, and that the team looked forward to his return. Winslow joined the team again Monday. Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts was revealed to have a staph infection, the Indianapolis Star reported Friday. University of North Carolina-Asheville fans also recently learned that Kenny George, the 7-foot-7 center on the basketball team, had a staph infection complication that led to part of his foot being amputated. It's unclear how these high-profile athletes acquired their infections, but locker rooms have been found to habor staph bacteria in previous outbreaks. The topic is generating buzz throughout the sports world as more players' staph cases are revealed. Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings. Regardless of where these players got their infections, the close quarters of a locker room raise questions about overall risks. About 30 percent of people carry staph in their noses without exhibiting symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts say Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics, has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin-to-skin touching. Most MRSA infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red, swollen, painful or with drainage such as pus, the CDC says. Infections often occur in cuts and abrasions but also on body parts covered in hair, such as the back of the neck, armpit or groin. Schools, prisons and other crowded environments are particularly known for transmitting MRSA, said. Elaine Larson, professor of epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. MRSA may spread particularly easily among athletes because they have repeated skin-to-skin contact, share items and surfaces that touch skin and have a hard time staying clean, the CDC says. Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection. Dr. James Steinberg, medical director at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, said that environment plays a role in the spread of MRSA but that it's less a factor than coming into contact with a person's skin. ""If you have somebody who has an infection -- he has a draining infection -- and he gets some of his pus on a bench, that staph's going to be there for hours or days before it dries out,"" he said. ""But the higher concentration is going to be on that person's skin."" A second infection in the same person could result from re-exposure or from treatment that didn't get rid of the bacteria colonization, he said. MRSA has been around in hospital settings since the 1970s, but community-associated MRSA was born in the late 1990s, and is now widespread in the community, said CDC spokesperson Nicole Coffin. A report from the CDC said that the deaths of four children from MRSA in North Dakota and Minnesota during the late 1990s ""demonstrate the potential severity of community-acquired MRSA infections."" A study on the St. Louis Rams published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2003 found that during the 2003 football season, there were eight MRSA infections among five of the 58 Rams players. To protect against MRSA, the CDC recommends practicing good personal hygiene and taking care of your skin, which includes wearing protective clothing and covering cuts and abrasions with clean, dry bandages. Also, do not share items that come into contact with your skin, such as towels, razors and ointments. Put something between your skin and shared equipment -- for example, sit on a towel on a bench. Larson said she is not directly familiar with Winslow's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection. There could be economic and psychosocial repercussions -- for example, another team might not want to play against that one, she said. But in general, other team members should be made aware of the situation so they do not share towels or engage in other behaviors that might transmit the infection. Still, there is a danger of overreaction, she said. In some instances when a child in a public school has died, the whole school panicked and fumigated the facility, she said. ""It's a good idea to avoid that level of fear, because it's costly and it scares people unnecessarily,"" she said. On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in ""game mode"" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis. ""To come out and talk about that just was going to be another distraction,"" Savage said on his regular weekly appearance on WTAM radio in Cleveland, Ohio. ""That's our job, is to limit distractions as much as we can."" Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public. ""This has nothing to do with football, and this has nothing to with my current contract situation,"" he said. ""This is a health concern."" A spokesperson for the Browns did not return a request for comment. An NFL representative said the league has no statement on the issue.","Several professional athletes have recently had staph infections .

"(CNN) -- For the elite basketball stars of the NBA and WNBA, winning Olympic gold is a given. Silver is for the losers. The U.S. men's team has been champion 13 out of 16 times since 1936. American women have topped the podium six out of eight. ""Second place is unacceptable,"" says legendary center Hakeem Olajuwon, who was in the U.S. ""Dream Team"" that topped the podium in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. With teammates such as Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen, the Nigerian-American, who was born in Lagos, quickly came to realize that reality. ""Coming to the United States, being there for so long, then it becomes -- you are expected to win gold,"" he told CNN's Aiming for Gold show. Olajuwon, who is rated one of the greatest 50 NBA players of all time, came into the Atlanta Games having helped Houston Rockets win back-to-back NBA titles in 1994 and 1995. Security presence . While he enjoyed winning Olympic gold, the sheer fame of the Dream Team left them surrounded by an all-pervading security presence and he felt he missed out on the Games experience. ""We can't go anywhere -- we weren't even free to go to the (athletes') village. So it was a different experience from that perspective. ""The opening day you get all the different athletes but after that, of course, for security issues the Dream Team were by themselves."" But he added: ""The Olympic gold medal is a huge accomplishment and so is my career with NBA basketball. I'm just happy that I get the opportunity to accomplish both."" Olajuwon retired in 2002 but is still involved in the game, acting as a mentor for the likes of current superstars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. Argentina's Luis Scola followed in Olajuwan's footsteps at Houston Rockets and to the top of the Olympic podium. The Nightmare Team . The forward center achieved the feat at the 2004 Games in Athens, on the way beating a U.S. lineup which acquired the unfortunate label of ""The Nightmare Team."" It was a stunning upset, but proof that the rest of the world had raised their standards to match America's NBA elite. ""I take a lot of pride in the gold medal because of the whole experience that happened behind it,"" he told CNN. ""When you talk to somebody here in the U.S. and they find out you played in the Olympics and they are like, 'Wow, the Olympics?' 'Yeah.' 'How did you do?' 'We won it.' They are stunned, they cannot believe it really."" U.S. basketball chiefs were sufficiently stunned to revamp its organization and coaching staff so by the 2008 Olympics in Beijing traditional dominance had been restored. Scola and his Argentina teammates took the bronze medal in China. He will be in an Argentina squad attempting to cause another upset at the 2012 Olympics in London, but believes U.S. success is almost inevitable. ""There are three big sports here: baseball, American football and basketball. Basketball is really the only one that's played in the Olympics. So I think that plays a role too. ""There's a lot of talent in the U.S., a lot of talent. There's 10 different teams you can pick players from and that will be a very good team and eventually you can win a medal or a gold medal, no question about that."" Women's star . For WNBA legend Lisa Leslie, defeat at the Olympics just wasn't an option. She played in four Games and won four golds with an all-conquering U.S. squad from 1996 to 2008. ""I really loved that moment of being on the podium and having the gold medal placed around my neck, just listening to the chants and listening to our national anthem -- that always gives me chills,"" she told CNN. ""That was my favorite sports moment."" Boosted by her record 488 points, 241 rebounds and 36 blocked shots in Olympic competition, Leslie and her teammates had a remorseless winning attitude. ""Our main goal was one game at a time, one country, one goal, and that's to win a gold medal."" Leslie, who retired from the Los Angeles Sparks in 2009, will go down in history as the first woman to complete a slam dunk in a professional game. The six foot five inch center achieved the feat in 2002 and went on to make it her trademark during a glittering career.","United States has dominated men's and women's Olympic basketball .

"(CNN) -- Trucks carrying supplies to NATO troops crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the first time in seven months on Thursday after Islamabad agreed to reopen routes, officials said. The four trucks, under heavy security, crossed the border from Chaman in Pakistan's Balochistan province. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants have to be trucked in from Pakistan. On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops. The incident plunged U.S.-Pakistan relations to an all-time low. The Pakistani routes offer a shorter and more direct route than the one NATO has been using since November that went through Russia and other nations, avoiding Pakistan altogether. It has cost the U.S. $100 million more a month to use the alternative northern routes. Imran Khan, founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party, lambasted the decision to reopen the routes, saying it was done without meeting conditions set forth by Parliament. He also criticized the incumbent government as being a pawn of the United States. The talks to reopen routes had been stuck on two key issues -- Pakistan's demand to charge more per container shipped across its border, and Pakistan's demand that the United States apologize for the friendly fire incident in November 2011. Pakistani Taliban issue threats over reopening of NATO supply routes . On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized. ""We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military. We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again,"" Clinton's statement said. Until her apology, the U.S. government had only expressed regret over the incident, but had not issued a direct apology. Under Tuesday's announcements, Pakistan agreed not to impose any transit fee with the reopened routes, Clinton said in a statement. The Pakistani route costs about $250 per truck. Pakistan had been seeking $5,000 per truck as a condition of reopening the supply lines, which the United States refused to pay. The U.S. military will now pay Pakistan $1.1 billion it owes as part of the deal struck to reopen the NATO supply lines, according to U.S. officials who had knowledge of the agreement's details but weren't authorized to speak publicly. The money is part of a U.S. military program called ""coalition support funds,"" which reimburses the Pakistani military for counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries. The Pentagon will consult with Congress about paying the bills prior to paying Pakistan in full, according to one of the U.S. officials. Meanwhile, the Pakistani Taliban has threatened to attack NATO trucks, saying the supplies are used to target its members fighting against occupation in Afghanistan. Transporters who resume supplies will be ""considered a friend of the U.S."" and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said Wednesday. Taliban have attacked NATO supplies in the past, and killed drivers and other crew. U.S. and NATO secure exit route from Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- This year has provided something of a bumper crop of Catholic candidates. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan in the general election. Given the endless cycle of sin and guilt that we have to live with, sometimes it feels like it's easier for a Catholic to get elected president than it is to get into heaven. But political strength doesn't necessarily mean political unity. Today's Catholic vote is divided by intensity of faith. According to Gallup, the ""very religious"" lean toward Romney and the ""nonreligious"" prefer Obama, by significant margins. This reflects an internal story of conflict between liberal and conservative perspectives on what it means to be a Catholic. Biden and Ryan stand on either side of that debate, and their selections as running mates signal vastly different approaches to winning the Catholic vote. Joe Biden is part of the Vatican II generation of Catholics, reared on the lofty ambitions of the 1960s. After the Vatican II council, the church reformed its liturgy to encourage greater participation of the laity and make the Mass more accessible. For many Catholics, evangelization and catechism became less important than charity and social activism. Some, like Biden, have even accepted homosexuality and abortion as part of society's slow evolution toward justice for all. ""The animating principle of my faith,"" he said in 2008, ""as taught to me by church and home, was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power."" This commitment to egalitarian democracy could even make him a critic of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Although he carries his rosary everywhere and attends Mass on Sunday, Biden struggles with the concept of obedience. ""There are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church, you are at odds with the church,"" he told an interviewer. ""I think the church is bigger than that."" On the campaign trail, Biden's Catholicism expresses itself in public attendance at ethnic Catholic events like the St Patrick's Day parade in Pittsburgh. But he also recently took time out to eat ice cream with the nuns of Dubuque. Some interpreted this as a private ""thank you"" for the support many sisters have shown for Obamacare, contradicting the public position of their bishops. It's also notable that Biden's Catholicism was invoked by many commentators after his embrace of same-sex marriage, as if he spoke for a generation of Catholics who have come to terms with social change. When it comes to the culture war, Biden enjoys a certain amount of soft power. Belief: Paul Ryan will provoke a debate on Catholic politics . By contrast, Paul Ryan's engagement with the Catholic power is all hard power. His rhetoric is steeped in conservative historicism and theology. He explained his legislative philosophy to Townhall Magazine this way, ""As a congressman and Catholic layman, I really feel that Catholic social truths are in accord with the 'self-evident truths' our Founders bequeathed to us at our nation's founding: independence, limited government and the dignity and freedom of every human person."" Ergo, his budget proposals aren't just good bookkeeping, he says. They are both American and Christian. When Paul Ryan was growing up, the charismatic, anti-communist John Paul II was Pope. His traditionalist ethos has been continued and expanded under Benedict XVI, who has talked seriously of the church becoming smaller but purer. In this context, Republicanism and Catholicism find synergy -- and Ryan is its embodiment. He has a large family, boasts a 100% percent prolife voting record, and supported the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Ryan also is happy to lend his Catholic moral theology credentials to his new boss, who sometimes struggles to strike a chord with religious voters. Belief: GOP's non-Protestant ticket changes meaning of 'values' During his Norfolk speech accepting Mitt Romney's nod, Ryan got big applause for his promise to help ""save the American dream."" But he got much bigger applause for this statement: ""Our rights come from nature and God, not government."" It's a neat appropriation of the Catholic belief that dignity is a gift from God, for the sake of rallying conservatives of all backgrounds. For those who like their state small, it suggests contempt for the civil rights-guaranteeing federal leviathan. For those who want it just large enough to outlaw same-sex marriage and abortion, it promises a Christian approach to governance. Whereas Biden meets privately with nuns and emphasizes a private faithfulness, Ryan puts his Catholicism right out in the open -- and he attracts some evangelical support for doing it. Does any of this matter? In a tight election, perhaps. In 2004, George W. Bush made a big play for churchgoing Catholics, hitting themes of sexual and social conservatism. The result was that a) the Catholic vote was just as important in deciding the election as the evangelical vote and b) Catholic voting split along lines of church attendance. Overall, Bush won the Catholic vote 52% to 47%, a vital factor in a relatively close election. So Biden and Ryan present opportunities and challenges for their tickets. Biden will appeal to those Catholics (some say, a silent majority) who define themselves as faithful but who are also tolerant of cultural difference. But precisely because his appeal isn't strictly religious, it may fail to stir excitement on the campaign trail. For Ryan, the visibility of his faith won't be a problem. But he will have to find a way of expanding its appeal beyond social conservatives. As former Bush strategist Deal Hudson writes, he still has to find a way of reconciling his fiscal conservatism to Catholicism's empathy for the powerless and poor. If he sticks to purely moral themes, while also pushing for budget cuts, his brand of Catholic fervor may come across as all fire and brimstone and no heart. In an age of recession, that may not generate the votes that he and Romney need to win. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Stanley.","Tim Stanley: The VP candidates reflect divide between liberal and conservative Catholicism .
He says Biden is a post-Vatican II Catholic aimed at social justice and accessible faith .
He says Ryan hews to traditional Catholicism; record is anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage .

"(CNN) -- Tyson Gay tuned up for his Olympic showdown with Jamaican stars Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake with victory over 100m in the Diamond League meeting in London Friday. In three weeks time just across the British capital, the American will be hoping to cross the line first again in the 100m final, but will be hoping to avoid the damp and cold conditions that all the sprinters faced at Crystal Palace. The 29-year-old American came surging through to win in 10.03 seconds into a headwind, with Ryan Bailey second and Nesta Carter in third. Carter's Jamaican teammate Asafa Powell pulled out before the start of the meeting to rest an injury. ""I feel pretty good with the win. The weather wasn't that bad, it's very important to acclimatise and the weather helps me prepare mentally for the Games,"" said Gay. ""I'm in pretty good shape -- I want that Olympic gold,"" he added. Going to the Games, or watching at home? Send us your pictures and videos .

"(CNN) -- ""Did you hear the news? Anderson Cooper came out,"" I heard one guy tell another on the elevator at the magazine where I work. ""Is it really 'coming out' when everyone already knew you were gay?"" the other guy joked. To media insiders in New York City, Cooper's sexuality may have been no secret, but to the rest of the world, his romantic inclinations were a mystery -- an ever-present and provocative question mark. As an out lesbian and journalist, I've always felt conflicted about the uncertainty of Cooper's sexuality. On the one hand, I can delight in the mystery of a person's unspoken and enigmatic preferences, wondering: Is he gay? Straight? Bi? Maybe he's asexual. On the other, before he came out I couldn't help but wonder if he'd felt the need to veil his homosexuality to make himself palatable to the masses. It's irksome to think that he'd have to cater to the ignorant until he could secure a large following. Hopefully his coming out will blast the perception that you can't be openly gay and a widely respected public figure. When I put on my journalistic hat, I can definitely vouch for his point in an e-mail to The Daily Beast's Andrew Sullivan about the advantages of remaining unreadable to your interviewees. It's easier to forge a bond and to gain the trust of your subjects if the conversation isn't crowded with your slant on hot-button issues. If they see you as neutral -- or a blank page -- they can assume (albeit, often falsely) that you share their core values and beliefs, which elevates their level of comfort and opens them up. Anderson Cooper: The fact is, I'm gay . The truth is I can see the massive benefits of Cooper wanting to secure his professional standing before coming out. As a nationally beloved commentator, he'll successfully test the hearts and minds of viewers who may not be comfortable with homosexuality but respect and admire him. He couldn't have managed that had he come out before amassing a large and loving audience. The political impact of him revealing his same-sex preferences now, as opposed to when his career first launched, are far greater. But even now that he's out, I can't quite put away the idea that there's something wildly subversive and compelling about people who refuse firm categorization. I'd even argue that it's more radical -- maybe even more progressive -- to resist publicly categorizing one's sexuality, especially given the dark underbelly of those categories, which work to classify, police, target and judge bodies, particularly those imbued with desires and pleasures society terms ""deviant."" It may unsettle people to not know whether they are looking at a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgendered person, but in the space of uncertainty and discomfort is a possibility for growth. My Take: Will there be gays in heaven? We're forced out of lazy habits of thought and compelled to keep questioning and wondering when the nature of something or someone is uncertain. In some ways, sexual identity categories foreclose this opportunity by locking us into place and stemming the possibility of reconceiving and reimagining the world. That said, I know that there's a pragmatic purpose and power in numbers and visibility -- and that gay role models are as important as ever. With the epidemic of bullying in our country and the shocking number of high-profile gay teen suicides in recent years, Cooper's announcement is no small coup for gay youths. Role models are important for all kids, but especially for those who've been maligned and marginalized because of their difference. I can testify firsthand how important they were to me. Chely Wright: The cost of coming out . I didn't have any gay role models until I got to college. At UC Berkeley, in the late '90s, I majored in English with a concentration on gender and sexuality. My professors were a wild pack of queer and feminist thinkers intent on dismantling social hierarchies and trying to reassemble the world for the betterment of the misfit and mistreated. It was like living in a John Waters film, where all the freaks got center stage and were made to relish their queerness and triumph in their status as outsiders. Being in a room with an openly lesbian professor and knowing that I was valued, rather than vilified, for the ways in which I didn't fit in was a soothing antidote to all those adolescent years of self-loathing and doubt. When powerful pop cultural icons like Cooper affirm their homosexuality, it serves a similar purpose for gay kids. They are better able to see their way toward a brighter future and drum up the strength and courage to withstand the scorn and alienation that come -- far too often -- with being gay.

"(CNN) -- It's been called ""something Smurfs would play on,"" labeled a danger to players and derided over a lack of consultation. Madrid's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons. But is the furore justified? After all, isn't this the same surface -- just a different color? It's the nature of sports stars to be hyper-sensitive about their office environment. As one British journalist argued, a malfunctioning computer can waste your morning's work, but a ridge in a tennis court might spell the end of a career. The sport has undergone some of its most dramatic modernizations in the last two decades. Let's not forget the uproar when Hawk-Eye, the electronic ball tracking system, was introduced in the 1990s. But if the controversy over the last few weeks has revealed anything about tennis, it's that this is a game where tradition still looms large. Ion Tiriac's baby . The man behind the blue revolution is Romanian billionaire Ion Tiriac. The former French Open doubles winner and manager to Boris Becker has had a blue bee in his bonnet for a while. He pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in Stuttgart -- a lead followed by the Australian and U.S. Opens. Tiriac argues the color increases the visibility of the yellow ball and points to scientific tests proving the contrast is at least 15% better on blue than red. The fact it's also the color of Madrid's major sponsor, Spanish insurance giant Mutua Madrilena, has not been lost on his critics. A court by any other name . But really, it's just a color right? According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red, with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers. However, in Madrid these bricks are stripped of their iron oxide (the chemical that provides the original color) and then treated with dye. Tiriac acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay, but says the extra expense is worth it. He admits that improving the experience for television viewers watching his $10.6 million tournament was a major factor in the switch. Players see red . So what's all the fuss about? World No. 2 Rafael Nadal's shock exit in the third round on Thursday has only added fire to players' complaints that the new surface is too slippery. The ""King of Clay"" -- Nadal has won six of his last seven appearances at the French Open -- was beaten in a three-hour epic by fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco. It ended a 22-match winning streak on clay for Nadal that stretched back to 2011, and was his first defeat in 14 meetings with Verdasco. ""I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point,"" Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed. But even before his huge upset, the 25-year-old was critical of the new surface, tweeting: ""The history of clay court was on red. It wasn't on blue. Only one person wins -- the owner of the tournament."" A slippery slope? World No. 1 Novak Djokovic also threatened not to step on Madrid's blue clay again after he lost to Janko Tipsarevic. The Serbian beat Nadal in last year's final, held on red clay, and he expressed his unhappiness with the new surface even after beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 in his opening match on Tuesday. ""Today I played my first official match on blue clay and I have to admit I was not very happy. Next time I have to bring skates instead of shoes, it was sooo slippery,"" the 24-year-old said on Facebook. Likewise, Ukrainian player Sergiy Stakhovsky tweeted: ""After playing a match on blueclay court 6 I can say with full responsibility on my shoulders that it is the worst court of @ATPWorldTour."" In the women's draw, world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka also complained about the slide, telling reporters: ""The surface is a bit slippery, but it's the same for all of us."" It's not just the texture of the surface raising eyebrows -- on the most basic level it just looks different. ""Ha! Blue clay.. It looks like something Smurfs would play on,"" tweeted player Ivo Karlovic, in what has become a catchphrase of the tournament. But it's not all blue. American star Serena Williams didn't see what all the fuss was about. ""I haven't noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay. I think it's the same, it's just you don't get as dirty,"" she tweeted. Technically speaking . According to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay -- which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface. Alistair McCaw, a performance specialist to tennis stars including Jelena Dokic, has been watching the action close-up in Madrid. ""The problem is not the fact that the color is blue, even though the change from the traditional brown is quite a shock. Let's not forget the Australian Open changing court color from the green to that bright blue! The players had a lot to say about that too,"" he said on his Facebook page. ""It's that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal. If you dig your foot into the surface and remove some of the clay, you will notice that the underlying surface is a hard rubber-like mat. When water is sprayed on the surface, it become slippery. This, in my opinion, is what's causing the main problems."" Former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic tested the blue clay at Madrid last year and admitted it did ""look a bit slippery."" But the Croatian, who retired last month, didn't believe it was a safety issue. Part of being a pro tennis player is adapting to different surfaces, he said. And besides, the biggest challenge at Madrid isn't the clay -- it's the altitude. Balls fly faster through thinner air and Madrid is 650 meters above sea level. ""I would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay -- any clay,"" Ljubicic told CNN. ""Regarding adaptation, tennis players face different surfaces on a weekly basis, every clay court is a bit different. I would say that the altitude in Madrid creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court."" Eyes on the prize ... no, the other prize . The issue isn't just about Madrid, of course. The tournament is seen as an important buildup to the real clay-court crown -- the French Open. Players have argued it's difficult enough adjusting to the conditions in Madrid, without then having to change their game at Roland Garros at the end of the month. Perhaps most galling for the top players is that they were never consulted over the controversial changes. ""Players should be agreeing to the change -- there should be some value in what they say,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""I'm not blaming the tournament, it is fighting for its own interests. But the ATP should have done a better job on player rights in protecting what the players want."" Ljubicic added that even when players did raise objections, they were ignored. ""Players were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts. They clearly refused the idea -- only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue,"" he said. The ATP has granted permission for a one-year trial of the tournament, and says it'll be taking into account players' feedback. Judging by the response so far, Tiriac will have a battle on his hands to keep blue in 2013.","Madrid's new blue clay courts have caused an uproar in the tennis world .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities unsealed Monday an indictment charging five men in the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and offering up to $1 million for information leading to the arrest of the four men still at large. The investigation into the December 2010 killing revealed the existence of a botched federal operation that had sought to investigate U.S.-Mexican arms trafficking and led to the historic vote by the House of Representatives that found U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress. The indictment charges Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, Ivan Soto-Barraza, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes and Lionel Portillo-Meza with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, attempted interference with commerce by robbery, carrying and using a firearm during a crime of violence, assault on a federal officer and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The truth about the Fast and Furious scandal . A sixth defendant, Rito Osorio-Arellanes, is charged solely with conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery. A federal grand jury in the District of Arizona handed up the 11-count indictment November 7. It alleges that, on December 14, 2010, five of the defendants (Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, Ivan Soto-Barraza, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes and Lionel Portillo-Meza) were involved in a firefight with Border Patrol agents during which Terry was fatally shot. The indictment says the defendants had entered the United States illegally from Mexico in order to rob drug traffickers of marijuana. Terry was fatally shot when he and other members of a Border Patrol tactical unit tried to apprehend the men, officials said. Laura E. Duffy, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, noted to reporters in Tucson, Arizona, that covert efforts had not resulted in any arrests, and said officials decided it was in the best interests of the investigation to unseal the case and enlist the assistance of the public in the United States and Mexico. Toward that end, James L. Turgal Jr., FBI special agent in charge, Phoenix Division, said the FBI was offering up to $250,000 per fugitive for information leading to their arrest. The incident occurred in Rio Rico, Arizona, a remote area commonly used by people smuggling drugs into the country on foot, she said. It is about 10 miles north of the border. That night, four members of the Border Patrol team were on a steep hill above a wash; two other team members were in a nearby observation post from which they could monitor foot traffic and relay radio communications, Duffy said. Timeline: Fast and Furious investigation started with agent's death . Soon after 11 p.m., a ground sensor alerted the team to the presence of people on foot in the area; within a few minutes agents saw five armed men walking toward the agents, she said. ""As the armed group passed through the wash below, the agents announced their presence; several of the armed individuals turned with weapons raised,"" she said. The agents fired nonlethal bean-bag rounds at the subjects, who responded with gunfire, she said. A single bullet struck Terry, who died at the scene. Four of the five suspects fled; the fifth, Manuel Osorio-Arellans, was wounded and taken into custody. Two days before, on December 12, Border Patrol agents had arrested a sixth man, Rito Osorio-Arellanes, who was to have been part of the group, Duffy said. He was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery. He is Manuel Osorio-Arellanes' brother; both men are in custody in Arizona, Duffy said. ""The other four are believed to be at large in Mexico."" If they are arrested, U.S. officials will seek their extradition, she said. The case has attracted attention because of its link to Operation Fast and Furious. Launched by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the operation was intended to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, the operation lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of Terry's killing. Duffy alluded to the controversy that has swirled around the case, which has provided ample fodder for AM-radio talk-show hosts, noting that ""there are almost unprecedented atmospherics that have surrounded this case."" She would not say whether the bullet that killed Terry came from one of the guns involved in the botched program. But, she added, ""I want the Terry family and members of the U.S. Border Patrol to know that those atmospherics have not distracted the efforts of this prosecution team."" Congress voted June 28 to hold Holder in contempt for refusing to hand over documents related to the program. Poll: Americans' views on contempt vote . Republicans said that was because he was not fully compliant with a House subpoena requesting the documents; Democrats and the Justice Department countered that the documents withheld were internal deliberations that have, by tradition, been kept private during past administrations of both parties. ""Agent Terry served his country honorably and made the ultimate sacrifice in trying to protect it from harm, and we will stop at nothing to bring those responsible for his murder to justice,"" Holder said. In a statement, Terry's family members thanked Duffy and the Mexican government for their efforts in the investigation and reiterated their call for Holder to comply with the request for documents related to the case. ""Agent Terry died as a hero protecting this country; he and his family rightly deserve a full and thorough explanation of how Operation Fast and Furious came to be,"" said Terry family attorney Patrick McGroder in the statement from the family. Rep. Jason Chaffetz said the indictments should have been unsealed long ago. ""It's too bad that it didn't happen 14 months ago,"" said the Republican from Utah, who is on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in a telephone interview. He accused the Justice Department of having ""not taken this seriously."" Mexico accuses U.S. agent in border shooting .

"Joliet, Illinois (CNN) -- Attorneys for Drew Peterson, a former Chicago-area police officer accused of murdering his third wife, argued during opening statements Tuesday that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless. ""Kathy slipped, fell, hit her head in a household accident, and drowned. Case closed,"" said attorney Joel Brodsky. Kathleen Savio was found dead in a bathtub in 2004. Peterson also remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. Prosecutors, meanwhile, argued that Peterson was motivated to kill, at least in part, by his desire to avoid settlement payments to his ex-wife. ""This (is) not a case where you'll have DNA, fingerprints, or a videotaped confession . . . (But) when you've heard all the evidence, you'll be able to determine that Drew Peterson killed Kathleen Savio beyond a reasonable doubt,"" said Will Country State's Attorney James Glasgow during his opening statement. Prosecutors called Mary Pontarelli, a neighbor, as their first witness. Her voice cracked on a couple of occasions as she described finding the body of Savio, her friend. Court is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning. A jury of seven men and five women, chosen over two days last week, will decide Drew Peterson's fate during the trial in Joliet, Illinois, which is expected to last about a month, according to his lawyer. Peterson, 58, was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Kales, who later became Stacy Peterson. Savio and Peterson filed for divorce that October, and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook, Illinois, police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Drew Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. A judge in March 2002 granted Savio a protection order from her ex-husband, prohibiting him from being near her, entering her home or taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits. Savio had claimed that months later, Peterson held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home. On February 27, 2004, Drew Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home, spending the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed Savio; she was found naked and dead in her dry tub the next day. At the time of her death, a court was mulling how their marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. Police initially treated the scene as an accident, although the Illinois State Police was later brought in to investigate. Peterson's trial had been set to start in July 2010 but was delayed. In April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Drew Peterson's still-missing wife Stacy against him, a key development in the case. The ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbade prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. The defense had argued that using the statements would violate Drew Peterson's right to confront the witnesses against him.","NEW: Court is scheduled to resume Wednesday morning .

"(CNN) -- Portugal striker Cristiano Ronaldo has been unveiled as Real Madrid's new number 9, in front of 80,000 passionate fans at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, after his world record $130 million move from Manchester United. Cristiano Ronaldo is paraded in front of 80,000 passionate supporters at a packed Bernabeu stadium.

""I have made my childhood dream a reality -- to play for Real Madrid,"" Ronaldo told the packed stands. ""I am just so happy to be here,"" he said to a rapturous reception from the gathered thousands. ""I really didn't expect a jam-packed stadium -- this is truly impressive.""

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- An Australian woman is planning to dive into the ocean off Havana on Friday in her bid to become the first person to swim across the Florida Straits without a shark cage or swim aids such as flippers or a wetsuit. If successful, Penny Palfrey, 49, would surpass her own record that she set in 2011 for the longest unassisted swim. Palfrey swam more than 67 miles from Little Grand Cayman island to Big Grand Cayman island. Her swim to the Florida Keys will cover a much great section of water, much of it shark-infested. ""She will swim continuously 103 miles or 166 kilometers under standard open-water swimming rules; that means no wetsuit, no shark cage,"" her husband, Chris Palfrey, said Thursday when the couple spoke to reporters. ""There have been other attempts, but no one has completed the swim under these rules. We expect the team to take 40 to 50 hours,"" he said. In 1997, fellow Australian swimmer Susie Maroney completed a similar swim but from inside a shark cage. Golden girl of Australian swimming . In 2011, long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad twice tried and failed to complete the same journey. Nyad was waylaid by asthma attacks and stings from Portuguese man-of-war jellyfish. A lycra suit will provide her some protection from jellyfish, Palfrey said, and long cables called ""shark shields"" will be strung from the kayaks and boats around her to ward off larger predators. ""They emit an electric field through the water, which when a shark comes within 5 meters, it picks up the sensors on the snout, but they don't like it. They swim away,"" Palfrey said.

"(CNN) -- It's sacrilege to some Apple fanboys. It's also something none of Apple's competitors have been able to claim since that ""magical"" day in early 2010. But when Microsoft unveiled the Surface tablet (actually a pair of them) Monday, the software company clearly had one ultimate goal: to make a tablet that's better than the iPad. By most standards, Apple has crushed its tablet rivals that have tried to compete feature-for-feature. No single tablet running Google's Android system has gotten much traction (save the smaller, cheaper Kindle Fire from Amazon) and BlackBerry maker RIM's Playbook hit the market with a thud. And Microsoft's past attempts at building Apple-like gadgets -- witness the iPod-copying Zune -- have failed. Unlike some hasty competitors, Microsoft took its time getting into the tablet game. Earlier this year, the company rolled out the Windows 8 operating system, software that is optimized for mobile and that manufacturers such as Samsung and Asus are already building tablets around. But Microsoft clearly wanted to control at least one version of the hardware, a move it has largely shied away from during its history. And Microsoft seems determined to get this one right. So, the question remains -- will this be the tablet that finally gives Apple a run for its money? Details about the Surface are sketchy -- no price or release date were announced, and info about apps is scant. But there are at least five features CEO Steve Ballmer and friends showed off Monday that might make the Surface better than the iPad. Keyboard . A frustration for many users of the iPad and other touchscreen devices is the keyboard. While it's possible to get somewhat proficient at tapping spots on a flat screen, most acknowledge it's impossible to get e-mail and other documents written as quickly as with physical keys. Sure, there are third-party keyboards you can buy to add onto the iPad, but they can be clunky. The Surface keyboard will be part of its Touch Cover, which is connected with magnets and flips open. There will be a version with pressure-sensitive flat keys and another with more traditional raised keys called a Type Cover. They're both sleeker and thinner than many of the third-party offerings for the iPad. The Touch Cover is 3 millimeters thick, and the Type Cover is 5 millimeters. And for the style-sensitive among us, they'll come in a variety of colors, including black, pink, red and blue. Some folks see the inclusion of a keyboard as the Surface's big selling point. ""If it works well, the keyboard -- which I got to inspect at great length but not actually type on -- is going to be the Surface's killer attraction,"" wrote Slate's Farhad Manjoo. ""Lots of people get frustrated with the iPad because typing on it is a major chore. They want to use it like a full-fledged desktop, but they're stymied by the input method. ... If the Surface ships with the keyboard -- and if Microsoft markets the device as a tablet that will let you get some work done -- it could be a big hit."" Add the machine's trackpad and built-in ""kickstand,"" and you've got usability features that current iPads don't possess. Size . Apple has made such a compact, stylish tablet that many of its competitors look chunky by comparison. That's not true of the Surface, at least as it was demoed Monday. First, its display screen is 10.6 inches, almost a full inch bigger than the iPad's. And the company says it's optimized to have essentially the same dimensions as a movie screen: So, farewell black bars when watching video. The Surface for Windows RT is a fraction of a millimeter thinner than the iPad (9.3 vs. 9.4), while the heftier Surface for Windows 8 Pro will be 13.5 millimeters. The RT weighs virtually the same as the iPad (it's less than an ounce heavier), while the Pro will be around 2 pounds. The Surface's Touch Cover, with the keyboard, is 3 millimeters thick. ""Every micron matters within Microsoft Surface,"" Microsoft's Panos Panay said Monday. Power . Especially with the Windows 8 Pro model, Microsoft has set out to blur the line between tablets and the new wave of light, slim ultrabooks and their predecessor, Apple's Macbook Air. Tablets have always been a hybrid hovering somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop, best used for game playing, Web surfing and media consumption. Microsoft wants the Surface to be something you can actually do some work on. The Windows Pro model will run on an i5 Intel processor and come with up to 128 gigabytes of internal memory (the iPad currently goes up to 64). USB ports . Both versions of the Surface come with two USB ports (2.0 on the RT and a faster 3.0 on the Windows Pro). The lack of ports has been one of the few persistent compaints about the iPad. These ports open up the possibility of extra storage, printing and other external capabilities that should be easier and quicker than the workarounds iPad users need involving cloud storage, Wi-Fi connections and the like. Xbox SmartGlass . The Xbox SmartGlass feature, which Microsoft rolled out at this month's E3 video gaming expo, will work with the iPad and Android tablets. But it's not hard to envision Microsoft optimizing the technology for its own piece of hardware. The system looks to make the Xbox a central device in the living room -- one that may or may not be even used for video games. It will connect a smartphone or tablet with the Xbox, which in turn will be connected with the television. By connecting the devices, users can watch a movie on their television while getting bonus material on their tablet. They could also start enjoying a game or movie on the tablet, then transfer it to a TV -- or vice versa. If the feature is front and center on the Surface, it will be one more step in Microsoft's push to bring all of a user's devices together within the flexible Windows 8 system.","From early showing, Microsoft's Surface tablet could be superior to the iPad in some ways .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian authorities said Sunday they are preparing for a new round of negotiations with the man who has kidnapped two Americans and an Egyptian tour guide to demand his uncle's release from an Alexandria jail. Gen. Ahmed Bakr, the head of security in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula, says Bedouin sheikhs who are acting as mediators have confirmed the hostages ""are unharmed and well fed."" They include Michel Louis, the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Boston; Lisa Alphonse, a parishoner at another American church; and an Egyptian tour guide. Authorities have identified the hostage-taker as Germy Abu Masouh, a member of a prominent Bedouin tribe in the Sinai. He wants Egyptian police to free his uncle, whom Bakr said had been caught in Alexandria with a half-ton of drugs. Bakr said negotiators include top intelligence and police officials. ""We hope to reach a resolution soon,"" he said. ""Germy has threatened to kidnap more tourists if his demands are not met."" Abu Masouh told Egyptian news outlets that Louis, the pastor of Boston's Free Pentecostal Church of God, had been allowed to call his wife, who had been on the same bus. However, the minister's son, Daniel Louis, cast doubt on that claim Sunday afternoon. ""We have spoken to my mother, and my mother has told us that she has not spoken to my father,"" he said. Michel Louis suffers from diabetes, and the family doesn't know whether he has his medication, his son said. Another son, Jean Louis, told CNN earlier Sunday that the captive Americans were part of a group that was on its way to Israel. ""As the tour bus was in an area of the Sinai peninsula of Egypt, they were stopped by a couple of cars,"" Jean Louis told CNN's ""Early Start Weekend"" show. ""In the cars were some gentlemen who got onto the bus. They detained both my father .... and another woman who was part of the group on their way to Israel."" The family is praying for the safety of their father and the other kidnap victims, he said. ""We are concerned, but we're Christians. We believe in God. We're resolved in our faith, we know that God is going to see him out of the situation,"" he said. Jean Louis said the family was not aware of security concerns about travel across the Sinai, where Americans had been kidnapped and swiftly released in two separate incidents since February. ""If we were aware, I would believe we would use correct judgment not to enter that area,"" Jean Louis said. Bakr said the situation ""is partially the fault of the travel agency,"" which he said had not informed police of their route. If it had, ""we would have sent a police escort,"" he said. Authorities say the captives are still in the area where they were abducted. Kidnappings and armed robberies have increased since a popular uprising ousted Egypt's long-ruling dictator, Hosni Mubarak, last year. In a message posted on Twitter on Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo said it was ""in close touch with Egyptian authorities, who are doing everything they can to bring about safe release of the American tourists."" CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy reported from Cairo and Saad Abedine, from Atlanta. Richard Allen Greene and Randi Kaye contributed to this story.","NEW: The captives are ""are unharmed and well fed,"" an Egyptian official says .

"(CNN) -- The Veepstakes guessing game is over. In the red corner, we have Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, America's ""comeback team."" In the blue corner, we have Barack Obama and Joe Biden, America's current team. Let's get ready to rumble. Now that we know who the players are, the race is on to define Paul Ryan. Winning the contest of turning him into either a villain or hero could determine the election in several states, none more important than Florida, the big kid on the swing-state block. Paul Ryan has great potential, the potential to be an asset or a liability to the Republican ticket. How he affects the election in Florida depends primarily on two voting groups, seniors and Hispanics. We just don't know how he will play with those two groups. Polls show that most Americans don't know much about Rep. Paul Ryan. Political junkies either love or hate the Ryan Plan, but average Americans are more likely to be conversant on the latest contestants on ""Dancing with the Stars"" than on the intricacies of Ryan's budget proposal. The day after Ryan's selection was unveiled, headlines in the major Florida papers predicted Ryan could be a drag on the Republican ticket. The Romney campaign soon announced Ryan would visit Florida this next weekend. Ryan needs to clearly and unequivocally define himself. There will be a Medicare battle waged in Florida, a state with one of the biggest senior populations in the country. Democrats will say Ryan will end Medicare as we know it. Republicans will say he is a courageous leader who offers a responsible solution to the inevitable bankruptcy of Medicare and Social Security. I live in Florida and have seen this movie before. It usually involves scary robo-calls and political mailers targeting seniors. Opinion: Does Ryan Medicare plan make sense? While in Florida, he should also do Hispanic outreach. Latinos don't know Ryan from AdÃ¡n. Given the standing of the Republican brand with Latinos, that may be a good thing. Not being known is better than being disliked. Soon after Ryan was named, my inbox filled up with e-mails about his vote against the Dream Act, which would allow undocumented young people brought here as children to become legal under certain circumstances. This is a popular and emotion-laden measure among Latinos. Ryan had also been an opponent of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. This is a heresy for a dependable voting block of Cuban-American Republicans. Yikes! One of the negatives of a running mate with a long career in Congress is having to defend and explain an extensive voting record. This can be a challenge, but not an insurmountable one. Though Ryan voted against the Dream Act, he has not engaged in angry rhetoric towards immigrants or been a champion one way or another on immigration issues. He has not built his career by fanning anti-immigrant flames. Many in Congress, including Democrats, voted against the Dream Act. However, that vote makes him the only one of the four names on the ballot to have cast a vote against it. I don't know, and I suspect others don't either, if Ryan supports some other legal recourse for undocumented students and adults. He should tell us if he does before Democrats use his immigration votes to drive a wedge with the Latino community. Yes, Ryan voted in the past against the Cuban embargo. He comes from the Midwest, where the thought of selling farm goods to the island is appealing. His Cuban-American colleagues from Miami, including Congressmen Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart, say Ryan had a genuine conversion after they sat down with him and explained the realities of the totalitarian Cuban government. He has since then voted in favor of maintaining the embargo. Ryan should explain his change of heart or risk Democrats taking advantage of his past record to suppress the vote of Republican Cuban-Americans. Opinion: Why Paul Ryan? Ryan comes across as an articulate and earnest man of conviction and faith. He is a Catholic who, unlike Romney, has no qualms speaking about his religious beliefs. The Romney campaign should allow him to speak directly and engage in a constructive debate. Paul Ryan is comfortable showing emotion, so let him. He is very good at speaking about policy, so let him. Surprisingly, he stumbled out of the blocks in his first solo interview with Brit Hume earlier this week. He gave fuzzy answers to questions about the Romney budget. He said, ""We haven't run the numbers on that specific plan."" Boston, run the numbers now! Ryan is perceived as a numbers and ideas guy who can explain wonky concepts in lay terms. The expectations for him when discussing fiscal issues are high. There is no room for error. Paul Ryan can help win Florida and Latinos, but only if he lets us get to know him before the Democrats turn him into the monster underneath the bed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ana Navarro.","Paul Ryan's effect in Florida depends mostly on seniors and Hispanics, says Ana Navarro .

"(CNN) -- Glasgow Rangers, one of European football's most famous clubs, must play in the fourth flight of their domestic league next season, Scottish Football League (SFL) clubs decided Friday. The 30 clubs were asked to vote on admitting the most successful club in their country to the SFL and in which division they should be placed. Cash-strapped Rangers went into administration earlier this year and a new company was formed to allow them to continue as a professional team. They were subsequently expelled from the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and had to turn to the lesser SFL for next season. Why Rangers' financial meltdown should worry European football . At a news conference at Glasgow's Hampden Park, it was announced that 25 of the 30 clubs had voted for Rangers to start the 2012-13 season in the SFL Third Division. ""It has been a very, very important day for Scottish football,"" SFL chief executive David Longmuir told a press conference. ""We have voted to willingly accept Rangers as an associate member of the SFL (29 out of 30 clubs in favor) ""The only acceptable position will be to place Rangers FC into the Third Division from that start of this season, 2012/13. This decision followed a tried and tested process . ""Today's decision has been one of the most difficult for all concerned but it has been taken in the best interest of sporting fairness, which is the fundamental principle of the SFL."" But that decision is likely to have severe financial implications for Scottish football, which has struggled to attract the cash lavished on the English Premier League (EPL) south of the border. As one of its two great clubs, part of the famous ""Old Firm"" with Glasgow rivals Celtic, was facing up to years in the wilderness, the EPL sealed a sponsorship deal with Barclays Bank worth £40 million ($62.18 million). The three year deal is a near 50 per cent increase on the previous sums paid by Barclays and follows a month after the EPL improved a 70 per cent increase in the value of its domestic television rights to more than £3 billion ($4.67B) over three years to 2016. By contrast, the sponsorship and television deals for Scottish football are comparatively modest. A new five year television deal for the SPL, starting from the 2012-13 season, will bring in £80 million ($124.5m). Derby matches between Rangers and Celtic, who traditionally battle for the honors in the SPL, are the main attraction for Scottish football fans and armchair viewers. Reports have suggested that the new TV deal may even founder if a certain number of Old Firm matches cannot be guaranteed. Rangers have also been regulars in the European Champions League since its inception. They won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and as recently as 2008 were runners-up in the UEFA Cup (Now Europa League). SPL chief executive Neil Doncaster and his Scottish Football Association counterpart Stewart Regan both lobbied for Rangers to be placed in the SFL Division One so they could secure a quick return to the top flight, but their pleas were ignored. Rangers went into administration on February 14 this year following court action from UK tax officials. Businessman Charles Green purchased the assets of the club for £5.5 million ($8.55m) and they were transferred into a new company in June. Several leading players have since left the 54-time Scottish champions, claiming their contracts were effectively annulled when the new company was founded. Reacting to the SFL decision, Green said: ""We are grateful to be accepted as members of the SFL and accept their decision to vote us into Division 3. ""This decision maintains the sporting integrity that clubs and fans across Scotland have been calling for but it also impacts massively on Scottish football as a whole and only time will tell what the consequences will be. ""We are a football club and we just want to get back to playing football. Now is the time to move on and start afresh.""","Rangers to play in Scottish fourth flight next season .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Philip is continuing to make progress and respond well to treatment for the recurrence of a bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said Friday. Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland on Wednesday. Doctors have suggested the Duke of Edinburgh gets some rest, so there will be no visitors Friday, palace officials said, but the family are in constant touch with him by telephone. The 91-year-old, who first suffered the problem in June, fell ill again as he was staying at the royal residence in Balmoral, Scotland, where the queen traditionally spends part of the summer. The palace said he had been taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure and was likely to be kept in for several days. It is the third time Philip has been hospitalized in the past eight months. Before the bladder infection, which he initially contracted during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. However, he appeared in good form early this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29. He appeared by her side at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games at the end of July and accompanied her on a visit to the Olympic Park as the events got under way. It has been a particularly busy year for the queen and Duke of Edinburgh because of the many events held to celebrate her diamond jubilee. Addressing Parliament in March, the queen paid tribute to her husband as ""a constant strength and guide"" throughout her long reign. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then to England in 1928. Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947.","Prince Philip is continuing to make progress after two nights in hospital, palace officials say .

"London (CNN) -- British government ministers fought back Sunday against accusations they had taken their eye off the Olympic security ball, rejecting accusations they were warned nearly a year ago about the security giant contracted to provide guards for the Games. G4S, the security contractor, admitted on Wednesday that it would not be able to provide more than 10,000 security staffers by the time the Olympics begin in less than two weeks. The government hurriedly announced it would bring in 3,500 military personnel to boost security for the Games. Sports Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Sunday it should be no surprise that some contractors were unable to meet their commitments. ""It's completely normal that you're going to find some contractors on a project of this size who aren't going to be able to deliver what they promised,"" he said on the BBC's Andrew Marr show. He praised the contractor as being ""honorable"" for having admitted the problem, apologizing and covering the costs of bringing in military personnel. And he reiterated that the government learned only last week that G4S would not meet its commitment. ""Management told us right up until last week that everything was on track,"" Hunt said. The contractor said Saturday it stands to lose up to $77 million after failing to recruit enough staff. Also on Sunday, the Home Office rejected a newspaper report that it had been cautioned about G4S in September of last year. The Home Office, which is responsible for domestic security, said it was ""inaccurate"" that a report by the police watchdog agency Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary ""should have raised alarm bells about the readiness of G4S."" The report ""into Olympics security preparedness -- which has never been published -- raised serious issues over G4S last year,"" the Independent on Sunday said. The Home Office denied that. ""While an early inspection highlighted issues to be addressed, a report in February 2012 said that LOCOG was on track to deliver the required number of security personnel,"" the Home Office said in a statement. LOGOC is the London Olympic Games Organising Committee, which is running the Games. G4S chief executive Nick Buckles said Saturday he was ""deeply disappointed"" the firm was unable to live up to its contract with LOCOG. ""We clearly took in a contract in good faith,"" Buckles said. ""We were a vital part of securing the games. The military would have to be called in to help us through that process. We know a number of these soldiers had had to cancel leave to come back and help us with the process ... we feel we caused a huge problem."" Buckles acknowledged the company was at fault and said it was grateful the military is providing support. ""We are sorry they had to give up leave, truly,"" he said. ""It is down to G4S ... we were contracted to deliver staff. We should have done that."" London Olympics organizer defends security contractor . The military deployment means that 17,000 military personnel will be on duty in the United Kingdom during the Games, compared with the 9,500 currently in Afghanistan. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the security operation will not impact operations in Afghanistan, which is the main effort for the military. Some personnel who would have had leave over the Olympic period will have the leave rescheduled, the spokesman said. G4S had been expected to recruit a staff of about 10,400 as part of a total security force of 23,700 for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The staffers were to provide venue perimeter security, including manning X-ray machines, conducting spectator and vehicle searches and operating closed-circuit television, said G4S spokesman Adam Mynott. The contractor said this week that while 4,000 are already at work across 100 venues, more than 9,000 are still going through the training and vetting process. In a statement Saturday, the company said it had ""encountered significant difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training, vetting and accreditation procedures. As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers."" UK: 3,500 extra troops called in for Olympic security . That failure is likely to cost the firm between Â£35m and Â£50m ($54 million -$77 million), it said. G4S ""deeply regrets that, despite the relentless efforts of so many of its people, it is unlikely to deliver in full its obligations to LOCOG, to the government and to everyone with an interest in these Games."" Britain is on a heightened state of alert ahead of the Games, which open on July 27. Home Secretary Theresa May said Thursday that ""there is no question of Olympic security being compromised."" But opposition lawmakers have described the situation as a ""shambles,"" saying it raises concerns over the government's grip on the preparations for the Olympics and Paralympics. LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said Friday he was ""extraordinarily impressed with"" private contractor G4S so far. Coe said he was happy with the security staff on site and that while G4S has ""challenges,"" it would get there. Olympic organizers have agreed to give 10,000 tickets to the armed forces to compensate for the short-notice deployment, the Ministry of Defence said. The questions over security staff come as Britain gears up to welcome many of the visiting teams' officials this weekend ahead of the athletes' arrival on Monday. One headache was removed for organizers with the reopening Friday of the main highway linking Heathrow airport with central London. The busy M4 motorway had been closed for a week for emergency repairs to a viaduct. Is Olympic-level security already under way in Britain? CNN's Erin McLaughlin, Susannah Palk and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Sports Secretary Jeremy Hunt says it's normal for some contractors to fall through .

"Athens (CNN) -- After yet more financial turmoil and political wrangling, citizens in Greece readied to hit the polls Sunday to decide an election that may determine the debt-stricken country's future in the eurozone and significantly impact the global economy. Two parties, New Democracy and Syriza, are considered to be front-runners going into the vote. Campaigning has now ended but in the last official polls they were running neck-and-neck. No new polls are allowed in the 14 days before voting takes place. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? Should a working majority emerge under the leadership of the moderate New Democracy party, Greece may follow through with the next installment of public spending cuts demanded by its ""troika"" of creditors: the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. But if the left-wing Syriza party emerges as the largest, with its commitment to tear up the current bailout agreement, markets will begin to anticipate a ""disorderly exit"" from the eurozone. Sunday's election was called after an initial ballot on May 6, the first since Greece's financial crisis exploded, failed to deliver a majority for any one party and talks to create a government failed. Since then, Greece -- whose people have been suffering under a heavy burden of painful austerity measures, high unemployment and a long-running recession -- has been roiled by uncertainty and division. Global markets have also been volatile amid fears that Greece could exit the euro currency union, a step that could drag down other ailing euro nations and send shock waves through the world's financial markets. Many voters were focused on Greece's Euro 2012 soccer match against Russia on Saturday night in Warsaw -- a welcome distraction from the political drama playing out at home, especially after Giorgos Karagounis's goal helped propel the Greek side into the high-profile tournament's quarterfinal round. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt . Some analysts fear Sunday's election could again result in no clear winner, leaving Greece with a weak caretaker government at a time when the nation needs clear leadership. Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras has threatened to renege on the terms of Greece's bailout, but he has also expressed a desire to remain in the euro currency union. Antonis Samaras, leader of New Democracy, has said his party wants to remain in the eurozone and alter existing policies, including stringent austerity measures, to ""achieve development and offer people relief."" New Democracy and the Socialist Pasok party were punished by voters in the last election for supporting the bailout program, as well as for agreeing to the austerity measures that came with it. Greece must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered ""compliant"" with the terms of its bailout program. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . Speaking to his Cabinet for the last time Friday, interim Prime Minister Panagiotis Pikrammenos praised the spirit of teamwork the caretaker government had shown in office. In these difficult hours, he said, ""Greece will have a much better outcome if we all put aside our differences and work towards the common good of this nation."" His government had dealt with very difficult issues in the past 30 days, he said, and its work would continue until a new elected government was in place. The situation in Greece is likely to be on the minds of world leaders as they meet in Mexico on Monday for the Group of 20 summit. Some experts argue that a potential Greek exit would be manageable, assuming the European Central Bank and European Union policymakers respond aggressively. As economic crisis bites, Greece's children pay the price . But others worry that such an unprecedented event would cause chaos in financial markets and shock the global economy. What does it mean to be Greek right now? Tell us on CNN iReport. CNN's Irene Chapple and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","NEW: The Greek soccer team's win in Euro 2012 provides a welcome distraction .

Just over three million tickets are available for next year's 64-match tournament, the first to be held in Africa, although only half of those will be sold to the public. Requests for tickets can be made on the FIFA.com Web site from February 20 until March 31. Applications will be followed by a random draw for tickets on April 15. Fans around the world can apply for the first 740,000 tickets now. Applications can be made for individual tickets or team-specific ones. There will be four further sales periods, with the second running from May 4 to November 16. Unlike the first-sales phase, applications will be dealt with on a first come first served basis.

Later in the year, 570,000 will be made available to supporters of qualified countries and a further 344,000 will also be made available to those buying tickets through an official tour operator. ""Our ticketing policy has been drawn up to reflect our determination to ensure that FIFA's flagship competition is accessible to all football fans,"" said Jerome Valcke, FIFA secretary general. Owing to South Africa's location, demand for tickets overall is expected to be down on the 20 million requests made for 750,000 tickets at the first stage of the last World Cup in Germany. Prices range from $80 for the cheapest ticket in the group stages up to $900 for the most expensive seat in the house to watch the final in Johannesburg on July 11 next year. A special $20 ticket, making up 15-20 percent of the total, can only be bought by South African residents to encourage local attendance. Only South Africa as hosts have so far qualified for the tournament, which kicks off on June 11, also in Johannesburg. The organizers, already beset with problems during construction of stadiums that led to speculation the tournament would have to take place elsewhere, will hoping to avoid a repeat of the empty-seat fiasco of the last two World Cups. Of the 700,000 tickets available for sale overseas for games in Japan, more than 40 percent were reserved for national associations and around 30 percent for sponsors. Only between 50 and 60 percent of these set-aside allocations sold out leading to anger among traveling fans without tickets. And the same thing happened in Germany, when stadium announcers boasts of games being a sell-out were met with ironic cheers from the stands.","First lot of tickets have gone on sale for 2010 World Cup in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Bolton Wanderers manager Owen Coyle revealed Tuesday he had held a ""brief conversation"" with stricken Fabrice Muamba after the soccer star suffered a cardiac arrest during a match on Saturday. The 23-year-old collapsed on the pitch during a clash with Tottenham Hotspur in the English FA Cup and was rushed to the London Chest Hospital after a prolonged period of treatment on the turf. Muamba's condition improved on Monday when it was confirmed he was breathing without a ventilator and able to respond to questions appropriately. And Coyle, who has visited his player several times a day, reported that he had been able to converse with Muamba. Pinto: Is Muamba collapse a wake-up call for football? ""I've been into see him myself, as have his close family members, and had a conversation, a few words exchanged, that will remain private, which is a great sign,"" he told reporters. ""But I must stress it's still very early in the process, the doctors have stressed that point. Fabrice still has a long way to go but it is encouraging signs. ""I've spoken to Shauna his partner and his dad Marcel about it and where we all were on Saturday night certainly at this stage I would never have expected the improvement that's come. ""I have to mention the support he has had from countries all over the world. The qualities he has as a man, football pales into insignificance but he is an outstanding young individual and we pray he gets back to that level again."" Even though the treatment given to Muamba at Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground is widely credited with helping to save his life, the English Premier League said they are to review medical procedures in the wake of the 23-year-old's collapse. 'Muamba collapse proves I was right to quit the game,' says ex pro . Chairman Richard Scudamore told a sports industry event that an incident involving goalkeeper Petr Cech in 2006, which saw the Czech Republic international fracture his skull, had been a wake up call for the football authorities. Chelsea made an official complaint to the Premier League that there was no ambulance on hand to transfer Cech to hospital in the wake of his serious injury. In quotes carried by AFP Scudamore said: ""Incidents and events shape policy, shape developments, shape progress. There are no guarantees but we will do whatever we can to improve. ""What we will certainly be doing is looking at every aspect of what happened and if there are ways and means of improving, if there are ways and means of making it better in the future - just like we did in 2006-07 following the Petr Cech incident. ""We will do everything we can to make sure we reduce to the point of elimination, if we possibly can, things like that."" Coyle again paid tribute to the medical teams that treated Muamba at the ground and the staff at the hospital, saying the player's family wanted to stress how touched they were by the worldwide support he had received. Muamba grew up in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He came to England as an 11-year-old when his family fled civil war in the country. When asked if Muamba could make a full recovery Coyle replied: ""That's something [doctors] have said has happened before but every case is individual. Fears for stricken soccer player Muamba's recovery . ""But we've said before the two things Fabrice has that can help is that he is such a fit young man and the life he's had he's had to fight every step of the way along his young journey. Those things will stand him in good stead."" He said Bolton's players, most of whom had visited Muamba since Saturday evening, could be back in training on Wednesday. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said on Tuesday he feared the worst for Muamba when he collapsed, especially as he had previously coached the late Mark Vivien-Foe, who died of a heart attack while playing for Cameroon in 2003.

"(CNN) -- It's almost beach time! But the beach isn't the only way to cool off. After decades of decline and neglect, cities across America are embracing their riverbanksâ€”and the results are refreshing. From scenic parks to concert venues to wine trails, you might be surprised by what these 11 riverfront towns have to offer. Beacon, New York . Why go: Just an hour and a half north of NYC, Beacon's Hudson Riverfront was long dominated by scrapyards and oil tanks. But thanks to a 20 year restoration effort, a prime parcel at Long Dock Park opened to the public in July 2011, with a dedicated kayak pavilion, fishing pier and rehabilitated wetlands.

San Antonio, Texas . Why go: One of the first American cities to fully realize its river's potential, San Antonio created River Walk, an otherworldly oasis, with arched bridges, tiny waterfalls, and quiet reflection pools all set one story below street level. Just last year, the Mission Reach branch extended the trail three miles further, passing through native plants and woodlands. What to do: Wash down a mango pork carnita with handcrafted margaritas at Barriba Cantina (111 W. Crockett St. #214, 210/228-9876, entrees from $10) after you're done exploring.

"HARO, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish businessman withdrew a controversial lawsuit Wednesday against the family of a teenage boy he struck and killed while driving a luxury car. Tomas Delgado had filed a suit asking the dead boy's parents to pay him €20,000 ($29,400) on the grounds that the collision that killed their teenage son also damaged his Audi A-8. News of the case sparked outrage in Spain and generated deep sympathy for the parents of 17-year-old Enaitz Iriondo Trinidad. He was riding his bicycle home to a campground when Delgado's car hit and killed him in August 2004. Hundreds of people descended on a courthouse in northern Spain in a show of support for the boy's parents Wednesday. They broke into applause when word came that Delgado had dropped the suit. The businessman had insisted in a recent television interview that he was a victim, too. He was not present for a court hearing Wednesday. His lawyer told the court that Delgado felt that the extensive publicity amounted to a public lynching. Outside the courthouse, the boy's father -- Antonio Iriondo -- told CNN he was content with the decision. Yet he also said his family will explore the possibility of criminal charges against the man. ""This is just the beginning,"" the father said. His son was killed as he cycled back from a nearby village to a campground where his family was vacationing. Iriondo Trinidad's father told CNN he heard the screeching of the car from the campgrounds. The teen was struck from behind and dragged 106 meters (347 feet) along the rural highway, the father said. A traffic report said Delgado was traveling 113 km per hour (70 mph) in an area where the speed limit is 90 km (55 mph). An independent expert hired by Trinidad's family said Delgado was going 173 km per hour (107 mph). Shortly after the collision, a judge dismissed criminal charges against Delgado after concluding that he had committed no criminal infraction, the Spanish newspaper El Pais reported. The teen's mother, Rosa, told the newspaper that the family was given three days to appeal the judge's ruling, but they were too distraught to pursue it. She also told the newspaper that her family's lawyer advised her and her husband not to pursue criminal charges. After the collision, Delgado's insurance company paid the family €33,000 ($48,500). Two years after the wreck, Delgado sued the family for damages to his car and for car rental costs. The boy's mother told CNN before the hearing that she was indignant that the driver would seek damages after killing her son. A local prosecutor told reporters that he would take a second look at the case to see whether authorities can file fresh charges against Delgado. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A famous South Korean rock singer is just hours away from swimming into the diplomatic row over a small group of rocky islets in the East Sea, or the Sea of Japan. Kim Jang-hoon is among dozens of amateur athletes who left the eastern port of Uljin Monday, bound for Dokdo, a largely uninhabited set of volcanic islands claimed by both South Korea and Japan, known by Tokyo as Takeshima. The group's 55-hour, 230-kilometer relay swim is expected to end Wednesday, on the 67th anniversary of Korea's independence from Japanese colonial rule. Before jumping into the water, singer Kim Jang-Hoon told reporters: ""I will never make such a comment as 'Dokdo is our territory' when I arrive there. It's meaningless to do so because they are undeniably our territory,"" according to the Yonhap news agency. The politically-charged event comes days after Lee Myung-Bak broke with convention to become the first South Korean president to visit the contested islands. Read more: What's behind island dispute? ""Dokdo is indeed our territory and a place worth staking our lives to defend. Let's make sure to safeguard (the islets) with pride,"" he was reported to have told police officers stationed on the islands. Lee's visit inflamed Japan which recalled its ambassador to Seoul, Masatoshi Muto, and threatened to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice. ""President Lee visited Takeshima, which is an inherent territory of Japan, both in the light of historical facts and based on international law. Therefore it is incompatible with the position of Japan, and so I made a strong protest on the matter,"" Japanese foreign minister Koichiro Gemba told a press conference Friday. Read more: Man crashes Japanese embassy over disputed islands . Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. According to a South Korean website on the islands, Dokdo has a population of three and amid the craggy rocks sit a lighthouse, lodge, helicopter landing pad, and a police station manned by South Korean officers. The recent flare-up over who owns the islands even spilled onto soccer the pitch during the final days of the London Olympics. At the request of Japan, the International Olympic Commitee withheld the bronze medal from South Korean player Park Jongwoo after he held a banner during post-match celebrations supporting South Korea's ownership of the islands. An official from the Korean Football Association told CNN that the body had been asked to investigate the case by FIFA, soccer's ruling body, and submit its results by Thursday. ""It is proven from photos that Park's action was not intentional. He didn't make the sign,"" the official told CNN. ""As you can see from photos, a fan was holding the sign during the match and Park got it from the fan."" Dokdo/Takeshima is one of several of disputed island chains in the region and fears are emerging that competing territorial claims in the South China Sea could create a new Cold War in Asia. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan all have claims in the area and tensions have risen in recent months.","South Korean singer Kim Jang-hoon leading dozens of swimmers to Dokdo or Takeshima .

"Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Sibongile Sikhuze pointed to his bandaged right knee, showing where a bullet entered and exited. He then raised his right palm, struck by a rubber bullet when he tried to surrender. ""They ordered us to lie on the ground. People were falling all around me,"" Sikhuze told CNN Saturday, two days after police opened fire on striking miners. ""Another bullet grazed my head. I didn't think I'd come out alive. That's why I raised my hands. I thought we would all perish there. We were surrounded by the police."" Saturday, thousands of people gathered outside the platinum mine, angry about the incident's toll: 34 mine workers killed, 78 others wounded, 259 arrested on various charges, including malicious damage to property, armed robbery, illegal gathering and possession of weapons. The situation was calm, but tense, as police stood on guard near the protest and helicopters conducted surveillance. Desperate relatives, meanwhile, continued searching for miners who have not been unaccounted for. A day after South African President Jacob Zuma visited the scene of the shootings, a controversial, but popular, politician called on Zuma to resign. ""The minister of police (Nathi Mthethwa) must step down because this massacre was committed under his supervision,"" said Julius Malema. ""The same thing with President Zuma."" Malema, former president of the Youth League of the ruling African National Congress, was banned in April from taking part in party activities after he gave a speech critical of Zuma. He and the youth league helped propel Zuma to power in 2009. But in recent years Malema has become one of Zuma's fiercest critics, accusing his administration of failing to improve the lives of the poor. ""A responsible president says to the police you must keep order, but please act with restraint,"" Malema told the crowd. ""He says to them use maximum force. He has presided over the killing of our people, and therefore he must step down. Not even apartheid government killed so many people. "" Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega on Friday said police ""were forced to utilize maximum force to defend themselves."" Zuma told South Africans that they must come together to overcome national challenges, as they had done before. ""This is not a day to apportion blame,"" Zuma said. ""It is a day for us to mourn together as a nation. It is also a day to start healing."" The tragedy began unfolding a week ago when miners went on strike demanding pay increases at the mine near Rustenburg, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg. ""When there is a rock fall, it is generally the drillers who are the victims,"" wrote journalist Greg Marinovich in the Daily Maverick newspaper. ""It is the most dangerous job in the business."" The miners, who earn $300 to $500 a month, wanted their salaries raised to $1,500. It came as no surprise that their multi-national employer, Lonmin, said no to the whopping increase. The world's third-largest producer of platinum said the strike was illegal. The violence was believed sparked by a rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in South Africa. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Tensions at Marikana had mounted throughout the week. The striking miners carried traditional panga machetes and gathered Thursday around a small hill. By then, at least 10 other people were dead from incidents that had occurred in the days before. Among them were two police officers who were hacked to death. Journalists who were at Marikana said police seemed fed up with the miners and determined to resolve the issue. ""Yesterday the police were clear that today we are going to disarm them and remove them from the hill because the gathering is illegal,"" Xolile Mngambi, a reporter for CNN affiliate ETV, said Friday. By Thursday afternoon, another round of negotiations among the striking miners, the unions and Lonmin had failed. A heavily armed police Tactical Response Team moved in to disperse the miners. To hear Phiyega, the police commissioner, describe it, the police weighed all their options and decided to fence in the miners with barbed wire -- to compartmentalize them into more manageable groups. ""The armed protesters moved toward the police,"" she said. ""They were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets. But when they fired, police used maximum force."" But journalists at the scene could not say whether the protesters fired first. ""We cannot say to you the police were provoked,"" Mngambi said. Then, the police unleashed a barrage of gunfire. One witness said it went on for three minutes. CNN's Moni Basu and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Prominent politician calls on South African president to resign .

"(CNN) -- The husband of one of the members of Russian punk rock band Pussy Riot imprisoned for hooliganism in Moscow is leading a chorus of condemnation after a conviction decried as an attack on free speech. Three young women, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, were sentenced to two years in prison Friday after being convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred. They were arrested after performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February, a flash mob-style act that outraged many of the country's faithful. Pussy Riot supporters vent anger at Twitter . Footage of the brief but provocative protest action, in which the band members clad in balaclavas screamed ""Mother Mary, please drive Putin away,"" inside Christ Savior Cathedral attracted wide attention after it was posted online. The sentence handed down to the trio was widely condemned by rights groups and senior international figures as disproportionate, although polling suggests many in Russia believe they had a fair trial. Pyotr Verzilov, husband of Tolokonnikova, told CNN's Connect the World that legal experts had assured him while the women might have been arrested for their action elsewhere in the world, they would not have gone to prison for it. ""This would never happen in any Western country, it's just not possible,"" he said. Verzilov said the authorities had crossed ""a certain line"" in arresting the women for a nonviolent protest act -- and that this was the reason for the international outcry over the case, with celebrities including Madonna backing their cause. ""Everyone was amazed that Putin decided to give this brutal sentence to girls for singing a protest song inside a church -- no one was expecting that,"" he said. He said there had been no time to say goodbye as his wife -- who is also mother to their young child -- was taken from the courtroom to start her prison term. Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' ""Right after the girls heard the verdict, we only had a couple of glances, for five seconds, and that was it. She was led away by all these numerous guards in the court room and we couldn't speak to each other,"" he said. Verzilov's criticisms echo international concern that the sentence, although handed down by a court, may have been politically motivated and reflects a recent crackdown on free speech by Russia's authorities. White House spokesman Josh Earnest also said the United States was ""disappointed"" by the verdict and sentence. ""While we understand the group's behavior was offensive to some, we have serious concerns about the way that these young women have been treated by the Russian judicial system,"" he said. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton condemned the court's decision as ""deeply troubling."" ""Together with the reports of the band members' mistreatment during their pre-trial detention and the reported irregularities of the trial, it puts a serious question mark over Russia's respect for international obligations of fair, transparent and independent legal process,"" she said. ""It also runs counter to Russia's international obligations as regards to respect for freedom of expression."" Urging Russia to reverse the sentence, Ashton said the case ""adds to the recent upsurge in politically motivated intimidation and prosecution of opposition activists in the Russian Federation, a trend that is of growing concern to the European Union."" Rights group Amnesty International said that the court's decision was ""a bitter blow for freedom of expression in the country"" and that the women were now ""prisoners of conscience."" Amnesty believes that the women's conduct ""was politically motivated, and that they were wrongfully prosecuted for what was a legitimate -- if potentially offensive -- protest action,"" it said in a statement. Human Rights Watch also said the women should never have been prosecuted for a hate crime. Inside the courtroom, Judge Marina Sirovaya found the three Pussy Riot members guilty of offending the churchgoers present -- through their actions, obscene language and their clothing -- and showing a lack of respect for the rules of the Orthodox Church. Polling by the Levada Center indicates that many people within Russia support the legal proceedings against the three women. Its poll, conducted before the sentence was handed down, found that 44% of people surveyed thought the trial was fair, while 17% thought it wasn't fair and 39% said they didn't know. Verzilov said the survey's findings reflect the dominance of state media, particularly in areas of Russia where access to the Internet is limited. This made it easy to turn people against the band by portraying it as anti-Orthodox Christian, anti-Russian values and revolutionary, he said. Tolokonnikova, Alyokhina and Samutsevich have spent five months in pre-trial detention, which counts toward their two-year term. They are expected to appeal the court's decision -- but Verzilov said he did not think they would request a presidential pardon. ""My wife has already answered this question -- 'it's not us who should be asking Putin for pardon, it's Putin who should be asking for a pardon from us and the whole country,'"" he cites her as saying.","Pyotr Verzilov says no other Western nation would have jailed his wife for the protest act .

"(CNN) -- Martian rock N165, it's your time to shine, or glow, or whatever occurs when a hard substance gets zapped by a laser beam. From about 10 feet away, the Mars rover Curiosity's ChemCam was to take aim Saturday night at the hapless three-inch rock. ""We are going to hit it with 14 millijoules of energy 30 times in 10 seconds,"" Roger Wiens of Los Alamos National Laboratory told reporters. A millijoule is 1/1000th of a joule, which is way too complicated to explain here. Suffice to say, it should get the job done. India to launch Mars orbiter in 2013 . ChemCam, short for Chemistry and Camera, will analyze the resulting glowing, ionized gas in an effort to identify chemical elements in the rock. Scientists say it will be the first time such a powerful laser has been used on another planet. The laser works in conjunction with a telescope. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Friday that Curiosity's first driving destination will be Glenelg, about 1,300 feet from the rover's landing site. ""We had a bunch of strong contenders. It is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of, but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on Mars,"" said project scientist John Grotzinger. ""That first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of Mars exploration."" The mobile science lab touched down on Mars early on August 6 and has been beaming back images of the surface of Gale Crater ever since. The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a peak about 8 kilometers (5 miles) away.

"(CNN) -- Two of France's most high-profile football stars will face a court trial next year, being charged with allegedly soliciting an underage prostitute, the Paris prosecutor's office said. Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, who both played for France at the Euro 2012 finals in June, were first questioned two years ago about their alleged involvement in a prostitution ring. ""Some of the defendants will be prosecuted for 'aggravated pimping,' although I cannot disclose which ones at this time,"" the investigating magistrate Andre Dando told CNN on Tuesday. ""The trial is months away and will be well into 2013, I expect."" Ribery plays for German club Bayern Munich, while Benzema is at Real Madrid. An official from Madrid, which won the Spanish league title last season, said the club could not comment as it had no information about Dando's statement. Bayern has yet to respond to CNN's request for a statement. The case emerged in 2010, before the France team went to the FIFA World Cup tournament, after police raided a nightclub near the Champs Elysees in central Paris and detained 18 girls on suspicion of prostitution. Ribery's attorney says footballer is innocent . One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of ""Paris Match"" magazine in April that year and in an interview said she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club. She said she hadn't told them she was younger than 18 at the time, although she was 16. In an initial court hearing on the case, Ribery admitted he had sex with Dehar but insisted he did not know she was a minor. ""He is innocent until proven guilty,"" said his lawyer Sophie Bottai. ""I am sure the investigation will prove that Ribery was never aware of her age."" Ribery allegedly bought a plane ticket for Dehar, but Bottai said he never personally booked it and never saw her passport. ""There is no evidence that he was ever aware of her age,"" Bottai said. ""She told him she was 20 years old."" If found guilty, the players could face a prison term of up to three years, or a fine of €45,000 ($58,390). Dehar has since become a fashion designer, and launched her own collection this year. CNN's Alex Felton and Al Goodman contributed to this story.","Investigating magistrate says Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema will stand trial .

"(CNN) -- It's that time of year for seasonal trips to the movies, and to celebrate, the Screening Room is taking a look back at our favorite family hits over the years. The best of Spielberg: ""E.T."" is our perfect family movie and perfectly captures childhood. From blockbuster to blockbuster, these are the films with something for everyone. They've got to be live action -- we've covered animated films before -- and family friendly. Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best. Read other CNN viewers' favorite and worst family films, and tell us yours >> . 1. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Steven Spielberg, 1982) Spielberg's magic captures a perfect moment in childhood. We laughed and wept as his ugly little critter from outer space stole our hearts, while the kids fell firmly on the cute side of annoying. And oh, the music... 2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (Mel Stuart, 1971) Gene Wilder's whacked-out Willy Wonka adds a pinch of sinister to Roald Dahl's anarchic sweet treat, while the ignoble exits of Veruca Salt, Augustus Gloop and Mike Teevee were delicious. 3. Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) ""That'll do, pig."" Babe is wide-eyed with wonder in Dick King-Smith's touching tale of a lonely little sheep-pig. Comic relief from the ewes, subtle special effects and a heartwarming turn from James Cromwell as Farmer Hoggett make this a magical tale for all. 4. Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker, 1976) Jodie Foster and Scott Baio (Yes, Chachi from ""Happy Days!"") star in this glorious escapade set in a musical world of pint-sized gangsters and mini-molls. Al Capone for the kids; just watch out for the splurge guns... 5. Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968) Jack Wild is delightful as the Artful Dodger, Ron Moody's devilish Fagin glints with avaricious greed and Shani Willis shines as poor, ill-fated Nancy. But it's Oliver Reed's dark and sinister Bill Sykes who stayed with us -- and left us wanting more. 6. Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) Christopher Lloyd's mad professor, a Delorean-cum-time machine, rock 'n' roll and a convenient bolt of lightning see Biff the bully get his come-uppance. All that, and a skateboarding Michael J. Fox? Mr Zemeckis, you spoil us! 7. Home Alone (Chris Columbus, 1990) Macaulay Culkin's abandoned little boy sees off bungling burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern with a series of eye-watering stunts. It proves just how great a child actor Culkin was; pity the unpopular babysitters who became the victims of copycat pranksters... 8. Ghostbusters (Ivan Reitman, 1984) Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis blast ghostly green monsters to oblivion in this slime-filled romp around NYC, while taking time out to annoy Sigourney Weaver en route.

"(CNN) -- A Somali man who authorities say is the highest-ranking pirate ever brought to the United States for prosecution was given 12 life sentences Monday by a federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia. U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said he hopes the severe sentences send a clear message to other would-be pirates to stay away from U.S-flagged ships in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia. The sentences handed to Mohammad Saalli Shibin -- who authorities say negotiated for the release of pirate-held hostages and vessels in return for ransom -- follow his involvement in arranging ransoms for two dramatic, high-profile pirated vessels. In one case four Americans were shot to death aboard their yacht in February, 2011, while negotiations with the U.S. military were proceeding. In the other case, 22 crewmen aboard a German-owned vessel were allegedly tortured following their hijacking, and the pirates received a ransom of more than $5 million. During the sentencing, the judge found Shibin responsible for the entire ransom and ordered him to make restitution for more than 5.4 million dollars. The sentencing followed guilty verdicts against Shibin on 15 counts including piracy and kidnapping in April, 2012. That came just about one year after Shibin was captured in a raid in Somalia by Somali forces working with the FBI. During negotiations for the four Americans, Shibin remained on shore and determined the size of the ransoms to be demanded, and he did not board the yacht himself, authorities said. Three other alleged pirates charged with the deaths of Americans Jean and Scott Adam of California, and their friends Bob Riggle and Phyllis Macay of Seattle, are scheduled to go on trial and will face potential death sentences. Federal prosecutors in Norfolk have prosecuted 18 Somali pirates to date.","Authorities say Mohammad Saalli Shibin was a high-level pirate negotiator .

"(CNN) -- Two Californians, one of whom died, may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while vacationing at Yosemite National Park, health officials said Thursday. The visitors contracted hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, a rare but often fatal lung disease. The two had stayed at the popular Curry Village in mid-June, according to the California Department of Public Health. An unidentified 37-year-old man from the San Francisco Bay area died in late July, said Dr. Vicki Kramer, chief of the department's vector-borne disease section. A Southern California woman in her 40s survived and is recovering, Kramer told CNN. The two stayed in separate locations at the village, which contains about 400 canvas tent and wooden cabins. ""They are very sparse but comfortable,"" Yosemite ranger and spokesman Scott Gediman said of the tent cabins where the man and woman stayed. Officials have focused on deer mice, common in the high-elevation eastern Sierra Nevada region. The mice are gray or brown on top, with white bellies. Their ears have no fur. ""Rodents can infest a whole range of these structures,"" Kramer said. ""Deer mice can get in a hole one-quarter inch in diameter."" In the United States, the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, the CDC says. The virus is not communicable from person to person. Explainer: What is hantavirus? Rodent control is the primary strategy for preventing the hantavirus syndrome, according to the CDC. California's health department has worked with Yosemite National Park for years to reduce the risks to visitors, Kramer said. The agency and park public health officers routinely conduct rodent surveillance, and the park inspects buildings and facilities, it said. The battle begins with workers routinely disinfecting floors and removing mouse droppings. Once park officials learned of the two cases, all 400 camp structures were thoroughly cleaned, Gediman said Thursday. Yosemite National Park has increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk, according to officials. ""You cannot eliminate all the mice,"" Kramer said. ""There are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins."" Gediman said officials consider Curry Village safe and guests have not canceled lodging reservations in the busiest month of the year at Yosemite. Officials urge people to clean areas of rodent infestation with caution. It's best not to vacuum or sweep, because that can push hantavirus particles into the air, where they can enter the lungs. Rather, people should wear gloves and use bleach where they see mouse droppings. They should let the bleach sit for 15 minutes before using a mop or sponge to clean up. Opening shuttered areas to air and sunlight also is suggested. The two recent hantavirus cases bring the 2012 total in California to four. About one-third of the 60 cases reported in the state since 1993 have been fatal, the department said. Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010. There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infection, according to the CDC, but the earlier the patient is brought to intensive care, the better. Diagnosis is difficult, because early symptoms of fever, muscle aches and fatigue often are confused with the flu. ""However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue, and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, (that) would be strongly suggestive of HPS,"" the CDC says.

"(CNN) -- It was Manchester City's big moment, a chance to show how far the ""noisy neighbors"" from the blue half of town have come from under the shadows of their big rivals -- but the day of wild celebrations ended with a humble apology to one of football's most iconic names. When Carlos Tevez lifted a banner proclaiming ""R.I.P. Fergie"" during a victory parade marking a 44-year wait for an English league title, it brought into sharp focus comments by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson back in 2009. ""Not in my lifetime,"" the Scot said when asked if his team would ever be underdogs against City. United may not have been underdogs this season, but certainly had to play second fiddle as City won both league derby clashes and snatched the Premier League crown from Ferguson's team in the final minutes of the campaign, if only by the narrowest of margins. Arabian dreams: Abu Dhabi celebrates title success . City officials, to their credit, moved quickly to say sorry. ""The creation of the tasteless material is in itself reprehensible and in accepting and brandishing it, Carlos has made a significant error of judgment,"" said a club spokeswoman. ""The club wishes to express its sincerest apologies to Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United Football Club for any offense or distress caused."" Tevez, who has history with Ferguson after his acrimonious departure from Old Trafford to join City in 2009, was also contrite. ""I got carried away in the excitement of the moment and I certainly didn't mean any disrespect to Sir Alex Ferguson, who I admire as a man and a manager,"" said the Argentina international, who was given the banner by a supporter. Did City win the title - or did United throw it away? The incident took some of the gloss off an event that saw more than 100,000 people line the streets of Manchester to celebrate City's triumph. However, chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak was at pains to emphasize that the club's first title since the Premier League began 20 years ago is only a small step in the plans of City's Abu Dhabi owners, especially in context of United's 12 championships in that period. ""Manchester United set the benchmark for success for every club,"" Khaldoon said in an interview with City's website. ""I have the highest respect for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson. To get 89 points and not win the league is unbelievable. ""We are trying to accomplish just some of what Manchester United have been able to do in the past. We look at teams like United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Bayern Munich and what they mean to their cities. ""This is one step in that direction but there is a long way to go yet."" City's success has come, in large part, due to a spending spree of hundreds of millions of dollars on star players such as Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Tevez, Samir Nasri, Mario Balotelli and David Silva, and there has been widespread speculation that Arsenal's Premier League-leading scorer Robin van Persie will be the next big-money buy. But Khaldoon said the future emphasis would be on developing a new training and academy facility to nurture talent to comply with UEFA's new financial fair play rules. ""We have a championship-winning team. We are not starting from the same point as in other preseasons,"" Khaldoon said. ""We have had to improve in a very dramatic manner. Now we have a nucleus of players who have won the FA Cup and the Premier League. To improve further we have to harness that nucleus and to improve in a tactical way. ""You're not going to see any major changes. There will be improvements but it will be in a very manageable way. ""When you look at financial fair play, when you look at what the academy does for the community, how do we manage the evolution of this club over the next 10 years, it is fundamental to our growth strategy to have a continually successful program that produces young talent into the first team. ""Already today there are some wonderful young players in the academy and the reserve team, players who I think will be future superstars."" Khaldoon said this season's success will help further City's goal of becoming one of the world's biggest clubs. ""Today we are a global brand, that wasn't the case three years ago. We go to the United States, Malaysia, China, Argentina ... Manchester City has become an important club with a growing fan base,"" he said. ""If we are not there already, we are very close to being the most popular club in the Middle East. Asia is a huge market with a lot of potential and as Premier League champions that gives us a lot of benefits, the same with North and South America."" Manager Mancini and his squad paraded the trophy on an open-top bus tour of the northern city on Monday. To continuous chants of ""champione"" there was a massive roar when the team first emerged on a raised stage in front of the historic town hall. Mancini and captain Vincent Kompany received the biggest applause when they came out last, carrying the EPL trophy they had snatched from city rivals and defending champions Manchester United in the dramatic finale. City beat QPR 3-2 Sunday with two goals in stoppage time from Edin Dzeko and Aguero to edge out United, 1-0 winners at Sunderland, on goal difference. Belgian star Kompany told the gathered fans: ""I want to say thank you, you guys have been amazing."" Mancini added: ""I think that you should be proud of these players. They did everything for you. They wanted to win this championship for you."" For United fans, there was also some consolation late Monday when the club announced that veteran midfielder Paul Scholes would play on for another season. The 37-year-old former England international midfielder came out of retirement midway through the campaign and starred for the former champions in several matches. However, Ferguson was not complimentary to City's spending policy when he talked about his postseason plans, with both clubs having been linked to young Belgian star Eden Hazard -- who is expected to leave French club Lille. ""We know City are going to spend fortunes, pay stupid money and silly salaries. We know that happens. We can't do anything about that,"" Ferguson told United's television channel. ""We are not like other clubs who can spend fortunes on proven goods. We invest in players who will be with the club for a long time, who will create the character of the club and the excitement for our fans. We are good at that and we are going to continue that way."" Meanwhile, controversial QPR midfielder Joey Barton, who was sent off at the Etihad for elbowing Tevez in an off-the-ball incident, has been hit with two charges of violent conduct by the English Football Association. Barton, who departed early in the second half to leave his team with 10 men, clashed with both Aguero and Kompany on his way off the pitch. And while City celebrated their title success, Aston Villa manager Alex McLeish paid the price for a poor season which saw them narrowly avoid relegation. Villa, among the founding members of the English football league, announced in a statement Monday that McLeish had been sacked after just under a year in charge. The club's American owner Randy Lerner gave his reasons in a statement on their official website. ""We need to be clear and candid with ourselves and with supporters about what we have lacked in recent years. ""Compelling play and results that instil a sense of confidence that Villa is on the right track have been plainly absent."" Paul Lambert, manager of Norwich City who beat Villa 2-0 on the last day of the season, is the early favorite to succeed fellow Scot McLeish.","Manchester City apologize for ""tasteless"" banner held up by Carlos Tevez during parade .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Over the last few weeks, there has been a definite Italian flavor pervading ""The Screening Room"" offices. Nanni Moretti's (pictured) ""Dear Diary"": ""It transmits a great love of place and cinema,"" says Marshall. The team is recently back from the Venice International Film Festival, where we broadened our knowledge of this years's film offerings, while vast amounts of pasta unfortunately had the same effect on our waistlines. Italian film has also expanded its horizons this year. Paolo Sorrentino's ""Il Divo"" and Matteo Garrone's ""Gomorrah"" wowed critics at Cannes film festival, fueling, once again, talk of a resurgence in Italian cinema. With all this in mind, we asked Rome-based film critic of 14 years, Lee Marshall to nominate his top 10 Italian films. Don't agree? Think he's missed one? Let us know in the SoundOff box below. 1. 'La Strada' (Federico Fellini, 1954)  ""Absolutely wonderful film with Giulietta Masina and Anthony Quinn. She was tiny and had an almost clown-like face, like a female Charlie Chaplin. It's about a loose couple of traveling circus performers who go around Italy juggling in the street. It's also one of the greatest tragic love stories ever filmed. Quinn's character doesn't realize how important his partner is in life and work until it's too late. 'The magic of cinema' is a phrase thrown around too much, but this film shows just how magical it can be."" 2.'The Conformist' (Bernardo Bertolucci, 1970) ""Italy, like Germany, had a post-war trauma syndrome and refused to think about what had happened under Fascism. This was one of the first films to confront it head-on -- it wasn't a strange race of aliens, it was us and one of the reasons was the pressure to conform. 'The Conformist' is the story of a weak man who is persuaded by Fascist secret police to assassinate his former university professor, now a leading anti-Fascist. The film explores the way in which the totalitarian state manipulates people and the way people allow themselves to be manipulated. A technically, aesthetically and visually rich film, it announced the arrival of Bertolucci as a major director."" 3. 'Ossessione'  (Luchino Visconti, 1943) ""It was the first film (even before the first American film) based on the book adaptation of 'The Postman Always Rings Twice.' Set in rural Italy, it is an incredibly earthy, passionate exploration of human desire. A drifter gets a job in a remote service station and starts to fall in love with the owner's wife; the pair plot to kill him. It is considered one of the first films of the Neo-Realism movement -- low budget films, made on location using non-professional actors. The classic of this strand is Vittorio De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves.'"" 4. 'L'Avventura'  (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1960)  ""Starring Monica Vitti, this is one of the first really experimental films in modern Italian cinema. It was one of the first thrillers in which you never find out what happened. A woman disappears on a Mediterranean island and is never found, which becomes a metaphor for what Antonioni thought was missing in middle-class Italian society. It's a compelling drama. You feel a bit cheated at the end, but you can forgive a slap in the face if it's done with enough elegance."" 5. 'A Fistful of Dollars' (Sergio Leone, 1964)  ""The film that announced the Spaghetti Western to the world. It also turned Clint Eastwood's rugged face and narrowed eyes into an icon. Eastwood owes his acting career to Leone. They made the Western genre a lot darker, too. Traditionally, these were optimistic films about pushing back the frontier, part of the American Dream. In Spaghetti Westerns it became about survival. That's what Clint is doing in this film. He moves into a town where two rival families are engaged in a bitter feud and then maneuvers events so they wipe each other out and he is the last man standing."" 6. 'The Battle of Algiers' (Gillo Pontecorvo,1966) ""A extraordinary film about the resistance against French occupation in Algeria in the 1950s and 1960s. If you look at, say, Steven Soderbergh's 'Che' or Paul Greengrass' film 'Bloody Sunday,' they owe a huge debt to 'The Battle of Algiers.' One of the first films made anywhere in the world about war; there weren't any goodies or baddies, just roving cameras following the chaotic day-to-day bomb attacks. It also shows the brutality that was then applied by the French police in an almost documentary way. It was just holding up a mirror and this was the first war film to do that."" 7. 'Dear Diary' (Nanni Moretti, 1993) ""Moretti is a film maverick who first emerged in the mid-1970s, whose films are always in some way autobiographical. He's probably, the closest thing Italy has to Woody Allen, except his films have a more political slant. He's a great comic actor and merges politics and comedy in his films. 'Dear Diary' is just a diary in three episodes. One of those films that manages to be incredibly rich and satisfying, but when you describe the story it sounds inconsequential. It's just him riding around in Rome on a Vespa with a voice-over where he's talking about films. It transmits a great love of place and cinema -- as well as riding around Rome on a Vespa being brilliantly cinematic."" 8. 'Cabiria' (Giovanni Pastrone,1914) ""The Italian 'The Birth of a Nation' or 'Metropolis' -- a great silent film that defined Italian silent cinema. It's quite a wild ancient history epic about a woman called Cabiria sold into slavery in Carthage. An extraordinary experiment -- it was one of the first times in Italy that cinema, having been a fairground entertainment, was starting to be considered as potentially high art. A brilliantly exotic, erotic take on ancient history and wonderfully over the top."" 9. ""The Consequences of Love' (Paolo Sorrentino, 2004) ""One of the best Italian films of the last 10 years. It's an interesting take on the mafia film and an alternative love story. It is about an accountant living in a hotel in Switzerland, leading an uneventful, measured life. All the violence happens off to one side and its absence is almost menacing. You don't realize there is anything shady about him for a long time and a love affair develops with the hotel receptionist. I think Sorrentino is a very original new voice."" 10. 'Pane, amore e fantasia'  (Luigi Comencini, 1953)  ""Starring Gina Lollobrigida and Vittorio De Sica, this is a wonderfully innocent, sexy comedy set in central Italy in a little village that is incredibly backward and rural. It's about a young woman who is courted by a lot of admirers, including a local police chief. It's really about the feisty, unputdownable spirit of Italy. When we think of Italy, even in a slightly cliched way -- spaghetti, sun and the whole cult of love, the feisty women and the men playing lotharios -- this film just embodies that vibrant life force and energy. It's a very funny romantic comedy.""","There is a distinct Italian flavor pervading ""The Screening Room"" this month .

"(CNN) -- A West Nile virus epidemic has prompted a public health emergency in Dallas County, Texas, where the disease has killed nine people, a judge declared Friday. The virus there infected 175 people, said Patricia Huston of Dallas County Health and Human Services. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins declared the emergency in his capacity as director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management and instructed the department to file a local disaster declaration with the state. ""This declaration will expand our avenues for assistance in our ongoing battle with West Nile virus,"" Jenkins said in a statement. West Nile virus on the rise in the U.S. Insecticide spraying by planes will be offered to certain communities hit hard by the virus as long as those local governments request it, Jenkins told reporters. The aerial spraying would occur from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., when children are inside, Jenkins said. ""The insecticide is safe,"" Jenkins said. ""The planes are quite sophisticated, and they get the spray to where it needs to go."" The judge organized an invitation-only work session Friday with county, state and federal officials to discuss a response to the epidemic. The United States is experiencing its biggest spike in West Nile virus since 2004, with 241 cases of the disease reported nationwide this year so far, including four deaths, health officials said last weekend, before the latest totals. Of the 42 states that have reported infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, 80% of them have been in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. The CDC listed a breakdown of infections by state. ""It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years,"" said Marc Fischer, a CDC medical epidemiologist. ""Regardless of the reasons for the increase, people should be aware of the West Nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family."" The virus is transmitted through infected mosquitoes. In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rash. ""Less than 1% develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues),"" the CDC said. Those at greater risk are people older than 50 and those with conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease, or with organ transplants. There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection. People with milder illnesses typically recover on their own, but those more seriously affected may need hospital care. Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellant and getting rid of insect breeding sites. Symptoms of West Nile virus .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan's parliament voted to sack its two top security ministers on Saturday for failing to respond to rocket shelling from Pakistan.

"London (CNN) -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's wealthiest men, was arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of his American-born wife was found in their home this week, police confirmed Friday. The 49-year-old was initially arrested Monday on drug charges and then was held ""in connection with the death"" of Eva Rausing, police said Tuesday. The new details of his arrest emerged during the inquest into her death, which opened at Westminster Coroner's Court on Friday. The Metropolitan Police said there is no murder inquiry yet and the death is still being treated as unexplained. Authorities are awaiting the results of further post-mortem tests, which are not expected for several more days, police said. An autopsy Tuesday failed to determine the cause of Eva Rausing's death, police said. Detective Inspector Sharon Marman told the coroner that police had discovered the drugs when they searched Rausing's car after stopping him on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the UK's Press Association news agency reported. They then searched his home address, a mansion in one of London's most expensive neighborhoods. During that search, officers discovered the ""apparently lifeless body of a female in one of the bedrooms,"" Marman said, according to the news agency. The suspect has been arrested on suspicion of her murder, ""and we await notification of when he will be fit to be interviewed,"" she said, quoted by the Press Association. A spokesman for Hans Kristen Rausing, James Henderson, told CNN that nothing had changed in Rausing's position. ""He was arrested on Monday on suspicion of murder. He has not been questioned yet. He has not been charged,"" he said. Henderson said Rausing was still receiving medical treatment, and he did not know when he would be questioned. Police earlier this week declined to name Hans Kristian Rausing as the man who was arrested, but a source familiar with the investigation said the man in custody lived at the address where the body was found. He is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family's connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A man in civilian clothing opened fire on a base shared with Afghan forces, killing three NATO troops, a spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force said Saturday. The shooting occurred late Friday in Afghanistan's volatile Helmand province, the same region where three American soldiers were killed hours earlier by a man in an Afghan military uniform, officials said. Afghan and ISAF officials offered conflicting accounts over the latest shooting in Garmsir District, where U.S. Marines have been working with Afghan forces at a joint outpost. An Afghan official said a local police officer opened fire, killing three Marines, while ISAF said the gunman was wearing civilian clothes. Official: Man in Afghan security uniform kills 3 U.S. troops . The international coalition did not release the nationalities of the troops or details about the shooting or the location. The gunman was detained by troops shortly after the shooting Friday night, said Maj. Martyn Crighton of the ISAF Joint Command. Haji Mohammad Khan, the deputy district chief, said a policeman opened fire on the Marines at the outpost located inside the Garmsir police compound. But Crighton said the shooter was an Afghan civilian working on an installation shared by Afghan and NATO forces. He would not say whether the shooting occurred at the compound in Garmsir. Brig. Gen. Gunter Katz, an ISAF spokesman, who also described the man as a civilian, said he had been detained after the attack. It was the second Friday shooting targeting NATO troops in Afghanistan. Three U.S. soldiers were killed when a man in an Afghan military uniform opened fire in the Helmand province, the latest in a series of assaults against NATO troops by Afghans wearing security force uniforms. The three soldiers were part of a Special Operations mission to stabilize a village in the Sarwan Qala region, a Taliban stronghold, a Defense Department official said on condition of anonymity. They were meeting with local officials when the shooting occurred, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media. NATO and Afghan troops have been searching for the gunman. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the killings of NATO service members and ordered an investigation. ""The enemy who does not want to see Afghanistan have a strong security force, targets military trainers,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said it was ""too early to say"" that the latest incident was part of a stepped-up effort by insurgents. ""We know they are trying to maximize media exposure of these events but our military believes that the operational impact has been negligible. Nonetheless, these incidents do concern us and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families."" In the strikes, known as ""green-on-blue"" attacks, Afghan security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops. Asked about the incidence of such attacks, Katz told reporters in Kabul that ISAF's assessments indicated ""the infiltration rate is very, very low,"" but that more could be done to educate both sides and build mutual respect. ""If you just look at the statistics, what I can see compared to last year is that we have much more soldiers in the field,"" he said. ""We have almost 500,000 soldiers fighting together right now, and in the years before, those numbers were much smaller."" Afghan security forces have also been targeted by their countrymen. On Saturday, an Afghan policeman killed 10 fellow police officers in the Dilaram district of the southern Nimruz province, said Omar Baluch, a spokesman for the provincial governor. The shooter, who is believed to have links to the Taliban, was killed by other policemen, said Baluch. An investigation into the incident continues, he added. Earlier this year, Gen. John Allen, commander of all U.S and NATO forces in Afghanistan, said systems put in place by Afghans and coalition troops to prevent such attacks were having an effect. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government filed suit Tuesday against Wyndham Hotels after sensitive customer data, including credit card numbers and personal information, allegedly were stolen three times in less than two years. In court documents, the Federal Trade Commission alleges Wyndham Hotels' lax security policies allowed Russian hackers to access more than 500,000 customer accounts on three separate occasions between 2008 and 2010. Hackers used the data to rack up more than $10.6 million in fraudulent credit card transactions, according to the suit filed in the U.S. District Court of Arizona. The security breaches involved Wyndham's Phoenix, Arizona, data center, the main hub where the company stores and transfers data between its corporate headquarters and affiliates. By gaining access to the Arizona data center, hackers were able to install ""phishing"" software on numerous Wyndham servers around the world and gain access to customer data, the FTC's lawsuit alleges. ""At the time of these incidents, we made prompt efforts to notify the hotel customers whose information may have been compromised, and offered them credit monitoring services,"" Michael Valentino, Wyndham's worldwide director of communications, said in a statement to CNN. But Wyndham failed to take proper security measures even after the company was aware of a security breach, according to the FTC's complaint. The FTC said Wyndham should have instituted complex user IDs and passwords, and fixed software that stored the company's customer credit card data in clear readable text. Wyndham didn't make the fixes, the government alleges, and the hackers were able to gain access to servers on two more occasions. ""Even after faulty security led to one breach ... Wyndham still failed to remedy known security vulnerabilities; failed to employ reasonable measures to detect unauthorized access; failed to follow proper incident response procedures,"" the FTC said in a statement announcing the suit. There is no penalty for first-time violators of the FTC's Consumer Privacy Act, and this is the first time Wyndham has been charged with violating the act. But according to Kristen Cohen, an attorney in the FTC's privacy and identity protection division, the agency is seeking a permanent injunction that would force Wyndham to implement what the agency considers reasonable and appropriate security measures for customer information. Wyndham Hotel Group claims to be the world's largest hotel company with more than 7,000 hotels worldwide. The company operates hotels and resorts under the Wyndham brand, and includes Ramada, Super 8, Days Inn and Howard Johnson and several other hotel companies among its affiliates.","The FTC alleges lax computer security policies by Wyndham Hotels .

"Seoul (CNN) -- The Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the church colloquially known as the Moonies, is unconscious and undergoing treatment for pneumonia at a hospital in South Korea, a spokesman said Thursday. His doctor has given him only a 50% chance of survival, spokesman Ahn Ho-yeol said. Doctors put the 92-year-old founder of the Unification Church in intensive care Tuesday, where he is breathing through a respirator, the church spokesman said. Moon felt ill suddenly and was hospitalized in Seoul in ""grave condition."" The Unification Church gained fame worldwide for its mass weddings decades ago, including at New York City's Madison Square Garden. Many met their spouses-to-be for the first time during the ceremony. In addition to weddings in South Korea, couples from various countries took part in the ceremony through satellite hookups. The controversial Moon, whose church critics compare to a cult, served a federal prison term in the United States for tax evasion. He was also a strong supporter of Republican politicians including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, said Eileen Barker, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He was ""virulently anti-Communist,"" having been imprisoned in North Korea during the Korean War before being freed by the allies, she said. Moon is the founder of The Washington Times newspaper, which vocally backed Reagan, she said. In 2010, the newspaper was sold to a group operating on his behalf, according to a statement on the paper's website. In his later years, his position toward North Korea softened, and he met the late North Korean dictator Kim Il-sung and invested some money in the North. His followers regard Moon as the messiah who is completing the salvation that Jesus Christ failed to accomplish. His church says Jesus was divine but he is not God, a position that puts the Unification Church outside the bounds of traditional Christianity. Different measures are under way in case of the worst-case scenario, according to the church spokesman. He did not elaborate on the measures. Followers of the church worldwide are praying for his health, he said. CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Sun Myung Moon's church gained fame worldwide for its mass weddings .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least 10 people died in three separate attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday, including an service member for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to Afghan government and ISAF officials. Two Americans were among those wounded in an attack, an Afghan official said. A roadside bomb killed nine Afghan civilians and wounded five more in the Paghman district, west of Kabul, according to a statement from Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office. Karzai condemned the ""terrorists"" for the killings ""during the holy month of Ramadan."" In a separate incident in eastern Afghanistan, an ISAF service member died from ""direct fire"" during an insurgent attack, ISAF said. In a third attack, a suicide bomber in a truck detonated near an ISAF military base, wounding at least 13 people in Logar province, just south of Kabul, provincial spokesman Mohammad Faqeer Darwish said. He said that two of the injured were Americans. ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Hagen Messer confirmed that ISAF service members were injured in the explosion in the province's capital of Pul-e-Alam, but did not identify their nationalities nor say how many had been hurt.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Two sons of ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stood trial Monday in a Cairo criminal court on charges of insider stock trading, with prosecutors alleging they acquired millions illegally by using insider information about a bank sale. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak allegedly gained the money through the 2007 sale of the Al Watany Bank of Egypt. They stood trial with seven others, including the deputy chief executives of the bank. Prosecutors told the court the defendants conspired to acquire illegal funds and 80% of the bank's shares. Gamal Mubarak illegally made nearly 500 million Egyptian pounds, or about $82 million, from the bank sale, prosecutors said. His brother, Alaa, used insider information about the bank to gain 12 million Egyptian pounds, or about $1.9 million, authorities allege. The two ""purposely withheld vital information on the sale of the bank from other share traders to implement their crime and violated the principles of transparency and equality between traders,"" according to a statement from prosecutors. They are further accused of selling their shares to strategic partners at EFG Hermes. Yasser El-Malawny and Hassan Heikal, EFG Hermes joint chief executive officers, are among the other defendants in the case. Following Monday's proceedings, the trial was adjourned until September 8. The court denied a request by the Mubaraks' attorneys that they be released on bail. The attorneys had pointed out that the other seven defendants were freed on bail, but not allowed to travel. The travel ban remains in place, the court ruled. All nine of the defendants, including the Mubaraks, deny the charges. Gamal Mubarak told the judge there was ""no basis whatsoever to these accusations."" ""Unfortunately, these are all lies,"" Alaa Mubarak said. ""None of this happened."" Gamal and Alaa Mubarak have been imprisoned since spring 2011. They were acquitted of corruption charges in another case last month. EFG Hermes is one of the Middle East's most prominent investment companies, with branches in nine Arab countries. Hermes released a statement last May saying its two executives acted properly in the acquisition of the Al Watany bank. The National Bank of Kuwait took a nearly 100% stake in the bank in November 2007. ""The two chief executive officers had no personal interest, gain or any dealings or trading in the shares of the Al Watany Bank of Egypt,"" Hermes said, adding that the company has taken the necessary legal actions to defend them. The bank's deputy chief executives are also accused of gaining ""concealed"" percentages and conducting dealings without informing the stock market authority publicly, which is against the laws of the Egyptian Central Bank and the stock market. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak offered last month to pay a 2 billion-pound ($330 million) fine in reconciliation, but prosecutors denied the request, according to Adel Al-Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor. The prosecutor ""insisted they plead guilty first, and all the defendants must also join them in this reconciliation effort,"" he told CNN. ""Only one other defendant offered to pay."" Hosni Mubarak, who led Egypt for more than 30 years, was ousted by the Arab Spring protests last year and was found guilty of charges relating to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution. The 84-year-old is reportedly in declining health and was moved to a military hospital last month.","Gamal and Alaa Mubarak are accused of insider trading .

"(CNN) -- Two former hotel workers have been cleared of the high-profile murder of an Irish newlywed on her honeymoon in Mauritius last year, police on the Indian Ocean island said Thursday. Michaela McAreavey, a 27-year-old teacher and ex-beauty queen, was found strangled in the bathtub of her hotel room in January 2011. The police and prosecutors said she had been murdered after disturbing thieves raiding the honeymoon suite. The accused, Avinash Treebhoowoon, 32, and Sandip Moneea, 43, worked at the luxury Legends Hotel at the time and were arrested a day after McAreavey was killed. Both denied the murder during a two-month trial and police confirmed Thursday they were acquitted by a jury at the Supreme Court in the Mauritian capital, Port Louis. The jurors took two hours to deliberate and both verdicts were unanimous, police said. Family friends in Ireland said the ex-beauty queen's widower, Gaelic football star John McAreavey, was in a packed courtroom along with other relatives to hear the verdict announced. The friends said family members left the court immediately, as the acquittals were greeted by cheering from local people in the public gallery. The family friends also said defense lawyers were carried from the court by jubilant supporters of the defendants. In the early stages of the investigation, the Mauritian authorities said Treebhoowoon had admitted to the murder, but his lawyers said durin the trial that police had fabricated a confession and forced him to sign it. Local media said the case provoked intense interest in Mauritius as it involved the murder of a tourist. It also dominated the news agenda in McAreavey's native Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. She was well-known on both sides of the Irish border as the daughter of one of the country's best-known sporting figures, Gaelic football manager Mickey Harte, and a winner of the Ulster Rose of Tralee beauty pageant title. The Harte and McAreavey families issued a written statement after Thursday's verdict. It read: ""After waiting 18 months in search of justice for Michaela and following the endurance of seven harrowing weeks of this trial, there are no words which can describe the sense of devastation and desolation now felt by both families.''","The two men worked at the Mauritius hotel where Michaela McAreavey was slain .

"Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- A U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in northern Ghana stabbed and killed a suspected robber, the police officer investigating the case said Monday. The volunteer, identified by the Ghanaian officer as 26-year-old Andrew Kristler, was with another Peace Corps volunteer early Saturday morning in Wa, the capital of the Upper West Region. They were accosted by two alleged assailants, according to the officer, who was not authorized to speak on the record. A struggle ensued and Kristler stabbed one of the assailants in the chest, killing him, the officer said. The volunteer sustained wounds to his shoulder and hand. Police discovered the body of the alleged assailant early Saturday morning; the other attacker remains at large. Following drops of blood from the body, police were led to Kristler, the officer said. By way of explanation for why he hadn't reported to the incident to police promptly, the volunteer allegedly told authorities he had been advised by the U.S. Embassy in Accra to stay indoors, the officer said. That account was disputed by Mike Koffman, the country director of Peace Corps in Ghana. He said Kristler reported the incident. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell weighed in on what happened Monday. ""We can confirm that two Peace Corps volunteers in Ghana were the victims of a crime in the early hours of Saturday, July 14. Contrary to media reports, they are not being detained at this time. The matter is under investigation by Ghanaian officials. We are closely monitoring the situation and are providing consular assistance,"" he said. According to the investigating officer in Ghana, Kristler is required to check back in with police next week.

"Epsom, England (CNN) -- Watched by the Queen of England, hot favorite Camelot won the Epsom Derby on Saturday, setting up a potential tilt at English horse racing's Triple Crown. Camelot, with odds of 13-8, added the prestigious title to his 2,000 Guineas win in comfortable fashion, triumphing by five lengths. He will now be targeted at the St. Ledger Stakes later this year, according to his owner. If successful, he will become the first horse since the great Nijinsky in 1970 to win the treble. With Camelot trained by Aiden O'Brien and ridden by his 19-year-old son Joseph, history was made on the weekend of Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The pair became the first father-son/trainer-jockey combination to win England's premier Classic race. Aiden O'Brien's other horse in the race, Astrology, finished third after leading the eight-horse field into the straight before Camelot and Main Sequence surged past. It continued the O'Briens' domination of the English flat racing season, having already captured the 1,000 Guineas with Homecoming Queen, the 2,000 Guineas with Camelot and the Oaks (for fillies) with Was at Epsom on Friday. Britain's horse-loving queen . The family had earlier scooped Saturday's other main race, the Coronation Cup. Queen Elizabeth chose to commence her weekend of celebrations with a visit to Epsom Downs. An avid racing fan, the Queen has attended all but two Derbies during her 60-year reign.

The 1,000 Guineas and the Oaks are fillies-only races. Of the three remaining events, the treble is rarely attempted these days, due to its longer length of the St. Ledger of a mile and six furlongs.","Camelot wins English horse racing's Epsom Derby, as Queen watches .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of animals, some of them rare, remained missing from Tasmania's only accredited zoo Saturday, two days after someone released the creatures into the wild, the zoo's co-owner said. The intruder or intruders also killed about a dozen birds, including a Tasmanian swift parrot, said Rochelle Penney, who co-owns Tasmania Zoo with her father, Richard Warren. The Australian government lists the bird as endangered. Fewer than 1,000 of the birds remain in the wild, according to the Australian Parks and Wildlife Service. The death will affect the zoo's work to increase the bird's numbers, Penney said. ""It's very upsetting,"" she said. The incident happened Thursday night. Warren found an enclosure door open when he arrived at work the next morning, Penney said. ""Then it went from there door after door,"" Penney said. The entrances of about 30 enclosures had been flung open, she said. The zoo sprang in to action to limit the damage. ""We had to quickly go through and lock them all up,"" Penney said. ""We spent the last two days to recapture the animals."" Particularly painful was the release of the park's population of quolls, a rare indigenous mammal zoo officials were trying to replenish in captivity, Penney said. Like kangaroos, quolls are marsupials and carry their young in pouches. But they are much smaller and crawl instead of hopping. The zoo also has a Tasmanian devil breeding program, but those animals remained in captivity, Penney said. Some of missing animals will die if not recaptured, Penney said. ""A lot of our animals are in captivity for a reason,"" she said. ""They won't survive on their own."" Penney said she hopes that many animals will not go far, allowing them to be recovered. ""They know where home is,"" she said. The incident has placed a financial strain on the zoo, which receives no government funding. It will cost up to 2,000 Australian dollars ($2,111) to replace each of the birds killed in the incident, Penney said. ""We are privately owned and operated,"" Penney said. ""It has taken us nine years to get where we are now."" The zoo ""takes up about 15 -- 20 acres"" and boasts a variety of animal life, but birds appear to be a particular specialty. ""We have over 80 species of birds,"" Penney said. Tasmania Zoo has no idea who might be behind the rampage, hoping police will make progress or someone from the public will come forward with a tip. Fans of the zoo have called to offer words of comfort, Penney said, but so far no leads.","Tasmanian zoo searches for animals after someone released dozens .

"(CNN) -- Girl wonder beats boy wizard. The Hunger Games trilogy has surpassed the Harry Potter books to become the best-selling series on Amazon.com, the company announced Friday. ""Since debuting in 2008, Katniss Everdeen and the Hunger Games have taken the world by storm, much as Harry Potter did a decade before,"" said Sara Nelson, the editorial director of books and Kindle at Amazon, which is the largest bookseller in the United States.

"(CNN) -- ""It is so ordered."" Four words, used by the Supreme Court of the United States, that set loose a cascade of public policy. Few phrases are as powerful and precise. On June 25, when Justice Anthony Kennedy closed the court's majority opinion regarding Arizona's anti-immigrant law, S.B. 1070, with these words, the court lifted a burden off the shoulders of local law enforcement as well as millions of immigrants across the country. Last Tuesday, the ripples reached Indiana: The state's Republican attorney general, Greg Zoeller, said portions of his state's Senate Bill 590 could not be defended. ""The Supreme Court made clear that immigration enforcement is a federal government responsibility,"" Zoeller acknowledged. Elements of Indiana's law resemble those the Supreme Court struck down in Arizona's, including provisions giving local police unprecedented power to make warrantless arrests based on assumed immigration status. Zoeller saw the constitutional writing on the wall and freed his enforcement resources from an expensive court battle the state of Indiana was sure to lose. The court's ruling on S.B. 1070 made it clear that state laws authorizing local law enforcement to make warrantless arrests of people for immigration violations are unconstitutional. Opinion: Don't deport the 'tamale lady' The court struck down three parts of the law, including the murky section that authorized state officers to arrest people based on ""probable cause"" that they had committed an offense that could lead to deportation. The court allowed a fourth section, the troubling ""papers please"" provision, to go into effect, but it left the door wide open for further legal scrutiny. Lest you think otherwise, Zoeller is no shrinking violet when it comes to immigration enforcement and keeping our nation safe. He is an active member of the Alliance Partnership of the Conference of Western Attorneys General, in which attorneys general across the United States partner with their colleagues in Mexico to strengthen the legal systems of both countries and reduce crime. As Zoeller wrote in 2011, ""Greater cooperation, trust and information sharing between law enforcers and judicial officers on both sides of the border creates a more peaceful backdrop against which the U.S. government can work to improve an immigration system that clearly needs fixing."" Working collaboratively across state lines and international borders to fight human and drug trafficking, money laundering and consumer fraud is a far better use of law enforcement resources than arresting landscapers and nannies. Zoeller is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law. Last year, he joined a bipartisan group of business, law enforcement and religious leaders in signing the Indiana Compact, a set of principles to guide the state's immigration debate. The compact affirms that immigration enforcement should be handled at the federal level, not the state level. The signers of the Indiana Compact joined like-minded leaders in Utah and Iowa â€” neither of which is a liberal stronghold â€” who signed compacts of their own calling upon the administration and Congress to work together to create a common-sense immigration process. But Congress has failed to muster the will to craft legislation, and President Obama is reduced to making administrative changes to an antiquated system. Sadly, the Supreme Court's ruling on S.B. 1070 is all we have to work with when it comes to federal guidance on immigration. Opinion: Why 'illegal immigrant' is a slur . But the winds of the immigration debate are changing. From the Mountain West to the Southeast to the Midwest, people who wear badges, run businesses and carry Bibles are building a new consensus on immigrants and America. The consensus is that immigration policy is a human issue. Documented or undocumented, people have freedom that we protect. That is one of the ideals on which our nation is built. Leaders such as Zoeller are doing what they are constitutionally required to do: Enforce the law. Zoeller must and will protect the residents of Indiana, regardless of their federal immigration status. To do so, he will direct all his resources toward tracking down those who would perpetrate crime on these residents and bring them to justice rather than dedicate scarce resources toward enforcing federal immigration law. The Supreme Court has ordered that the federal government pre-empts states when it comes to immigration law. It is time the other branches of our federal government heeded that order and created a rational immigration process that allows law enforcement officials to do their job: keep us safe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.","Indiana's attorney general has declared most of the state's new immigration law indefensible .

"London (CNN) -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with ""preventing the lawful and decent burial"" of his wife, Eva, UK media said. Her body was discovered in an advanced state of decomposition on the floor by a bed in an annex of the couple's central London mansion, the Press Assocation news agency said. Rausing looked frail as he appeared in the courtroom, the news agency said. His appearance came a day after he was charged by London police with preventing his wife's lawful and decent burial. Eva Rausing's body was found last week when police searched the couple's home after her husband was stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and then arrested on drug charges. Hans Kristian Rausing, 49, is the son of Hans Rausing, who is worth an estimated $10 billion, thanks to the family's connection to Swedish packaging giant Tetra Laval. A statement released on behalf of his parents by a public relations firm representing the family said they wanted privacy to grieve. ""Hans and Marit Rausing and their families are mourning the death of their son's beloved wife, Eva. Her death, and the details of subsequent events, are a reminder of the distorted reality of drug addiction,"" the statement said. ""They desperately hope that their dear son, Hans, may find the strength to begin the long and hard journey of detoxification and rehabilitation."" Hans Kristian Rausing was initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the discovery of his wife's body but has not been charged with that crime. The death of his 48-year-old wife remains unexplained pending further tests, police said Friday, but the heiress's previous problems with drugs are well documented. Her father, Tom Kemeny, paid tribute Tuesday to his ""beloved daughter."" He described her as an ""American philanthropist, loving wife and mother, who helped countless addicts, and children."" The tribute was e-mailed to reporters by a public relations firm representing the family. Read the full tribute . He also expressed the family's love and support for her husband. Recounting her early life, starting with her birth in Hong Kong in 1963, Kemeny painted a picture of a bright and loving, but shy, girl. ""We think she started experimenting with drugs in her late teens to overcome her shyness,"" he wrote, adding that this drug use affected her studies in California. His daughter eventually recovered in the 1980s and dedicated many of her efforts to helping other addicts, he said, before marrying Rausing, with whom she had four children. Swedish billionaire's son Rausing arrested after wife, Eva, found dead . The couple continued to support her ""life-long vocation in helping those with drug addiction,"" Kemeny said, helping to ""save"" the lives of many other people -- though ""tragically, not her own."" He also paid tribute to her sharp wit and intelligence, devotion to her children and care for others. A Kemeny family statement released with his tribute said: ""We believe her tragic death highlights the scourge of drugs and that it does not matter how rich, intelligent or beautiful you are, you can still be impacted and overcome by this terrible disease."" Kemeny said the best way to remember his daughter would be to carry on her efforts to help those battling addiction, especially women. ""Eva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives,"" his tribute said. ""The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future."" UK police: Billionaire's son Rausing arrested on suspicion of murder . The Kemeny family intends to set up a foundation in her memory in due time, it said. The family statement also appeals for donations in Eva Rausing's name to a drug awareness and treatment fund, or to the UK charity Action on Addiction, which she supported. It quotes Nick Barton, chief executive of Action on Addiction, as saying: ""Eva worked tirelessly for years, without any desire for public recognition and despite her own health issues, to help people and charities in the addiction field through her wonderfully generous support."" ""Eva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together. They benefited thousands of lives through their personal involvement and philanthropic activities,"" Kemeny wrote. ""They bravely battled their demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to our beloved 'son' Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all our hearts.""

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Roman Catholic priest in Philadelphia was arrested on allegations of sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in 1997, the city's district attorney announced Friday. Andrew McCormick, 56, has been charged with involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault, sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, corrupting the morals of a minor, indecent assault and indecent exposure in connection with the alleged 1997 incident, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced Tuesday. ""He had a pattern of grooming altar boys and took several on trips to Poland,"" Williams said. ""We suspect that there are other victims. I am very thankful the victim reported the crime directly to law enforcement."" McCormick befriended the former altar boy, now 25, while he was a pastor St. John Cantius Church in Bridesburg, Pennsylvania, Williams said. The man alleged that the abuse occurred in the church rectory and involved one incident of ""sexual contact."" After the incident happened, the defendant tried to ensure that the victim would not tell anyone about the abuse by telling the boy, ""Masturbation is a sin, homosexuality is a sin, premarital sex is a sin and lying is a sin,"" Williams said. ""I applaud the courage of this young man,"" Williams said. ""This victim was also concerned for other victims. Victims need to come forward."" In December of 2011 the man reported the alleged incident to the police department's Special Victims Unit after seeing news coverage of the sexual abuse scandals at Penn State and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said Police Capt. John Darby of the Special Victims Unit. ""It's a theme that repeats itself. The victim hesitates because the individual is a person of authority,"" Darby said. ""He was lectured by this individual (McCormick) and the victim personalized that."" A 2011 grand jury report led the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office to criminally charge four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Monsignor William Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. Lynn, 61, was found guilty in June of one count of child endangerment, a third-degree felony, the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted on such a charge. He was given just under the maximum sentence he faced, which was three-and-a-half to seven years in prison. Ordained in 1982, McCormick was one 21 priests placed on administrative leave by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in March of 2011 in response to the grand jury report. His most recent post was Sacred Heart Parish in Swedesburg, Pennsylvania, from 2004 to 2011. As a result of the administrative leave, McCormick has not been permitted to exercise his public ministry, administer any of the sacraments, or present himself publicly as a priest, according to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. McCormick was arrested Thursday night after he was taken into custody outside of Philadelphia, where he was living with his parents. He was arraigned Friday afternoon and is being held on $150,000 bail. The court took away his passport and he is not allowed contact with the victim, or with children or youth involved with the ministry, volunteer work or any charities, according to the district attorney's office. McCormick is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on August 17.","Andrew McCormick ""had a pattern of grooming altar boys,"" the DA says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg may be the oldest, tiniest member of the Supreme Court, but her colleagues know her to be perhaps the toughest, and by all accounts a dedicated and tireless justice. The latest evidence: Ginsburg is recovering from a rib injury suffered in June, during the Supreme Court's last hectic weeks before it issued the landmark ruling upholding President Barack Obama's health care reform law. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg confirmed the injury occurred at the 79-year-old justice's Washington home June 4, but did not prevent Ginsburg from participating fully in the court's internal deliberations. Two other sources close to Ginsburg said she fractured two ribs from an accidental fall. Details of the injury were first reported by Reuters. Arberg said the justice maintained a regular work schedule in the days after the injury that included June speeches in New York and Washington. Sources said she was not hospitalized, but instead treated by doctors at the Office of the Attending Physician, which provides outpatient medical care to the justices and members of Congress. The court is now in recess and the justice has continued to keep busy, working through the summer in chambers. She appeared last week at a legal panel in Chicago, and returned recently from overseas trips to Europe. As the oldest justice, Ginsburg's health in particular, and those of her benchmates, has been closely watched by some Washington insiders, since high court vacancies have recently created a high-stakes, politically-charged environment. The Brooklyn native has survived two separate bouts with cancer, but has said she hopes to stay on the court for another few years at least. Meanwhile, Ginsburg is not letting her rib injury stop her from engaging in two of her favorite passions: the law and opera. She appeared with Solicitor General Donald Verrilli and other legal heavyweights Friday at an American Bar Association panel, to listen to some classical music and engage in spirited discussion. Hosting the event was Craig Martin, an attorney with Jenner & Block LLP, and himself an opera buff. ""Arias and opera can be used to raise larger questions about society -- good vs. evil, for example,"" he told CNN. ""It can be a prism to look at the law and our civic responsibilities."" Members of Chicago's famed Lyric Opera performed selections from ""Faust,"" ""The Magic Flute,"" and four other works, a starting point for debate with Ginsburg and others. ""I sat down with Justice Ginsburg, and we tried to focus on arias that would work well as a springboard to the discussion,"" said Martin. ""She has such great knowledge of these works, the music and the underlying interpretation. I learned more from Justice Ginsburg about opera in our meeting than I had from a lifetime of going to operas again and again."" Benjamin Britten's adaptation of ""Billy Budd"" -- the tragic story of a sailor sentenced to hang after falsely being accused of inciting mutiny -- caused perhaps the most passionate talk. ""The moral premise was whether Captain Vere could save Billy Budd's life from the court-martial,"" privately believing the young man was ultimately innocent, said Martin. ""Justice Ginsburg came up with a well-thought out, well-crafted legal solution."" ""He didn't have to empanel the court-martial on the ship,"" said Ginsburg. ""He could have kept Billy and could have had the trial held on British soil."" But the justice acknowledged a risk in that: ""There was this tremendous fear of mutiny."" The charismatic but overly-trusting Budd is ultimately convicted on the high seas under the strict reading of the law as the captain sees his duty, and the sailor is hanged. The justice's love of opera is well known. Along with Justice Antonin Scalia, her best friend on the court and fellow operaphile, she has appeared onstage -- in costume -- for several cameo roles at the Washington Opera. Also attending the Friday panel discussion was Ginsburg's son James, a former lawyer who runs Cedille Records, a Chicago-based non-profit classical music label he founded. Justice Ginsburg remembered how another opera prompted a little drama within the insular high court a few years ago. The late Chief Justice William Rehnquist unexpectedly modified his judicial robes as a subtle tribute to Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Iolanthe,"" a fantasy that satirically tweaks the law and government. ""One day, my dear old Chief, who loved Gilbert and Sullivan, appeared in the (court's private) robing room with his new robe, and it had four thin gold stripes. People were aghast,"" she recalled, smiling. While many people wondered what the adornment was all about, ""I laughed because I knew exactly what he had done."" Baldwin suggests portrayal of Douglas' life, career . Talk about the role of a lifetime. Actor Alec Baldwin recently revealed who he thinks deserves being portrayed on screen: the late Justice William Douglas, the longest-serving member of the Supreme Court. Baldwin, a fellow outspoken progressive, said Douglas' career as a jurist, prolific author, civil libertarian, and environmentalist would be relevant to today's audiences. ""In the world we live in today, a world which is increasingly shaped, I should say surreptitiously, by the current (conservative majority) Supreme Court, I would like to see something that would bring to a new generation a biography -- a film or otherwise -- of the life of William O. Douglas,"" Baldwin told a Washington audience. Douglas, a Washington state native who served from 1939-75, was named to the bench by Franklin Roosevelt, and carved a clear liberal record. Baldwin, who currently stars on the long-running television series ""30 Rock,"" said he was not sure he himself could best take on the Douglas role. Few, if any, individual justices have received the big screen biopic treatment, but the late Justice Thurgood Marshall was profiled a few years ago in a one-man Broadway show starring award-winning actor Laurence Fishburne.","Ginsburg is recovering from fractured ribs, sources say .

"Emporios, Chios, Greece (CNN) -- August in Greece means two things: vacation and wildfires. Fires are popping up across the country at the tail end of a painful heatwave, but tourism is down sharply as many vacationers are concerned about visiting the country in its weak financial state. Strong winds spread a substantial fire across the southern part of the Greek island of Chios late Friday into Saturday. No injuries have been reported and no homes have been damaged as of Saturday afternoon, according to Chios police. The fire started at approximately 3 a.m. local time. Many of the local residents suspect arson because the fire started in the middle of the night, but officials have not yet determined the cause. Residents in Avgonima, Armolia, Anavatos, Pyrgi, Mesta, Elata, Lithi, Vessa, Olympi, and Dafnonas have either already evacuated their homes or are making preparations to do so. Lithi and Vessa are in the greatest danger from the fire, according to local firefighters. Roads to both towns have been closed. Police officials seemed overwhelmed by the scope of the fire, with several saying it was ""everywhere"" on the island and still not under control after many hours of firefighting efforts. The firefighting teams consist mostly of volunteers, but also include soldiers enlisted in the Greek army. In addition to fire trucks with water hoses, helicopters equipped with large buckets were being used to scoop up sea water to be dumped on the flames. The island is frequently plagued with fire in the summer months, mostly because of the combination of strong winds, and hot, dry weather, especially in August. Another major factor is the mastiha and other dry trees that cover the hills of the island. Mastiha trees make a sap that is the primary export of the island, used to make liquor, candy, gums and beauty products sold in Greece and exported to other countries. The fire on the southern part of the island follows another one that started August 7 on the small island of Ignussa off the northern tip of Chios. The island lost power for two days, according to residents, before the fire was contained. However, a huge portion of the mountains on the tiny island is now burned and blackened and local residents say more than 100 goats died in the fire. Summer fires in Greece are a routine occurrence, but this year the country has bigger problems looming, including the pending bailout payments from the European Union. On the island of Chios however, tourism is the more immediate issue worrying residents. Tourism is down by about 50% this summer, according to local reports. While the island of Chios is not as popular as Mykonos or Crete, it still relies heavily on the mostly European tourists who visit in July and August every year. The lack of foreign visitors is apparent on the southern part of Chios. Mavros Volia beach, or ""Black Rocks"" beach, is usually brimming with tourists and Greek visitors from the mainland during August, with the small road that leads up to the beach packed with rental cars and motor bikes. This year, the number of sunbathers on the beach appears to be down by more than half. Chios is off the coast of Turkey in the eastern part of the Aegean Sea.","Substantial fire causes widespread evacuation on the island of Chios .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Africa to represent Africans, a glorious dream. But that is what it has been for all this while, just a dream. Over time, as years have rolled into decades, Africans have become more and more subjugated to the decisions and policies that our former colonial masters propose, and with the aid of visionless leaders, they tell us that it's the best thing for the people. It is not the first time subsidies have been removed in Nigeria. Former president Olusegun Obasanjo reduced it eight times during his tenure, with the cost of gasoline increasing from 20 naira (12 cents) to 70 naira (43 cents). Each time Nigerians were promised better infrastructure and investment. Recently all subsidy was removed from diesel fuel and during this time, ordinary Nigerians have not seen any impact of the savings in their lives. In fact, life has become worse for them with life expectancy now at an average of 45 years, according to a 2010 United Nation Report. Corruption has been the main problem of most African countries for over half a century; it is shameful and disrespectful to the spirit of our forefathers' struggles for a free Africa. It hasn't been too long that we recovered from the pains and delusions of an IMF-imposed structural adjustment program (SAP) in the country, which ran for more than a decade and put us in a worse situation than we were in before it was implemented. General Babangida, the then head of state, deregulated all sectors and removed government subsidies from almost every sector of production in line with IMF and World Bank directives towards a more open capitalist economy. The result: inflation shot up. We recovered from the pain and delusions but the poverty still remains with us. This subsidy removal is the latest in a long line of foreign concepts and ideologies that are being forced down the people's throats. What the Nigerian government has failed to realize is that we cannot continue to model our economies on foreign blueprints. What is behind the fuel protests? I believe the fuel subsidy removal is callous and does not take into consideration the hardships facing the people. Nigeria's Central Bank governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, stated in a town hall meeting on fuel subsidy that 90% of Nigerians live on less that 2$ a day. Yet, the government choose to charge their own people $1 per liter for petrol, without consideration of how people are going to survive. This is treason against the people of Nigeria. One of the reasons given for subsidy removal is that ordinary Nigerians don't really benefit, but it is a secret cabal behind importing fuel that is benefiting from subsidy and removing it will kill off their influence in the market, but the people disagree with this. The people do not trust the government to honor their promises. We have heard different successive governments come in and say they are not corrupt and want to build infrastructure but end up being the exact opposite. We the people no longer want to be the doormats on which our politicians wipe their feet on their way into luxury and comfort. Nothing has improved in education, agriculture, housing, or transport; even our sports industry has been decimated. We have inadequate electricity in Nigeria so everything runs on generators; even the power plants are powered by generators. These generators run on petrol and diesel fuel. With an increase in the price of petrol by 117% from 65 naira (40 cents) to 141 naira (86 cents) and even 200 naira ($1.23) in some places, virtually everything in Nigeria has risen in price overnight. How can the government even talk of saving any money with this kind of inflation crippling the buying power of the population? Nigeria's government squeezed . Worse still, President Goodluck Jonathan says he is introducing measures to help reduce our suffering and he comes up with 1,600 diesel buses as a solution. This is an insult to Nigerians. This number of buses is not adequate for a population of 160 million. How is this a cushioning effect? It doesn't even scratch the surface of the pain we shall have to endure. That works out to 100,000 people per bus. I do understand that the government needs to raise money fast but the suffering of the people cannot be an option. I personally support the removal of subsidy when our government fixes our refineries so we do not have to import petroleum. They also need to be transparent about how much it costs to actually produce a liter of petrol. We the people of Nigeria will fight for the right to survive in the face of tyranny and deceit and I am calling on all the great Nigerian youths to join the mass action and rally everywhere in the country and abroad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Seun Anikulapo-Kuti.","Seun Kuti says previous fuel subsidy reductions have not resulted in better infrastructure .
The removal of subsidies, says Kuti, is in line with IMF policy but harms Nigerians .
He argues that the people do not trust the government to honor their promises .
Kuti thinks the subsidy should only be removed when Nigeria stops importing petrol ."

"(CNN) -- With their magnificent puppets, Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler have been pushing theatergoers' experiences to new heights, casting a spell on audiences across the world. The South African duo are the co-founders of the Handspring Puppet Company, creators of the astounding life-sized horse puppets that take over the stage in the award-winning play ""War Horse."" In June, the two artists, who are also partners in life, were the recipients of an honorary Tony Award in New York, a distinction marking the culmination of many years of beautiful, thought-provoking puppetry from the company they founded three decades ago. ""It's a wonderful thing to be happening as we hit 30 years of our company and 40 years of our relationship together and 60 years on the planet, (as) we turn 60,"" says Jones. Blind music pioneer fires up Nigeria's modern sound . It's been a long journey for the two creative men who met at a South African art school in the 1970s, a time when all young white males were compelled to serve for a year in the armed forces of the apartheid government. Jones and Kohler decided not to join the army and fled to Botswana's capital, Gaborone, where many of their compatriots had also found shelter. ""It was an incredibly happening place for South Africans and two white gay guys from South Africa kind of plunging themselves into the heart of the cultural African National Congress,"" says Kohler. ""I think we sorted ourselves out then, and then came back to South Africa with intentions of trying to use theater as a means to educate kids of a possible different kind of future,"" he adds. Having started their career with children's plays, Jones and Kohler moved later onto works for adult audiences. They ended up creating some of their country's most successful theater pieces, often in collaboration with renowned South African artist William Kentridge. William Kentridge, the South African artist drawing apartheid . Having excited South African audiences for decades, the duo have recently exploded onto the international stage following the phenomenal success of ""War Horse."" The play, based on the celebrated novel by Michael Morpurgo, centers around the immense love of a boy for his horse against the background of World War I. The moving tale has become a major hit -- it is running in both New York and London, it's about open to open in Toronto and Melbourne and it's also slated to tour the United States within the year. It is also the newest film from blockbuster director Steven Spielberg. ""It's become a phenomenon. It's strange to understand why, but it's taken off everywhere; by the end of next year there will be six productions running,"" says Kohler. On stage, Jones and Kohler's creations seem to occupy another space, creating a mesmerizing spectacle for their viewers. ""Puppets celebrate and lyricize the everyday and the ordinary, they make our everyday lives epic, huge,"" says Jones. ""We feel very lucky to be a part of this profession that is reinventing itself in the 21st century,"" adds Kohler. ""In a time of CGI graphics, in movies where anything fantastical is possible, the puppets somehow are staking their claim for a handmade theatrical experience that can transport an audience in a different way."" Despite all the success garnered from War Horse, Jones and Kohler are determined not to rest on their laurels. They admit that they are currently floating in a ""sea of possibilities"" but have to be careful about their future choices. ""At the moment we're kind of saying no to big shows, let's rather do smaller local things, and that's giving us a tremendous amount of feedback and enjoyment,"" says Jones. Jones and Kohler have also set up a non-profit organization focused on developmental work in rural communities in South Africa, seeking to explore the boundaries of new puppet theater forms. ""We think of Handspring more now as a platform for excellence in puppetry and we're inviting newcomers onto that platform as a place where we can present new ideas in our art form,"" says Jones. ""We're not going to be around forever -- there is a lot of talent coming up and if they're interested in puppets, we're thrilled,"" adds Kohler.

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers rushed Tuesday to get aid into flooded communities in New Jersey and Vermont, where many residents remain stranded in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. Marc Leibowitz, a New Yorker, went to Vermont over the weekend to get married. The wedding went off without a hitch, he said, but now he is stranded in the town of Pittsfield, with no roads to get him and his guests out. Residents have food and drinkable water, but resources are limited and won't last forever, Leibowitz told CNN's ""AC 360."" ""There's several bridges down on Route 100. There's a road that just caved in. There's several houses in town that we watched floating. It's been scary,"" he said. Thirteen Vermont towns were inaccessible by roads early Tuesday. By late afternoon, Route 100 into Stratton and Rochester had opened and officials said they hoped to have the remainder of those towns accessible soon. In Grafton, Vermont, 800 residents were stranded.  ""It's one massive mess,"" said Tara Taylor, who came out of Grafton to nearby Rockingham, along with her family.  ""There's no words to describe this."" While part of Grafton has maintained electricity, much of the town is running on generators, she said.  But as far as she knew, people were well, and no one had been hurt, Taylor said.  ""We've been very lucky with this."" Taylor's young daughter told CNN she had seen pictures of some devastated areas. ""It just tore me apart on how it was like all just gone,"" she said. Mark Bosma of the Vermont Office of Emergency Management said officials were working to bring supplies to cut-off communities, turned temporarily into islands. The National Guard operated two helicopters, doing drop-offs where needed, delivering such necessities as food, water, medicine, diapers and formula. Meanwhile, in New Jersey, search-and-rescue teams went door-to-door by boat in flooded communities, transporting families from their homes to higher ground. ""The water's moving so fast,"" said Scott Evans of the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management.  ""It's not even safe to go close to the river at this point."" Evans spoke with CNN in Paterson, New Jersey, just three blocks from the swollen Passaic River. Water in the street was as high as 15 to 18 feet, he said. Some one-story buildings were fully submerged. Tuesday morning alone, 34 people, including 14 children, were rescued in Paterson along with three dogs, Evans said. While people had been warned that river levels were rising and flooding was likely, some stayed in their homes overnight because they didn't realize the water would come gushing so quickly, Evans said. ""Unfortunately, they are used to flooding, but not of this magnitude,"" he said of local residents.  ""And a lot of areas are getting flooded this time that have not been flooded before."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie surveyed some of the damage and told reporters on Tuesday that he had seen ""extraordinary despair."" More than 1,300 people throughout the state are in shelters, he said, though that number is likely to rise as additional areas are evacuated. Also Tuesday, the death toll stemming from Irene continued to rise. At least 43 deaths were linked to the storm, from Florida to North Carolina to New England. An estimated 2.85 million customers remained without power Tuesday afternoon, the U.S. Department of Energy said.  That included more than half a million each in Connecticut and New York, more than 400,000 in Virginia, more than 300,000 in New Jersey and more than 250,000 in Maryland. Nearly 6.7 million customers initially were left without power by the storm, the department said. ""This storm covered a tremendous amount of territory,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters in Virginia. She said most states are now in recovery, though a few states -- like Vermont and New Jersey -- are still in response mode. Napolitano traveled to North Carolina and Virginia on Tuesday with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to meet with state and local officials and to survey storm efforts. Vilsack spoke to reporters in North Carolina after touring some of the hardest-hit areas. He said tobacco, cotton and corn producers had suffered extensive damage. The full extent of Irene's destruction won't be known for some time. The federal government estimates that the cost from wind damage alone will exceed $1 billion. Analysts have put the total expected cost of Irene much higher. CNN's Julia Talanova, Mary Snow, Amber Lyon, Gary Tuchman, A.

"(Rolling Stone ) -- In an excerpt from Christopher Andersen's ""Mick: The Wild Life and Mad Genius of Jagger"" published by the New York Daily News, Andersen claims that Mick Jagger and David Bowie had an ongoing sexual relationship. Among the various rumors and stories cited, the excerpt points out that Bebe Buell, mother of Liv Tyler and former lover of both Jagger and Bowie, dated the two at the same time, and that the two rockers attempted to lure her into a few orgies. ""I used to get some pretty strange phone calls from Mick and David at three in the morning inviting me to join them in bed with four gorgeous black women,"" reads a quote in the book. ""[Or] four gorgeous black men."" But in a Facebook post written today, Buell smashed Andersen's account, strongly dispelling the rumors. ""This entire Bowie/Jagger thing is completely stupid and false! Who cares what they did in their private time? I sure don't but I don't like getting dragged into the press when I wasn't part of it. I don't do orgies, never did, never have!"" she writes. ""Yes, I dated both men but not at the same time. Bowie was more of JUST a friend. Jagger was a BF on and off for years.

"(CNN) -- This month Road to Rio -- a Green City Journey stops off in the world's second most populated country, India. Sara Sidner, Mallika Kapur and Nick Glass meet in the capital city New Delhi, to explore how carbon cuts are being made. They hit the ground on green modes of transport to take on the Green City Challenge, picking up the best of green initiatives in a city heaving with mechanical and human traffic. From a solar-paneled rickshaw they explore the cuts being made in transport -- nearly the whole public transport system is run on natural gas (CNG) and the Metro system is expanding to take 17 million cars off the road reducing emissions by 160 millions tons. The slogan of the Rio Earth Summit, where we're heading in June, is ""The Future We Want."" Are young Indians participating in the future they want? Sara visits a local orphanage where organic waste from the local market is powering the stoves -- one solution to Delhi's problem of 9,000 tons of waste daily. Night markets are being lit by solar lamps in an initiative pioneered by Delhi students. And in the evening: A local eco-community provides the entertainment with a Bollywood movie in a solar powered cinema accompanied by popcorn made in a solar cooker. GREEN TEA . Tea production is one of India's foremost industries and nowhere is more celebrated for its tea leaves than Darjeeling. Nick goes to visit Chamong Tea Estate where tea pickers are exploiting renewable hydroelectric power to help run their business, making this truly ""green tea."" CLEANING UP DIRTY PHONE CALLS . Bharti Infratel in Gurgaon, near Delhi, has turned to renewable energy to help power the conversations of the future. The telecoms industry is growing massively each year, nowhere more so than in India. With around 800 million cell phone subscribers as well as call centers, every 10% increase in penetration has increased the country's GDP by 1.2%. However, the telecoms industry has a dirty secret; it is very carbon intensive. Sara goes to find out how it are cleaning up. SUSTAINABLE SILK . India is the world's second largest producer of textiles after China. It is an age-old trade, but the millions of meters of fabric rolled out each year pump nearly 200 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Mallika heads to Jaipur to see how a textile factory is turning the power of the sun to weave more and burn less. MUGHAL GREEN WISDOM . Locked into the ornate stone walls of Jaipur's Mughal palaces are the keys to really green buildings. Architect Manit Rastogi has explored the palaces to build a carbon cool university in a desert climate. Nick accompanies Rastogi from the Amber Fort to the Hawa Mahal, to see how clever manipulations of stone and water have made the Pearl Academy an energy efficient masterpiece. MUMBAI RECYCLING . Approximately 7,000 tonnes of waste is generated per day in Mumbai. Residents of the city's sprawling slum Dharavi, one of the largest slums in the world, have come up with a solution. Rag pickers swarm the heaps of garbage, and now there's a buck or two more for their work. Recycling the mounds of plastic into toys, household products and accessories is making big business out of rubbish. Mallika goes to find out. Watch the show in February at the following times: .

"(CNN) -- This month, Road to Rio touches down in China. In their first stop, CNN's Kristie Lu Stout and Stan Grant, and the Road to Rio 'Expert' Jie Yu, meet in Hong Kong to explore a range of the city's boldest carbon cutting initiatives. The dynamic journey features sustainable transport projects such as the Hong Kong Police's fleet of electric scooters, clean fuel taxis, electric cars and solar ferries. The reporters visit the latest in green architecture - the solar glass of the Science Park and the Zero Carbon Building. They taste the delights of the Intercontinental cuisine - it's 'carbon neutral menu' and watch as the waste oil is collected to be converted into bio-fuel at a local power plant. One reporter heads to a glass recycling plant, while the other climbs to the sky gardens -- where urban farming is blossoming. In the evening, as the colors of the night start to light up on Tsim Sha Tsui, one scientist explains his low energy color LED invention which will be reducing Hong Kong's light pollution. RICE . Agriculture is the world's second highest carbon culprit. Nitrogen fertilizers are responsible for over a third of the sector's emissions, and plants are notoriously bad at absorbing nitrogen. Arcadia Group has developed a groundbreaking rice seed which incorporates the efficient nitrogen absorbing genes from wheat. China is the world's largest producer of rice, so Stan Grant goes to visit the testing plantation in the fertile soil of Yinchuan. CARBON CAPTURE . 70% of China's electricity is generated by coal and it's no clean process. One company is pioneering a solution to the high carbon emissions: carbon capture. Shenhua Coal Factory in Ordos plant is is home to the world's first operating carbon capture facility. CCS technology captures carbon dioxide produced during the coal combustion process and aims to store it underground indefinitely. Stan Grant explores the factory to find out how the technology works. BAODING . Branded the world's first carbon positive city, Baoding describes itself as a 'living showcase of environmental technology' and is home to over 200 renewable energy producing companies. Jie Yu is this month's Road to Rio 'expert' -- born in Shanghai, she is Climate Change Policy Director at The Nature Conservancy, China. She takes CNN on a tour of the city, from factories creating wind turbines to the production lines churning out sheets of solar panels. Jie speaks to a WWF Project Manager in the carbon neutral Jinjiang International Hotel, about how this city could be a model for others in a rapidly urbanizing country. TOYS . The 'Made in China' label is ubiquitous. China produces some 70% of the world's toys, in factories located in the Guangdong province. The production lines are unrelenting, as are the carbon emissions. Kristie goes to visit one factory heading up an ambitious plan to cut the carbon at even the lowest level of operations. Tsuen Lee factory in Shenzhen are committed to a rigorous energy saving programme - a range of new and innovative low-tech solutions are ensuring that clean green toys will now circulate the playrooms of the world.","This month Road to Rio stops off in China to check out some green initiatives there .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army battalion commander killed in a shooting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was a highly decorated veteran who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military said Saturday. Lt. Col. Roy L. Tisdale, 42, of Alvin, Texas, was killed Thursday by a soldier in his battalion who opened fire during a safety briefing, according to a statement released by base officials. ""Tisdale was killed immediately and the unit member reportedly turned the weapon upon himself, causing life-threatening injuries,"" the statement said. The military has not released a possible motive in the shooting, though a defense official said Tisdale was shot by a soldier in his battalion. The alleged shooter, a specialist, was facing court martial after being accused of stealing a tool box worth nearly $2,000 from a motor pool, and faced dishonorable discharge if found guilty, said the official, who did not want to be named. The official is not authorized to speak to the media. The battalion commander had gathered his unit Thursday afternoon for a safety briefing that was really more of a ""stay safe"" talk before the July 4th weekend, the official said. During the talk, the specialist pulled out a gun and started shooting, then shot himself, the official said. The alleged shooter had once served on the battalion commander's security detail during a tour in Afghanistan, the official said. The alleged shooter, whose identity has not been released, was in critical condition and not expected to survive, the official said. A third soldier, identified as Spec. Michael E. Latham, was treated for minor wounds, base officials said. Tisdale took control of the Fort Bragg-based 525th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, in January. Among military honors he earned was a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and an Army Commendation Medal, according to base officials.

"Washington (CNN) -- About a dozen demonstrators used metal poles, wire cables, and rappelling gear to hoist a large banner high in the air within sight of the U.S. Capitol Wednesday. It called for a tax on billionaires to help pay for funding to fight AIDS. Police arrested nine people, all charged with taking part in an illegal demonstration, U.S. Capitol Police Lt.. Kimberly Schneider told CNN. The rally was organized by a group called Housing Works, which describes itself as ""a healing community of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS."" Opinion: Save lives, end the HIV stigma . In a statement sent to CNN timed with the demonstration, the group said it was protesting ""the federal ban on funding syringe exchange programs and the dearth of funds for HIV/AIDS treatments, while Wall Street continues to make exorbitant profits and the war on women's reproductive rights still wages on."" At least two women were among those detained by police. Fire department personnel responding to the scene near the Capitol Reflecting Pool at first seemed puzzled about how to take down the poles, which had been fashioned into tripod supports at least 20 feet high. They were lashed together and spaced apart, and supported two protestors who held lines that suspended their banner. Emergency equipment on hand included a rubber rescue boat, extension ladders and stretchers, but it was a team with large bolt cutters that moved in first. As a fireman snapped one cable, one of the demonstrators suspended from the structure shouted for them to stop. ""That's going to hurt someone,"" he told authorities. ""We know what we're doing."" He explained that to cut another cable would cause both structures to collapse, sending both people tumbling to the ground. The demonstrators then agreed to come down on their own, using their rappelling gear to slowly descend. Once free of the apparatus, U.S. Capitol police placed them in plastic handcuffs and loaded them into detention vans.

"New York (CNN) -- Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said a partial seizure is the cause of a Friday morning car crash. At a press conference on Tuesday, Kennedy also said the seizure might have been from a previous injury she suffered on the right side of her brain. Kennedy, 52, was found by state police behind the wheel of her damaged Lexus SUV. A New York State Police press release said the SUV collided with a tractor-trailer. Kennedy charged in hit-and-run . At a hearing on Tuesday in district court in North Castle, New York, Kennedy pleaded not guilty to charges of driving while impaired. The judge released her under her own recognizance. At the press conference after the hearing, Kennedy said she told the officer who arrived at the scene: ""It is theoretically possible that I might have taken an Ambien rather than a thyroid pill"" earlier that morning. Kennedy said she remembers nothing of her alleged erratic driving, from getting on the highway until the officer stopped her at a traffic light. ""A subsequent investigation found Kennedy to be operating the motor vehicle while her ability was impaired by drugs,"" police said in announcing the charge against her on Friday. At Tuesday's press conference, Kennedy said she went to Northern Westchester Hospital, where she was tested for recreational drugs, prescription drugs and alcohol.

"London (CNN) -- The mother of a victim of one of Britain's most notorious killers died Saturday, a day after police said they were investigating a possible clue to where her child was buried nearly 50 years ago. Winnie Johnson, whose 12-year-old son Keith Bennett went missing in 1964 in northern England, had spent the long decades since seeking first to find, and then to give a proper burial to, her murdered child. But her death after serious illness has come before that hope could be realized. Ian Brady, who was jailed for life in 1966 for three other child murders committed with the help of his partner Myra Hindley, admitted killing the boy in 1987 but has never disclosed the whereabouts of his body. The other four victims were buried on Saddleworth Moor, a lonely upland expanse in the Pennine hills, near Manchester, but repeated searches have never uncovered Keith's remains. Brady, known as the ""Moors Murderer,"" remains in a secure psychiatric unit. A statement on the family's website, Searching for Keith, confirmed that Johnson, a ""much-loved mother, grandmother and great-grandmother,"" had died at age 78. ""Winnie fought tirelessly for decades to find Keith and give him a Christian burial,"" it said. ""Although this was not possible during her lifetime, we, her family, intend to continue this fight now for her and for Keith. We hope that the authorities and the public will support us in this."" Police revealed Friday that they were investigating claims that Brady may recently have given details of the burial spot to one of his longtime visitors, in a sealed letter to be passed to Johnson after Brady's death. The information came to light when a documentary filmmaker interviewed a woman who has been acting as Brady's mental health adviser, the Press Association news agency reported. Martin Bottomley, head of Greater Manchester Police's cold case review team, cautioned Friday against leaping to conclusions but said police were taking the possibility Brady had written such a letter seriously. ""We do not know if this is true or simply a ruse, but we clearly have a duty to investigate such information on behalf of Keith's family,"" he said in a statement. ""Since Keith was so cruelly taken away all those years ago, our thoughts have always been with his family as they try to come to terms with what happened. All they want is to finally be able to lay Keith to rest."" A 49-year-old woman was arrested in South Wales on Thursday on suspicion of preventing the burial of a body without lawful exercise, and has been released on bail pending further inquiries, the police statement said. Documents have also been seized from the address and are being examined, police said. Brady and Hindley were taken by police to Saddleworth Moor to look for the bodies of Bennett and another victim, 16-year-old Pauline Reade, after they admitted those killings in 1987, the Press Association said. However, only Reade's remains were found. The lawyer who represented Johnson, John Ainley, said it was a ""heartbreaking situation"" that she had died without ever learning where her son was buried. ""Over the years and in all our personal meetings, Winnie has insisted Brady is the only person who could put her mind at rest and give her the chance to give Keith a decent burial before she passed on,"" he said, according to a statement from the law firm. ""She was convinced Brady knew where her son was buried and she told me she wanted the search to continue to find Keith."" Johnson is quoted on the Searching for Keith website as saying: ""My greatest hope in this life from the day he left is to have him home, I now accept he is not alive but I still believe I have the right as his mother to give him a Christian burial.""

"(CNN) -- A 6.6-magnitude earthquake struck early Sunday in the western Pacific off Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The tremor did not immediately prompt any tsunami warnings by the U.S. National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center or the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Tsunami Programme, which is affiliated with the United Nations, likewise said historical data suggests there is ""no destructive widespread tsunami threat."" ""However, earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that can be destructive along coasts located within a hundred kilometers of the earthquake epicenter,"" the IOC said in a bulletin. ""Authorities in the region of the epicenter should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate action."" The quake was centered 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) deep under the ocean floor, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It happened shortly after 6 a.m. Sunday (4 p.m. ET Saturday). The epicenter was about 33 kilometers south-southeast of Taron, in the eastern part of Papua New Guinea. The island nation's capital of Port Moresby was some 850 kilometers away.

"(CNN) -- A severed human hand and foot sent to two Vancouver schools are linked to a grisly killing and dismemberment in Montreal, police said Wednesday. Montreal police have taken over the investigation of the Vancouver incident because they believe the suspect in the case, porn actor Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, sent the body parts via Canada Post from Montreal. ""Right now, we got no reason to believe there could be someone else involved in this horrible crime,"" said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. Investigators believe Magnotta killed Concordia University student Jun Lin, 33, on May 24 or May 25, posted a 10-minute video of the murder and dismemberment, then took a flight to Paris on May 26. Authorities launched a massive manhunt that ended Monday when Berlin police nabbed Magnotta at an Internet cafe. Magnotta will not fight extradition to Canada to face first-degree murder charges, Berlin police said. Police said Magnotta mailed Lin's left hand and foot to the headquarters of Canada's two main political parties in Ottawa. DNA tests completed Tuesday confirmed the body parts were Lin's. Police believe the right hand and foot found later in Vancouver also belonged to Lin. They are on their way back to Montreal for DNA testing. Lin's torso was found after a resident of Magnotta's apartment building in Montreal called to complain about a foul smell in an alleyway. The torso was stuffed inside a suitcase tossed into a garbage heap. The victim's head is still missing. Police also believe Magnotta filmed the death and dismemberment and posted the video to the Internet. Authorities have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts. Lafreniere said the video also included evidence of cannibalism. The crime, the grisliest Montreal police have seen in years, has Canadians on edge. Adding to the panic was a 911 caller who reported a severed foot in Montreal less than 24 hours after the gruesome discoveries in Vancouver. Lafreniere said that the foot was fake, made of plastic or rubber, and that it was someone's idea of a bad joke. ""It put everyone under stress thinking there could be body parts everywhere,"" he said. The discovery of Lin's body parts set off a massive manhunt for Magnotta who, before that, had left a disturbing trail in cyberspace. Police plan to look into accusations by online animal rights activists who say Magnotta killed kittens by suffocation or drowning and videotaped himself in the act. He also said investigators would check out rumored links between Magnotta and notorious killer Karla Homolka. Ontario police arrested Homolka and her husband in 1993 in the rapes and murders of three Ontario girls, including her own sister. As part of a plea bargain, Homolka served 12 years in prison and was released a few years ago. However, Lafreniere said investigators have no evidence linking Magnotta to other crimes. Montreal police are also investigating a website that hosted Magnotta's chilling 10-minute video of Lin's murder. The site could face criminal charges for publishing obscene material. However, the hand and foot discoveries in Vancouver take precedence in the police investigation, Lafreniere said Wednesday. He asked reporters again to be aware of how difficult this has been for Lin's family. ""We have been working extremely hard to find all the body parts with respect to the family,"" he said. Lin's parents hailed from a village in China and did not have much money, Lafreniere said. They plan to travel to Montreal, and some Montrealeans have volunteered to help them with costs. ""I am proud of that,"" Lafreniere said.","A severed hand and foot sent to Vancouver schools belonged to Montreal victim, police say .

"(CNN) -- Worshippers at an Islamic center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, will have to wait at least a week before they can use their new mosque, officials said Thursday. The mosque -- subject of a two-year battle marked by legal wrangling, vandalism and anti-Muslim sentiment -- still needs to pass inspection and get its occupancy permit, mosque officials said. ""It is unfortunate that we cannot be in our building for the start of Ramadan tonight,"" Islamic Center of Murfreesboro officials said in a written statement. ""However, it does look like we will get to enjoy most of Ramadan in our building, especially the breaking of the fast at the end of Ramadan, on Eid-ul-Fitr."" The release said it will take about 10 days to complete the next legal steps. ""They do have a lot of work to be done cosmetically,"" said David Jones, Rutherford County Building Codes director, told CNN affiliate WSMV. ""We have gone through the building with them"" and made suggestions, he added. On Wednesday, a federal judge in Memphis ordered Rutherford County to conduct a final inspection on the building, setting aside a local judge's ruling from June that voided a planning commission's approval. If the structure fails to comply with inspection requirements, U.S. District Judge Todd J. Campbell ordered the county to immediately notify the Islamic Center of any deficiencies and ""promptly reinspect the building"" after the center informs the county it has corrected the problems. Embattled mosque moves forward with construction . Kevin Fisher, who is opposed the mosque, told CNN affiliate WZTV on Wednesday that the issue was never about someone's right to worship but rather about whether the planning commission gave proper public notice. ""I do believe in our system. I believe in due process,"" he said. ""You have to respect the system, even if you disagree sometimes with the decision it makes."" Sally Wall, one of the leading opponents of the mosque, said she wasn't surprised by the ruling and never thought her group would win the court case. She said she just wanted to show Muslims that they are not welcome in Murfreesboro. Faced with the fact that the mosque is likely to be opening soon, Wall said she hopes it doesn't bring ""1,000 to 2,000 Muslim families here."" She plans to keep up the fight, and said the controversy has drawn the community closer together. ""Everyone else feels the same way I do (about the mosque) except the 5% who moved here the day before yesterday,"" she said. Feds investigate fire at site of future mosque . Imam Ossama Bahloul of the Islamic Center said the congregation has a three-decade history and has not caused any disruption in the city. ""No one can come to say the Islam community is radical,"" he told CNN. ""What did we do?"" Angela Hytry, 31, said she thinks local opinions on the issue are a reflection of town demographics. The population is split equally into two groups, she said: those who have moved to Murfreesboro -- mostly for Middle Tennessee State University or to commute to nearby Nashville -- and those whose families have been there for decades. ""People who have been here forever have a very one-sided, ignorant viewpoint of what a mosque coming to Murfreesboro would mean,"" she said. The graphic designer, originally from Detroit, has been living in the suburban town for 10 years. She said Detroit has a large Muslim population and she grew up with that as a normal part of the culture. Two years ago, the mosque was the talk of the town, but at least for her circle of friends and family it has become a fringe issue, she said. Why do Muslims pray 5 times a day? A municipal worker who lives near the mosque said most of the residents in her neighborhood are more concerned about the traffic than the Muslim presence. But for the majority of the town it's the term ""Muslim"" that counts, she said. The 69-year-old, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue and her connection to local government, said she thinks any religious group has a right to be there and she doesn't feel threatened. ""It's just the way Muslims are perceived because of the terrorist attacks and the war,"" she said. ""We have Buddhists here and they have their place of worship and I don't think anything's ever been said against them."" What's bothering this 11-year Murfreesboro resident the most is the discord it's brought to her town. ""It's just a mess and it's brought terrible publicity,"" she said. ""It's a wonderful city and town, but the news is not going to portray that."" The issue is widely discussed among local residents and some people near her have even put their houses up for sale, she said, because they don't want to be near a Muslim congregation. The fight erupted in 2010 when planning commissioners approved an expansion project. The construction site has been vandalized several times, including by an arson attack in 2010, and federal authorities have charged a Texas man with calling in a bomb threat to the center before last year's anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. ""Not welcome"" was spray-painted by vandals on a sign announcing the construction of the project. Bahloul said the mosque's opening will be another opportunity to extend ""hands of peace"" and thank supporters. ""I believe we are all related, we all came from Adam and Eve,"" the imam said. ""We might have some disagreement, but we must find a way to sit at the table, have a discussion and respect each other."" My Faith: After my mosque was torched .

At least seven people were killed in the Bulgarian explosion. Iran had no immediate reaction. After Iranian nuclear scientists were assassinated in Tehran, Iran blamed Israel. When attackers targeted Israeli diplomats this year, Israel blamed Iran. Iran hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists, state-run Press TV reported in May. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of the January 2010 killing of Massoud Ali Mohammadi, an Iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist. He was also convicted of spying. Prosecutors accused him of working for the Mossad, the Israeli spy agency, and said he was paid $120,000 by Israel to carry out the hit. Israel typically does not comment on such claims. In January, Iran sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general alleging the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a clear pattern. ""There is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,"" the letter said. In April, Iran said it broke up an Israeli ""terror and sabotage network"" that was planning attacks within the country, making a number of arrests while confiscating weapons and equipment, state-run media reported. ""The complicated and months-long measures and moves made by the Iranian intelligence forces to identify the devils led to the discovery of the Zionists' regional command center ... and discovering the identity of the agents active in that command center,"" a statement from the Iranian Intelligence Ministry said. Previously on CNN.com: Iranian supreme leader blames U.S., Israel for scientist's death . A spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said then that every few months Iran spreads disinformation and there was no basis to the story. Ties between Iran and Israel unraveled after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. After he was elected in 2005, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad began spouting anti-Israeli and anti-Western rhetoric. Yet it has been Iran's nuclear program that has raised the prospects of armed conflict. Iran has been in a protracted dispute with the United States and other countries over its nuclear program, which it claims is for peaceful purposes. But many Western countries fear the program is a cover for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Just this week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Iran has not made a ""strategic decision"" to address concerns. Clinton: Iran's proposals are ""non-starters."" Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop the country from developing nuclear weapons. ""There is a world agreement that the Iranian government is after nuclear weapons and that its policy of terrorism is endangering everybody. There is a global understating that we must do everything we can to prevent Iran from endangering others,"" Israeli President Shimon Peres said, according to the Israeli Foreign Minister's office.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- After a student walk-out spurred a flood of support from alumni and others, the board of the University of Georgia's student newspaper backtracked Friday and vowed a staffer they had hired will not have final say on editorial decisions, the paper's former editor-in-chief said. The new policy was one of several requested by student journalists and outlined by Red & Black newspaper board members in a meeting Friday with students in Athens, Georgia, said Polina Marinova, who was the paper's top editor until earlier this week. She called the policy shift a testament to the students' unity and conviction, as well as thanks to a wave of public pressure put on the board. ""I'm just really proud that everyone stood together and there was so much support,"" Marinova told CNN on Friday night. ""We stood up for ourselves, and I think other people saw that."" Marinova and Julia Carpenter quit as editor-in-chief and managing editor, respectively, of the Red & Black on Wednesday, with fellow editors, design staff, photo staff and reporters joining them leaving the newspaper's building en masse. They explained they had done so after the publication's board recently hired several ""permanent staff with veto power over students' decisions."" In a statement posted on a new website -- redanddead.com -- they set up to continue covering news and offer their views, the departed staff posted a ""draft"" memo written by a Red & Black board member dated on Wednesday -- the day of the resignations and walk-out -- as being ""effective today."" In the memo, board member Ed Stamper detailed responsibilities for the ""Editorial Director and the entire professional staff"" such as ""taking corrective action to replace students that do not follow our standards,"" setting design mandates and suggesting what types of stories staff should cover, including ""more good"" and less ""bad"" news stories that highlight wrongdoing. ""Recently, editors have felt pressure to assign stories they didn't agree with, take 'grip and grin' photos, and compromise the design of the paper,"" wrote Marinova, a rising University of Georgia senior, in a statement announcing her resignation. ""But what's most alarming to me is that there was no input from the Red & Black student staff about any of these changes."" After the resignations and walk-out, the Red & Black board and its publisher, Harry Montevideo, on Thursday issued their own statement expressing ""regret"" for what it called ""a great deal of miscommunication during the past 24 hours."" They stated the Red & Black ""is still and will remain an independent student media organization,"" explaining the hiring of the new professional staff and specifically stating that the recently appointed editorial director is meant to serve as ""a counselor, teacher, mentor, coordinator and manager"" and not as a de facto editor-in-chief who makes final editorial decisions. In her resignation letter, Marinova wrote that ""more than 10 permanent staff"" had been hired in ""less than a month."" On Friday, the board of directors vice chairwoman Melita Easters disputed that figure, saying it was ""more like eight"" -- about half of whom were part-time, and only two of whom were editorial staff (with others focused on marketing and advertising). Easters said that the ""board, as a whole,"" did not foresee the students' actions or the public hubbub that followed. ""This was a big misunderstanding that got blown even to larger proportions,"" she told CNN on Friday. ""The level of misunderstanding became a feeding frenzy for the media."" A number of national media outlets picked up on the story almost immediately, as did media rights advocates and alumni. The latter included scores of former Red & Black staffers who signed a letter to the newspaper's board of directors characterizing the language in Stamper's memo as ""embarrassing"" and calling the possibility that students would lose editorial control their ""biggest concern."" The Red & Black is one of a handful of student newspapers nationwide that is independent financially and editorially from its university, said Frank LoMonte, the executive director of the Student Law Press Center, which works with high school and college journalists around the United States. Its board may be even more unique, as the only one that LoMonte knows of without any student members. He said the torrent of one-sided reaction to the episode, including via Facebook and Twitter, shows the Red & Black has an especially passionate alumni as well. The outpouring played a large part in the board's reversals within just a few days, according to LoMonte. ""No newspaper can lose their audience, and this audience wants to read a student-run newspaper,"" he said. ""The fact this situation was largely able to be turned around in a matter of 36 hours is directly attributable to the power of social media."" The board issued a new statement Friday, offering its ""deepest apologies"" and insisting ""the student editor has always had the final editorial decision responsibility for our news content."" It added Stamper -- who issued a statement apologizing for ""embarrassment"" caused by his memo, which he said were talking points for a planned discussion with the editorial director and did not represent the policy of the Red & Black board -- had resigned and opened the door for Marinova and Carpenter to reapply for the top editor posts. Feeling this statement was ""a bit vague,"" Marinova said she and others met with board members to clarify what was happening. She said she learned that the editorial director job was being changed to an editorial adviser position and professional staff would have ""no prior review"" or sign-off of news content. Marinova, who said she didn't believe all board members ""knew what was going on"" throughout the situation, said she feels there's much more clarity and dialogue. ""We feel now that we have a voice,"" Marinova said. ""And the communication lines are now much more open."" The Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, a division of the university that many of the paper's student staff attend, lauded the board for having ""reconfirmed the editorial authority of student journalists"" and lamented the ""current crisis of leadership at the paper and its effect on students."" Whatever its motivation, LoMonte from the Student Law Press Center interpreted Friday's actions by the Red & Black's board as a clear win for the University of Georgia students -- and, more generally, for student journalists all around the country. ""I think the takeaway from this is that you cannot mess with student autonomy in a student newspaper,"" he said. Marinova, who said that she and Carpenter plan to reapply for their old positions, said the ordeal shows that when young people work together with a common purpose, they can be heard. ""Students and everyone should have a voice,"" she said Friday. ""They should feel that they are part of something, that you can't be told that you're ostensible (because) you are there for the reason.""","Top editors of the University of Georgia's student paper quit and the staff walked out .

"(CNN) -- When the comedian Daniel Tosh reportedly singled out a woman in his audience and suggested, according to a blog post that recounted the incident, it would be ""funny"" if she ""got raped by, like, five guys, right now,"" the online reaction was swift, heated and often split down gender lines. Many men wanted to explain free speech or heckling etiquette. Many women (and virtually all feminists) said these topics were distractions, at best, from the sheer offensiveness of Tosh's attack. As we at the Women's Media Center watched hundreds of users comment on our Facebook post about the incident, we saw the same disconnect. Quite a few of the women who shared our post said they were doing so in hopes that a husband or boyfriend would ""finally understand why I won't watch Tosh's show with him."" Some even tagged their husbands or boyfriends, to be sure the message would reach its destination. In the aggregate, these comments gave us a glimpse into the ongoing, low-grade conflicts between women who have been trying to articulate their discomfort with Tosh's lazy, cruel and misogynistic humor, and the men who share their lives but just don't get it. At the center of these disagreements is the rape-joke empathy gap. The problem isn't a failure of men to see rape as horrific. It's that many of them do not perceive that rape itself lies on the far end of a broad spectrum of ways in which the idea of rape, the invocation of rape or the threat of rape is used to intimidate women or to regulate their behavior. When women are told that they shouldn't drink too much or walk alone at night or wear a revealing top, they are being given a guided tour of the boundaries of acceptable female conduct. Women are supposed to understand that these boundaries are policed by rapists. We cross the line at our own risk. And if we are caught, the brutal punishment is one we have earned. Gilbert Gottfried: If you don't want to hear an edgy joke, don't listen . A comedian who shoots down an audience member who objects to his rape jokes by joking about her being gang-raped on the spot isn't being funny. He's using rape to shut up a woman who crossed a boundary by speaking out of turn. That is unacceptable. Tosh was free to say what he said, of course. But that doesn't mean it wasn't morally repugnant. It was. What about rape jokes with less vicious punch lines? Here is the gray area where the empathy gap thrives best. There is absolutely room in both comedy and in feminism for discussions about rape jokes that highlight rape as a social ill vs. those that perpetuate that injustice. That's why we joined with other feminist media critics and activists to produce a YouTube ""supercut"" of rape jokes -- some insightful and some far less so. Still, the presence of rape in women's lives is too real and pervasive for many to laugh at all the same jokes that many men can. It's not that women never enjoy crude humor -- a lesbian journalist friend recently confided in us her amazement that her wife is a fan of Tosh's show, if not some of its more brutal misogyny. And it's not that no man knows with terrible certainty what it's like to be a rape victim -- one in five females and one in 71 males in the United States are the victims of rape, to say nothing of atrocities around the world such as those described in our new report on rape as a weapon of war in Syria. Nonetheless, the significant overlap between the gender divide and the rape-joke empathy gap is real, and it seems inevitable when media coverage of rape so often focuses on what a victim should have done differently to try harder not to get raped. Such shoddy framing creates a fictional image that there's a certain type of woman who gets raped. Women know that's a lie, because they live the truth, but men may never have occasion to question that image, and so when they laugh at rape jokes, they're laughing at an abstraction that's all too real for many women. Tosh and all those with the privilege to hold a microphone have a responsibility to shine a light on the reality behind the abstraction -- not to perpetuate it, and certainly not to silence those who bear its burden. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julie Burton and Michelle Kinsey Bruns.","Julie Burton, Michelle Kinsey Bruns: Men, women seem to disagree on comic's rape joke .
They say many men don't seem to get the joke reflected extreme end of rape culture .
They say threat of rape used to define boundaries for women's behavior; joke did this, too .

"(Rolling Stone) -- With Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler both leaving the judges' table on American Idol, the search is on for their replacements -- and now, add Charlie Sheen to the list of interested candidates. Calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest Tuesday, Sheen chatted with the Idol host about the judge job, noting that producer Nigel Lythgoe had said something about offering Sheen the opportunity. ""It kind of came out of nowhere and I responded with a quote, just to sort of check the temperature of it or test the waters. Haven't heard anything back,"" Sheen explained. ""I guess it got some people curious."" Sheen added that he would be interested if the producers would match 20 percent of his salary to two foundations of his choosing, if the numbers and scheduling made sense for him and if FX (the network that airs Sheen's new sitcom Anger Management) allowed him to do it. ""It seems so out of the blue that it almost made perfect sense,"" he said. ""I thought this could be a lot of fun."" When Seacrest asked Sheen if he saw himself giving feedback to contestants, the actor responded, ""Oh yeah, absolutely! And being very honest but not, like, creating any suicidal moments, you know?"" Seacrest promised to pass the news onto Lythgoe and Sheen added an emphatic, ""Seriously, tell him I'm genuinely interested. It's so different, it could be radical."" In expressing interest in the Idol gig, Sheen joins a club that currently also includes former show runner-up Adam Lambert and the Queen of Soul herself, Aretha Franklin -- the latter of whom sweetened the deal when she promised to bring Patti LaBelle on as her sidekick.

"(CNN) -- To call ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ""highly anticipated"" at this point would be an understatement. The fervor for Christopher Nolan's third Batman film has been so intense, tickets were selling out in select theaters back in January, months ahead of its July 20 U.S. opening. With this being the third and final film in an acclaimed trilogy, each casting announcement and trailer clip has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed. And now, thanks to early reviews that have circulated on Monday, the fascination with ""The Dark Knight Rises"" has reached a new level. ""Big-time Hollywood filmmaking at its most massively accomplished, this last installment of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish,"" says The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy. ""Entirely enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined, as a cohesive whole this ranks as the best of Nolan's trio, even if it lacks ... an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal turn in 'The Dark Knight.' "" A review from Todd Gilchrist at IndieWire's The Playlist says even more effortless than Nolan's filmmaking is the way the movie ""fits into the summer's conversation about The Big Important Issues that are preoccupying us, even when we're walking into darkened theaters and asking only to be entertained."" Set eight years after the events of 2008's ""The Dark Knight,"" the latest installment finds Bruce Wayne/Batman (played to applause by Christian Bale) in seclusion. Gotham City not blames the caped crusader for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent. There's even been a drop in crime in Gotham City -- that is, until Tom Hardy's masked sociopath Bane rips into Gotham, leaving terror and death in his wake. With aid from Anne Hathaway's Selina Kyle, who initially lures Bruce Wayne out of hiding with a burglary, Batman tracks down Bane only to find that it is going to take some doing to vanquish this villain. Gilchrist calls the film ""A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph,"" adding that the story ""is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself -- as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope."" Variety's Justin Chang notes that, ""All in all, the picture impressively conveys a seething vision of urban anxiety that speaks to such issues as the greed and complacency of the one percent, the criminal neglect of the poor and oppressed, and above all the unsettling sense that no one and nothing is safe."" HitFix's review from Drew McWeeny found that ""The Dark Knight Rises"" ""more than fulfills the promise made by the first two films."" ""We may never see superhero films quite like these again, and that's fine,"" the review continues. ""Whoever Warner Bros hires to reboot the 'Batman' films a few years from now, I wish you luck. The bar is as high as it could possibly be."" Agrees Time magazine's Richard Corliss, ""The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for. ... The movie may not top 'The Avengers' at the worldwide box office, but it is a far, far better thing -- maybe the best, most troubling, assured and enthralling of all the superhero movies.""","Early reviews for ""The Dark Knight Rises"" have arrived ahead of Friday's release .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The remaining plaintiff in the sexual battery lawsuit against John Travolta fired his lawyer, but the case could continue with another lawyer and another court, two lawyers told CNN on Thursday. Gloria Allred confirmed Thursday that the plaintiff known as John Doe #2 has hired her to represent him and possibly file a new legal action against the actor. ""We believe that the lawsuit should be filed in another court and, therefore, the lawsuit that was on file was dismissed without prejudice,"" she told CNN. ""We will be conferring with our client regarding what will happen next in this case."" Okorie Okorocha, the lawyer who initially filed the lawsuit in federal court last week, said his second client called him Thursday morning and said he was fired. He later learned Allred had been hired. The suit, which accused the actor of groping two male massage therapists at hotels in Los Angeles and Atlanta in January, is being dismissed Thursday by Okorocha. Travolta's lawyer, Martin Singer, has called the allegations by both men ""ridiculous."" John Doe #1, who said that Travolta sexually harassed him at the Beverly Hills Hotel, hired Allred on Tuesday, just hours after he withdrew from Okorocha's lawsuit. Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta. ""We are in the process of conferring with him regarding the next steps, which he may wish to take,"" Allred said. That dismissal was ""without prejudice, which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against John Travolta if he chooses,"" Allred said. There was no immediate reaction from Travolta's lawyer to the latest developments. John Doe #1 withdrew from the lawsuit after it was learned Travolta was in New York, not Los Angeles, on January 16, the day he had alleged the massage incident took place. Okorocha told CNN the date should have been January 15, but the mistake would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2 in court. He also said ""personality conflicts"" with John Doe #1 contributed to the decision. The lawyer insisted in a CNN interview Tuesday that he would ""mop up"" in the courtroom with the allegations made by John Doe #2. Despite losing both clients, Okorocha told CNN Thursday that he still believes they ""absolutely have cases"" against the actor. He accused Allred of stealing his clients, which she told CNN was ""completely false."" ""Mr. Okorocha's representations are false, outrageous and defamatory,"" Allred said Wednesday. ""John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 contacted my offices and neither I nor anyone in my law firm solicited either of these two clients. Both clients first called me and asked me to represent them."" Allred said after practicing law for 37 years, she does not solicit clients. ""Clients come to me,"" Allred said. ""John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 called me without my having any contact with them whatsoever prior to their phone calls."" She demanded that Okorocha retract ""his false statements."" ""I value my reputation and will defend it vigorously both publicly and in court,"" she said. Okorocha, reached by Wednesday afternoon, said he had a text message exchange on Tuesday with his client saying he was called by Allred. ""I get the case to national prominence and then someone who only does press conferences and sideshows, and doesn't actually go to court or do trials, just steps in and says, 'I'll take the clients,'"" Okorocha said. Okarocha predicted that Allred would quickly reach a settlement with Travolta that would include an agreement not to disclose its existence. ""I will find out what's in that settlement and I will get my equitable share of that settlement, because I did the majority of the work to get to where we are,"" he said. Okarocha said there are two more people he represents who may become plaintiffs. ""If Travolta doesn't take responsibility, I'm going to file those cases,"" he said.","NEW: Gloria Allred denies recruiting plaintiffs from Okorocha .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish court on Wednesday dismissed an allegation that one of the world's richest men, Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, raped a young woman on a yacht on the island of Ibiza in 2008. In its ruling, the Spanish court in Palma de Mallorca found there wasn't sufficient evidence to press charges. The prince has long maintained that he was innocent, that he hasn't been in Ibiza in more than a decade and that others have tried to impersonate him. The prince's legal team released a statement Wednesday saying the ruling vindicates the prince, but said the legal matter has nevertheless resulted in ""a grave injustice"" to him. ""These reports confirm what we have said all along, which is that the allegations against HRH Prince Alwaleed were not only false and outrageous but also impossible as His Royal Highness was not in Spain at the time but was in France with his wife, children, grandchildren and in the presence of dozens of witnesses, as the documentation shows,"" the legal team's statement said. ""This has been a grave injustice to His Royal Highness. For this, he has asked our Firm to study how to proceed in order to protect other innocent people from facing similar attacks and to make sure that those who have deliberately lied about HRH are held responsible for their actions,"" the statement said. In September, a Spanish court reopened the investigation into the rape allegation. The woman filed her complaint in Ibiza in August 2008, but a local judge shelved it in 2010, citing a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, according to court documents. The woman appealed to the next highest court, the Balearic Island Provisional Court, which ruled the lower court in Ibiza should reopen the investigation. According to court documents obtained by CNN, the victim argued in her appeal that the real reason the lower court tossed out the case was that the alleged perpetrator was a powerful member of the Saudi royal family. In September, the Saudi prince, a billionaire and the biggest foreign investor in companies such a News Corp., said in a statement that he was just learning of the accusation. ""These allegations are completely and utterly false,"" said the statement from his investment firm, Kingdom Holding Company. ""The alleged encounter simply never happened."" According to September's statement, the prince doesn't vacation in Spanish waters. But Max Turiel, one of the lawyers for the alleged victim, said last year there was evidence his team had wanted the court to examine further. According to the court documents, the woman believed her drink had been drugged. She sent a text message to a friend stating as much. She awoke on a yacht to find she was being sexually assaulted by a man she identified as Alwaleed, according to court documents. Turiel said ""there were remains of semen"" that should be examined against the prince's DNA, as well as ""remains of a tranquilizer that produced the symptoms she had."" The evidence came from tests carried out 30 hours after the alleged rape, the attorney said, so the alcohol was gone from her body, but not the drug or the DNA. In September, Turiel said the alleged victim's mother could answer questions from CNN, but only through e-mail. He provided responses to questions that he said were from the mother. CNN could not independently confirm the message was from the victim's mother. ""She wanted to reopen the case due to the huge injustice and a feeling of a helplessness; powerful people should not take undue advantage of it and have others subjected to them,"" the message said. The message described the ""man or men"" who allegedly abused the young woman as powerful individuals who threatened her onboard the yacht. Asked if her daughter was afraid to appeal the case, the mother said, ""Part of the fear has a lot of dignity and that can't be bought nor scared off with threats."" The young woman, a dual Spanish and German citizen, was 23 in September, the e-mail said. In December, a Spanish court heard new testimony from the woman. The prince and his lawyers were not present at the hearing. The woman, who has worked as a fashion model, entered the courthouse in Ibiza wearing a black hat and dark sunglasses to conceal her face from reporters outside, Turiel said. Her mother accompanied her. The two-hour, closed-door hearing included the woman, another one of her lawyers, the prosecutor and the magistrate in charge of the investigation. In a December statement, the prince's lawyer in Madrid said the prince was with his family in France in August 2008 on a visit that was well-documented by his passport, cell phone records and hotel receipts, as well as photographs, video and eyewitness accounts. But in her testimony in December, the woman maintained her accusation against the prince, said Turiel, despite what he termed tough questioning by the prosecutor seeking details of the alleged rape.","A woman of dual Spanish-German citizenship accuses Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal of rape .

"(CNN) -- Before the light, the dark. Ali Khousrof's training facilities are spartan. The building in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, where the 23-year-old judo fighter is preparing for the London 2012 Olympics is small and gloomy. Electricity is intermittent; the elements rarely kept at bay by the potholed roof. Poverty and poor training facilities are nothing new for thousands of athletes from the developing world preparing for the chance to realize their dreams of competing in an Olympic Games. But Khousrof, like many others in the Arab world, has had to overcome much more than just challenging training conditions. Last year he was shot in the abdomen whilst protesting against the rule of then President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down after hundreds of protestors were killed by his security forces. The bullet shattered inside him. He feared first that his Olympic dream, rather than his life, was over. But after specialist treatment, Khousrof has returned, and has thrived in preparation for the biggest moment of his sporting life. He is just one of hundreds of sportsmen and women who have battled to secure their place at the Olympic Games as revolution and war waged around them during the Arab Spring, toppling dictators from Tunis to Sana'a and giving them hope, for the first time, for a brighter future. ""These Olympics will happen while there will be a new president so it's a better feeling that gives a push to better represent our country,"" says Khousrof, who would protest every day against the rule of President Saleh until he was shot. ""I wish that our participation in the London Olympics be powerful and be competitive so we can represent Yemen in an honorable image."" After the Arab spring . For many athletes in the Arab world this will be the first time they represent their countries free from the tyranny of dictatorship. In the past, sporting glory produced conflicting emotions; on the one hand immense pride at flying the flag for their people; on the other revulsion that success would be exploited as a victory for the regime. Wajdi Bouallegue knows that better than most. The Tunisian gymnast will travel to London despite fearing that he would never represent his country again. In 2009 he was handed a lifetime ban for insulting the former president Zine al Abidine Ben Ali. ""I tore the picture of the president right here,"" he says in his gym, pointing behind to the wall. ""There's a big photo of him and I tore [it]. I have some problems with the federation and I see the big photo of Ben Ali... I tore it. And then they stopped me for one year and a half."" Bouallegue, considered one of the greatest Arab and African floor specialists of all time, had previously traveled to Athens for the 2004 Olympics. Back then he felt the heavy hand of the regime looking for success and reflected glory. ""Every champion in all sports had a pressure,"" he says. ""If you have an interview you must thank the old president and after you can speak about your performance. (You) must thank the regime before the interview. It's crazy but it's the reality."" The president's men . Eventually Bouallegue was asked back to the team, but only out of desperation when the sporting authorities realized they had no gymnasts for the 2010 Africa championships. He refused owing to them keeping the life ban on his coach, who is also his father. ""Now I think only of my flag, my country and I am happy that my father is always with me to make this performance, because I cannot image another coach but him."" It was in Tunisia that the Arab Spring began, and Bouallegue was soon drawn into the chaos, patrolling outside his building after joining a neighborhood militia. Just 28 days later Ben Ali was gone, exiled to Saudi Arabia after over two decades in power. Bouallegue could not believe it had happened so quickly, and that he was free once again to visit the gym, his gym, and dream of the Olympics once again. ""When we wake up, first day, my wife says to me...'he's really gone, this dictator?'"" he recalls. ""I say 'I don't believe.' Before we [were] even afraid to speak in your own home, to critic the regime. Maybe there is some cameras? Some phones to hear you?"" The Egyptian Usain Bolt . The Tunisian revolution quickly spread across the region -- to Libya, Bahrain, Syria and beyond. In Egypt a few weeks later, Amr Seoud received a message on Facebook telling him to get down to Tahrir Square. Seoud is the fastest man in Africa, a sprinter who will compete against Usain Bolt in the 100 meters sprint. He put his training to one side and left for what he thought was a small protest against the hated police. It was January 25 and he arrived at the biggest, and most crucial, protest of the revolution. It was to be the beginning of the end for president Hosni Mubarak. ""I was there from the first day,"" Seoud told CNN. ""I completely forgot about athletics at this time because the entire country is going crazy and there's no way to think about training or athletics... last year wasn't the greatest training year for us just because of the revolution."" Seoud's schedule was badly affected by the ensuing chaos. He still trained when he could on the track at Zamalek Island in Cairo but according to his U.S. based coach it wasn't enough. What little money there was from the Mubarak regime before -- peanuts given that the president would prefer to wrap himself around the success of Egypt's national soccer team -- fell to nothing afterward. Somehow the Egyptian authorities managed to find the money to send Seoud to Colorado for an intensive training camp. It is money that could be well spent.

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and as many as two dozen were injured Thursday when a commercial bus crashed into an overpass pillar on a southern Illinois interstate, authorities said. The Megabus coach line said there was one fatality, a woman, among the 81 ticketed passengers aboard its Chicago-to-St. Louis bus. The wreck happened on southbound Interstate 55 near Litchfield, about 55 miles northeast of St. Louis, the Illinois State Police told CNN. Illinois State Police identified the victim as 25-year-old Aditi Avhad of India. ""The thoughts and prayers of our entire staff go out to everyone involved, particularly the family of the person who has died,"" the company said in a statement. The injured were being taken to hospitals in Litchfield and nearby Staunton. Paula Endress, a spokeswoman for St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, said the 13 patients taken there had injuries ranging from minor to grave. And Susan Campbell, chief executive of Staunton's Community Memorial Hospital, said that facility had taken in three patients and expected as many as nine more. The bus driver was among the injured, but his injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, Megabus said.

"(CNN) -- Regulators are focusing on at least four of Europe's biggest banks as they investigate the attempted manipulation of the region's benchmark interest rate, suspecting that Barclays' traders were the ringleaders of a circle that included Crédit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Société Générale. Evidence of links between traders at all four banks and Barclays' former euroswaps trader Philippe Moryoussef is under scrutiny, people involved in the process have told the Financial Times. The news comes in the wake of the clear-out of senior management at Barclays, after the bank paid a £290m fine to settle probes in the US and UK into its involvement in the attempted manipulation of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and its European equivalent, Euribor. The furore over the attempts to rig lending benchmarks has led to calls from policy makers around the world for an overhaul of the system that underpins $500tn of contracts globally -- everything from arcane derivatives to standard home loans. In its settlement with Barclays, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, described an unnamed trader as having ""orchestrated an effort to align trading strategies among traders at multiple banks [...] in order to profit from their futures trading positions"". According to several people familiar with the matter that senior Barclays trader was Mr Moryoussef, who worked for Barclays from 2005 until 2007. His strategy was based on the fixing of three-month swaps pegged to Euribor -- the euro-based interbank lending rate set in Brussels by averaging 44 banks' submissions, regulators have said. According to an FT investigation, Mr Moryoussef is alleged to have contacted a number of traders whom he knew at other banks, either through previous employment or via professional or personal networks. Regulators are looking at suspected communication with Michael Zrihen at Crédit Agricole, Didier Sander at HSBC and Christian Bittar at Deutsche Bank, all of whom no longer work at the groups in question, according to people familiar with the investigations. At SocGen the identity of the traders in question remains unclear and the probe appears to be at an earlier stage. There were at least 20 requests from traders at rival banks to Barclays' Euribor submitters to lower or raise rates between 2006 and 2008, according to findings by the Financial Services Authority in its settlement with Barclays. It has been clear for some time that about 20 institutions have been drawn into regulators' sights over the affair. But until now, the details of how individual banks could be implicated has remained murky. There had been a broad assumption that most banks under investigation were suspected of manipulating Libor submissions in the financial crisis period running from 2007-9 to appear healthier than they really were, sometimes allegedly with the implicit nod from policy makers. However, the alleged involvement of traders at Crédit Agricole, HSBC, Deutsche and SocGen, predates the financial crisis by several years. Barclays' settlement with regulators made it clear that there were two distinct periods of attempted manipulation -- the first for trading gain, the second for broader reasons of financial stability. Sir Mervyn King, Bank of England governor, has sent a letter to other top central bankers inviting them to a September 9 meeting in Switzerland to discuss ""radical reforms"" to the Libor process. The invitees include the head of the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and other major central banks, according to a person familiar with the contents. Regulators' probes continue. But to date there has been no allegation of wrongdoing made by any authorities against any of the individuals or any bank beyond Barclays. All the banks declined to comment beyond previous statements confirming their co-operation with regulators over the broader investigation. The traders concerned either could not be reached or declined to comment.

"(CNN) -- Seven Transportation Security Administration employees at Philadelphia International Airport face losing their jobs after an eight-month internal investigation into an alleged bribery scandal, the agency announced Friday. The agency said it removed 10 employees from security duties last November pending the results of the investigation by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security. ""Since that time, three of the employees involved have resigned from TSA and seven others have been notified of TSA's proposed action to terminate their employment,"" the agency said in a release. According to the release, ""a training instructor responsible for administering annual proficiency exams was found to have accepted payment from TSA security officers to ensure passing grades."" The training instructor pleaded guilty in February to a charge of bribery, the agency said. ""Any employee who willfully violates TSA rules will be held accountable for their conduct and appropriately disciplined,"" said Chris McLaughlin, the agency's assistant administrator. This latest incident comes two weeks after 43 Transportation Security Administration workers in Florida were disciplined for not performing additional screening on random carry-on bags and passengers. Last month, after a series of breaches at Newark Airport, a Homeland Security inspector general report found the agency is failing to adequately report, track and fix security breaches at airports. The agency responded to those incidents with ""corrective action,"" according to the inspector general, but not all the problems received the same treatment. ""There's a TSA disaster every week, and the security meltdown gets more and more outrageous,"" said Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, in a release put out by his office on Friday. Mica, who has repeatedly called for privatizing Transportation Security Administration, said reforms ""can't come soon enough."" He added that hundreds of U.S. airports ""still operate under the Soviet-style all-federal screening model."" The Transportation Security Administration said that upon learning about the bribery allegations in Philadelphia, it notified the inspector general and worked closely with law enforcement during the investigation.","The TSA completes an eight-month investigation into bribery allegations .

"(CNN) -- A Thai politician accidentally shot and killed his former wife and personal secretary with a submachine gun in a restaurant in northern Thailand, local police said Monday. Senator Boonsong Kowawisarat was dining with Chanakarn Detkard and four others on Sunday when he took out an Uzi 9mm sub-machine gun, police said. ""Senator Boonsong's gun was accidentally fired off while he was trying to keep his pistol into its case. The shot went straight into his secretary who was having dinner,"" Police Lt. Colonel Choosak Pulsawat told CNN. The police officer said that Boonsong had been separated from his wife for a while but they were currently living together. He added that Boonsong had permission to own such a weapon. Police have initially charged Boonsong with causing death by negligence but he cannot be arrested while the Thai parliament is in session -- unless the parliament rules otherwise. The Bangkok Post said the charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a 20,000 baht fine (US$640). The newspaper said that Boonsong was so shocked by the shooting that he was unable to take Chanakarn to hospital. It is not clear why he was armed, why he took the weapon into the restaurant or whether he knew the gun was loaded. Boonsong is a senator from Mae Hong Song province, which borders Myanmar. The incident took place in Phrae province, also in northern Thailand. Gun ownership is common in rural Thailand but owners require a permit from the Ministry of the Interior.","Thai politician accidentally shoots former wife and secretary over dinner, police say .

"London (CNN) -- Barclays bank took out large UK newspaper ads Saturday to say sorry to ""all Barclays customers and clients"" in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal which has hammered its reputation. The public apology, printed in papers including the Financial Times and the Times of London and signed by outgoing chairman Marcus Agius, says the bank is ""truly sorry for what has happened and that you have been let down."" It continues: ""It is our actions now over the coming months and years that will make the difference. ""You are the lifeblood of our business, and we will not allow ourselves to be distracted from what really matters -- delivering for you, day in and day out."" Barclays is determined to put its customers ""at the heart of everything we do"" and must earn the right to retain their business, the statement concludes. Agius's resignation as chairman was announced 12 days ago, as the scandal over the rates at which banks lend each other money gathered pace. He will step down once a replacement is found. Following wide pressure, the bank's former chief executive, Bob Diamond, resigned a day later. The scandal involves a lending rate, known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers' Association. The BBA publishes Libor as a result of this. The Libor affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates. A report from the UK's Financial Services Authority concluded the rate-fixing scandal was of the ""utmost seriousness."" Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities. E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. Diamond has blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of ""a couple thousand."" During the credit crisis of 2007 and 2008, Barclays' high Libor postings came under scrutiny and the bank, concerned about ""unfounded negative perceptions,"" lowered its Libor submissions, according to Barclays notes to the Treasury Committee. A host of other banks, including Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and UBS, are being investigated by regulators. Lawsuits have been filed against the banks in the United States, and are being prepared in the UK.

"Parris Island, South Carolina (CNN) -- Charles Burns steadies himself, using the arms of his wheelchair, before pushing up into a standing position. His wife, Lisa, places a firm hand under his frail arm, helping him to his feet. Once upright, Charles places his hand across his heart as the band plays the national anthem at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, the training facility for all Marine recruits east of the Mississippi River. The former chief petty officer in the Navy, who served a one-year tour of duty as a crew member on patrols along the Mekong River Delta in South Vietnam during that war, had just one wish for Father's Day -- to watch his son, Ryan, graduate from Marine Corps boot camp. On Friday, his wish came true. ""I've done this trip a million times in my mind,"" he said. Vets: There is no shame in not being Superman . The 65-year-old Navy veteran is dying, making last week's feat bittersweet. But not even a series of strokes, diabetes and heart failure would stop him from making the 1,000-mile trek from Rockland, Massachusetts, to Parris Island, South Carolina, to see his boy. ""I promised him I wouldn't die unless he got out here with his uniform, in one piece, and that he earned it,"" he said. ""Outside of that, my commitment is just being a father. I'm happy it turned out the way it is."" With help from the Norwell Visiting Nurses Association and Hospice, and on-site medical assistance available from the Marines in case an issue arose, Charles was able to see his son's big day in person. ""Ryan,"" he said, pausing. ""He's an amazing kid. There isn't anything he's done, or will do, that he doesn't excel in."" Following a stroke in 1998, Charles' health forced him to retire from his post as a power lineman for Boston Edison, the electric company serving the Boston area. By the time Ryan enlisted in the Marines last fall, his father had already spent six months in the hospital in need of treatment for heart failure. That and diabetes rule him out for a heart transplant. He entered hospice care in September. Ryan left for boot camp in April. Charles smiles in pride as Ryan's Platoon 2053, Hotel Company, 2nd Recruit Training Battalion passes his front-row perch in the covered stands, while a weeping Lisa buries her face in a tear-soaked tissue. ""Every child, whether it's a boy or a girl, when they say they want to be a Marine, or want to be something other than just a civilian, that means a lot to me,"" he said. Scores of family members rush onto the concrete parade grounds after the ceremony concludes. Among the crowd is Charles, who is pushed by Lisa toward Ryan as he emerges from the crowd. ""There he is,"" yells Lisa. Ryan, dressed in full uniform, quick-steps toward his parents and throws his arms around his father. The two share a long, quiet embrace before Ryan hugs his crying mother. ""Amazing. Loving and fate-filled amazing,"" Lisa said about attending graduation. Military service is a Burns tradition. Charles joined the Navy following high school in 1965. Ryan's grandfather served in the Army during World War II. Ryan, now 20, was a fourth-grader when he first decided he wanted to join the military after watching the 9/11 attacks. Then, 12 weeks ago, he answered the call of duty when he left for boot camp. It's mission accomplished for Ryan, now an official U.S. Marine, and his terminally ill father. ""Me and my dad had a bet. When I came here to Parris Island, it was 'I'll finish boot camp as long as you make it to my graduation.' So we both had mission accomplished. And we're here today. So I couldn't ask for anything more,"" he said. Ryan said he doesn't know what keeps his father going, adding that he was humbled to have ""that much support"" from his family. ""He's definitely the strongest will-powered man I know. There's no fight he hasn't been able to overcome. He's never given up,"" Ryan said. ""He's my hero."" As for Charles, he draws strength from his wife and son, and is taking life one day at a time. ""Have a little pride in yourself. And stick to it, whatever it is. Don't let up, even if you fail. Tomorrow you can start again,"" he said. Justices dismiss law making lying about military honors a crime .","Charles Burns, 65, entered hospice care in September .

"(CNN) -- The Baghdad talks over Iran's nuclear program concluded inconclusively with a decision to continue negotiating in Moscow next month. How could they have ended otherwise? Too much suspicion, mistrust and too many complex issues to imagine an early breakthrough. At the same time, the uncertainties reflect something else too. Let me make a prediction. There will be no war with Iran in 2012 and no comprehensive deal on the nuclear issue either. Sanctions have forced the Iranians to alter the pace of its nuclear program but not to abandon it. Right now it's in everyone's interest to defuse tensions, and to paraphrase Winston Churchill, to jaw-jaw rather than wah-wah. Unless Iran is prepared to give up its quest for nukes (and it isn't), we've averted war but not eliminated the threat. Think 2013. For the past six months, the relationship between Iran and the West has been defined by covert war and much talk of an overt one. For the next six, the trope will be ""let's make a deal."" The reasons aren't hard to divine. First, sanctions are taking their toll and are on the verge of getting tougher. In early July, the Europeans will impose additional oil sanctions. Second, the position of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been strengthened as a result of parliamentary elections and mullah maneuvering. If he were inclined to show flexibility, the decider-in-chief is in a better position to do it now. And third, let's face it, nobody -- not the Iranians, the Europeans, the Obama administration, not even the Israelis, particularly if they have to do it alone -- wants a war. All of these factors have combined to create an opening for that almighty and much-revered diplomatic deus ex machina: the process. To be kind, that's just another word for describing how to manage a problem you can't resolve today. The desire to shift from talk of war to actual talk and negotiations is both logical and understandable. In fact, given the limited options right now, a process is much better than the alternative. The hope is that negotiations can create an opening for a small deal on the nuclear issue in which Iran would agree to enrich uranium at much reduced levels, agree to inspections and perhaps even export its stockpile of weapons-grade material out of the country in return for an easing of some of the less onerous sanctions. This incremental approach, tiny steps for tiny feet, would buy time and space to enhance confidence and create trust. It might even pave the way for broader discussions on other key issues that divide Iran and the West. Maybe even a grander bargain might follow. The only problem with this approach is that its chances of success are dubious. In coming weeks and months, the negotiating process may well produce limited understandings. But it's hard to see how these will turn into a sustainable deal that can convince the West, let alone the Israelis, that Iran has given up its quest for nukes. Three major realities will make it all the harder: . Iran wants a nuclear capacity. Outside of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, four nations possess nukes: Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea. All are fundamentally insecure and perceive nukes as a core advantage in their security and foreign policy theology. Iran is insecure, but it believes it is profoundly entitled. This mix of vulnerability and grandiosity is a bad combination. The Iranian regime wants the bomb, not primarily to have the option of attacking Israel, a possible fringe benefit, but as a hedge against regime change and as a prestige weapon in its quest for regional power and influence. Had the Shah not been turned out by the 1979 revolution, Iran would already have nukes. Iran fashions itself a great power, and great powers believe they need the ultimate weapon. Iran's nuclear program is too advanced, too entrenched, too redundant and too secretive to be stopped permanently, even by military attack. To do so, you'd need to change the regime. The U.S.-Iranian Cold War. The nuclear issue needs to be seen in the context of the broader dysfunction in the relationship between Washington and Tehran. Truth is, the regime is right. America wants an end to its repression and brutality, freedom for the Iranian people and Iran's regional ambitions curtailed. There's almost no issue on which Washington and Tehran agree, from support for Hamas and Hezbollah, to backing the Assads, to Iranian terrorism, to support for Shia insurgents, to Iraq and to Israel and the Palestinians. Given the level of suspicion and mistrust, the odds of finding a sustainable modus vivendi soon, particularly against the backdrop of the regime change issue, are slim to none. As long as the regime is convinced that America wants it replaced and Iran's regional ambitions muzzled, Iran will continue its quest for nukes. Indeed, the nuclear issue can't be separated from the issue of regime insecurity. It's emblematic of Iran's hopes and fears. Israeli hopes and fears factor centrally into the equation too. We wouldn't have the tough sanctions we do if it weren't for President Obama's and the Europeans' fear of an Israeli strike. Paradoxically, Obama fears an Israeli strike more than the mullahs do. On one hand, you might argue that the Israeli threats have increased the chances of a diplomatic resolution. That would be true, but only if Iran actually feared an Israeli attack or if it weren't determined to continue its quest for nukes. But the Iranian regime won't stop, and will inch closer to a breakout capacity to produce a weapon. And the Israelis will then have to decide whether to launch a military strike or bring enough pressure on the Obama administration to do so, even if it only means a setback of a year or two. Only one country can stop Iran from acquiring a military nuclear capacity -- that's Iran, should it judge the costs of acquisition too high. Now process, diplomacy and negotiations are king. But without some fundamental breakthrough in the talks or some other unpredictable event that changes Iranian calculations, we'll be drifting again toward war and the prospective disasters and calamities it will bring. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller predicts no war with Iran in 2012 .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Violence continued early Friday in mainly Catholic districts of Northern Ireland after protests began on Thursday, the main day of the annual Protestant marching season. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said ""at least 10 gunshots"" were fired at police lines in the nationalist Brompton Park area of Belfast's Ardoyne district at 12.30 a.m. Friday. Police said no-one had been wounded. Officers were also attacked with pipe bombs during the disorder, police said. Police said they were working with community representatives to restore order. Problems began Thursday in Ardoyne after a parade by the Orange Order. The march passed without a major incident, but there was tension between pro-Irish and pro-British groups as they staged rival demonstrations. Both sides hurled stones and other objects, police said. Officers were wounded in an attack from pro-Irish youths throwing petrol bombs, fireworks and bricks. The Police Service said the officers' injuries were ""not life-threatening."" More than 20 officers were injured, although none very seriously, police said. ""A large number of petrol bombs have been thrown at police. Two arrests have been made at this stage, although this number is expected to rise in the coming days as police continue with their evidence gathering operation,"" a police statement said. The police also said several vehicles were set on fire and pushed at police lines. Riot police used water cannon and plastic bullets to bring the crowd under control. Sporadic violence continued for several hours. Police also reported minor clashes in a Protestant district beside Catholic Ardoyne. British loyalists there threw bricks and bottles at police. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, the officer in charge of the policing operation in Belfast, condemned the attacks on police. ""I am angry we have this annual madness when it seems that people think the peacekeepers are a legitimate target,"" he said Friday. He added that a ""significant number"" of arrests would be made to ensure those involved in the violence ""are placed before the courts and answer for those actions."" In a statement Thursday he said police were ""dealing with significant disorder"" and urged calm in the area. There was also disorder in the Northern Ireland city of Londonderry, or Derry, as many residents call it. Police said petrol bombs were thrown at officers in the Bogside area, the scene of the Bloody Sunday killings by British soldiers in 1972. Vehicles were also set alight in Derry, and a public bus was hijacked and burned in Craigavon, County Armagh. Six men aged 18 to 34 have been charged with public order offenses during disturbances in Belfast on Wednesday night.","NEW: More than 20 officers hurt, two people arrested after an Orange Order parade in Belfast .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A retired gold medal-winning athlete in India is under pressure to prove she is female after her partner accused of deception and sexual assault, police said Friday. Runner Pinki Pramanik has been detained on charges of fraud and cheating after allegations by Anamika Acharya, a woman claiming to be her live-in partner, said Rajeev Kumar, the police commissioner of Bidhannagar in West Bengal State. Acharya has also accused Pramanik of being a man. If a medical examination establishes she is male, police could charge her with rape, Kumar said. Pramanik, who won gold at the 2006 Asian Games and a silver medal the same year at the Commonwealth Games, has denied the accusations and refused to undergo a gender test, Kumar said. Police have requested a court order to compel her to take the test. The maximum sentence in India for cheating and fraud is three years in prison; for rape, it is seven years in prison. CNN was unable to contact Pramanik or her representatives directly Friday. A senior official at the Athletics Federation of India said the sports organization had not received any complaint against Pramanik challenging her sexual identity. C.K. Valson, the secretary of the federation, said athletes are subject to gender verification tests only on the basis of formal complaints. During her career, Pramanik underwent drug tests that involved the submission of urine samples to female officials, Valson said. ""She participated in the Asian Games and other events as a woman,"" he said, noting that she is now retired. Pramanik's case has revived memories in India of another female runner, Santhi Soundarajan, who was stripped of her 2006 Asian Games silver medal after the results of a gender test. Soundarajan attempted suicide in 2007, survived and became a coach. In 2009, the gender of South African athlete Caster Semenya, then 18, became the focus of international news media attention after sporting officials said they would carry out tests. Semenya was given the all-clear to compete as a woman in 2010.","Police want runner Pinki Pramanik to take a gender test .

"(CNN) -- British sports fans who struck out twice trying to land Olympic tickets will get a third chance starting Friday. Only 20,000 people will be eligible to apply for the 900,000 seats on offer in the first 31 hours.

"(CNN) -- The throaty, thumping churn of the military helicopter convoy is a sound like no other. It's a common sound in Washington, but less so in the skies over Chicago. Barack Obama doesn't get back to his old town much these days. He did last week; he returned to Illinois for slightly more than 24 hours to celebrate his 49th birthday with some friends, to make a public appearance at an auto plant, to raise some money for upcoming campaigns. And as he arrived late on a wet and cloud-darkened afternoon, there was that baritone rumble of the line of helicopters, there were the Chicagoans looking up toward the president in Marine One, there were the streets closed to traffic in anticipation of his motorcade. Obama arouses in people such political passions, both positive and negative, that sometime it feels futile to discuss him without knowing that the conversation will veer inevitably into heated partisan territory. Yet there may be some usefulness -- especially for those of us not consumed by politics -- in stepping back, on an occasion like one of his rare returns to Illinois, to consider a lesson inherent in his rise: . Aim high. It seems pretty simple, after the fact. Obama is president of the United States. Of course he was ambitious; of course he set his sights high, in his successful 2004 campaign for the U.S. Senate and then in the 2008 campaign that took him to the White House. Today those decisions of his are, literally, history. But it is instructive to think of him not as the man in Marine One, but as the frustrated 41-year-old state legislator in Springfield, Illinois, in January of 2003. He had tried once for an office that would move him onto the national stage; in 2000 he had attempted a run for the United States House of Representatives. He was crushed by a margin of 2-to-1 in the Democratic primary. By 2003 he was back in Springfield, a face in the crowd. He was known to those who follow state politics closely, and to statehouse reporters, but Obama at the beginning of 2003 could have walked into most restaurants and stores in Chicago and not have turned a single head. There were two marquee political stars in the state: the glamorous new governor, Rod Blagojevich, who had just been sworn in for his first term, and the mayor of Chicago, Richard M. Daley, bearer of the most famous name in local government. What was Obama to do? Bide his time in Springfield, hoping to achieve increasingly more influential committee assignments? Eventually try once more for the U.S. House of Representatives, after the humiliating rejection in 2000? Put his ambitions for elective office away, and take up the private practice of law? We know what he did instead. Aim high. It doesn't always work; a person can aim high, and fall flat on his face. He can be mocked for even trying, especially when he comes up short. But as Marine One and its convoy thundered over the edge of where Lake Michigan touches the shore in Chicago last week, as the people on the streets looked skyward, a jury at the Everett M. Dirksen Federal Building a few blocks to the west had just completed another day of deliberations that will determine if Rod Blagojevich will remain a free citizen or will be sent to prison. When Obama, before climbing into the helicopter, had landed at O'Hare International Airport in Air Force One, Richard Daley was waiting patiently in the rain to stand in a receiving line and shake the president's hand. Things haven't been going particularly smoothly for Obama in recent months; his poll numbers are down, he seems under constant criticism from every direction, his missteps often appear on newspaper front pages and at the top of television newscasts. Why anyone wants the job that a president has is a question that rational people tend to ask themselves from time to time. Yet when we do take that step back from the frenzy of a given day, and consider the choices a person makes during the course of a lifetime -- the choices about whether to be satisfied with what you have, or to take that leap of faith and try for something beyond what the rest of the world thinks you can do. . . . I have a copy of a letter, a public document, that I have held onto since November 13, 2008, when it was written. It's very brief. It was addressed to Blagojevich, who on that day was still the governor of Illinois. ""Dear Mr. Governor: . ""I hereby resign effective November 16, 2008 from the United States Senate in order to prepare for my duties as President of the United States. ""Sincerely, . ""Barack Obama"" You ask yourself what must go through his mind, in his seat aboard Marine One, as he looks down at the city where he once lived, at the people who live there now, the people peering up toward the chopper convoy's roar. Impossible things can happen to a person. But first, a person has to try. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Barack Obama was a state legislator whose advancement was blocked in Illinois .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton flew to Afghanistan early Saturday as part of a 13-day trip that will tackle some of the thorniest U.S. foreign policy issues. Clinton was in Kabul on a previously unannounced visit and will meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. During the trip, the top U.S. diplomat also will meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders, visit Egypt, where tensions are rife between military and civilian leaders, and attend a conference of leading Asia-Pacific nations, the region of increasing strategic focus for the United States. In Paris, the first stop of the trip, Clinton attended a meeting Friday of the Friends of Syria, a group of more than 60 countries that aims to find a solution to the Syrian crisis. Clinton lambasted Russia and China on Friday for blocking efforts to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has lost a key general to defection. Clinton will travel to Tokyo to attend a conference Sunday about providing future financial support for reconstruction and development in war-torn Afghanistan. NATO-led troops have been fighting against Islamic militants in Afghanistan for more than 10 years, and the country still has a strong dependency on foreign aid. Poverty and corruption are widespread in Afghanistan, which came in 172nd out of 187 countries in the United Nations' 2011 Human Development Index, which ranks nations based on life expectancy, education and living standards. The conference in Tokyo will address Afghanistan's likely financial needs for the period starting in 2015, the time troops from the United States and other coalition members are expected to have withdrawn from the country. At the start of next week, Clinton will make stops in Mongolia, a resource-rich but economically underdeveloped neighbor of China and Russia; and Vietnam, which is locked in territorial dispute with Beijing over parts of the South China Sea. She also will visit Laos, a small communist-ruled nation in Southeast Asia that has not been visited by a U.S. secretary of state in 57 years. She will then spend the second half of next week in Cambodia, where senior officials from countries like China, Indonesia and Myanmar are attending meetings organized by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In Asia, the Obama administration has tried to find a balance between engaging with Beijing while seeking to contain its growing influence. Fostering stronger ties with China's neighbors is a crucial part of this approach. On July 14, Clinton will travel to Egypt to express support for the country's ""democratic transition and economic development,"" said Nuland, the state department spokeswoman. But it's a transition that some in Egypt fear may last indefinitely. Mohamed Morsi was sworn in Saturday as Egypt's first democratically-elected president, taking the helm of a deeply divided nation that is economically strapped and lacks a working government. His inauguration was overseen by Egypt's military rulers, who have been in control of the country since Hosni Mubarak was ousted last year during a popular revolution. The generals dissolved the Egyptian parliament last month after a high court ruled that it was unconstitutional. They also named a defense council to oversee national security and foreign policies. Morsi has suggested that control of legislative powers should return to civilian hands, and some of his supporters are pushing for a confrontation with the military rulers. Clinton will wrap up her trip with a visit to Israel, where she will meet the country's leadership to talk about ""peace efforts and a range of regional and bilateral issues of mutual concern."" High among those matters is likely to be Iran and its controversial nuclear program. Western powers are concerned that Iran is developing nuclear weapons even though Tehran insists the program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes. Israel has said it may attack Iran to halt the program. It has expressed skepticism that the mixture of sanctions and negotiations being pursued at the moment by the United States and European nations is deterring Tehran from pursuing nuclear weapons. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: Secretary of state arrives in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- As the nation enters the weekend marking the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, law enforcement authorities are deploying additional security measures and urging all Americans to be vigilant for suspicious activity. Much of the beefed-up security has been in the planning well before Thursday's announcement of a potential al Qaeda vehicle bomb plot against New York City or Washington, officials said. And some of the toughened measures won't be visible to the public, officials said. At the U.S. Capitol, Americans can expect to see ""visible strategic security enhancements"" such as more uniformed and undercover officers and more police cruisers, as well as deployments of bomb squads, Hazmat and SWAT teams, and K9 units, said Sgt. Kim Schneider of U.S. Capitol Police. Federal law officials will be sharing information and coordinating operations, Schneider said. For example, Capitol Police special agents are embedded in the intelligence community and assigned to the FBI, Secret Service and Department of Defense, Schneider said. The efforts are designed ""to present a visible deterrent to our adversaries and detect those who may present a threat"" as well as ""to respond to incidents in our jurisdiction or take protective measures in response to an incident occurring elsewhere in the National Capital region or anywhere around the nation,"" Schneider told CNN in an e-mail. ""People on the Capitol Grounds or in the area of the U.S. Capitol may notice a more visible presence in addition to the multiple layers of security that are not visible to the public,"" Schneider said. Many additional security measures were stepped up Friday in the wake of U.S. intelligence gathering about an al Qaeda-organized vehicle bomb being detonated in New York City or Washington on the 10th anniversary, which falls Sunday, authorities said. In New York City, officers were stopping and searching trucks as they approached the George Washington Bridge, which links New Jersey with New York City, as well as the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Holland Tunnel and the Verrazano Bridge, linking Staten Island and Brooklyn. Police also manned checkpoints throughout Manhattan where they examined vehicles, particularly vans and trucks, for possible bombs. In Washington, where increased police activity began after Labor Day, members of Congress, their staff and visitors were being urged Friday to continue their vigilance for anything suspicious, authorities said. ""Remember, 'if you see something, say something!'"" said Wilson Livingood, the U.S. House sergeant-at-arms. The al Qaeda threat has yet to be corroborated, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. National security officials have ""been running a process for four months, anticipating the need to be extra vigilant, to take extra precautions around this anniversary, the 9/11 anniversary, because, as you would expect, al Qaeda, while it lost its leader when we brought justice to Osama bin Laden, remains a threat to Americans, remains interested in attacking the United States and Americans, and we have to be vigilant against that threat,"" Carney said. Vice President Joe Biden urged all Americans to be wary this weekend. ""Continue your life as normal. Be vigilant. Be vigilant,"" Biden said on NBC's ""Today"" show Friday. ""Report anything that looks suspicious to you. And you know, we went through this before in a different circumstance with the car bomb (attempt) in Times Square (in 2010). There are people who are likely to try over the next period of months and years, but the point is that we are using every single asset we can, including local law enforcement, to help thwart the possibility it could happen."" Some intensified security measures will be out of the public eye, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. ""Our security posture includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, and we will continue to respond appropriately to protect the American people from an evolving threat picture both in the coming days and beyond,"" she said in a statement. In Washington's subway system, police were conducting random baggage tests Friday as commuters came down the escalator -- measures that were previously planned and weren't a result of the potential al Qaeda threat, said Michael Taborn, the transit system's police chief. Dog teams patrolled platforms, and an officer with a flashlight examined tracks after trains passed. Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray said Friday the city is ""redoubling"" its security efforts in the wake of the unconfirmed al Qaeda threats, with officers working 12-hour shifts and operating under a restricted-leave policy. ""We take these threats seriously -- as we do all threats to our city -- and citizens should know we are taking all the appropriate steps to ensure their safety,"" Gray said in a statement. CNN's Mike Ahlers, Ted Barrett, Sarah Chaffin, Paul Courson and Jay McMichael contributed to this report.","All Americans need to be vigilant to suspicious activity, officials say .

"(EW.com) -- ""Sparkle"" is a movie for anyone who thought that the pop melodrama of ""Dreamgirls"" wasn't over-the-top enough. Set in the late '60s, it tells the story of three sisters from middle-class Detroit who form a girl group sort of like the Supremes. They're astoundingly talented, they want to be famous, and at one point they get their shot at a major deal with Columbia Records. But all sorts of things keep getting in the way, like an abusive, coke-sniffing celebrity boyfriend — what happens to him will leave your jaw on the floor — and, more than that, their oppressively uptight church-lady mother, played with teasing confidence and force by Whitney Houston in her final screen role. The movie is a remake of the 1976 ersatz-Supremes Hollywood fable that starred Irene Cara, and the earlier film's setting — the late '50s and early '60s — made sense. Transplanting the material ahead nearly a decade, to the era of race riots and black power (when the classic Motown sound was, in fact, already starting to fade), hurts the movie's credibility, since it is now all the harder to believe that three feisty grown women are still living in their puritanical mother's house because they're too cowed to go out on their own. From its opening scene, set inside a hopping Detroit nightclub, Sparkle is charged with a synthetically corny high tension. (Cee Lo Green shows up in that scene, and does a fine job of playing a conk-haired funk-soul relic who loves the ladies, but then he completely vanishes from the movie.) The three sisters are each cut from a very different cloth. The quietly ambitious Sparkle, a brilliant songwriter, is played by the sixth-season American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, who proves to be a lot like Irene Cara — that is, she's pretty in a slightly pained way and wholesomely sincere to the point of being a bit boring. The whippersnapper Dolores (Tika Sumpter) mostly stays in the background, except when she explodes in moments of vengeful high dudgeon. And then there's the sister known, literally, as Sister, who's the star of the group and is played by the ravishingly sexy and accomplished British actress Carmen Ejogo. In this role, she looks and acts strikingly like a demon-driven, down-and-dirty Beyoncé, and her scenes with Mike Epps, as her charismatic but hateful comedian lover, are the most potent in the film. The truth is that whenever Sister is on screen, we're a little unsure why the movie is named after anyone else. Sparkle uses some of the same imitation-Motown numbers by Curtis Mayfield that powered the 1976 version, along with new songs by R. Kelly. The music is all highly competent and, frankly, just unmemorable enough to make you wish that you were hearing authentic period chestnuts instead. The trouble with Sparkle isn't that it's overwrought (that's what's sometimes fun about it). It's that everything in the movie is derivative and third-hand: a copy of a copy. The film is pulp that's been fed through a strainer, with bits and pieces squeezed out of a dozen other, better movies (""What's Love Got to Do With It"", ""Lady Sings the Blues,"" and ""Dreamgirls,"" to name just a few). At times, it's like a Joan Crawford neurotic-mother fantasy, and the gravelly conviction of Whitney Houston's performance proves that this could have been the first step not merely in a comeback but in a major re-invention. She had the instincts of a superb character actress. At other times, the movie is a girl-group biopic that never quite delivers the charge of success that we're longing to see. Jordin Sparks' big, climactic on-stage number is supposed to do that, but to me it's just a testament to the way that too many ""Idol"" graduates, with their how-many-notes-can-I-cram-inside-a-note technical bravura, short-circuit any true connection with the audience. ""Sparkle"" is never more than an overheated mediocrity. The one thing it isn't, however, is dull. Grade: B- . See full story at EW.com.

"New York (CNN) -- Ted Turner, the 72-year-old media mogul turned environmentalist and philanthropist, has decided that nuclear power may not be the answer to the world's energy woes, but it's still better than coal. ""I'd rather have nuclear power than coal,"" he told an audience at the 92nd Street Y in New York City on the first day of the U.N. General Assembly meeting. ""One will kill you for sure, and the other might. I'll take 'might' over 'sure.' "" Still, last March's nuclear disaster at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant soured him on the technology as a replacement for coal and a cure for climate change, he said. Agency OKs building of a nuclear power plant in Alabama . That's because nuclear power is costly and dangerous, he said. ""You've got the problem of what to do with the spent fuel, and nobody wants it. So it's being stored all over the world."" Those storage places include a number of locations that could prove dangerous, since they tend to be near power plants, and the plants tend to be located near population centers, he said. Turner is an investor in alternative-energy projects, the largest of which is a 250-acre solar array in Cimarron, New Mexico, that powers 9,000 homes, he said. His partner in the project is Southern Co., the largest utility in the South and the biggest customer of coal, which he derided for increasing the incidence of asthma. But alternative energies still have a long way to go, he acknowledged. The next big challenge akin to creating the interstate highway system will be to create the technology to move the power created by wind and solar energy to where it is needed, he said. ""We need a whole new digital transmission across the country,"" he said. But the Obama administration is not in a position to help much, he said. ""Health care was so divisive and controversial and complicated that it completely polarized the government, and we've had basically a lockup situation since then where very little has occurred,"" he said. Turner called for more resources worldwide to be invested in projects like health care and funding for the United Nations, to which he himself pledged $1 billion to create the U.N. Foundation. He critiqued the U.S. media for what he described as a narrow vision that does not include much international news. ""I need to know what's going on in the whole world,"" he said. ""That's why I think the U.N. is so important; that we have a place where we can get organized and deal with problems -- overfishing, pollution of the atmosphere, deforestation, global climate change, refugees, world hunger. Those are things that one country cannot solve by itself, not even the United States."" Turner said he keeps abreast of world events by reading The Economist magazine, a British publication, on the Internet. Asked about the future of print, he said, ""Gone. Long gone. It was great. Like coal and oil, they served us well."" But that doesn't mean there is no future for paper. ""What would we do without toilet paper?"" he said to laughter. ""We still need that."" Turner said he depends on his sense of humor to ""make it through"" and credited his ability to make friends for the success of CNN, which he founded in 1980 but no longer is involved in. ""I studied history and it looked to me like the people who did the best in life were the ones who made the most friends,"" he said. ""The ones who made the most enemies did not do well. That's what happens when you bomb people. You don't make people like you when you bomb people."" When he was at the helm of CNN, everyone in the world was a potential customer, so he went out of his way to make friends with the likes of former Cuban President Fidel Castro and ""the godless Communists in Russia and China,"" he said. ""The next thing you know, they were friends."" Rather than sending troops abroad, the United States should consider trying to make friends by sending doctors and engineers instead, he said. ""People don't terrorize people who are their sponsor."" Turner said he would like to see the world cut military expenditures over 10 years by 10% per year, which would give countries enough time to find things for the current crop of military personnel to do and save enough money to ""eliminate poverty and solve most human problems."" War has come close to bankrupting the nation, and there is no reason for it, he said. ""It made good sense back in the Middle Ages, when there was nothing else to do. We didn't have TV and there was no NFL, no Olympics. The only thing to do to keep from being bored to tears was to go out and fight."" But ""We've got other things to do now,"" he said, citing the sex aid Viagra as one of them, then adding, ""That's what I mean about a sense of humor."" Turner refused to offer advice to those in his audience searching for the key to success. But, reflecting on the 2001 AOL merger that resulted in his losing some 90% of his money, he said, ""Being poor and then rich and facing the prospect of being poor again is not a very pleasant prospect. Rich is better. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. It's nice to be able to afford dessert."" Turner predicted his point of view on the environment would prevail over those of ""Republicans and tea party people who don't believe in global warming -- we're just going to outwork them and outlast them."" After his speech, he told a reporter that he likes President Barack Obama, but thinks he has ""a tough job."" Asked how he thinks Obama is handling that job, Turner said, ""It's hard to be critical of the way someone is doing a job you don't want yourself.""","Environmentalist says nuclear power is costly, dangerous .
But alternative energy not ready for prime time yet, he says .
U.S. government not in strong position to help, Turner says .

"(CNN) -- Philadelphia police arrested Carlos Figueroa-Fagot after he turned himself in to authorities who believe he is the man who tried to snatch a 10-year-old girl in Philadelphia, authorities said Thursday . The 33-year-old suspect gave himself up Wednesday evening after police released surveillance video showing the attack. ""This case demonstrates the power of getting information out,"" Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter told reporters. Figueroa-Fagot was charged with a series of felony and misdemeanor charges, including attempted kidnapping, unlawful restraint, indecent assault and other counts. Authorities say the suspect has a prior criminal record in Puerto Rico that stems from between 2000 and 2006. Last year, he also faced allegations of sexual assault from a family member in Philadelphia, police said. That case, however, was withdrawn without prosecution earlier this month. Neither Figueroa-Fagot nor his attorney could be immediately be reached for comment. The incident sparked an outcry that reached the top levels of city government, with Nutter announcing a $10,000 reward for the capture of the perpetrator, who tried to snatch the girl while she was walking home from a store with her 2-year-old brother on Tuesday. Police Captain John Darby said the girl immediately struggled against her attacker, but credits the screams of her little brother with thwarting her abduction. The boy ""literally screams louder than anything she's ever heard before,"" Darby told reporters Thursday. The surveillance video was released Wednesday on the Philadelphia Police Department's YouTube page. Video shows Georgia girl, 7, fighting off alleged kidnapper . It shows a white car pulling up to the corner of Porter and Lee streets while the girl and her brother are walking home. As the children make a left onto Lee Street, a male gets out of the car and follows the children. The video then switches to Lee Street as the suspect walks up behind the girl and grabs her, pulling her away from her little brother, whose hand she was holding. The girl falls to the ground moments after she is grabbed and the suspect then lets go and runs away, fleeing in the white car. Authorities say the man also put his hand over the girl's mouth, though that is unclear in the video. Neighbors told CNN affiliate KYW they are grateful the little girl is OK, but were worried for children in the neighborhood while the man was on the loose. ""It's scary. It's making people nervous, making people think that they can't bring their kids outside, you know, and let them play outside by themselves, and that's not right,"" neighbor Kathleen McDowell told KYW. Police also announced Thursday that the department's Special Victims Unit made four unrelated arrests on rape and conspiracy charges related to the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl on Monday at a Philadelphia recreation center. Authorities said they are looking for a fifth man and that they know his identity. More from CNN Justice: . Feds raid City Hall of New Jersey capital .

"New York (CNN) -- At least a dozen employees of the New York Police Department were reprimanded following an investigation into comments deemed racist that were posted online about the city's West Indian Day Parade, the NYPD reported Thursday. The comments were posted on a Facebook group page last year called ""No More West Indian Detail,"" which has since been removed. The page was used by those protesting NYPD security at the West Indian Day Parade to vent their frustrations. The parade is an annual event in Brooklyn that celebrates West Indian history and culture, but has been a scene of violence in recent years. Some posts referred to the event as ""the unemployment parade,"" likening marchers to ""animals."" The NYPD has not identified which posts of the hundred-plus comments were made by its employees. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly started an investigation into the comments in December 2011. Last year, two NYPD officers were injured by gunfire near the parade, while marchers accused police of using excessive force.

"(CNN) -- An aspiring Colorado sports reporter and the others killed or wounded in a mass shooting at a movie theater in suburban Denver should be the focus of the public's attention, rather than the suspected killer, her brother said. ""The more air time these victims have the less time that man has his two seconds on television,"" Jordan Ghawi told CNN's ""AC360"" on Friday night. Jordan Ghawi traveled to Aurora, where his sister, Jessica, was killed. He called the suspected gunman a ""coward."" The young woman in her mid-20s -- who barely missed a deadly Toronto shooting last month -- was among 12 patrons killed, according to police. Their father, Nick, who had asked her brother to head out to Colorado to ""confirm what's happened,"" could not be reached for comment. Gunman turns movie into real-life 'horror film' Jessica Ghawi had been at an Aurora multiplex to catch a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" the latest installment of the Batman series, when a gunman burst in and began shooting. A journalist and blogger in her mid-20s who also went by the name Jessica Redfield, she had tweeted about the movie not long before the attack. ""Movie doesn't start for 20 minutes,"" she wrote in her last message. Ghawi's mother, Sandy Phillips, said she will miss communicating with her daughter. ""I'll never have her to hug again, or get a text message again or get a funny Facebook picture,"" Phillips told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio, Texas, where her daughter grew up. ""That's the hard part right now ... knowing those are things I'm never going to experience again."" Phillips told KSAT her daughter was excited the two would soon spend some time together. ""She had a huge heart,"" Phillips said. ""Cared deeply for other people."" Theater security stepped up nationwide . Ghawi's friend and fellow movie-goer Brent Lowek also was shot during the attack but later emerged from surgery at a medical facility, according to friends and relatives. ""It looks like he's going to be OK,"" his stepfather, Dan Greene, told CNN. By Friday morning, a Denver radio station where Ghawi had once interned posted on Facebook that she had been killed. ""Sending thoughts, prayers and love to my friend Jessica and her family,"" 104.3 The Fan posted. ""She is one of the victims who died in the theater shooting."" Baby among victims treated . Her brother wrote on his blog earlier Friday that relatives had informed him that his sister was among the victims of Friday's shooting, taking two rounds, including one to the head. ""At approximately 0215 CST, I received an hysterical, and almost unintelligible, phone call from my mother stating that my sister, Jessica Ghawi, had been shot while attending the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Denver, CO,"" he wrote. Later Friday, Jordan Ghawi wrote, ""essentially, she died quickly and painlessly. Now we will begin the process of bringing her home to celebrate her life."" Shooting suspect was a doctoral student . Benjamin Hochman, a reporter for The Denver Post, described his friend Ghawi as an effervescent young woman, brimming with energy and a love of hockey that she sought to channel into the competitive world of sports reporting. ""I woke up this morning and saw that people had been texting me to make sure I was OK,"" said Hochman, who then checked Facebook and saw postings about Ghawi. He'd written her a letter of recommendation just a few months earlier, and the two had become fast friends. ""I thought the world of her,"" he said. Jordan Ghawi told CNN his sister was working hard to succeed in sports journalism. ""She left everything she knew in San Antonio to come out here to pursue that dream,"" he said . Shooting unfolds in real time on social media . In June, Ghawi was visiting Toronto with her boyfriend, a minor league hockey player, when they narrowly escaped a deadly shooting in the city's main downtown mall. Peter Burns, a friend of Ghawi's, said that attack seemed to heighten her zest for life, pointing to reflections she later posted on her blog. ""I can't get this odd feeling out of my chest,"" Ghawi wrote in a June 5 post. ""This empty, almost sickening feeling won't go away. I noticed this feeling when I was in the Eaton Center in Toronto just seconds before someone opened fire in the food court. An odd feeling which led me to go outside and unknowingly out of harm's way. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around how a weird feeling saved me from being in the middle of a deadly shooting."" She added that ""gun crimes are fairly common where I grew up in Texas, but I never imagined I'd experience a violent crime first hand."" ""I was shown how fragile life was on Saturday. I saw the terror on bystanders' faces. I saw the victims of a senseless crime. I saw lives change,"" she wrote of the June shooting. ""I was reminded that we don't know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or where we will breathe our last breath."" U.S. service members among casualties . Ghawi further reflected, saying the incident reminded her that ""every moment we have to live our life is a blessing."" ""So often I have found myself taking it for granted. Every hug from a family member. Every laugh we share with friends. Even the times of solitude are all blessings. Every second of every day is a gift. After Saturday evening, I know I truly understand how blessed I am for each second I am given.""

"Burgas, Bulgaria (CNN) -- Investigators in Bulgaria are working around the clock to identify the man suspected of killing five Israeli tourists and their bus driver in an airport suicide bombing, the country's interior minister told reporters Friday. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov said police were trying to piece together the movements of the suspect, who was carrying a fake Michigan driver's license. Investigators are also working to analyze the bomb, believed to have been located in a backpack placed Wednesday on the bus in a parking lot outside Burgas International Airport, Tsvetanov said. Israel has said it suspects Iran or an Islamist militant group such as Hezbollah is behind the attack, a claim that has added to tension between Israel and Tehran. Iran, which has condemned the attack, has rejected Israel's claims. The bodies of the five Israelis arrived Friday morning in Israel, said ZAKA, the volunteer emergency search-and-rescue organization that had gone to Bulgaria to recover them. The coffins, loaded onto a military plane at Burgas airport, were greeted with a ceremony on arrival at Ben Gurion airport outside Tel Aviv. Israeli Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov said at the service: ""This is a cruel, deliberate and well-orchestrated wave of terror. Its aim is to target Jews and Israelis, to take down human lives, to kill the freedom."" Among the victims was Kochava Shriki, who was on the bus with her husband and had learned that morning that she was pregnant, CNN affiliate Channel 10 reported. Childhood friends Maor Harush and Elior Priess also died, as did Itzik Kolongi and Amir Menashe, two men who were on holiday with their wives. As Israelis grieved Friday, Bulgaria continued the hunt for clues as to who was responsible. ""At the moment, we are focused on finding the identity of the suicide bomber, and of course from the moment of the blast every single minute and every single hour of his being on the territory of Bulgaria,"" Tsvetanov said in a news conference broadcast on Bulgarian National TV. Explosion amid growing Iranian-Israeli tensions . The suspect was a foreigner who entered the country with fake identification documents and had been in Bulgaria for at least four days, he said. Experts believe the attack was planned for the precise moment and place that it happened, he said, and they are certain from DNA analysis of body parts found at the scene that the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. But Tsvetanov said he was not excluding the possibility that a second person might have been involved. Bulgarian authorities are working with their Israeli counterparts and international organizations like Interpol and Europol to identify the suspect, Tsvetanov said. Authorities still don't know from where the suicide bomber came, where he stayed or what he did, Tsvetanov said. A witness has said the suspect tried to rent a car from him but didn't have a proper driver's license, so was turned away, the minister said. FBI officials have said the man's Michigan license was fake. See latest photos of the explosion scene . Security footage aired by Bulgarian National TV shows the suspect, -- a white man with long hair and wearing khaki shorts, a baseball cap and sneakers -- looking relaxed as he walks among other travelers, carrying a backpack and a smaller bag. In addition to the fatalities, the bombing wounded more than 30 Israeli tourists, some seriously. Israel's military flew 36 of the wounded back Thursday to Tel Aviv, where they were taken to Israeli hospitals. The airport bus targeted by the attacker was to have taken about 47 passengers to a beach resort. Bulgaria, whose Black Sea resorts are a popular destination for Israelis, has not speculated on who may have been responsible for the attack. Bulgaria received nearly 8.4 million visitors in 2010, the last year for which U.N. World Tourism Organization figures are available. The vast majority of the country's visitors that year, more than 8 million, came from Europe. About 25,000 visitors came from the Middle East. U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov by phone on Friday. He condemned the ""barbaric attack,"" gave his condolences and offered support for the investigation. Bulgarian officials have sought to reassure those worried by what is an unusual attack in the nation, saying security has been boosted wherever needed. Read Netanyahu's statement here . Burgas airport has reopened and is functioning normally, Tsvetanov said, but access was restricted to passengers. In a televised statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that the attack was ""perpetrated by Hezbollah, Iran's leading terrorist proxy,"" as part of a global campaign that has reached a dozen countries on five continents. But he offered no evidence. Israel's U.S. Embassy said Wednesday that it had no proof that Iran was the instigator of the attack. Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said Friday that the attack ""does bear the hallmarks of Hezbollah."" He refused to elaborate. Netanyahu said Hezbollah and Iran have been trying to foment terrorism in countries that include Kenya, India and Cyprus, as well as in the United States, where an Iranian is accused of trying to kill the Saudi diplomat. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said Israel was engaging in ""baseless accusations against other countries in order to distract the attention of the international community from its terrorist activities being carried out throughout the world,"" according to a statement from the state-run IRNA news agency. The Iranian Embassy in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia said earlier that Israeli suggestions that Tehran was involved in the attack were ""unsubstantiated"" and that the assertion was politically motivated.

"(CNN) -- After years and years of over-the-top stories attesting to the character, honor, integrity and moral fiber of the late Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno, we now know, after reading the 267-page Penn State internal report on child predator Jerry Sandusky, that Paterno was nothing more than a narcissistic, arrogant coward. The report by former FBI director Louis Freeh details the shameful conduct of top officials at Penn State, including Paterno, who cared more about negative publicity than young boys being scarred for life. ""The most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized,"" the report concluded. Imagine that. For 14 years they were silent and complicit in Sandusky's sexual abuse. For 14 years Paterno, President Graham Spanier, Athletic Director Tim Curley and Vice President Gary Schultz could have picked up the phone to call the cops and tell what they knew about Sandusky sexually assaulting young boys. But they didn't. All they cared about was negative attention and how it might reflect on the program and the university. Please, don't bother with the petty justifications, rationalizations and calls to look forward instead of back. How can any man or woman, Penn State alum or not, stomach even hearing Paterno's name or seeing his face after reading how he played an integral role in covering up the vile and evil sexual misdeeds of his former defensive coordinator? Opinion: After Penn State scandal, time to look at Second Mile . Paterno was treated like a saint in Happy Valley; in some quarters, he was a little ""g"" god. He was the man above reproach. He had more power than any other official on campus; possibly in the state. He's famous for saying he stayed in coaching because had he left, ""it would leave college football in the hands of the Jackie Sherrills and Barry Switzers,"" two coaches known for their winning ways, and for breaking NCAA rules along the way. But Paterno didn't break NCAA rules in covering up for his buddy Sandusky, and allowing the coach a clear field to wreak havoc on the lives of numerous young men. What Paterno did break was the moral code that every man and woman should abide by. Paterno family's statement on Freeh report . If Penn State officials or Pennsylvania politicians had any guts, they would strip the university bare of anything adorned with the name Joe Paterno. What his teams accomplished on the field is impressive, but no one can turn a blind eye to the failed leadership he exhibited off the field. And as The New York Times detailed in a story Saturday, Paterno clearly sensed his reign coming to an end and decided to selfishly cash out. He lied repeatedly about his knowledge of Sandusky's sexual attacks, and did all he could to milk millions out of Penn State. I hope the families of the victims go after his estate for every penny and more. Opinion: The end of JoePa University . By leaving his name on buildings and his statue up, decades from now people will hail his work on the field and not think about the devastation he allowed to happen off the field. If sports fans nationwide could heap scorn on Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens for allegedly taking steroids, then a special place in sports hell should be reserved for Paterno. Football is nothing more than a game. But Sandusky raping young boys is a matter of life and death, of innocence lost. In the aftermath of Sandusky's arrest, Paterno was treated as a victim, a man who was caught up in something he wasn't aware of. Now we know that was a lie. Freeh produced the documents showing Paterno, his family and his legion of supporters lied in order to protect Paterno's name. All he cared about was breaking the all-time record set by Grambling State head coach Eddie Robinson. Paterno, and the other Penn State lackeys, had to know that turning Sandusky in could prevent ""JoePa"" from breaking that record. So they all stayed silent, and all the while young boys suffered in their own silence. When it's time to name the great coaches of college football, Robinson, Bear Bryant, Amos Alonzo Stagg and Knute Rockne will certainly be mentioned. Prior to the Freeh report, Paterno would have been on that list. But his actions in the Sandusky affair destroyed everything he accomplished in his career. Great coaches make the tough calls. When Paterno failed to make the toughest call of his life -- to the police to turn in his longtime friend -- he did more than cost his team a victory. Young boys lost something they can never recover. That's what cowards do, and Joe Paterno was a coward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Penn State report reveals Joe Paterno as a coward .
He says coach's silence on Sandusky sex abuse to protect reputation makes him complicit .

"(CNN) -- Motorsport's governing body the FIA has told Red Bull to modify the floor of its controversial Formula One car ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix. Australian Mark Webber drove the RB8 to victory at last month's Monaco Grand Prix, but rival teams questioned the legality of a hole in the car's floor located in front of the rear tire. FIA rules dictate the floor of an F1 car must be ""continuous, rigid (no degree of freedom in relation to the body/chassis unit)"" and ""impervious."" It has now taken the step of issuing a note to teams in order to reinforce the laws of the sport, with two-time constructors' champions Red Bull set to make the appropriate modifications. Red Bull's RB8 causes a stir . ""Red Bull are expected to revise the much-talked-about 'holes' in their car's rear floor ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix,"" read a statement on the sport's official website. ""Other teams had interpreted the rules to mean only floor slots are allowed and the FIA has now made clear that it will consider enclosed holes illegal from the Montreal race onwards."" Webber and two-time world champion teammate Sebastian Vettel are tied for second in the drivers' standings, with Red Bull also leading the constructors' championship after six races. The hole in the RB8's floor was initially approved by FIA scrutineers, and the Austrian-owned marque have been running with their current setup since April's Bahrain Grand Prix.","The FIA tells Red Bull to change the hotly-disputed floor of the team's car .

"(CNN) -- Five children, ages 2 to 13, died when an SUV they were riding in blew a tire and crashed on a Texas highway, police said. A dozen people were packed into the 2003 GMC Envoy on Monday, on the way to a family outing at Splash Kingdom water park in Canton, Texas, according to Trooper Jean Dark of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Driver Federico Acuna lost control when the right rear tire exploded on Interstate 20 just outside Canton in Van Zandt County on Monday afternoon, Dark said. Acuna apparently overcorrected and the vehicle flipped, she said. None of the children who died was wearing a seat belt, Dark said. While no charges have been filed against Acuna, who was wearing his seat belt and wasn't injured, there is the potential for five charges of criminally negligent homicide, Dark said. Two-year-old Judith Jaimes and 13-year-old Rosvaelia Jaimes were pronounced dead at the scene. Saideth Acuna, 6, Omar Jaimes, 7, and Ulisa Acuna, 3, died at hospitals, Dark said.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan Pastor Maldonaldo was fastest in a rain hit second practice session at the German grand prix. In Friday's dryer first session, McLaren's Jenson Button led teammate Lewis Hamilton at the top of the time sheets. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher had a day to forget at Hockenheim, crashing his Mercedes into a wall in the final few minutes of the second session. The German driver, known for his ability to handle wet track conditions, had been going well at his home race. ""The way I ended the second session was obviously not part of the plan,"" Schumacher told the official website. ""I simply slid off track because I lost a little concentration, we were talking on the radio and I was altering some settings at the same time. ""Overall the session went ok. I think that qualifying will probably be wet tomorrow, so today's weather was useful in that respect."" The Mercedes team suffered a miserable end to the day as it was confirmed that Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg will start five places back from his qualifying position as punishment for replacing his gearbox. Defending World Champion Sebastien Vettel enjoyed a much improved second session. The German moved from twelfth in the morning to third in the afternoon. ""We just got used to the conditions, as there may be rain tomorrow and also on Sunday. The forecast isn't looking great,"" he told the Formula 1 website. Vettel's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber described the conditions as ""unreal"", as he endured a mixed day. ""We didn't expect the rain to be this bad today, but it was quite heavy at times - we even used the extreme full wet tire,"" the Australian, who won the previous grand prix at Silverstone, told the official website. ""That's two races in a row now with tricky conditions."" Current championship leader Fernando Alonso was happy with the way his car handled the conditions. The Ferrari driver, who has won two races this season declared himself ""pleased with how things went."" ""The car behaved well in all conditions, which is always a good thing and we were also able to see how the various types of tire worked."" McLaren unveiled a number of upgrades to their car as they attempt to rescue a disappointing season. Former world champions Button and Hamilton rewarded their team's efforts with a good first practice session. ""The men and women back at the factory did an incredible job to get all the upgrades to the track this weekend. It's definitely a step forward,"" Hamilton told the official website. ""The car doesn't feel bad at all. It's tough in the wet out there, like driving around on an ice rink, but I feel positive that we can do something good this weekend."" Button echoed Hamilton's comments, as he declared to the official website that the team can be happy with the new parts, ""most of them worked correctly - so it's nice to see the improvement. I want to say a big 'well done' to the guys at the factory."" The weather forecast suggests the track will be damp for qualifying tomorrow, with similar conditions likely for the race on Sunday.","Maldonado and Button fastest in two practice sessions .

"(CNN) -- The owner of the South African mine where 34 people died in a clash with police said Tuesday that it will not discipline workers who fail to return this week, reversing an ultimatum to return to duty or face being fired. The announcement came a day after a government committee looking into humanitarian aspects of the tragedy told company leaders that such threats were not ""in the national interest."" Meanwhile, South Africa's minister of police told a special session of Parliament on Tuesday that authorities had done everything in their power to avoid last week's fatal clash with miners. ""The events of Thursday, 16 August 2012, were not sudden eruption but a culmination of events that were building over months and months,"" Minister of Police Nathi Mthethwa said, according to a transcript issued by the government. ""The South African Police Service is saddened by the events that unfolded on that fateful day. The police did all in their power to avert such a situation."" Thursday's violence stemmed from what government officials have referred to as a wildcat strike involving 3,000 rock drillers at Lonmin PLC's platinum mine in Marikana. The miners, who earn $300 to $500 a month, want their salaries raised to $1,500 a month. Lonmin, the world's third-largest producer of platinum, rejected the increase and called the strike illegal. The violence at the mine is thought to have been sparked by a rivalry between two unions that wield significant power and influence in South Africa. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. Thursday's shootings came after negotiations between strikers and the company broke down and police decided to fence in machete-armed protesters with barbed wire, according to police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. The protesters moved toward police and were driven back with tear gas and rubber bullets, Phiyega said. Officers resorted to live ammunition when protesters attacked, Phiyega said. Police gunfire killed 34 people and wounded 78. Police also arrested 259 people on charges including malicious damage to property, armed robbery, illegal gathering and possession of weapons. The violence followed a week of rising tensions. At least 10 people had died in the days preceding the shootings, including two police officers who were hacked to death. The mine has reopened, and about a third of the 28,000 workers had reported for duty by Tuesday, according to Lonmin. While most of the company's work force and contractors are not on strike, many have been unable to return to work because of violence at the site, Lonmin said. On Sunday, Lonmin issued a statement warning workers to return to work by Monday or face the possibility of losing their jobs. While Tuesday's announcement dropped the threat, the company said it was encouraging the nearly 19,000 workers who have yet to return to their jobs to do so. ""The interests of employees, the wider economy and the company are best served by a return to work,"" the company said. ""We are working alongside the unions as they also want their members to report for work,"" the company said. The situation Tuesday was calm, government and mine officials said. Police officials had described the mood Monday as ""stable but tense."" ""Given the traumatic events of the last 10 days this is a delicate process and it will take time for people to come to terms with what has happened,"" Lonmin said in its statement. ""Nothing is being done to risk the continued calm on the ground. Safety and public order are the priorities of everyone involved in this process."" A heavy police presence remains at the mine, the company said. During Tuesday's special parliamentary session, Minister of Mineral Resources Susan Shabangu told lawmakers the tragedy has thrown the country into turmoil similar to its struggles against apartheid decades ago. ""The tragic events at Lonmin's Marikana mine that reverberated in every corner of our country shame us all. They drive us on to make amends, to review in utmost depth the happenings in our sector, to check any further outbreaks -- indeed, to ensure that these things never, ever happen again,"" she said. ""The events should refocus the collective might of our nation on answers not recriminations, on rationality not rhetoric. We should refuse to be cowed into a state of mind where we accept the notion -- popular in certain circles abroad -- that we are nothing but a country at war with itself,"" Shabangu said. A memorial service has been scheduled for Thursday at the spot where miners and police clashed, the state-run South African Government News Agency reported Tuesday. ""We felt the memorial service should be held there as part of cleansing the place,"" the agency quoted Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Richard Baloyi as saying. ""The tragedy that happened is not easy for the people of Marikana and the country as a whole.""","Owner of South African mine says it won't fire workers who fail to show up .

"(CNN) -- Canadian aviation company Bombardier is taking a ""major bet"" on the notoriously cut-throat passenger plane market, spending around $3.5 billion to compete with well-established rivals Boeing and Airbus, its chief executive Guy Hachey says. The money will be invested in Bombardier's new C Series aircraft, which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers. Bombardier faces obstacles, including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis, which has hit the aviation industry hard. But the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been ""under-served"" by the major players, Hachey said. Watch: How to buy planes . ""So far, we've been serving customers up to about 100 seats, more in the regional segment. Now we're cracking into more of the mainline segment. We're investing about $3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment,"" he told CNN. ""If you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $10 billion on the rail side and $10 billion in aerospace. But it is a major bet for the corporation."" Cutting edge design . Hachey said Bombardier's competitive edge lies in the design of its planes. Until now, this market had largely been served by the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. However these smaller versions of planes -- called ""shrinks"" --- were also much heavier. The other option was Brazilian company Embraer's E-195 -- known as a ""stretch"" -- but it cannot fly as far in one go. In comparison, Hachey said Bombardier's C Series will deliver an ""optimized product"" built specifically for the 100 to 150-seat market. On its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient, yet provide a ""best-in-class, wide-body cabin environment."" Taking on the major players . Bombardier's ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high, given the long history of Airbus and Boeing in these markets. Founded in 1942, Bombardier is a relatively new kid on the aviation block. The company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer. Its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people, with an annual turnover of Â£8.6 billion. According to Hachey, the company now has the scale to take such challenges. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit . Hachey is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150-seat segment over the next 20 years. So far Bombardier has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft. Hachey, who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes, said: ""We feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards, so we are very happy with our position."" Beyond Europe . As European markets continue to take a battering, Hachey says Bombardier will be expanding its focus elsewhere. In the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries, with a renewed push in the U.S. ""In Europe typically things have been slower than usual, and this is a fortress market for us. We've been very strong in Europe so we are feeling the impact of the economic uncertainty,"" Hachey noted. Watch: Airlines brace for economic impact . ""The good thing is the rest of the world is not necessarily in the same shape. If you look at emerging countries we've been doing very well,"" he said. ""We're focusing elsewhere. The U.S. has also been picking up which is a very, very important market for us.""

"(Financial Times) -- Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff has launched a R$133bn ($65.6bn) stimulus package to spur investment in the country's creaking infrastructure and shore up ailing investor confidence in the world's second-largest emerging market economy. In the first of what are expected to be a series of announcements in the coming weeks, Ms Rousseff said the government would sell concessions in nine highways and 12 railways before moving onto other areas of infrastructure. ""We are starting with railways and roads but obviously we will take care of airports, ports and waterways,"" Ms Rousseff told a gathering of politicians and leading businessmen in BrasÃ­lia. Brazil's economy has slowed to a crawl over the past 12 months as inadequate infrastructure including roads and ports and a shortage of skilled labour has raised costs and stifled industry. The economy expanded 7.5 per cent in 2010, the fastest pace in more than two decades, but last year slowed to 2.7 per cent and this year is expected to grow 2 per cent or less. Among the initiatives, the government will sell rights for private companies to operate 7,500km of roads and 10,000km of railways. The measures would double the capacity of the country's main highways, transport minister Paulo Passos said at the event. Of the total investment, R$79.5bn would be spent within five years and the remainder over 25 years. Funding would be largely at favourable terms from the state development bank, BNDES. Bret Rosen, senior credit strategist for Latin America at Standard Chartered, said the move was a step in the right direction, with infrastructure bottlenecks posing one of the biggest obstacles to faster growth in Brazil. But he added: ""The easy thing is making the announcements, the harder thing is execution, and the track record not just of Brazil but of Latin American countries in general is pretty poor on infrastructure."" The cost of exporting a container from Brazil is more than double that of China and 1.5 times that of India while the country's ports are notorious for delays. But other analysts hailed it as the start of a new era for Brazil. ""With a government willing to make politically difficult decisions ... this downturn may end up being a boon for Brazil in its quest for global economic status,"" Stratfor, the political intelligence agency, said. The centre-left coalition government led by Ms Rousseff's Workers' party has traditionally been opposed to privatizations. But she has proven pragmatic in the face of infrastructure bottlenecks. Earlier this year, her government awarded projects to redevelop and operate three major airports to private sector-led consortia in a bid to speed up preparations for the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics two years later. ""Since last Sunday, we have been an 'Olympic country',"" Ms Rousseff said on Wednesday. ""We are in a countdown to the games in 2016."" Economists warned, however, that the infrastructure measures announced on Wednesday would have little short-term impact on the economy. ""This is a plus for the long-term but it doesn't improve the growth prospects in the short-term,"" said David Beker, Brazil economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff has launched a R$133bn ($65.6bn) stimulus package .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City shrugged off a penalty miss, an injury to striker Sergio Aguero and falling 2-1 behind in the second half, to register a thrilling 3-2 opening win over Southampton Sunday in their defense of the English Premier League title. Samir Nasri scored the clinching goal with 10 minutes left at the Etihad Stadium to end the bold challenge of the newly promoted visitors, who had threatened a victory of their own. ""We deserved to win the game. They didn't have any chances in the first half and we had four or five incredible chances,"" City manager Roberto Mancini told AFP. ""We made some mistakes but the big problem was we missed chances when it was 1-0 and then it changed. ""The first two or three games could be like this because we are not 100 percent."" Argentina star Aguero scored the crucial injury time winner against Queens Park Rangers in the final game of last season as City edged out arch-rivals Manchester United, but he lasted just 11 minutes before being stretchered off. He was caught awkwardly by a challenge from Nathaniel Clyne and twisted his knee to be replaced by Edin Dzeko. In the 18th minute, City won a penalty as Carlos Tevez was pulled down by Jos Hooiveld, but Spain World Cup star David Silva saw his weak effort saved by Kelvin Davis. It was left to Tevez to make the breakthrough just before the break as beat the offside trap to fire past Davis. Any idea City would ease to victory were quickly dispelled in the second half as Southampton substitutes Rickie Lambert and Steven Davis were on target in quick succession to put their side 2-1 ahead. But Dzeko leveled it at 2-2 after being set up by Yaya Toure and Nasri clinched three points for the champions after latching on to a loose ball in the penalty area. Earlier, Belgium's Eden Hazard made a fine debut for Chelsea as the Champions League winners beat Wigan 2-0 at the DW Stadium. Hazard, a big money signing by Chelsea from Lille in the close season, set Branislav Ivanovic on his way to score an early opener. Only two minutes were on the clock and Wigan, who narrowly avoided the drop last season, were soon 2-0 down after Hazard was pulled down for a penalty. Frank Lampard slotted home the spot kick and Robert Di Matteo's men were already on their way to a winning start. Victor Moses, a reported target for Chelsea, troubled the visitors as they defended their lead, but they held on for the three points.","Manchester City beat Southampton 3-2 in their EPL season opener .

"(CNN) -- A book company said Wednesday that it will release on September 11 a firsthand account of the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Christine Ball, director of marketing and publicity for Dutton, a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA, said the book was written by a Navy SEAL under a pen name. Although CNN has confirmed the name of the SEAL, the network agreed not to publish his identity at the request of Pentagon officials who said the information might lead to other SEALs on the raid being identified through social media links. After The Associated Press and Fox News reported the SEAL's name online Thursday, many other websites, including The New York Times and USA Today, published his identity. The book is entitled ""No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama bin Laden."" The former Navy SEAL was on the Bin Laden raid, according to Pentagon officials. The 36-year-old chief petty officer left the Navy as a highly-decorated commando in April, but he could be subject to criminal prosecution, they said. His military awards include five Bronze Stars with a special combat designation and a Purple Heart. He led others under fire at least seven times, Pentagon officials said. The book account includes the stealth helicopter crash that could have killed the author and his teammates, his publisher said. U.S. Special Operations Command has not reviewed the book or approved it, a Defense Department official said. Officials only recently became aware the former SEAL was writing a book but were told it encompasses more than just the raid and includes vignettes from training and other missions. They would like to see a copy, the official said, to make sure no classified information is released or the book contains any information that might out one of the team members. Officials have been told that some of the profits are going to charity. Former Special Forces officers slam Obama over leaks on bin Laden killing . About two dozen U.S. Special Operations members and two helicopters were involved in the raid early May 2, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. The raid occurred in a span of 38 minutes, after CIA reports of repeated sightings of a tall man doing ""prison yard walks"" around the yard of the housing compound in Abbottabad, which was under constant surveillance, an official said on condition of anonymity a few days after the raid. U.S. authorities did not definitively determine beforehand that the man was bin Laden, but they eventually concluded that there was enough evidence to go through with the operation. One helicopter made a hard landing when it apparently came too close to a wall. It landed inside the western side of the compound with its tail rotor over the southern wall. The first man killed in the mission -- which the U.S. official said was code-named Operation Neptune Spear -- was the Kuwaiti courier who had worked for bin Laden. He was shot dead after a brief gunfight in a guest house. From that point on, it is believed no other shots were fired at the U.S. forces, the official said -- which contrasts with early U.S. government reports describing the operation as a ""firefight."" The troops then moved into the compound's three-story main building, where they shot and killed the courier's brother. As they went upstairs and around barricades, one of bin Laden's sons rushed at them and was killed. Neither of these men had weapons either on them or nearby, the official said. The U.S. official said that the team then entered the third-floor room where bin Laden was, along with his Yemeni wife and several young children. The al Qaeda leader was moving, possibly toward one of the weapons that were in the room, when he was shot, first in the chest and then in the head. He never had a gun in hand but posed an imminent threat, according to the U.S. official. Bin Laden's body was flown to the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, then in the North Arabian Sea. After DNA tests and further confirmations of his identity, he was buried at sea within 12 hours of his killing ""in conformance with Islamic precepts and practices,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said. President Obama met with some of the Navy SEALs, often referred to as SEAL Team Six and officially as the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Opinion: Are 'Swift Boat' attacks on Obama bogus? The U.S. raid, which was conducted without the knowledge of Pakistan, enraged the Pakistani public and embarrassed its military. Three months later, 15 members of Seal Team Six were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal are working on a movie about the raid. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is about the decade-long hunt for bin Laden. Bigelow and Boal are the team behind the 2008 Oscar-winning film ""The Hurt Locker."" The new movie was said to be set for release just before the election, but after Republicans complained that it was a pro-Obama ad, it was pushed back until December. There is some dispute over whether it was ever meant for release before December. The movie has been the focus of a Washington partisan fight since last summer. The Pentagon's inspector general began an inquiry after questions were raised by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. He demanded investigations by the Department of Defense and CIA inspectors general into what, if any, classified information about Special Operations tactics, techniques and procedures were leaked to the filmmakers, calling the film a ""potentially dangerous collaboration"" between liberal filmmakers and the administration. Some of what those investigations found did show collaboration between the administration and the filmmakers, but Defense Department and White House officials have said it's no different than what they give many filmmakers and news reporters on a regular basis.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- There's no doubt that Iran's election will be a major test for incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But many Iranian women hope the results will also shake the current status of women in the Islamic republic. Zahra Rahnavard, wife of Iranian candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, has taken a visible role in the campaign. ""Thirty-four million women demand to have female Cabinet ministers; 34 million women demand to be eligible to run for president,"" Zahra Rahnavard, wife of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Thirty-four million women want the civil law to be revised; 34 million women want the family law revised."" Whether her husband wins or loses Friday, Rahnavard has broken barriers for women just by appearing on the campaign trail with her husband, a rarity for political wives in Iran. ""We look at her, and we say, 'We want to be like her in the future,' "" said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, an Iranian woman who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium along with nearly 12,000 others to hear Rahnavard speak in March. Rahnavard is a mother of three, as well as an accomplished artist and academic. She has been compared to first ladies in the United States, including Michelle Obama, for her visible role in her husband's quest for the presidency. ""I am here to say that men and women are equal,"" Rahnavard said. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins. ""We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it,"" she said. Iranian women remain second-class citizens in criminal matters, divorce, child custody and inheritance cases, despite making up 65 percent of university students. Ahmadinejad's fundamentalist government has tried to make it easier for men to take more than one wife while restricting public sector careers for women. This year, for the first time, the Guardian Council announced that a woman could legally be among the final candidate list. Out of the 42 women who registered, however, none was ultimately allowed to stand. Even Zahra Eshraghi, granddaughter of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was banned from running for parliament as a reformist. ""For Ahmadinejad's government, women are just living things,"" Eshraghi said. ""A woman is there to fill her husband's stomach and raise children.""  Watch one analyst talk about women in Ahmadinejad's Iran » . Moussavi is not the only candidate calling for a stronger role for women in Iran. Mehdi Karroubi, the only cleric in the presidential race, has promised to campaign for women's rights. Hard-line conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie also said he would have female ministers if he wins the election. Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplayed Rahnavard's impact on the outcome of Friday's election. He said she may win over reformists and women, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates. iReport.com: Iranians rally in large numbers . ""If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him,"" Marandi said. But try selling that to Rahnavard's enthusiastic supporters. ""This is the first time after the revolution we see a lady behind the president,"" Farhad Mahmoudi said. ""And this is why we're so happy, because we can have a first lady.""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia banker who went missing last month is being sought by federal authorities for allegedly embezzling millions of dollars from a south Georgia bank. Aubrey ""Lee"" Price, 46, is charged with wire fraud, and is suspected of defrauding more than 100 investors of at least $17 million over the course of two years, a criminal complaint from the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York, said. In late 2010, Price was celebrated by his peers and written up in newspaper articles after a company he controlled bought a controlling portion of the troubled Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey, Georgia. He was supposed to invest the bank's capital. Instead, prosecutors say Price used a New York-based ""clearing firm"" -- a dummy company set up to hide money -- to cover up fraudulent wire transfers and investments. Montgomery Bank & Trust in Ailey -- about 170 miles southeast of Atlanta -- had been in operation for nearly 90 years when it was closed Friday by the state of Georgia, with the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named as receiver. The FDIC said Ameris Bank in Moultrie, Georgia, would take over operations of Montgomery's accounts and its two branches. Price disappeared about two weeks ago after telling his friends he had lost ""a large sum of money through his trading activities,"" the complaint said. The complaint quoted a letter purportedly written by Price in June to acquaintances and business associates. Price indicated he planned to commit suicide off the Florida coast by ""jumping off a ferry boat,"" the complaint said. But federal investigators, including the FBI, believe Price, who owns property in Venezuela and Guatemala, may be on the run. FBI Special Agent Michael Howard said in the complaint that investigators believe Price ""may own a boat that would be large enough to travel to Venezuela from Florida."" Price was last seen in Key West, Florida, in mid-June, and ""despite a recent search by the (U.S.) Coast Guard, Price's body has not been recovered,"" the complaint said. Prosecutors say airline records indicate Price had returned to the United States from a trip to Venezuela on June 2. ""Certainly we are receiving any information that arrives locally, but any updates or comments would have to come from the U.S. attorney's office in New York,"" Stephen Emmett with the FBI Atlanta Field Office told CNN on Sunday. There was no one available for comment in the New York U.S. attorney's office Sunday. If tried and convicted, Price could face up to 30 years in prison.","Aubrey ""Lee"" Price is suspected of defrauding more than 100 investors of at least $17 million .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Tennessee Valley Authority is liable for a coal ash spill in eastern Tennessee in which a massive mixture of toxic ash and water blanketed approximately 300 acres. ""... had TVA followed its own mandatory policies, procedures, and practices, the subsurface issues underlying the failure of North Dike would have been investigated, addressed, and potentially remedied before the catastrophic failure of December 22, 2008,"" U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Varlan wrote in his 130-page decision. Plaintiffs have three weeks to file briefs recommending how the court should proceed in the next phase -- in which they must show they are entitled to relief. From the archives: Months after ash spill, Tennessee town still choking . In a statement, TVA said its ""commitment has not wavered -- to clean up the spill, protect the public health and safety, restore the area, and, where justified, fairly compensate people who were directly impacted."" It added, ""TVA remains committed to the full restoration of the community directly impacted by the spill, while being mindful of our responsibility to manage ratepayer dollars."" TVA said it has bought more than 180 properties, settled more than 200 other claims from area residents and gave $43 million to the Roane County Economic Development Foundation. It predicted the recovery project will continue through 2015. The spill began before dawn when the walls of a dam holding back more than 1 billion gallons of coal ash waste stored in a retention pond at TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant, 35 miles west of Knoxville, trembled and crumbled. The mixture of water and ash, enough to fill nearly 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools, fouled the adjacent Emory River. There were no deaths, but three homes were destroyed and about a dozen others damaged. The spill contained toxic materials such as arsenic, selenium, lead, chromium and barium. But the TVA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency have reported that air and drinking water in the area were safe and that the levels of toxic substances did not exceed federal standards. Thursday's decision was followed closely by nearby residents. ""I'm absolutely thrilled,"" said Sarah McCoin, who lives on the banks of the Emory River, about a mile from where the spill occurred. ""It's just a huge accomplishment for our community and for other communities much like ours that are sitting in coal ash zones."" The ruling not only sets a precedent, she said, ""it also allows people to hope that what happened to us will never happen to them."" McCoin, 56, said property values have sunk for the 40-acre farm that has been in her family for generations. ""Would you spend your money to live here?"" she asked. ""No. Nobody would."" The possibility of long-term health effects remains a concern from the disaster, she said. ""It's infiltrated so much of our lives you start to become numb to it: The water's not good, don't swim in the river, don't eat the fish, if you fall overboard, hurry up and get back on your kayak."" In 2010, Tennessee state officials slapped the TVA with $11.5 million in fines after the state's Department of Environment and Conservation determined that the authority had violated state clean-water and solid waste disposal laws. The TVA itself agreed to pay $40 million for economic development projects in Kingston in 2009 as part of a larger fund set up for cleanup efforts.","Judge says TVA failed to follow its own mandatory policies, procedures and practices .

"(CNN) -- Former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno may have played a greater role than previously known in a decision made by university officials not to report a 2001 incident involving former coach Jerry Sandusky and a boy in a locker room shower, according to e-mails written by university officials. CNN does not have the e-mails, but the alleged contents were made available to CNN. A jury last month convicted Sandusky, 68, the Nittany Lions' former defensive coordinator, on multiple charges of sexual abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years. At Sandusky's trial, former Penn State graduate assistant Mike McQueary testified he believed he saw sexual contact between Sandusky and a boy in the shower and told Paterno in February 2001. Disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for Penn State officials . Paterno, a revered Penn State icon who died in January, testified before a grand jury that when he learned about the situation, he contacted his then-boss, athletic director Tim Curley, as required and left it up to the university to investigate. In court documents, prosecutors state they have e-mails from university officials that allegedly contradict grand jury testimony of Curley and Penn State vice president Gary Schultz, who oversaw campus police. The alleged e-mails, the contents of which were first reported by CNN, were among other documents, including a Sandusky file, discovered by Penn State and turned over to state prosecutors as part of ongoing investigations, according to both Penn State and prosecutors. One of the newly revealed alleged e-mails appears to show Paterno had another, previously undisclosed conversation with Curley about the shower incident. On February 26, Penn State's vice president told Curley, the athletic director, to contact Sandusky, alert child welfare authorities and inform Second Mile, the charity Sandusky founded for disadvantaged children, a purported e-mail says. After Curley spoke with Paterno, however, the athletic director allegedly told the school president that he had changed his mind about the best course to pursue. ""After giving it more thought and talking it over with Joe yesterday -- I am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps,"" he purportedly wrote the following day. Instead of alerting authorities, Curley allegedly wrote, he would prefer meeting with Sandusky, telling him they knew about another incident in 1998, and offering him professional help. He suggests notifying the Second Mile ""at some point"" if Sandusky is cooperative, and ""maybe"" child welfare officials. If Sandusky did not cooperate, Curley suggested notifying both Second Mile and child welfare. How the case unfolded . How much the purported conversations between Paterno and Curley influenced the decision not to contact outside agencies, something Penn State was required to do under state law, is unclear. An internal Penn State investigation headed by former FBI Director Louis Freeh also has turned up billing records from Penn State officials to the university's outside council around the time of the 2001 incident showing Penn State was ""researching its legal obligations"" for reporting the assault, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The results of Freeh's investigation are expected before the end of the summer. Asked whether Penn State had any comment on the alleged e-mails, school spokesman David La Torre said the university and board of trustees are ""reserving comment"" until after Freeh's report is released. Wick Sollers, a lawyer for the Paterno family, issued a statement following CNN's disclosure of the purported e-mails. ""Some number of e-mail exchanges between former Penn State officials have apparently been leaked to the media. Since the Paterno family is not in possession of these e-mails, it would be inappropriate to comment on their supposed content,"" the statement said. ""To be clear, the e-mails in question did not originate with Joe Paterno or go to him as he never personally utilized e-mail."" Sollers noted that Paterno, ""from the beginning ... warned against a rush to judgment in this case. Coach Paterno testified truthfully, to the best of his recollection, in the one brief appearance he made before the grand jury. As he testified, when informed of an incident involving Jerry Sandusky in 2001, Coach Paterno followed university procedures and promptly and fully informed his superiors. He believed the matter would be thoroughly and professionally investigated and he did not interfere with or attempt to compromise any investigation."" Monday, Sollers released another statement, calling on Freeh and the Pennsylvania attorney general to release all e-mails and records they have related to the case. The ""selective"" leaking of e-mails ""is not intended to inform the discussion but to smear former Penn State officials, including Joe Paterno,"" said Sollers. ""The public should not have to try and piece together a story from a few records that have been selected in a calculated way to manipulate public opinion. Joe Paterno didn't fear the truth, he sought the truth. His guidance to his family and his advisors was to pursue the full truth. This is the course we have followed for 9 months. It is the course we will follow to the end,"" he said. Painful chapter closes with Sandusky's conviction . Paterno testified to the grand jury that McQueary was ""very upset"" when relating the incident and told him that he saw Sandusky ""doing something with a youngster. It was a sexual nature,"" according to a transcript. Paterno said he told Curley. Attorneys for Schultz and Curley issued a statement on their behalf. ""For Curley, Schultz, Spanier and Paterno, the responsible and 'humane' thing to do was, like Governor (Tom) Corbett, to carefully and responsibly assess the best way to handle vague, but troubling allegations,"" the attorneys said in a statement to CNN on Friday. ""Faced with tough situations, good people try to do their best to make the right decisions."" Paterno and Spanier were ousted from their jobs after the Sandusky scandal broke in November. When Paterno was fired, the university's board of trustees questioned his leadership for not doing more. Schultz had retired in 2009. Paterno family spokesman Dan McGinn told CNN the coach's final guidance to him before Paterno died was ""to seek the truth"" and due process for everyone involved. Calls to Spanier's lawyer have not been returned. Curley and Schultz have pleaded not guilty to charges of perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse. It's not known when the Pennsylvania attorney general's office will complete its ongoing investigation of what Penn State knew about the 2001 incident and how it was handled.

"(CNN) -- When Bryan Clay was growing up, it seemed very unlikely he would one day assume the mantle of ""the greatest athlete in the world."" The reigning Olympic decathlon champion spent his troubled teenage years in Hawaii ""getting into fights"" and it was only the intervention of his mother which set him on the path to eventual golden glory. If he earns a place in the U.S. team for London 2012, the 32-year-old will hope to become the first man to win medals in the grueling 10-event discipline at three successive Olympics, having claimed silver in Athens in 2004. Assuming he comes through the trials, which start on Friday, Clay will be one of the favorites for gold in the British capital in August. His Beijing triumph followed in the footsteps of other American decathlon greats, the first being the legendary Jim Thorpe, who won gold at Stockholm in 1912. Thorpe was presented with his medal by King Gustav V of Sweden, who announced he was the ""greatest athlete in the world"" -- a tag which has stuck for all subsequent winners of track and field's toughest test, which is competed over two days. More recently, Bruce Jenner's 1976 triumph in Montreal gained him massive exposure in the U.S. while Dan O'Brien took the title on home soil in 1996 in Atlanta to great acclaim. Jenner once famously said: ""The decathlon is a big, high brick wall which nobody is able to climb. Nobody ever beats the decathlon."" He cashed in on his success, building up a business fortune, and has most recently has been seen in the reality TV series ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" -- he is the stepfather of the four children. By contrast, devout Christian Clay leads a quiet family life, largely away from the media spotlight, dedicating himself to training at the university in California where he also spent his college years. ""I have my faith that's first, my family that's second and my track comes third,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero Series. Troubled early years . It was not always so. ""I wasn't a good kid growing up. I was getting into fights. I was a very misguided youth,"" Clay said. Born in Texas to a Japanese mother and an African American father, he spent much of his childhood and teenage years in Hawaii. His parents later divorced but his mother remained a strong influence on his life, steering him away from team sports where his early lack of discipline would have seen him rebel against authority. ""My mum gave me the option of doing track and field or swimming. I chose track,"" he recounted. Clay's recent book ""Redemption"" puts the spotlight on his early years and is subtitled: ""A Rebellious Spirit, a Praying Mother, and the Unlikely Path to Olympic Gold."" It tells of the fights, dabbling in drugs and moments of desperate, pre-suicidal depression, but he came through it with sport and faith his salvation. Having been put on the correct path, Clay earned a place at Azusa Pacific University, an Evangelical Christian college near Los Angeles. It was there his all-round talents were spotted by his current coach Mike Barnett, who directed him towards the decathlon. ""If I'm being honest, when I was growing up I said I wanted to go to the Olympics,"" Clay said. ""I remember I signed my yearbook with the Olympic rings and wrote '2004.' ""I think deep down inside I knew it was a dream, a pretty far-fetched dream, I didn't know if it was actually going to happen."" Brutal training regime . Clay's early ambitions have clearly been met, but not without an incredible amount of hard work and dedication. Six days per week, he practices at Azusa for up to seven hours each day. He rises at 6 a.m. and is in the weights room an hour later before heading to the track to work on the various disciplines -- a mixture of running, jumping and throwing -- which make up his event. With such an immense training load he is constantly striving to find enough time to maintain his calorie intake. ""It's just making sure we get enough of everything we need -- enough protein, enough carbohydrates, enough calories. It really comes down to eating as much as you can, and eating when you can."" Clay likes to train early so he can spend the afternoon on outside commitments and in the evening be with his family -- wife Sarah and their three children. Olympic goals . Having married in 2004, Sarah has seen Clay reach the heights in his chosen sport, starting with silver medal in Athens behind world record-holder Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic. The tables were turned at the 2005 world championships in Helsinki, Finland as Clay relegated Sebrle to the silver. Injuries meant Clay was unable to defend his world crown in Osaka in 2007, but the following year he dominated the Olympics in Beijing, winning by more than 200 points. Clay admitted to CNN that he has to be careful not to push himself too hard in training -- ""I have to be really disciplined"" -- because further hamstring and knee injures denied him the chance to compete at either the 2009 or 2011 world championships. But in 2010 he won the world indoor heptathlon title in Doha and the decathlon at the prestigious Hypo-Meeting in Austria, showing he can still cut it at the highest level. For Clay, the Olympics are the pinnacle of his sport and inspire him to even greater feats. ""The entire world stops, no matter what's going on,"" he said. ""All that matters is that we get together and celebrate in the Olympic spirit, and to me that's inspiring. It's about inspiring our youth, inspiring the people of the world to be better, to be the best they can be. ""This is the one time the entire world gets together to do that."" But he knows that he cannot afford to make any big mistakes over the two days of competition. ""We're trying to be consistent because consistency is what makes a good score,"" Clay said. ""It comes down to the person who makes the least amount of mistakes, and that's something that has to do with the mental side of things."" Sporting philosophy . Underlying Clay's gentle demeanor is a ferocious competitive spirit which has stood him in good stead at previous Olympics. ""The decathlon is such an amazing test of your mental strength and how far you can push yourself and your physical strength and endurance,"" he said. ""I love putting myself to the test like that. I enjoy it, I feed off that trying to figure out how far I can go. ""I also like competition. I'm a competitive person by nature and I enjoy saying 'I'm better than you' at whatever it is we're doing."" Clay shares that in common with the great British decathlete Daley Thompson, who won successive golds in Moscow and Los Angeles and narrowly missed out on a third medal when fourth in Seoul in 1988. Clay will look to match Thompson's double gold heroics in London, and is relishing besting an athlete he much admires by getting on the podium for the third straight time. ""I can go up to him and say I've got one up on him,"" he said.","Bryan Clay looking to win successive Olympic decathlon titles in London .

"Washington (CNN) -- A ""top-to-bottom"" review by the General Services Administration, the federal agency that was found to have spent lavishly on an October 2010 conference in Las Vegas, has revealed that the agency also spent more than a quarter-million dollars for a one-day awards ceremony just outside Washington in May 2010. The latest spending came to light Thursday when members of Congress were notified that the agency has opened an internal investigation into the roughly $268,000 spent for the 2010 event held not far from the Pentagon in northern Virginia. The agency's preliminary review has determined that approximately $20,000 was spent on drumsticks given to the attendees of the award ceremony. A source inside the agency told CNN that a drum band was hired for the event and the drumsticks were given to allow attendees to play along with the band and make the activity interactive. Troubled federal agency paid for cooking classes, hosted holiday video contest . ""I know, it's ridiculous,"" the source said, and acknowledged ""a lot of frustration"" because the agency's new leadership is dealing with events that happened under the previous administrator. The source also told CNN there are a lot of changes and reforms coming to the agency and that some are already in place, such as a freeze on bonuses and pay raises instituted by Acting Administrator Dan Tangherlini, who took over after the previous administrator resigned. In addition to $20,000 for drumsticks, the agency's inspector general also informed Congress on Thursday that a preliminary review has found the spending included roughly $34,000 for the venue, including catering charges, room rental charges and AV charges; roughly $7,700 for a reception at a second hotel for the same one-day awards ceremony; and approximately $104,000 for logistical and management services provided by a outside vendor. In a statement provided to CNN, the General Services Administration said this type of spending ""is not tolerated."" ""This event took place in 2010 and has been in existence going back to 2002,"" the agency said. ""Today, under the new GSA leadership, this event and type of spending is not tolerated. As of April 2012 all spending for events, including training conferences, leadership events, team building exercises, award ceremonies, were suspended. These events indicate an already recognized pattern of misjudgment which spans several years and administrations. It must stop, and is why Acting Administrator Tangherlini has instituted several stringent new policies on spending to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars."" Previously on CNN.com: Another GSA official placed on leave in spending controversy . Thursday's revelation is the latest spending embarrassment for the General Services Administration. Congressional committees are examining GSA spending after a scathing inspector general's report issued earlier this year showed lavish spending -- $823,000 -- at the agency's Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas in October 2010. Jeff Neely, the GSA official who organized the conference, resigned, as well as the agency's administrator, Martha Johnson. Two of Johnson's deputies were fired and eight other employees left the agency. That's when Tangherlini, a former Treasury Department official, took over. In addition to the Las Vegas conference, the GSA apparently spent $330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii -- and likely millions more dollars on other employees over two years -- according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner. Also, 84 GSA employees, most of them supervisors or other senior staff -- all subjects of inspector general investigations -- are still collecting their bonuses, totaling more than $1 million in taxpayer money. The General Services Administration, which has more than 12,600 employees and a $26.3 billion budget, is tasked with helping manage and support government agencies.

"(CNN) -- Hospitals across the Denver metropolitan area treated dozens of people, many of them critically wounded, in the aftermath of Friday's mass shooting at a movie theater. The youngest of the injured, a 4-month-old boy, was treated and released from a hospital. Ten people died at the theater in Aurora and two died later at hospitals, officials said. Another 58 people were injured in the massacre. Among the dead was an aspiring Colorado sports reporter in her mid-20s, according to a statement from her brother. ""Jessica (Ghawi) has indeed died of injuries sustained in the shooting,"" Jordan Ghawi said on his blog, citing the coroner's office. Families of the victims had not been notified by midafternoon Friday because there was still an active investigation at the crime scene, Aurora police said. Patricia Legarreta, who went to the movie with her fiance, their 4-month-old baby and 4-year-old daughter, tearfully recalled what happened. Legarreta, who suffered wounds to the leg, said she grabbed her son and daughter and headed for the door. ""There was a moment where my daughter tripped. I pulled her up and I was just dragging her and I was just thinking we've just got to get out."" Legarreta and her fiance, Jamie Rohrs, later spoke about their ordeal on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""I'm trying to get out of the way but people are falling next to me, but I am all right, thinking this is it,"" said Rohrs. In the chaos, the couple, who had recently moved to Colorado from New Mexico, became separated. Rohrs eventually learned Legarreta and their children made it out of the theater. At the hospital, the couple had an unexpected conversation. ""He had gone to the restroom and came out,"" Legarreta said of Rohrs. ""And he just looked at me and he said 'I know this is not the time and place, but will you marry me?' And I said, 'yes.' Going through 10 minutes of thinking he was dead and I would never see him again, you never want that feeling again."" Gunman fires on audience in Colorado theater . The wounded were being treated at five medical centers. CNN was unable to account for all 58 injured from lists provided by officials.

"(CNN) -- There were no long lines waiting to see ""The Dark Knight Rises"" at the urban multiplex closest to where I live in Washington, D.C. A mild surprise, since this wasn't, after all, just any movie's opening Friday. This was, as we kept being told, a Major Summer Event, the biggest, darkest and most eagerly anticipated of the many Hollywood blockbusters being wheeled out to the movie-going public. It was also a workday. And I was willing to believe that there were too many people who didn't or couldn't play hooky, no matter how much frothing hype had been aroused on Batman's -- sorry, The Batman's -- behalf. But this was no ordinary opening Friday -- or any other Friday. Less than six hours before I arrived at the box office, a lone gunman opened fire in a darkened theater in Aurora, Colorado, whose seats were jammed with men, women and children gathered for a special midnight showing of ""Dark Knight Rises."" He killed and injured numerous people. For those who survive, I would guess that going into a dark room to watch a movie will never be the same again. The only outward sign at my screening yesterday was another ticket-taker at the entrance asking to look into my book bag. Others were likewise asked to show the contents of their carry-on items. It wasn't a full house, but this was one of those theaters where the movie was being screened in several theaters at once. As the lights dimmed, I heard the crackle of police radios by the exits. Then darkness -- and the show. Of the movie itself, it's enough to say, for now, that it succeeded in absorbing my attention, using every one of its estimated $250 million to fill its 164 minutes. It was too long by half, just like every other summer blockbuster that preceded it. But it was conceived with surging ambition, executed with imaginative cunning, performed with admirable conviction and succeeded at doing what it was build to do: Make me forget the outside world's travails -- even the fact that people died hours ago watching this film. And what did they see? I don't know how far they got before the true horrors began, but here's some of what I remember. (I'm going to spoil some things for you here because I'm trying to make a point. So skip the next few sentences if you want). Several bridges blow up during the course of the film. You don't see close-ups of people trapped in cars plunging into the river. Nor do you see what actually happens to the people on a football field ravaged by an underground explosion, though a field microphone is snatched quickly off the corpse of a dead official. Otherwise, little blood, not much gore, just a lot of stuff blowing up and limbs being cracked ... Real people died, hours ago, watching this stuff. The thought lurked in the back of my head for most of the movie. It pushed itself to the forefront as I walked onto the sidewalk. This is not to place the blame for anything that happened in Aurora on this movie, though I knew, minutes after I'd heard the news, that there were pundits, legislators, radio hosts and concerned parents who were going to do so. (In fact it would seem as if somebody already has). We are at this writing some distance away from assessing what the suspect's motives were. And yet, there was darkness shrouding ""Dark Knight Rises"" even before the shooting. Marshall Fine, my old friend and colleague from the New York Film Critics Circle, was besieged over the past week by death threats for his less-than-glowing review of the movie. There are other film reviewer friends who have likewise been verbally harassed, in varying degrees of ugliness, over critiques of Batman movies that weren't nearly as, well, critical as Fine's. I'm not anxious to find direct psychological connections between fandom run amok and cold-blooded murder. Nor do I feel an urgent need to prosecute popular culture for capital crimes, though I'm also not naÃ¯ve enough to believe that people's feelings can't be adversely affected by what they see and hear. There's a lot I simply don't know for sure, about the shootings, about the suspect, about the victims for that matter. I do know this: That culture, popular or otherwise, can do many things to make us feel connected. It can at its most euphoric or engaged detach us from misery, loneliness and pain. But ultimately it cannot free or save us from these ills. The movie I saw today permitted me to forget for almost three hours what happened to people who saw it two time zones away. It couldn't -- and didn't -- keep me from caring about them. And from worrying about the rest of us.

"(CNN) -- Four people were killed Wednesday in a two-vehicle crash on U.S. Highway 63 near Bay, Arkansas, said Craighead County Deputy Coroner Kurt Beeson. Video from the scene showed the minibus resting on its roof alongside the road. The incident involved a Chrysler PT Cruiser and a minibus that Beeson said was operated by Focus Incorporated, which is aimed at helping disabled people. Video showed the highway littered with debris from the crash. The minibus was resting on its roof in a ditch beside the road. The mangled and nearly unrecognizable burgundy PT Cruiser came to rest on the other side of the road. The footage showed at least one body being put in the back of an ambulance. Authorities held up sheets to shield victims from the overhead helicopter from CNN affiliate WMC. Northbound lanes of U.S. 63 were closed. Beeson said preliminary information indicates that the driver of the PT Cruiser was heading the wrong way on the highway or crossed into the wrong lane. CNN's Shawn Nottingham, Divina Mims and Emily Robards contributed to this report.","Minivan involved was operated by group aimed at helping disabled people .

"(CNN) -- Penny Malphrus got her long-awaited answer in the form of a one sentence text message: ""We had a productive day and determined the engine contained a two bladed propeller."" It was not what Malphrus wanted to hear; nevertheless, she was prepared for it. Malphrus had been hoping to learn if plane wreckage recently discovered eight floors below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, 20 miles off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida, was her father's twin engine Piper Aerostar which disappeared without a trace one February night 16 years ago. Joe Kistel, a marine conservationist and the executive director of an artificial reef building company in Jacksonville, led a dive last weekend to search for clues. ""I personally felt bad that we were not able help her further in her journey for closure at this point,"" Kistel said later. ""I had prepared myself for the news that it may not be my Dad's plane,"" Malphrus admitted. ""It is very comforting and refreshing to know there are people like Joe out there that have the kind of heart to want to help someone that may need answers. Joe Kistel and his team have brought me closer to finding this thing called closure."" Kistel found himself in the middle of this aviation puzzle purely by happenstance. During a dive last month to map a site for artificial reefs, he discovered the plane wreckage: tires, turbine blade, a pair of engines and other parts. Malphrus heard about Kistel's find and drove from her home in Hilton Head, South Carolina to meet him and learn more. See the photos and videos . Two diving teams comprised of eight people went down on Sunday morning. Kistel's goal was to lift one of the two engines buried 75% in the sandy sea floor. He and his group wanted to figure out how many blades were on the propeller. If there were three blades, there was still a chance it was the plane belonging to Malphrus' father. The first diving team consisted of Kistel, photographer Larry Davis and lift bag operators Ed Kalakauskis and Nate Tucei. The second dive team included Jack Leone, Emily Leone and Dane Shields who went along to observe. The conditions were favorable although the water a bit murky when the first team dove around 8:30am carrying two lift bags, one for each buried engine located about 40 feet apart. Kistel said, ""For safety reasons and to avoid the possibility of the engine drifting off and being lost, I connected a 50 foot tether line between the two engines."" It didn't take long for the inflatable lift bag to raise the approximate 400 pound engine from its resting spot. ""When the engine ripped out of the ground from the brute force created by the lift bag it shot up until the tether caught it,"" Kistel recounted. Immediately, the search teams saw it was a two bladed prop with stamped numbers 15911 imprinted in the metal. Using the information, Kistel contacted Hartzell Propeller Inc., an Ohio-based designer and manufacturer of propellers. Kevin Ryan, a technical support employee at Hartzell, said, ""It's not the first time"" someone has contacted him to help solve an aviation mystery. Using the underwater pictures taken by Kistel's dive team, Ryan determined the propeller was likely made on January 3, 1968 and shipped to a Piper aircraft company in Pennsylvania. ""If 15911 is the correct factory number, the prop is an HC-E2YK-1RB/8465-7R. It's an Aztec prop, and we sold it to Piper in Lock Haven, so it could be original equipment on the aircraft,"" Ryan said. ""We sent a truckload of propellers to Lock Haven where they bolted propellers to new planes,"" he said. But that's about as far as he could go in determining who owned the plane. ""It's like Nike sending shoes to Joe's Shoe Store and then calling Nike and asking them who owns a certain pair of shoes,"" he explained. With the information provided by Ryan, Kistel has also reached out to the Piper Aircraft company as well as the National Transportation Safety Board. ""Having a definitive answer as to what may have happened in February of 1996 would answer a lot of questions in my mind and others,"" Malphrus said. ""Have I found peace? Yes,"" she emailed. ""I even have asked myself what would closure be? Is that something that happens and then you let go of the past? I hope not. My Dad is a huge part of who I am."" And so Malphrus is left pondering the same questions. Whose plane did Kistel's team find and will the wreckage of her father's plane ever be found? How the journey began .","Pilot Stewart Dunbar disappeared off Florida coast in 1996 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In just a few days, a politician largely unknown outside the U.S. has earned the dubious reputation on the world stage as the ""rape-gaffe congressman."" It's not an enviable title but one that has inspired column-writers worldwide to pick apart Todd Akin's comments -- their possible implications for the U.S. presidential election and what they say about an apparently civilized society's attitude towards rape. The standard news story has been syndicated worldwide, stating the bare facts; that a Missouri congressman referred to ""legitimate rape"" when trying to explain, incorrectly, a woman's biological response to being raped. Rape victims, the congressmen inferred, would not become pregnant because ""the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" The comment came in response to a presenter's question as to whether abortion should be allowed in the case of rape. Akin defies mounting calls to withdraw from Senate race . Akin's comments echoed as far away as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where award-winning playwright Eve Ensler penned a powerful open letter titled, ""Dear Mr. Akin, I Want You to Imagine..."" The U.S. author of ""The Vagina Monologues"" wrote that she was lying awake at 2 a.m. in Bukavu in the City of Joy in the Congo where she was working to support ""thousands of women who have been raped and violated and tortured from this ceaseless war for minerals fought on their bodies."" ""Mr. Akin, your words have kept me awake,"" she wrote, before explaining what it means for women who have been raped to hear him make the distinction between ""legitimate"" and ""illegitimate"" rape. ""The underlying assumption of your statement is that women and their experiences are not to be trusted. That their understanding of rape must be qualified by some higher, wiser authority,"" she wrote, before imploring him to imagine someone ""violently, hatefully forcing themself into you so that you are ripped apart."" At the time of writing the story had been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. ""Everyone's talking about rape,"" declared Hadley Freeman, writing in Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""It is testament to the determination of some folk to bend reality to their preferred viewpoint that there are so many intriguing words around these days for rape to make it seem, I don't know, less rapey,"" she wrote, looping a string around Akin and ""certain devotees of Julian Assange."" Akin's remarks deemed 'harmful' to rape survivors . She was referring to George Galloway, a British lawmaker with the Respect Party, perhaps best known outside the UK for his fiery testimony at a 2005 U.S. Senate Committee hearing into alleged impropriety concerning the United Nations' oil-for-food scheme. Galloway has refused to retract comments made in his video podcast in which he said the allegations made by two women in Sweden against WikiLeaks founder Assange ""did not constitute rape"" but were more of a case of ""bad sexual etiquette."" However, the majority of international column space devoted to the Akin comments related to their impact on the U.S. presidential race. Historian Tim Stanley struck back with this blunt analysis in Britain's Telegraph newspaper. ""Todd Akin's remarks on rape don't tell you what conservatives think about sexual assault. They don't tell you much about anything, other than that Akin is an idiot."" He added that Akin's comments were what President Barack Obama had been waiting for; an opportunity to swing the political narrative from jobs to culture. Opinion: Rape can make you pregnant. Period. ""How Akin's foolishness will play out in the election remains to be seen. Incredibly, he remains neck-and-neck in his Missouri race, which suggests that economics continues to eclipse social policy in the popular mind,"" he wrote. But the Australian Sydney Morning Herald's U.S. Correspondent Nick O'Malley said Akin's comments had ""trashed"" any hopes that Mitt Romney had of ""refocusing attention on to economics."" The straight news story about Akin's comments and refusal to end his bid for the Senate was carried on several websites in China, and generated a sprinkling of discussion on the country's twitter-like micro-blogs. User ""Xingxingnameliang"" wrote: ""Is he an undercover sent by the Democrats to destroy the opponent? Obama must be so happy to see this."" And ""reddress"" said: ""This would be a big headache for the Republicans. A lousy teammate who can sabotage his own people is the worst."" Under a column entitled ""Mistake of words and of the heart,"" the BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell asked why a U.S. politician was peddling pregnancy rape theories which dated back to the 13th century. ""Mr Akin may have many admirable qualities which recommend him to the voters of Missouri, but it seems strange that a 21st century politician is willing to legislate on the grounds of old wives' tales. Perhaps he should be explaining that, rather than his clumsy use of language,"" he wrote. One CNN reader who commented on the opinion piece ""Wake up: It's not just Akin"" also looked beyond Akin's wording to question the value of the debate. Opinion: GOP policy is the scandal, not just Akin's comments . ""What is the probability of an aroused woman getting pregnant versus the probability of a non-aroused woman getting pregnant? Non biased researchers probably know the answer to this question. Regardless of the answer, why did he think it's good politics to debate this stuff?"" However, one of the most inventive and educational responses to Akin's comments came from an academic website in Australia, posted by a professor of evolution and ecology who specializes in the biology of sexual conduct. ""Like almost everybody else I spoke to today, I was staggered, this morning, to hear Todd Akin's comments about 'legitimate rape' and pregnancy,"" wrote Rob Brooks, from the University of New South Wales on The Conversation website. Brooks questioned whether Akin was confusing human biology with that of Australian Black Field Crickets, a species for whom forced copulation is impossible. ""She has to mount him voluntarily and she is unlikely to do so unless he has a sexy song. But once she has mated him and he has attached a bag of his sperm (a spermatophore) to her abdomen, she often chooses to remove it before its entire contents enter her body,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps this is the kind of thing Todd Akin had in mind?"" On a more serious note, Brooks wrote: ""What strikes me about the anachronistic attitudes of evangelicals and their Republican puppets to abortion, contraception, family planning, female economic empowerment and feminism in general, is just how unambiguously male these attitudes are. ""An entire political party in one of the most advanced and educated countries on earth has become a caricature of the most basal evolved insecurities about masculinity. They seem terrified of losing control over the means of reproduction and petrified of cuckoldry,"" he said. Experts: Rape does not lower odds of pregnancy .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- In a highly symbolic break with previous policy, Egypt reopened its border crossing into Gaza on Saturday, opening the door for Palestinians to the outside world and raising fears among some Israelis that militant attacks will increase. ""Procedures were excellent,"" said Younes Ahmed, who described his travel into Egypt as the first such visit in his life. ""I hope there will be peace between our people and I want to thank the Egyptian people and the Egyptian government ... we always hope for easier ways for Palestinians because our people suffered enough."" Crossing officials said more than 600 Palestinians passed Saturday through the Rafah border, which had been subject to frequent closures by Egypt after Hamas, an Islamic militant group, took control of Gaza in June 2007. The closure of the border had been part of an embargo policy by Egypt and Israel aimed at cutting off Hamas, though it simultaneously created an economic hardship in Gaza by limiting shipments of goods in and out of the country. Egypt opted to reopen the border to offer relief to the people of Gaza, said Ambassador Menha Bakhoum of the country's foreign ministry. ""Today, we are facing a new stage, a new stage were this blockade is defeated,"" said a Hamas representative at the crossing. ""This step is to support the resistance of the Palestinian people to face the Zionist blockade."" ""This is a Palestinian-Egyptian frontier and it's not the business of the invaders,"" said Salam Baraka, general director of border police. ""This border does not submit but to the Egyptian-Palestinian rule."" Palestinian Authority adviser and negotiator Nabil Shaath heralded the move by the government in Cairo, calling it a ""brave and bold decision"" that demonstrated ""the new Egypt stands by the Palestinian people."" It was seen as a victory by many in the Hamas government of Gaza, which staged a celebration rally Saturday near the crossing. Some in Israel's security establishment have privately expressed concerns that the increased traffic at Rafah could serve to allow more militants and weapons to cross in and out of Gaza and that it could ultimately serve to bolster the position of Hamas, which Israel and the United States consider a terrorist organization, but the Israeli government has said little publicly. Neither the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor the foreign ministry would publicly comment due to the sensitive nature of relations with Egypt. Sari Bashi, who serves as director of Gisha, an Israeli organization that advocates for Palestinian freedom of movement, welcomed the changes at the crossing and said Israel need not be overly concerned. ""It continues to prevent goods from traveling via Rafah and it also continues to limit travel to those listed in the Israeli-approved Palestinian population registry,"" Bashi said of the new Egyptian policy. ""Egypt is allowing an incremental and welcome change, but it is still expressing its willingness to engage Israel and engage Israeli security concerns."" The Rafah crossing was open sporadically between June and January, when Egypt ordered it opened to those in need of medical care, students, and foreign passport and residency card holders. Among those people allowed to cross were those wounded during an Israeli assault aboard a flotilla of ships headed to Gaza last year. Rafah is one of two crossings through which Palestinians can exit Gaza; the other is controlled by Israel and bars passage by most Palestinians save for those with emergency medical conditions. Since the flotilla raid, Israel has allowed a greater amount of goods to enter Gaza, but it still maintains a complete blockade of the airspace and territorial waters and has limited most exports. After Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak was forced from office, the interim government promised to reopen the border. CNN's Paul Cosley and Talal Abu Rahmah contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Procedures were excellent,"" says one middle-aged Palestinian on his first visit to Egypt .

"(CNN) -- England will make their defense of the World Twenty20 title without gifted batsman Kevin Pietersen, who was omitted from their 15-man squad Tuesday. Pietersen was man of the tournament in their triumph in the Caribbean two years ago, but is at odds with teammates and the England management for ""provocative"" texts sent to opposition South African players. The 32-year-old was left out of the third Test against South Africa at Lord's, which ended in a 51-run defeat, despite scoring a superb century in the previous match of the series. He has apologized for the text messages, which allegedly criticized England captain Andrew Strauss, but it has not been enough to earn him a recall to the England fold. ""Kevin Pietersen's future involvement is still being determined and he was therefore not considered for selection in either squad,"" national selector Geoff Miller told the official England and Wales Cricket Board website. South African born Pietersen averages nearly 50 runs per innings in Test cricket and is renowned for his ability to score quickly in one day internationals and the Twenty20 format. But earlier this year he made a shock announcement to retire from one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches for England. After his superb 149 in the second Test against South Africa, Pietersen cast further doubt on his future by saying ""obstacles"" must be overcome for him to continue playing. He was believed to be referring to a fake Twitter account which portrayed him in unflattering terms and was being followed by several of his teammates. But Pietersen was soon using YouTube to announce that he was available again for England in all forms of cricket. It was not enough to earn him selection for the final Test where England lost their No.1 status and his exile has now continued. Pietersen's close friend, the Australian cricket legend Shane Warne, said Tuesday that it was a ""tragedy"" that he would not be playing for England. ""There's a bit too much ego at the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board), there's no give or take or compromise,"" Warne told a press conference in Sydney. ""If he doesn't sign his England contract, if he doesn't play for England again, I just think that's a tragedy."" But Warne added: ""Kevin Pietersen has to put his hand up and say 'I've conducted myself in a pretty ordinary fashion, too'."" England's squad contained few surprises, with eight survivors of the squad which won the trophy two years ago. Jonathan Bairstow, who scored 95 and 54 in stepping in for Pietersen at Lord's, is included. ""We are very much looking forward to beginning the defence of our World T20 title next month,"" said Miller.","Kevin Pietersen left out of England's World Twenty20 squad .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The upcoming ninth season of NBC's ""The Office"" will be the sitcom's last, executive producer Greg Daniels said Tuesday. Though the show's ratings are healthy -- it is NBC's highest-rated scripted series -- contracts are expiring for most of the original cast, making it ""the last chance for us to go out together and to make an artistic ending,"" Daniels said. All 15 of the characters from season eight will return, with the addition of Jake Lacy and Clark Duke, he said. But the contracts of most of the veterans are expiring, he said.

""As we head into the home stretch, we have a lot of exciting things I personally have been wanting to do since season two and the ending should be pretty cool,"" Daniels said. One story arc in particular is the relationship between receptionist Pam Beesly and salesman Jim Halpert, he said. ""The most loyal fans would really want to see that happen,"" he said.

""Basically, all questions will be answered this year,"" Daniels said. ""We are going to see who is behind the documentary.""

"London (CNN) -- Outside a modest redbrick block behind the Harrods department store in west London, a media circus is taking place. Well-to-do shoppers laden with bags side-step the TV crews clogging the pavement, asking what all the fuss is about. This is no ordinary apartment block but the Ecuadorian Embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has just been granted asylum in that country and is holed up inside the building. Assange supporters sport 'V for Vendetta' masks and pump revolutionary anthems including Rage Against the Machine's ""We are Legion"" and Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up."" Scuffles broke out earlier between campaigners and police officers, captured on film by 10 times as many cameramen and watched by handfuls of resigned-looking residents. Reporters pack the alleyway beside the building, in case Assange makes a bid for freedom in a getaway car. But CNN's Atika Shubert at the scene says this is the same alleyway used by Harrods' delivery trucks. The Australian sought refuge at the embassy on June 19 in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden where he is wanted for questioning over accusations he sexually assaulted two women. Explaining the reasons for granting asylum, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo PatiÃ±o said Thursday there is credible fear that if Assange is sent to Sweden, he could be subsequently extradited to the United States, where he could be charged with espionage and treason. Assange published thousands of secret U.S. government documents in 2010. We know he is still tweeting. At 2.30pm London time he posted his thanks to the Ecuador Government in Spanish: ""Gracias a Ecuador y ustedes."" He may have seen supporting tweets from across the world, such as that from documentary filmmaker Michael Moore who urged campaigners to rise up: ""OccupyWallSt calls for people to head over to British consulate in NYC now 2 protest UK threat to raid Ecuador embassy."" The British Government insists the UK still has a legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden. As the British Foreign Office tweeted: ""We are disappointed by the statement from Ecuador's Foreign Minister that #Ecuador has offered political asylum to Julian #Assange."" It is a sentiment that prompted the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo PatiÃ±o to hit back: ""We are not a British colony. Those times are passed."" Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt however, remained pragmatic, posting: ""Our firm legal and constitutional system guarantees the rights of each and everyone. We firmly reject any accusations to the contrary."" Meanwhile, the Assange gags continue to roll in on social media. Photos of taxi drivers apparently called to the Ecuadorian Embassy with signs to pick up one Julian Assange have been retweeted hundreds of times. Then there's Darth Vadar, who joked on Twitter: ""Ecuador gave WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange assylum. Apparently, Wookieeleaks founder, Chewbacca, is heading there now too.""

"(CNN) -- Politicians have always been a fat target for humorists. ""Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress,"" Mark Twain once observed. ""But I repeat myself."" And Will Rogers once remarked, ""I'm not a member of any organized political party -- I am a Democrat."" Mark Katz: The guy who makes politicians funny . But humor from politicians themselves? A much thinner volume. Nevertheless, there have been a number of witty lines that politicians have come up with -- or, at least, for which they've received credit. Here's a sampling: . John Adams: ""In my many years I have come to a conclusion that one useless man is a shame, two is a law firm, and three or more is a congress."" Abraham Lincoln: Sen. Benjamin Wade accused the president of being ""the father of every military blunder that we've made. You are on the road to hell, sir, with this Government, and you are not a mile off this minute."" ""Wade, that is about the distance from here to the Capitol,"" Lincoln replied. Theodore Roosevelt: ""When they call the roll in the Senate, the senators do not know whether to answer 'present' or 'not guilty.'"" John F. Kennedy, when asked how he became a war hero: ""It was absolutely involuntary. They sank my boat."" Ronald Reagan: ""I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency -- even if I'm in a Cabinet meeting."" Bob Dole, on the Senate: ""If you're hanging around with nothing to do and the zoo is closed, come over to the Senate. You'll get the same kind of feeling and you won't have to pay."" Bill Clinton, on the White House: ""I don't know whether it's the finest public housing in America or the crown jewel of the American penal system.'' George W.

"(CNN) -- Montpellier's France international striker Olivier Giroud has agreed to join English Premier League club Arsenal. Giroud, who passed a medical at Arsenal's training ground on Monday, was a key player for Montpellier last season as the French club won Ligue 1 for the first time in their history, scoring 21 goals in 36 appearances. The 25-year-old, who made three substitute appearances for France during Euro 2012, will officially join Arsenal on July 1 on a ""long-term"" contract though Arsenal did not disclose the length of the deal. Italy reach semifinals after penalty-shootout triumph . ""We're delighted to have secured the signing of Olivier Giroud,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the club's website. ""He has a very good physical presence and is exceptional in the air, with a great work ethic. We're excited about Olivier joining us and he will add an additional dimension to our attacking options next season. ""He has proved that he is capable of performing at the top level with club and country, and we saw what a big influence he was in Montpellier's championship-winning side last season. ""We all look forward to Olivier joining us and seeing him play in an Arsenal shirt."" Giroud has been at Montpellier for two years, having previously played for Grenoble, Istres and Tours, where he won the Ligue 2 Player of the Year award in 2009/10. ""I was attracted by the philosophy of football and Arsene Wenger's 'touch' at this club,"" said Giroud. ""I've always admired Arsenal with its great history and reputation, and I now hope to achieve great things here. I'm very proud to be a Gunner and I will give my best for all the Arsenal fans.""

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid made a stumbling start to their La Liga title defense, as they were held 1-1 by Valencia Sunday in the Santiago Bernabeu. It was two costly points dropped as arch rivals Barcelona later thumped Real Sociedad 5-1 in the Camp Nou. Barca's new coach Tito Vilanova saw them dominate the first half and take a 4-1 lead by the break. Carles Puyol headed them in front from a second minute corner before Chori Castro leveled for the visitors. But Lionel Messi was at his superb best to take the game away from Sociedad. He scored a double in four minutes, both fine individual efforts, before Pedro Rodriguez added a fourth on the stroke of halftime. David Villa added the gloss to the performance, as he made his return in the second half after a lengthy injury layoff. He converted a pass from Andres Iniesta in the 75th minute. Barcelona meet Real in the Spanish Super Cup on Thursday and will be hoping the reigning champions misfire as they did against Valencia. Gonzalo Higuain put Jose Mourinho's men ahead Real ahead after nine minutes, but Brazilian midfielder Jonas Goncalves equalized just before the interval with a neat header. Cristiano Ronaldo had an early chance for Real but was otherwise quiet on a disappointing night for Los Blancos. ""I don't think we played a great game, but we did enough to win,"" Mourinho told the official Real Madrid website.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A judge Thursday dismissed felony sexual assault charges against a Roman Catholic priest arrested in July on allegations of sexually abusing a 10-year-old boy in 1997. At Thursday's preliminary hearing, Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Karen Yvette Simmons dismissed felony involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and sexual assault charges against Andrew McCormick, 56. Simmons still remanded the case for trial on the misdemeanor charges of indecent assault, corrupting the morals of a minor and endangering the welfare of a child, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. The district attorney's office will re-file the felony charges against McCormick as well as file an appeal to determine if the felony charges should have been properly held for court based on the alleged victim's testimony. ""The Commonwealth is very confident that all the felony charges will be reinstated and McCormick will then be sent to trial in the Court of Common Pleas on all charges,"" Tasha Jamerson, district attorney spokeswoman said in a statement. McCormick befriended the former altar boy, now 25, while he was a pastor St. John Cantius Church in Bridesburg, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Seth Williams said in July following his arrest. The man alleged that the abuse occurred in the church rectory and involved one incident of ""sexual contact."" The alleged victim testified Thursday that the sexual activity occurred when he was 10 years old, according to the district attorney's office. ""It was a huge win today,"" said defense attorney William J. Brennan. ""I believe his (complaining witness) motives are suspect. Father McCormick has overwhelming support from the community. He's innocent until proven guilty."" Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, expressed disappointment that the felony charges were dropped. ""It's tempting to be complacent, do nothing, and assume that McCormick will get convicted on the remaining charges. But that's irresponsible. We must all do all that we can to protect kids. Every single victim, witnesses an whistleblower must summon the strength and step forward so that predators will be kept from children,"" Blaine said in a statement. Ordained in 1982, McCormick was one 21 priests placed on administrative leave by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia in March of 2011 in response to a grand jury report. McCormick's most recent post was Sacred Heart Parish in Swedesburg, Pennsylvania, from 2004 to 2011. As a result of the administrative leave, McCormick has not been permitted to exercise his public ministry, administer any of the sacraments, or present himself publicly as a priest, according to the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. McCormick was arrested after he was taken into custody outside of Philadelphia, where he was living with his parents. He was released on $150,000 bail. The court took away his passport and he is not allowed contact with the alleged victim, or with children or youth involved with the ministry, volunteer work or any charities, according to the district attorney's office. In December of 2011, the complainant reported the alleged incident to the police department's Special Victims Unit after seeing news coverage of the sexual abuse scandals at Penn State and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, said Police Capt. John Darby of the Special Victims Unit. McCormick's arrest in July came in the wake of the landmark priest sexual abuse trial in Philadelphia, the result of a 2011 grand jury report that led to criminal charges against three Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher for allegedly raping and assaulting boys in their care, and charges against Monsignor William Lynn who was accused of allowing the priests to have access to children. Lynn, 61, was convicted in June of one count of child endangerment, a third-degree felony, the first time a U.S. church leader has been convicted on such a charge. He was given just under the maximum sentence he faced, which was three-and-a-half to seven years in prison. The same jury that convicted Lynn was unable to bring a verdict against his co-defendant, the Rev. James Brennan, who was accused of the attempted rape of a 14-year-old. The trial marked the first time U.S. prosecutors have charged not just the priests who allegedly committed abuses, but also church leaders for failing to stop them. Lynn is the highest-ranking cleric accused of covering up allegations of molestation and rape against priests by transferring them to unwitting parishes. Last month, the Philadelphia district attorney's office announced it would retry Brennan. Defense attorney William J. Brennan, no relation, also represents Rev. Brennan. ""Enough is enough,"" Brennan said of the dropped charges and the district attorney's decision to retry the case against the reverend. ""It's time to pack it in."" Defrocked priest Edward Avery was due to also go on trial with Brennan and Lynn, but pleaded guilty in March to involuntary sexual deviate sexual intercourse after admitting to sexually assaulting the 10-year-old altar boy during the 1998-1999 school year. The victim, who testified in April, also alleges abuse by the Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at the same parish, as well as by Bernard Shero, a teacher at the school. Engelhardt and Shero go on trial in September.","Judge dismisses charges against Andrew McCormick, 56 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paris Jackson waited at home Sunday, hoping for a phone call from her grandmother, the woman who has cared for her since her father, Michael Jackson, died three years ago. ""yes, my grandmother is missing,"" Paris Jackson, 14, tweeted Sunday morning. ""i haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now."" A nephew reported Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson, 82, missing late Saturday after her grandchildren were unable to get in touch with her for a week. It is the latest chapter in a messy dispute between several of Jackson's children and her advisers over her finances and legal affairs. Jackson's nephew, Trent, filed the report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. But one of her sons involved in the dispute said in a series of Twitter postings Friday that Katherine Jackson was fine and resting in Arizona. ""I want to reassure everyone (inc all sudden medical experts) that Mother is fine but is resting up in AZ on the orders of a doctor, not us,"" Jermaine Jackson tweeted. ""This is our mother and her health is paramount. We are not inventing or plotting anything. We are following doctor's advice. Period,"" he added. Paris Jackson's responded to her uncle's claim with her own tweet early Sunday. ""the same doctor that testified on behalf of dr murray saying my father was a drug addict (a lie) is caring for my grandmother... just saying"" she tweeted. The doctor who examined Jackson at her home on July 14 was Dr. Allan Metzger, according to Katherine Jackson attorney Sandra Ribera. Metzger was a defense expert witness for Dr. Conrad Murray last year. Murray was subsequently convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death. Dr. Metzger was brought into Jackson's Calabasas, California, home ""under false pretenses"" by saying he was sent by her primary care physician, Ribera said. ""We came to find out that her doctor has no association with Dr. Metzger."" The doctor advised Jackson that it was better for her to take a plane on a trip planned for the next day, rather than ride in a RV driven by Trent Jackson, Ribera said. Jackson left with her oldest daughter, Rebbie, the next day to fly to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to attend a Jackson brothers concert two days later, she said. But she never arrived at the concert, Ribera said. When Paris Jackson called her aunts Rebbie and Janet over the past several days to find her grandmother, she was told each time she could not speak to her, Ribera said. In another tweet, Paris Jackson gave out her bodyguard's phone number and asked people to call the authorities if they saw her grandmother. ""The kids were trying to get a hold of their grandmother and they haven't been able to reach her for almost a week,"" Ribera said. ""They are told she's unavailable."" ""I'm concerned that she's not safe,"" Ribera added. Jackson ""has never gone 24 hours without talking to her kids,"" she said. ""I'm concerned that she would never do this. We have no idea what's going on with her. No one has talked to her."" CNN reached out to Janet Jackson's representatives several times but did not hear back. Family, fans remember Michael Jackson . The sheriff's homicide-missing persons unit has been asked to investigate, Ribera said. A letter was made public Wednesday in which two daughters, Rebbie and Janet, and three sons -- Jermaine, Randy and Tito -- charge that Katherine Jackson was being mistreated by the executors of Michael Jackson's estate and mis-advised by her manager and lawyer.","NEW: A doctor examined Katherine Jackson ""under false pretenses,"" her lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Editor's note: This story may contain spoilers . Warner Brothers studios confirmed Friday that it will not cancel any screenings of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" squashing any rumors that it might dial back the release following the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, theater. The shooting rampage that left at least 12 movie patrons dead and dozens more injured reignited the gun debate in the United States -- a debate that actually figures into the movie itself. The film kicks off in a violence-free Gotham. But soon the bad guys emerge and so, too, does a retired Batman, to deal with them. Shooting casts pall over 'Dark Knight Rises' blockbuster weekend . In one scene the hero (once again played by Christian Bale) jumps into a fight already in progress between Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) and about half a dozen villains. When the two masked characters seize the upper hand, Catwoman grabs a gun to finish the job. But Batman stops her, telling her he doesn't use guns. She grudgingly concedes and the two make their escape. The good guys win this battle without killing anyone and without the use of guns. But this singular anti-gun moment is soon turned on its head. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . About an hour and countless acts of violence later, Batman is about to be killed by the film's antagonist, Bane. During what is arguably the film's most pivotal scene, Catwoman repays Batman's earlier life-saving favor. However, she does it her way, by blasting Bane away, killing him with a piece of artillery attached to the ""Batpod"" -- the film's motorcycle-like vehicle. Then Catwoman, in a made-for-the-big-screen moment, reminds Batman that she doesn't agree with that whole ""no guns"" thing. The cinematographic message is clear: small battles are one thing, but to win the war, the use of guns is not only acceptable, it's probably required. Theater offers 'perfect killing' zone . As the film continues to play on 4,400 screens around the country, audiences may be struck by the mixed message in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Batman neutralizes his opponents with fisticuffs and other means, but he never applies deadly force. And his plea against using guns may ring hollow when, presumably for the sake of entertainment, filmmakers pack the movie with plenty of violence from guns, bombs and other heavy weaponry. In light of the shooting, how do you feel about gun control and public safety? Let us know on CNN iReport.","A gun debate figures into the storyline of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" itelf .

"(CNN) -- The buzz began hours before the start of the race at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials: Would one of the most-elusive records in long distance running set by a legend long dead finally fall? It's a question that has been asked at nearly every Olympic track trials since the brash Steve Prefontaine set the meet record for men's 5,000 meters in 1972. Sure, there have been runners since who have been more than capable of breaking the record. They just always came up short when it counted. The record, though, was not the most pressing issue on Galen Rupp's mind when he stepped up to the starting line on a cool, crisp night last week at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. His goal, he told reporters: a top-three finish that would guarantee him a ticket to the Olympics. Rupp, who had already qualified for the 10,000 meters, was running against the Kenyan-born Bernard Lagat, a favorite. Unseen, though, was another opponent: Prefontaine, whose presence decades after his death on May 30, 1975, at the age of 24, has loomed large over long distance running in the United States. There are eerie similarities between Rupp and Prefontaine: Both were born and reared in Oregon, trained at the University of Oregon and later ran for the Oregon Track Club. And both matured as runners following their first Olympic appearance. Rupp finished out of the medals in the 10,000 meters at the Beijing Games in 2008. Pre, as Prefontaine was known to fans, was charismatic and brash, predicting wins and sometimes taunting opponents. His following was huge by track standards, with thousands attending his races. At one point, an opponent donned a ""Stop Pre"" T-shirt to counter fans, dubbed ""Pre's People,"" wearing ""Go Pre"" shirts. At the 1972 Games in Munich, Prefontaine promised that if it came down to ""a pure guts race at the end,"" he was the only one who could win. He placed fourth in a heartbreaking finish after leading for the last four laps of the 5,000 meters, a race that saw Finland's Lasse Viren win gold in a late surge. By most accounts, he was a favorite to medal, if not win gold, at the 1976 Games in Montreal. Prefontaine died in a car accident hours after running his last race at Hayward Field. At the time of his death, he owned every American record between 2,000 and 10,000 meters and between two miles and six miles, according to stats provided by the University of Oregon. When 26-year-old Rupp took to the track for the 5,000 meters Thursday at Hayward Field, the same track where Prefontaine set the meet record in 1972, he already owned an American record in the 10,000 meter. The crowd of thousands roared with the start of the race, just like they had decades earlier for Prefontaine's race. ""This is the only place in the country, possibly the world, that you're going to get that kind of reception for the 5,000,"" Rupp said later. It wasn't surprising that Rupp led the last laps. The surprise was the finish, after Rupp was overtaken by Lagat in the final lap and then surged the final 20 meters to the finish line. Rupp's time: 13:22.67, less than two-tenths of a second ahead of Prefontaine's 13:22.8. ""To hear I got the record, that's unreal,"" Rupp told reporters shortly after the race. ""Anytime you're mentioned in the same breath as Steve Prefontaine, it's a huge compliment."" But more than that, Rupp's record-breaking run opens the door for U.S. long distance runners to be considered contenders at the London Olympics. Only one American man has medaled since Frank Shorter won the gold medal in the marathon in 1972 and a silver medal in 1976, and that was Meb Keflezighi, who won the silver in the marathon at the Athens Games in 2004. Maybe, just maybe, Rupp will bring home the medal that eluded Prefontaine.","Steve Prefontaine set the 5,000 meter record at the U.S. Olympic trials in 1972 .

"London (CNN) -- Coal slag heaps up to 450-feet high may not seem the obvious candidates to join a list that includes the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and Yellowstone National Park. But the remnants of a once-thriving mining industry in northern France have now been included in a roll call of the world's greatest landmarks. The Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin has been designated a World Heritage site by the U.N.'s cultural organization, UNESCO, and is now ranked alongside nearly 1,000 sites across the globe considered to have outstanding value. Coal was extracted from the region from the 17th to the 20th century, when it suffered an economic slump. Now, after a 10-year campaign, locals are aiming to promote as tourist attractions the old pits, railway stations, workers' estates and mining villages. ""It's important as a piece of history in that part of the world,"" said UNESCO spokesperson Susan Williams. ""It doesn't have to be pretty... but it does have to be of outstanding universal value, in other words important for the whole of humanity. The locals have been so excited about this. This is a site they are very appreciative of,"" she said. In its summary, UNESCO said the mining region was a ""remarkable cultural landscape"" and provided ""exceptional testimony to the exchange of ideas and influences regarding the extraction methods used for underground coal seams, the design of worker housing and urban planning, as well as the international human migration that accompanied the industrialization of Europe."" The Word Heritage Committee meets once a year to implement the convention defining the kind of natural of cultural sites that can be considered for the prestigious list. The Calais basin is one of three mining sites that made the list this year. Among the 26 additions for 2012 were the Lakes of Ounianga in Chad, Africa, the Chengjiang fossil site in the Yunnan province of China, the decorated farmhouses of Halsingland in Sweden and the Margravial Opera House at Bayreuth in Germany. Nominations for heritage status have to meet the UNESCO criteria agreed by member states and come up with a long-term management plan before they can be scrutinized and judged. However, heritage status does not necessarily guarantee protection. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said news that mausoleums in Timbuktu, Mali, had been destroyed by Islamic militants was ""extremely distressing"" and called on all parties involved in the conflict to ""protect this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations."" In 2001 the Taliban destroyed part of another of the world's treasures -- the huge Buddha statues in the Bamiyan Valley on the ancient Silk Road in Afghanistan. Both of these sites are included on a list of 38 sites that are threatened.","World Heritage status has been given to the Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin in northern France .

"(CNN) -- ""Today is a big day for hip hop."" When music impresario Russell Simmons penned those words and posted them Wednesday, he was not referring to a new album dropping or the debut of an exciting artist. He was talking about a male artist's admission that his first love was a man. ""I am profoundly moved by the courage and honesty of Frank Ocean,"" Simmons wrote on the site Global Grind. ""Your decision to go public about your sexual orientation gives hope and light to so many young people still living in fear."" Ocean, an up-and-coming R&B singer, recently posted on his Tumblr that the summer he was 19 years old he fell in love with a man. ""We spent that summer, and the summer after, together,"" Ocean wrote. ""Every day almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile. ""Sleep I would often share with him,"" Ocean continued. ""By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with."" The revelation is significant given that it is unheard of in hip hop for male performers to admit to anything other than hardcore heterosexuality and all of the bravado that comes along with many female conquests. And Ocean is a member of the hip hop collective Odd Future, whose co-founder, Tyler the Creator, has been accused in the past of being homophobic and taken to task for his use of a gay slur in his lyrics. (According to online music magazine NME, Tyler the Creator used a derogatory term for gays or a variation of that term more than 200 times on his album ""Goblin."") But the rapper showed his support of Ocean via Twitter on Wednesday. He along with Simmons -- who as the co-founder of Def Jam Records and brother of Run DMC member Joseph Simmons is considered one of the founders of hip hop -- are not the only ones who hailed the singer for his openness. Writer Dream Hampton wrote on Jay-Z's site Life & Times: ""You shared one of the most intimate things that ever happened to you -- falling in love with someone who wasn't brave enough to love you back. Your relieving yourself of your secret is as much about wanting to honestly connect as it is about exhibition. We are all made better by your decision to share publicly."" Hampton noted that Ocean made his declaration the same week as the high-profile coming out of CNN reporter Anderson Cooper. And she touches on the accusations of homophobia that have long plagued hip hop, which has also taken shots for its misogyny. ""You're a Black man in America whose star is on the rise, working in hip-hop and soul, where gender constructs are cartoonishly fixed,"" Hampton wrote. Terrance Dean, author of the 2008 book ""Hiding in Hip-Hop: On the Downlow in the Entertainment Industry from Music to Hollywood,"" penned an open letter regarding Ocean. ""I actually have been awaiting the day, counting down the hours and minutes as to when one of my friends, or past lovers, would be brave enough to come forward and make a public announcement (My inhale continues to expand),"" Dean said. ""But, it wasn't one of them. No. It was someone younger. Much braver. An artist who isn't hindered by the old relics of Hip Hop, or the entertainment school of, 'Don't you come out or it will ruin your career,' and the record label politics."" So is hip hop ready to be more inclusive of LGBTs? It's a question that is now being hotly debated. The Los Angles Times called Ocean's reveal ""undoubtedly the glass ceiling moment for music. Especially black music, which has long been in desperate need of a voice like Ocean's to break the layers of homophobia. "" In it's article ""5 Things That Will Come Out of Frank Ocean's Coming Out"" the site All Hip Hop predicted that ""Hip-Hop will be forced to cool off on the homophobia. The fact is, Hip-Hop has had gay people in it for a very, very long time. That is a fact and far truer than people care to admit. But, somehow, unlike the rest of the world, the Urban Music world has been slow to accept homosexuality.""","Singer Frank Ocean has gone public with his love for a man .

"(CNN) -- Amid all the furor about the seemingly omnipotent military in Egypt, the disbanded Islamist-dominated parliament and the debate over whether the Muslim Brotherhood will ban beer and bikinis, it's tempting to mutter, ""It's the economy, stupid."" In 18 months of upheaval, all Egypt's economic indicators have headed south. Growth is a projected 1.5% this fiscal year, far too feeble to provide a young and rapidly growing population with jobs (80% of Egypt's population is under age 30). Unemployment, one of the engines of the revolution, is estimated to be as high as 25% among the young. Tourism revenues have fallen sharply, and foreign reserves have dwindled to $15 billion. According to the United Nations, some 40% of Egyptians live below the poverty line; 14 million people subsist on less than $1 a day. Institutions are chronically weak and corruption is endemic. President-elect Mohamed Morsi has his hands full. Many critics say the military has handed Morsi a neutered presidency doomed to fail. But economists who have dealt with the Muslim Brotherhood's economic team describe the team as pragmatic, well-prepared and favorable to the free market. Hernando de Soto, a noted economist who has helped his native Peru empower millions, has consulted with the Muslim Brotherhood. He says that when he met millionaire Khairat el-Shater, the Brotherhood's first presidential candidate who was disqualified for legal matters, el-Shater described himself as ""businessman"" on his card. ""They want to create a market economy for the poor, to bring them into the mainstream,"" de Soto says. The Muslim Brotherhood has pledged to reach a rapid accord with the International Monetary Fund to cool Egypt's borrowing costs and protect the value of its pound. The interim military government raised money by selling bonds to Egyptian investors -- but at rising interest rates, with the yield on the one-year bill reaching a dizzying 16%. The new government will have to repay or roll over some $4 billion in short-term borrowing over the next six months. There have been several rounds of negotiations between the Finance Ministry and the IMF for a $3.2 billion loan, but they have yet to yield an agreement. That amount may now be inadequate. Masood Ahmed, one of the IMF's senior officials for the Middle East, summed up the challenge last month: ""How can we help Egypt now come up with an economic program that would restore confidence, protect poor people and vulnerable households -- and do so in a way that restores confidence during uncertainty?"" Hafez Ghanem, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was recently in Egypt, says the immediate priority is to devise a ""bold, credible program to reduce the outflow of reserves, encourage investment and bring in other donors"" through an agreement with the IMF. He advises the new government to focus on two or three priorities. The first is tackling corruption, which resonates with every Egyptian. ""Real progress on corruption will have to involve a partnership between the government, the private sector and NGOs,"" he says. He looks at the example of Indonesia. After the fall of President Suharto, the new government embarked on decentralization, partnering with nongovernmental organizations and civil society. Results were not immediate, but the perception of change was. The second priority, Ghanem says, must be the subsidies that consume such a large part of the national budget. The country's growing deficit could be cut significantly if fuel subsidies were removed. But that's not going to happen. The Brotherhood is anxious to protect the poor Egyptians who propelled it to power, even though 90% of the subsidy benefits the wealthiest 20% of Egyptians. Fuel and bread subsidies have long been an essential insurance against civil unrest in Egypt. The challenge for Morsi and his government is to better direct them at those most in need. Ghanem says that over two or three years, the subsidy program can be refashioned as income support for the poorest, similar to the ""bolsa familia"" in Brazil that has lifted millions into the middle class. Gasoline stamps, graduated electricity tariffs and a shift in subsidies toward healthier foods -- away from bread and sugar -- all have a role to play, he says. Ghanem says the issue of youth unemployment can only be addressed if the public debt is tackled, something that could have been done already with support from the IMF. But the interim government's refusal to consider foreign financing squeezed liquidity out of the domestic credit market. Gehad el-Haddad, a senior member of the executive committee of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, says he knows it faces a tall order. ""We are warding off the immediate devaluation of the pound and working to regain the trust of investors in the market, to assure them that stability will come under this presidency,"" he says. One of their primary challenges, he stressed, is wiping away remnants of the Mubarak regime's hallmark bureaucracy and patronage networks: ""The economy is our first, second and third priority."" Some still aren't convinced. ""I'm not sure I want to be investing my money when I know the Brotherhood, with little experience in this realm, is at the helm,"" says a senior member of losing presidential candidate Ahmed Shafiq's campaign. ""It doesn't give me and many other liberals much incentive to invest in a civil state that might be compromised by Islamists with unclear motives."" Ahmed El Alfi, chairman of Flat6Labs, a start-up incubator based in Cairo that provides money and support to young entrepreneurs, says fostering entrepreneurship in Egypt is an oft-forgotten component of getting the economy on track. ""Really, this government should just get out of the way and let people work,"" he says. ""The revolution gave people a sense of empowerment. Instead of calling up your dad to call up his friends to get you a government job, now Egyptians are thinking outside of the box, they want to make a difference. We have to nurture this talent, support creativity and harness the power as an economic solution."" But El Alfi worries that continued instability may prompt a brain drain among Egypt's brightest prospects. He notes that most of the budding entrepreneurs that seek Flat6Labs' mentoring are public school educated and from a lower economic bracket. ""These are the people who can't just pack up and move to the West if things get bad,"" he says. ""And they can't be neglected."" Shadi Hamid, director of research at the Brookings Doha Center, says the Brotherhood knows this. ""Put simply, if they can't deliver on the economy, then they'll hemorrhage popularity,"" Hamid says. ""They know they can't fail, and they're committed to delivering with a detailed free-market economic program that also focuses on social welfare."" De Soto says the key to Egypt's long-term prosperity is to find a way to liberate its anarchic ""extra-legal"" economy: the shopkeepers, craftsmen and traders who work below the radar to avoid corruption, taxes and the inertia of the bureaucracy. That would require the streamlining of some 300 laws, he says, and the creation of one organization that could bestow property rights and provide the ""extra-legal"" with a path to a more productive role -- unlocking the vast sums sloshing about in the informal economy. It would be a huge transformation, de Soto says, and it will require promotion and smart messaging. ""But there is a window of opportunity,"" he says. ""That's what revolutions provide."" The same happened in Japan immediately after World War II, unleashing an economy that had been in many ways feudal until then. De Soto's consultancy, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, was commissioned by the Mubarak government eight years ago to study Egypt's informal economy and concluded it was worth 55 times all the foreign direct investment Egypt had received since the Napoleonic era. But none of his recommendations was implemented. De Soto reflects: ""If you're going to change things, your enemy is the status quo."" Marwa Metwally, 23, is the sort of young talent that de Soto wants to see empowered. She's a razor-sharp unemployed college graduate who makes a four-hour commute every day from the Nile Delta governorate of Sharqiya to a nonprofit organization called Education for Employment in Cairo. She says the status quo simply can't continue. ""Though I didn't vote for Morsi in the first round, he can bring the change we need,"" she says. ""The Brotherhood is from the poor, they understand. ... They were oppressed along with all us Egyptians the past 80 years, they have a plan and they know that we can't go on like this. We're dying. It's the breaking point."" But the short-term political uncertainties -- no parliament, a military perhaps committed to that very status quo and a ministerial team yet to gel -- will complicate decision-making. And given the speed with which Egypt's economy has deteriorated, time is a luxury the new government doesn't have.","Egypt's economy is badly suffering after a year and a half of unrest .

"(CNN) -- The gruesome civil war in Syria that pits government forces against rebels is now in its 18th month. Here are the latest key developments: . Deputy PM: Al-Assad's resignation not an acceptable condition for dialogue . Any suggestions of President Bashar al-Assad resigning could be discussed only after a dialogue with Syrian rebels begins, Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil said Tuesday, according to Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Setting his resignation ""as a condition before dialogue means that there will be no dialogue,"" Jamil said during a visit to Russia, according to the report. He added that ""the entire Syrian people should be asked"" about such a possibility. ""If this issue is being imposed on us from abroad, it is a very dangerous precedent in international relations,"" he said, according to RIA Novosti. Syrian state-run news agency SANA quoted Jamil as saying that Syria ""has kept its eyes set on achieving the national reconciliation in Syria."" Jamil and a delegation are now in Moscow. Russia has major trade deals with Syria and, along with China, has blocked repeated efforts in the U.N. Security Council to pass resolutions that many other countries argued could have pressured the Syrian regime to halt its violent crackdown on the opposition. On the ground: 230 killed . At least 230 people were killed Tuesday, including 104 in Damascus and its suburbs and 42 in Aleppo, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syria, on state-run media, said its forces ""continued cleaning Aleppo's neighborhoods from the mercenary terrorists."" The Damascus suburb of Modamiyeh sustained a bloody assault by regime forces Tuesday, with troops storming the city from four directions amid heavy gunfire and shelling, the LCC said. Huge explosions and mortar shelling continue to rock the city, where regime fire killed several people Tuesday, the group said. Syria said its forces battled terrorists in Homs and elsewhere. A Japanese journalist was killed Monday during a gun battle in Aleppo, Syria's largest city and commercial hub. Mika Yamamoto, who worked for the independent Japan Press news agency, was reporting on the rebel Free Syrian Army, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said. ""I have seen the news on the television. I really did not want to believe it,"" her father, Koji Yamamoto, told the Japanese news agency Asahi on Tuesday. ""She always thought of children and women under the fire of conflict and kept saying it's her mandate to tell the stories of those people to the world."" At least 20 other journalists have been killed in Syria during the conflict, according to the nonprofit group Committee to Protect Journalists. Seventeen of the 20 are believed to be work-related deaths; in three cases, it is unclear whether the journalist was killed as a result of his or her work, the group says. On Monday, two other journalists went missing and may have been arrested by the Syrian army. They work for Alhurra TV, a U.S.-based Arabic language station. ""A Japanese female journalist was killed by the regime forces, who also attacked (an) Alhurra TV crew and captured the reporter and his Turkish cameraman,"" a man identified as Capt. Ahmed Ghazala of the Free Syrian Army said in an amateur video that Alhurra aired. CNN trip to get into -- and out of -- Aleppo . Alhurra TV said that it has not been able to reach its crew in Aleppo since Monday and that it was trying to verify reports the team was arrested by the Syrian army. World reaction: New U.N. envoy to meet on Syria . The newly appointed U.N. envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, will visit New York to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and senior aides this week, a U.N. spokesman said. U.S. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, has delivered a stern warning to al-Assad: Use chemical weapons, and risk provoking a military response. ""We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that's a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences, if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons,"" he said Monday. Syria is a juggernaut when it comes to chemical weapons, analysts say. The regime ""probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the Arab world,"" Michael Eisenstadt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said last month. It includes thousands of rocket artillery rounds filled with mustard-type blister agents that can damage skin and lungs, and bombs filled with sarin that attacks the nervous system. Opinion: Chemical weapons threat demands response . Syria has denied owning chemical or biological weapons. But Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi appeared to reverse that stance last month, issuing a veiled threat: . ""No chemical or biological weapons will ever be used ... unless Syria is exposed to external aggression."" Al-Assad has long described the uprising against his rule as a terrorist revolt and a ""foreign conspiracy."" The region: Fierce clashes erupt in neighboring Tripoli, Lebanon . Historic tensions between Sunni Muslims in Tripoli's Bab-al-Tibbaneh neighborhood and Alawite Muslims in the Jabal Mohsen neighborhood boiled over into clashes Tuesday. Children were playing with BB guns, leaving one wounded, said Ali Fedda, a member of the Arab Democratic Party in the neighborhood. Residents then began shooting, and the army intervened in response, Fedda said. In recent months, the Syrian crisis has aggravated decades-old quarrels between residents of the rival neighborhoods. Dozens of gunmen exchanged gunfire, as the Lebanese troops responded to the violence Tuesday afternoon. Two people were killed and 36 injured, Lebanese state-run media reported Tuesday. More: Syria violence fuels kidnapping threats in Lebanon . The strife between Alawites and Sunnis in Tripoli mirrors the conflict in Syria, where al-Assad's regime is dominated by minority Alawites and the opposition is largely made up of Sunnis.

"(CNN) -- Authorities investigating the disappearance of two young girls in Iowa said Saturday that they believe them to still be alive. Lyric Cook, 10, and her cousin Elizabeth Collins, 8, were last seen by their grandmother more than a week ago when they left on a bike ride. ""We believe these girls are alive and we are not discouraged by the passage of time since their disappearance,"" FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault told reporters in Evansdale, Iowa. She declined to discuss exactly what evidence investigators might have that pushed them toward that conclusion. Breault said she believes someone knows something, and she urged anyone with information to step forward. Grandmother: 'We will fight' A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the successful recovery of the girls and the prosecution of the person, or people, responsible, she said. ""Cooperation with law enforcement is the key factor in discovering the whereabouts of Lyric and Elizabeth. Unfortunately, in this case law enforcement has not received total cooperation from all family and close friends. It's important to note that the majority of the family has cooperated 100%,"" Breault said. ""We believe there's someone out there and we would urge them to come forward."" Family of missing Iowa girls 'bracing for the worst, but hoping for the best' The girls' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake hours after they were reported missing July 13. A search of the 25-acre lake turned up nothing, and the FBI is confident the girls aren't in the lake, said Breault. Authorities are now calling their disappearance an abduction.

"Geneva (CNN) -- Last week United States senators expressed dismay and outrage to learn that the uniforms for American Olympians were produced in China. But this is not new. For years unrestrained globalization has seen textile and clothing multinationals race to the bottom in the search for cheaper and cheaper production. The end of the Multi Fiber trade agreement saw the volume of textile imports to the U.S. from China more than double from 2004 to 2011. The phasing out of quota arrangements has led to the loss of millions of textile and garment jobs in industrialized and developing countries alike. For example, in 1980 West Germany had 4,055 textile and clothing manufacturers. Now, Germany as a whole has only 690. As it is cheaper to manufacture in countries that do not enforce international labour standards or pay workers a living wage, textiles and apparel are most often sourced from low wage countries such as China, India and Vietnam. Developing countries need jobs for their growing populations, but they have to be good jobs, without exploitation by companies from the industrialized world. USOC: It's too late to remake Team USA uniforms for London Games . Like with Ralph Lauren for the U.S. Olympic team, a $156 million deal with Adidas makes the company a key sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics. The company is providing sportswear for the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations, and owns exclusive licensing rights for all sportswear sold at London 2012 venues and stores. Like Ralph Lauren, Adidas is not manufacturing the majority of its products in the UK, or even in Europe, but is sourcing its Olympic apparel from a range of low wage countries including China, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. What's really 'Made in America' A worldwide alliance of trade unions and NGOs established the Play Fair Campaign in 2003 to demand that the Olympic principles of fairness and respect are extended to workers producing Olympic goods. In May this year the Play Fair campaign published a report on Olympic supplier plants in China, the Philippines and Sri Lanka that found the working conditions fell far short of the expectations of the London 2012 organizing committee (LOCOG). Far from being paid a wage sufficient to meet basic needs and provide some discretionary income -- a requirement for all London 2012 suppliers -- workers were receiving poverty wages. Half of the workers that spoke with the researchers in the Philippines told us they rely on ""pay day loans"" to get through the month, despite working more than 60 hours a week during busy periods. In Sri Lanka workers earned as little as $79 per month, and estimated this was only about one quarter of a living wage. Play Fair demands that multinational companies do more than pay lip service to human rights: they need to pay prices that enable suppliers to pay a living wage, they need to make sure that factories have the capacity to meet deadlines without requiring exploitatively long working hours, and they need to go beyond audits and engage workers and their unions in efforts to truly understand what conditions in supplier factories are like. Everyone wants to be proud of the Olympic athletes representing their country and not squirm in their seats when thinking of how the clothing the teams are wearing was produced. It is not right that workers in Indonesian footwear factories produce dozens of trainers each day, yet it would cost their entire monthly wage of $102 if they were to buy a single pair. From our readers: U.S. Olympians should go naked . With labor costing as little as 50 cents in the manufacture of a $100 sports shoe in China or Vietnam, paying a living wage would have a negligible impact on retail price. As consumers we need to tell multinational companies and governments loud and clear that we are willing to pay the price for decent conditions of work. Alternative view: Why NOT make Olympic uniforms in China? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jyrki Raina.","Senators outraged to learn that uniforms for U.S. Olympians made in China .

"(CNN) -- Unknown gunmen attacked an American diplomatic vehicle south of Mexico City, injuring three people, a Mexican military official told CNN Mexico. The motive behind the attack on the U.S. vehicle, which was on a diplomatic mission, was not immediately known. Gunmen inside what was described as a Mexican federal police vehicle fired upon a U.S. Embassy vehicle, said the official, who declined to be named for security reasons. The Mexican official said three Mexican marines were injured in the shooting. However, there were conflicting reports. Some Mexican reports stated that two of the injured were Americans. The injured passengers were transported to a hospital in Cuernavaca, Mexico. The Drug Enforcement Administration confirmed that a U.S. diplomatic vehicle was ""shot up"" in Mexico, but said no DEA officers were involved in the incident. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the reports, but had no immediate comment. The U.S. vehicle was attacked on a highway between Mexico City and Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias. Mexico's federal police said that its personnel were not involved in the shooting. Their forces appeared at the scene only after the shooting to secure the perimeter, police said. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: There are conflicting reports on the nationalities of the injured .

"(CNN) -- He sits, relaxed, one arm propped casually on top of a couch, describing his work as a stripper and adult escort. He talks about the difficulty drawing a line between his personal and professional lives and how he responds to aggressive clients. ""Some clients, mostly the ones that are on drugs or drinking alcohol, can get very violent, but I know how to handle myself in that situation. Basically I've been around and I know what to say and what not to say in a dangerous situation,"" the young man reports. Those words, spoken in 2007 to ""Naked News,"" an Internet-based service, took on fresh meaning as the man on the couch was identified by Naked News to be Luka Rocco Magnotta, a porn actor accused of killing and dismembering a man in Canada. He was arrested in a Berlin internet cafe Monday, ending an international manhunt. See details of arrest in Germany . ""I really do enjoy my work. I get to meet new people all the time. I'm a people person,"" Magnotta, who used a pseudonym during the interview, told Naked News, a self-described nude news program. He said he'd traveled around the world as a ""high end"" escort and had the opportunity to meet influential people. ""The best part about being an escort is I'm my own boss. I get to pick my own hours and I make a lot of money,"" Magnotta said, laughing. The Naked News interview was apparently just one in a very long line of Internet appearances by Magnotta in images and words -- on porn sites and what appears to be his own website, where he defends himself as the victim of cyber-stalkers out to get him. In months and years past, he was pegged as a serial kitten-killer by animal rights activists, and as a man who may have dated a Canadian woman convicted of drugging, raping, torturing and killing young girls almost two decades ago. A journalist who met him described him as ""creepy."" All the charges, however, paled in comparison to last week's accusations against Magnotta as he became the center of Canada's most talked-about crime. Authorities launched a massive manhunt for Magnotta after a severed hand was sent to Canada's Liberal Party, a foot was sent to the Conservatives and a torso was stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash of the Montreal apartment building where he lived. Inside Magnotta's apartment in Monreal, police found dried bloodstains on the table, the bed, the bathtub and the refrigerator. Montreal police Commander Ian Lefreniere said officers who have been investigating crimes for 30 years had never encountered such a grisly scene before. To make matters more chilling, Lefreniere said Magnotta filmed himself in the act of dismembering a body, the shocking 10-minute video then posted online for all to see. Magnotta was born in 1982 in Scarborough, just outside Toronto, as Eric Clinton Newman. He changed his name to Magnotta in 2006, according to the Toronto Star. Sometimes, he used the alias Vladimir Romanov. His website has writings in Russian as well as a link in Arabic that takes readers to an explanation of homosexuality. A search for Magnotta on Google last week yielded a plethora of images that match his description of himself: A model, an actor, a porn star. There are images of Magnotta half or fully naked, in suggestive poses, lips always pouted. Reporter Joe Warmington of the Toronto Sun met Magnotta in 2007. There were rumors then that Magnotta was romantically linked to Karla Homolka, who many years before was arrested for the rape-murders of three Ontario girls, including her own sister. In a plea bargain deal, she was sentenced to only 12 years in prison. She had been released from prison when the rumors about Magnotta started, Warmington said. He asked Magnotta to come to the Sun building -- he was nervous to meet him in an unfamiliar location. He had bleached blond hair and wore black leather. He said his modeling career was careening because of the rumors. ""I very quickly determined he was narcissistic,"" Warmington said. ""He was a guy looking for attention in a creepy way -- name dropping one of our most notorious criminals."" Warmington felt Magnotta was a ""little out there."" Coherent but not connecting. But he didn't sense him to be dangerous. When police released his name last week, Warmington felt chills. ""It freaked me out,"" he said. Magnotta's name is also familiar to animal rights activists who accuse him of being a serial kitten-killer. They say the man in a YouTube video killing kittens by drowning and asphyxiation and then using the carcasses in sexual acts is Magnotta. A Facebook group started in December 2010 identified Magnotta by name on its page, dubbed him the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer"" and asked for help in tracking him down. Last week, a post on the page said: ""We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police ... Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed. Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals.""

"(CNN) -- With an acting career that spans three decades, Ralph Macchio is right at home in front of the camera. But with the new National Geographic reality show ""American Gypsies"" premiering at 9 ET Tuesday night, the 50-year-old actor is going behind the lens as an executive producer. With ""American Gypsies,"" Macchio is training the spotlight on the New York-based Johns family, a Romany clan that's balancing holding on to its traditions while pursuing the American Dream, he said. ""American Gypsies"" was a bit like chasing a dream for Macchio, who said that the show's development took nearly five years as he bounced the concept around various networks. ""You want to surrender and give up so many times, but it adds validity to the fact that if you never give up you have the chance of finally making it,"" he said. Macchio spoke with CNN about the new show, what he's learned as an executive producer and why he isn't a big fan of reality TV. CNN: What was the impetus to develop a show around this family? Ralph Macchio: (The son of) a friend of mine and his film student partner, they were making a documentary on the Johns family. I saw some footage, and I was just immediately fascinated by this subculture that exists right in my city, right in New York. The characters and personalities were just popping off the screen, and I said this story needs to be told; this family could make entertaining television. I brought it to Stick Figure Productions, who I was involved with developing something for MTV at the time, and it felt like the right match. From there, we shaped a trailer and started pitching to a bunch of networks. ... At the end of the day, after years of time, National Geographic stepped up and said, ""We'll give you nine or 10 episodes on the air."" CNN: What can viewers expect to see? Macchio: Over the first season they'll see the growth within the family as far as finding the balance between (having) one foot in the American Dream side and the other rooted in the Gypsy age-old traditions. ... There'll be no shortage of the Gypsy court hearings and the conflicts and the psychic shop dilemmas. There's a lot of stuff going on, but the human elements are what I'm hoping will make this a long run rather than a flash-in-the-pan idea. CNN: What were the hurdles you were coming across when you were working to get this show to production? Macchio: It's an unorthodox, for lack of a better description, lifestyle. I use the word subculture because it is that. I think once you pitch it up a ladder of the network, and it gets to the corporate end, there's some who might frown upon taking a peek inside this world where there are arranged marriages, the kids are homeschooled, some of them don't know how to read -- which is an element of our first episode. This is one family that I just think is fascinating, and the characters are intriguing. Family comes first for them, and that's relatable to me. CNN: Did you know anything about this culture before you watched that footage? Macchio: No, and that's what was fascinating. A lot of the footage was about a wedding and also the whole psychic world. You're either a skeptic or a believer, and I fall way on the skeptic side, big time. But they claim they have a gift. It is an odd business, and not one that I would wholeheartedly invest in and embrace, but it's a belief. To me, it's just peeling back the curtain a little bit on this one unique family and what their culture is, whether you agree with it or not. The stereotypes (about this culture) are so negative. So I think the Johnses want to be recognized as a minority group and not those stereotypes. CNN: Why'd you use Gypsy in the title, and how (did) the Johns family feel about it? Macchio: Why isn't it called American Romany? That's a marketing thing. ... People understand that more than they understand Romany. I think the Johnses understand. Throughout the show, they speak of that and sort of educate about the misnomers of the ""Gypsy"" slang, but they get that's going to bring people to the table. CNN: Did you have any concerns about misrepresenting this group? Representing an ethnic group in a reality show can get dicey. Macchio: I agree with you. I have members of my family and friends who are from the old school who would never watch ""The Sopranos"" or ""Jersey Shore."" Now, ""Jersey Shore"" is a show that was cast; they went out and looked for those characters. But the Johns family is the Johns family; we did not cast them. This is not indicative of all Gypsy families nor do I endorse some of their choices. The traditions, the elder Gypsy court, the psychic businesses -- that's not made up, that's part of the culture. But how they react, their personalities, how they deal with conflict -- that's the Johns family, not necessarily every family. CNN: This is your first time as an executive producer for a reality program -- what were the biggest lessons you learned? Macchio: (Laughs) I'm still learning them. But the lesson I'm learning, once you get into TV, because the goal is to make sure they don't reach for the remote in a minute and a half, stuff is cut for drama and sometimes it's cut for train wreck, which is my least favorite form of entertainment. It's trying to stay true to story and character and integrity and still getting your audience to come to the table and having to deal with the buyers at the networks who control the end result of what comes on the air. That you struggle with in any form of it -- there's that old corny phrase, it ain't show art, it's show business. Hopefully, at the end of the day the human elements of the Johns family is what makes the show last. The bells and whistles are short-lived I think. Having both makes it exciting and entertaining. CNN: Did you watch any reality TV to prep for this? Macchio: I am not a reality TV fan for the most part. I'm an actor who wants more opportunities to act, so reality programming drains the marketplace for opportunities. But it's like great news programming -- real is more fascinating than fiction if you can invest and connect with the characters and the stories, so I see the worth in it. I did relent to do ""Dancing With the Stars"" after passing on it twice, and it turned out to be a fantastic thing for me. I don't run to it, but I get the appeal for sure. I just came off from the acting side. I just finished a film called ""Hitchcock"" with Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren and Scarlett Johansson. I'm really excited about that. CNN: Tell me more about that. Macchio: I play the screenwriter of ""Psycho"" -- the film is about Hitchcock's mindset during the making of that film and what was going on in his life. It's very smart, humorous and heartfelt. I'm also recurring as Fran Drescher's latest love interest on ""Happily Divorced."" I go back in October to shoot some more. We'll see how long that goes before they find out this isn't the right guy for her because you know what happens with couples on a sitcom. So I've been busy.","Actor Ralph Macchio now wears an executive producer hat .

"London (CNN) -- U.S. hopes for gymnast Gabby Douglas to repeat her gold-winning form Tuesday were dashed as she took a tumble from the balance beam -- but it was a day of joy for her teammate Aly Raisman, as Raisman claimed bronze in that event followed by a gold in the floor exercise. Raisman, who just missed out on a medal in the women's individual all-around, beat Catalina Ponor of Romania and Russia's Aliya Mustafina to clinch victory. ""It was the best routine I've ever done,"" she said. ""My coach said it was the best routine he'd ever seen me do."" She took the third spot in the beam after a U.S. challenge to the initial results saw Ponor pushed down to fourth. China's Deng Linlin and Sui Lu took gold and silver, respectively, in that event. The pint-sized Douglas swung back onto the beam to continue her routine, but the slip was too costly for her to place better than seventh. Douglas, nicknamed the ""Flying Squirrel"" for her aerial agility on the uneven bars, has won a new legion of fans after her thrilling win in the women's individual all-around early in the Games, but has seen medal chances slip through her fingers since. The 16-year-old's unfortunate mistake on the balance beam followed disappointment in the uneven bars Monday, when she came in eighth. ""It was an amazing finals with so many great competitors,"" she said after Monday's event. ""Coming into bar finals was a big challenge for me, and I made a little mistake. Even if I would have hit a solid routine, I know I have a lower start value than the other competitors."" Victory in the men's parallel bars went to China's Feng Zhe, ahead of Germany's Marcel Nguyen in silver position and France's Hamilton Sabot.. Happy hosts crown new medals king . Great Britain celebrated eight medals Tuesday, giving it 48 for the Olympics, one more than for the 2008 Beijing Games. Team GB has won 22 golds, most since the 1908 Olympics, also held in London. There was early disappointment for Team GB, though, as triple jumper Phillips Idowu failed to make it through the qualification round. The athlete, an east London native and Beijing silver medalist, had been the focus of much injury speculation in the run-up to the Games. Joy and tears were in evidence in the velodrome, the scene of a moving end to two great British Olympic cycling careers. Chris Hoy took the top spot in the men's keirin cycle race, making him the first British Olympian to win six gold medals. ""I'm in shock,"" Hoy told the BBC, official broadcaster for the Games. ""This is just surreal, this is what I always wanted, I wanted to win gold in front of my home crowd."" Hoy, now 36, said he was 99.9% sure he would not be competing in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. ""This is the perfect end to my Olympic career,"" he said. But Britain's Victoria Pendleton was denied a similar fairytale ending when Australia's Anna Meares took gold in the women's track cycling sprint after a dramatic finish, leaving her with silver. An emotional Pendleton, who retires after these Games, said, ""I can't believe it's all over."" But, she added, ""I'm very glad to be saying it's the last time I'm going to go through this."" The silver medal capped a week of ups and downs for the 31-year-old, who was disqualified from the women's team sprint alongside teammate Jess Varnish last week but then won gold in the women's keirin. Team GB's Laura Trott won the women's omnium, a cycling contest made up of six events. American rider Sarah Hammer had been well placed going into the final stage but slipped down the rankings. British track cyclists have won seven golds in these Games, while those from other nations have won no more than one each. There was also early exaltation for the home crowds Tuesday, as brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee of Team GB split gold and bronze between them in the triathlon, with Spain's Javier Gomez winning silver. Thousands of flag-waving spectators had flocked to watch the competitors in the men's triathlon swim in the chilly Serpentine lake, cycle laps of the Hyde Park area and run a final grueling 10 kilometers. Alistair Brownlee strolled over waving a Union flag as he claimed an emphatic win -- Britain's first ever gold in the event -- while Jonny Brownlee made a brave recovery to take bronze after taking a 15-second time penalty for a bungled transition between phases. In the equestrian sphere, Britain's riders Carl Hester, Laura Bechtolsheimer and Charlotte Dujardin took the home nation's first dressage gold, after holding their German rivals to a silver and the Netherlands to bronze in the team grand prix special. The victory, which was watched from the stands by Princess Anne, came a day after Team GB claimed gold in the team showjumping. Golden girls of the sand look for three-peat . In women's beach volleyball the U.S. is guaranteed gold and silver. On Tuesday, the pairs of Kerri Walsh-Misty May-Treanor and Jennifer Kessy-April Ross each won their semifinal matches. Walsh and May-Treanor are going for a third Olympic gold. ""They were playing awesome but we made it happen,"" May-Treanor said of their Chinese opponents. ""I'm speechless. I think we played as a unit, so I'm very happy. I had a picture in my head at the beginning of the season of how I wanted us to play, and we're living that picture, but it's not over yet."" Kessy and Ross beat Brazilians Juliana and Larissa to reach the final. ""We were always trying to prove ourselves, but with that match we don't need to do that anymore,"" Kessy said. Track star overcomes injury to win 1,500 meters . As the rain came down in the buzzing Olympic Stadium, the evening session was highlighted by the men's 1,500-meter final. It turned into tactical race where the favored Kenyans faded down the final backstretch. Taoufik Makhloufi of Algeria pulled away in the final 300 meters and won easily in 3:34.08, well off the world record. In a bit of a surprise, Leonel Manzano of the United States took the silver. It was the first U.S. medal in the event since Jim Ryun won silver in 1968. ""I've been training to the best of my ability, it was an amazing time,"" Manzano said. ""It was the only time I've ever cried after a race."" Abdalaati Iguider of Morocco edged Matt Centrowitz of the United States for the bronze. The top finishing Kenyan was Silas Kiplagat, who was seventh. Makhloufi was only in the race thanks to a doctor's note that said he had an injured knee. He had been expelled from the Olympics by the governing body of track and field, which said he had not put in a real effort in 800-meter qualifying. If one of his knees was injured, you never would have known it Tuesday. ""It was the will of God, yesterday I was out, today I was in,"" he said. ""I have a problem with my left leg and it may need surgery."" Australia's Sally Pearson, as predicted, won the 100-meter hurdles final, but only by .02 seconds. Despite poor conditions for hurdling, she beat the United States' Dawn Harper to the line in an Olympic record time of 12.35. ""Relief was the first thing I felt and then shock,"" Pearson said. ""I'm just going through the emotions. I really wanted this. I've worked so hard for two years. To see my name on the scoreboard, I just can't believe it."" The medal success for the Americans continued in the high jump where Erik Kynard took silver. Russia's Ivan Ukhov leapt to gold. In the other final of the night, Robert Harting of Germany won discus gold.

"(CNN) -- Unless you've been living under a rock, you know people are concerned about the deficit. Or at least they say they are. You'd also have to be willfully ignoring everything around you not to know that health care spending is a significant cause, if not the cause, of our long-term fiscal problems. The narrative that seems to be going around Washington argues that there are two schools of thought about how to improve our financial outlook. One side wants to cut spending. The other side wants to increase taxes. Or, so it goes. I was out to dinner on Saturday night with a friend who is rather pessimistic about compromise in our government. He believes that the chances for passing anything that might reduce spending on health care in the future are near zero. There's just one problem with his outlook. We've already passed a law that does a great deal to reduce future health care spending. I have argued many times that I don't think the Affordable Care Act does enough to contain costs. I still believe that's true. But let's not ignore the fact that it does a lot. More, in fact, than anything else passed by Congress and signed into law by a president in quite some time. Right off the bat, we need to remember that the Affordable Care Act makes significant cuts to future Medicare spending. Reductions in overpayments for Medicare Advantage constitute almost $140 billion in savings over a decade. Changes in the fee-for-service reimbursement schedule add up to almost $200 billion. That's an enormous amount of money, so large that it scared many people into thinking that Medicare would be severely curtailed. Running against Medicare cuts helped sweep the Republicans into power in the House of Representatives in 2010. Often, such arguments came from the same people now decrying the Affordable Care Act for not cutting health care spending enough. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. There are lots of other payment reforms (PDF) that should ""bend the curve"" for Medicare in the next decade. Hospitals will be punished for re-admissions for certain conditions. This is expected to save $8.2 billion. Refusing payments for hospital-acquired conditions should save another $3.2 billion. Accountable care organizations, for better or for worse, are expected to save almost $5 billion in the first eight years as well. Everyone hates waste in the system. The health care act does something about that as well. Specifically, it strengthens our means to investigate and then go after people who abuse Medicare or Medicaid. The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that the health care act's provisions for abuse of these programs could reduce spending by an additional $1.8 billion. Surely you've heard about the Independent Payment Advisory Board? This one, too, has cost the administration politically. It's been demonized as an actual ""death panel"" of unelected, unaccountable people who will ration your Medicare. That's not true. The panel is made up of people who need Senate approval (not easy), and they don't serve for life. Moreover, they have a very specific, limited task. If, and only if, the amount of money Medicare spends per person goes up faster than the consumer price index, the panel will make recommendations to Congress on how to get Medicare to spend less. By statute, they can't ""ration"" care or increase premiums, deductibles or co-payments. Still, what makes this a better cost control than what existed before is that these recommendations automatically become law unless Congress can pass a different plan that achieves the same savings. Because Congress has a hard time passing anything these days, that's not as likely to happen. The payment advisory board gets going in 2014, and in just its first five years, it's expected to reduce spending for all Medicare programs by more than $23 billion (PDF). These are just mechanisms acting on government insurance, though. The Affordable Care Act has some measures that affect private spending as well. The excise tax is one of those. Starting in 2018, plans that cost more than a certain amount will have a 40% tax levied on employers who provide them. Let's acknowledge that such taxes will absolutely be passed on to regular people, so it doesn't matter who is stuck with the bill at first. It's also worth acknowledging that the levels where the tax kicks in are really high ($10,200 for an individual plan and $27,500 for a family). Even so, many believe that this will eventually be one of the strongest levers the Affordable Care Act contains to rein in spending in the future. We should also mention the insurance exchanges themselves. Although it will take time to work out the kinks, the general idea is that the exchanges should reduce the administrative burden of individually rating and selling plans to consumers. Insurance companies instead will have to compete on value, and try to negotiate with providers to reduce spending to remain competitive. We'll have to see how well this works. Finally, the law invests in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and the CMS Innovation Center, which may lead to new ideas to contain costs as well. These are difficult to score, but they are being researched. You could argue that any one of these (other than the cuts to Medicare) is on the smaller side. But when you add them up, they start to get significant. So much so, that the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Affordable Care Act reduced the long-term fiscal gap by 2% of the gross domestic product over the next 75 years. That's about 25% to 33% of what is necessary to stabilize the debt in the long run. Granted, some of that deficit reduction comes from new taxes. But some of it also comes from reduction in future spending. Parts of the act cost money. Parts of the act save money. Overall, it is deficit reducing. You may not like these types of efforts. They may offend your political sensibilities. You may favor a more consumer-driven type of system, or one that relies less on panels of experts. But there's a difference between arguing that you want different measures and pretending those measures don't exist. Further, some have argued that these measures won't last. Someone will change them. Someone will gut them. But you have to remember that right now, they are law. Making them weaker requires action. Specifically, it requires a House and Senate to pass something altering them, and then a president to agree to sign it. That's hard to do in today's environment. Of course, some are campaigning on trying to do that right now. They want to overturn all of the above completely. That's fine; it's their right. But it's hard to understand how you can argue that the ""other side"" isn't serious about decreasing future health care spending while simultaneously working toward overturning the law it passed that does just that. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Aaron E. Carroll.","Aaron E. Carroll: Idea that GOP wants to cut, Democrats want to spend is a myth .

"(EW.com) -- Four weeks after the shootings in Aurora, Colo., the box office remains in a relative slump — despite performing over 20 percent better than the same weekends in 2011 and 2010. According to industry consulting firm Screen Engine, 17 percent of moviegoers are still reluctant to head to the theater following the shooting. While that number has dropped from the 21 percent who claimed they were reluctant one week after the shooting, it's still telling — and discouraging — for Hollywood. Fortunately, moviegoers have a lot of options to choose from. When the top seven movies at the box office all earn over $10 million, it's clear that the box office isn't in totally dire straits, but it doesn't seem to be firing on all cylinders. Sylvester Stallone and his weathered crew of grizzly action stars (and fresh-faced Liam Hemsworth) pushed their explosive sequel ""The Expendables 2"" to a $28.8 million debut, 17 percent lower than the $34.8 million bow of 2010′s original ""Expendables."" The number one debut marks the first time pop culture icon Chuck Norris has ever topped the box office. There really is nothing he can't do. Lionsgate spent $35 million to acquire the film, which was made by Nu Image for a reported $90 million. Audiences, which were 63 percent male and 65 percent above the age of 25 (both older and more male despite the addition of Hemsworth), issued the film a healthy ""A-"" CinemaScore grade. The explosive action entry also earned markedly better reviews than its predecessor, which could spur positive word-of-mouth, which Expendables 2 will need in order to match the original's $103.1 million domestic finish and for Stallone to justify another sequel. ""The Bourne Legacy"" held second place after dropping 55 percent to $17 million. Universal's $125 million sequel, which replaced star Matt Damon with ""The Avengers'"" Jeremy Renner, has now earned $69.6 million after ten days. By comparison, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" earned $69.3 million during its opening weekend in 2007. Focus Features' ""ParaNorman"" kicked off its run in third place with $14 million — a touch behind the $16.8 million that Coraline, which was also made by Laika Entertainment, earned in its debut. The 3-D flick, about a boy who can communicate with the dead, launched very wide in 3,429 theaters, and it achieved a rather lackluster $4,085 venue average — the least of any of the newcomers, including ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"" which found about $4,199 at each of its 2,598 theaters. Audiences gave ""ParaNorman"" a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade, which, again, was the lowest of any of the new releases, despite the fact that it earned the strongest critical reviews by far. ""ParaNorman"" will need some incredible holds in order to match Coraline's $75.3 million finish, but that film benefited from being part of the 3-D craze that peaked in 2009. ""ParaNorman"" is entering a very different marketplace where 3-D affection has long since passed. In fourth, Will Ferrell and Zack Galifinakis' comedy ""The Campaign"" dipped 50 percent to $13.4 million, which lifted the R-rated hit's total to $51.7 million. While ""The Campaign"" will likely miss the $100 million mark, it cost Warner Bros. only $30 million to make, and it should prove a profitable venture for the studio. The allure of Whitney Houston's final performance didn't drive many crowds to Sparkle, which began in fifth place with $12 million. As a point of comparison, the concert doc Michael Jackson: ""This Is It"" -- which arrived four months after Michael Jackson's death — started off hotter than ""Sparkle,"" earning $23.2 million in its opening weekend in October 2009 on the way to a $72.1 million finish. Sparkle didn't have 3-D ticket prices working on its side, but still, its less-than-stellar box office is somewhat surprising given Houston's status as pop royalty. Fortunately, the ScreenGems release cost only $14 million, and that low cost will be its saving grace. Thanks to a narrow theater count of 2,244, ""Sparkle"" notched a sturdy, if uninspiring, $5,348 per theater average, and if it can garner strong word-of-mouth — which seems likely given its ""A"" CinemaScore grade — it could find legs in the weeks to come. ""Sparkle's"" leading lady Jordin Sparks, who won Season 6 of ""American Idol,"" isn't the first Idol champ to show up at the box office, though she did garner the strongest opening weekend results. Season 4 winner Carrie Underwood had a supporting role in 2011′s ""Soul Surfer,"" which opened to $10.6 million on the way to a $43.9 million finish. Season 1 winner Kelly Clarkson led the famously awful musical ""From Justin To Kelly,"" which earned $4.9 million total in 2003. Now, if only Sparks could match their album sales. As reported yesterday, sixth place finisher ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" which grossed $11.1 million (down 41 percent) in its fifth weekend, passed the $400 million milestone. It has now earned $409.9 million total, and has passed ""The Hunger Games"" ($407.7 million) as the 12th highest-grossing domestic performer of all time. The final new release of the weekend, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green,"" started back in seventh place with $10.9 million. Disney's $25 million family drama, which stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner, earned $4.3 million on Wednesday and Thursday, which gives it an unremarkable five-day total of $15.2 million. ""Odd Life,"" which was issued an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade, will have to rely on (leafy) legs to drive its business. Garner has had bad luck at the box office ever since her breakout leading role in 2004′s ""13 Going on 30."" She has a few bright spots on her resume — namely the ensemble comedy ""Valentine's Day,"" which earned $110.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, the Matthew McConaughey rom-com ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,"" which grossed $55.3 million — but she's mostly starred in major misfires like Elektra ($24.4 million total), Catch and Release ($15.5 million), The Invention of Lying ($18.5 million), and Arthur ($33 million). Bubbling under the Top 10 at number 13, the anti-Obama documentary 2016 Obama's America expanded from 61 theaters into 169 locations, and increased its gross by 294 percent to $1.25 million. Tellingly, the film's per theater average increased from $5,202 to $7,391 this weekend, a rare feat at the box office — but especially when a film's theater count nearly triples. 2016 Obama's America has grossed $2.1 million in six weeks, and if it maintains this sort of momentum, it could become a major sleeper hit. Keep an eye on it. 1. The Expendables 2 -- $28.8 million . 2. The Bourne Legacy -- $17.0 million . 3. ParaNorman -- $14.0 million . 4. The Campaign -- $13.4 million . 5. Sparkle -- $12.0 million . 6.

"Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romania's leftist government began impeachment proceedings Wednesday to suspend President Traian Basescu. In a motion filed in parliament, the ruling coalition accused the president of violating the country's constitution and overstepping his authority. The motion is the latest in a series of attacks over the past month between Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta. A vote on the motion scheduled for Friday is expected to pass, given that the coalition holds a comfortable majority in parliament. If this were to happen, Basescu would be suspended for a month and the country would hold a referendum within 30 days on whether he should remain in office. During the president's suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the newly appointed president of the Senate, would assume the interim presidency. The ruling alliance of Social Democrats and Liberals this week passed a law making it easier for the coalition to impeach Basescu. In addition, Ponta accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they be replaced. The court, in turn, said Ponta was trying to dismantle it and threaten its independence. EU Commissioner for Justice Viviane Reding said on Twitter that she was ""seriously concerned about the recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania."" On Tuesday, the ruling coalition sacked the heads of both chambers of parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to Ponta. Also Tuesday, the coalition dismissed the country's ombudsman, whom it accused of political bias. The newly appointed ombudsman, Valer Dorneanu, is a former Social Democrat member of parliament. Basescu told reporters Tuesday that the country's current situation can be compared with riots that occurred in June 1990 by miners who staged violent demonstrations in the streets of Bucharest with the goal of bringing about political change. ""I warn the politicians that by breaking the country's laws and constitution, the country and its 22 million people are put in an extremely difficult situation,"" Basescu said. The impeachment motion is to be read Thursday during a special meeting of parliament. Coalition leader Antonescu has invited Basescu to address parliament directly on the matter. The political developments have raised concern from some observers about the state of democracy in Romania. U.S. Ambassador to Bucharest Mark Gitenstein said he was ""deeply concerned"" that the independence of the country's democratic institutions was under threat. Romania's government became the object of international criticism after Ponta was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral thesis. Ponta dismissed the accusation as a political attack from Basescu. The two men also argued over who was entitled to represent Romania at last month's meeting of the European Council in Brussels. Ponta received Parliament's vote to go to Brussels on behalf of the country, but the Constitutional Court ruled that president Basescu had the right to attend the event. In the end, the prime minister ignored the court's ruling and traveled to Brussels. The coalition government has come under criticism recently for ordering that Romania's Cultural Institute report not to the president, as it had been doing, but to the Senate. The institute is known for promoting Romania's cultural values and projects abroad as well as for supporting its artists, writers and cultural movements. The country's civil society and anti-corruption agencies addressed on Wednesday a letter to the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, expressing concern over this ""unprecedented attack"" on the rule of law. On Wednesday evening, some 300 people protested in front of the Government and at University Square in Bucharest. While some called for Basescu and Ponta to step down, others expressed concern over the threats to the country's democratic institutions. Ponta recently acknowledged that Romania is going through a credibility crisis at an international level but predicted the turmoil would end after this fall's parliamentary elections.","Leftist government files a motion with parliament to suspend the president .

"(CNN) -- An 11-year-old Christian girl has been arrested after being accused of blasphemy by burning pages of the Quran in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad. According to a statement released by the president's office Sunday, the girl, identified as Ramsha, was accused by a local resident of burning pages of the Muslim holy text after she gathered paper as fuel for cooking. Local media reports said the girl has Down syndrome. CNN was unable to confirm these reports, and a local police official said they are not true. Qasim Niazi, the police officer in charge of the station near where the incident took place, said the girl does not have a mental disorder but is illiterate and has not attended school. The accused girl had told him she had no idea there were pages of the Quran inside the documents she burned, he added. Niazi said that 150 people had gathered on Friday where the neighborhood's Christian population lives and threatened to burn down their houses. ""The mob wanted to burn the girl to give her a lesson,"" he told CNN. Other Christian families living in the area have fled fearing a backlash, he added. Petition: Free Pakistani Christian woman set for execution . The statement from President Asif Ali Zardari said he has called for an urgent report on the incident and added that vulnerable sections of society must be protected ""from any misuse of the blasphemy law."" ""Blasphemy by anyone cannot be condoned but no one will be allowed to misuse blasphemy law for settling personal scores,"" said the president's spokesman, Farhatullah Babar. Critics of the controversial law say it is being used to persecute religious minorities. Politician and former international cricketer Imran Khan tweeted: ""Shameful!

"(CNN) -- Tony Scott made movies, in the best sense of the word. Some of them got poor reviews. Some of them were burdened with sketchy scripts. But almost all of them -- from his first big hit, ""Top Gun"" (1986) to his most recent major release, ""Unstoppable"" (2010) -- were entertaining, well-acted and smoothly polished examples of the motion picture art. Scott, who died in an apparent suicide Sunday, was known for action, but what made his films distinctive was a feel for the human side of things. ""Take another look at 'Man on Fire' and check out the extraordinary chemistry Scott develops between (Denzel) Washington and the young girl (Dakota Fanning) he's protecting,"" wrote Deadline.com's Pete Hammond. ""Sure it has all the requisite action and violence we've come to expect from a Scott film, but it also has a strong human dimension missing from a lot of films."" ""He was one of the very few Hollywood action directors who could actually tell a story,"" added CNN commenter OnTilt. "" 'Crimson Tide' is the perfect example. Brilliant movie. So is 'True Romance.' A highly underrated film."" Coroner, director Tony Scott's family dispute cancer report . Indeed, it was no accident that the same Scott who reveled in screaming planes, racing trains and hard-charging automobiles also produced the TV series ""Numb3rs"" and ""The Good Wife"" -- taut dramas with clever, layered roles -- as well as the character-driven films ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007), ""In Her Shoes"" (2005) and ""The Gathering Storm"" (2002). The latter, an HBO film that starred Albert Finney as Winston Churchill, won Scott an Emmy, which he shared with brother Ridley and others in their company, Scott Free Productions. Scott first got into film through his brother; the two worked together in Ridley's advertising shop, Ridley Scott Associates. Even after his motion picture success, Tony still did commercials: among his recent outings were ads for Diet Mountain Dew and Dodge Ram trucks. Tony Scott made his feature directing debut with 1983's ""The Hunger,"" a vampire film that got more attention in its time for its eroticism -- particularly a lesbian sex scene between stars Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon -- than its chills. Scott's feature career was slightly derailed -- ""(The studio) saw a cut of 'The Hunger,' and all of a sudden my parking spot at Warner Brothers was painted out!"" he said years later -- but he hit the big time with his next film: In 1986, he directed ""Top Gun,"" which established Tom Cruise as an A-list star. Not much was expected of the film in the beginning, he recalled. ""Nobody really quite understood what it was going to be,"" Scott said, according to Alex Ben Block's ""Blockbusting,"" a history of top-grossing movies. ""They thought it was going to be 'The Hunger' on an aircraft carrier."" Scott turned out to be as aggressive as his high-flying characters. For one scene, according to ""Blockbusting,"" the director wanted an aircraft carrier turned to catch the light in a certain way for five minutes. The move cost $25,000. Scott wrote out a check on the spot. ""Top Gun"" was roasted by critics, but Scott's technical work was praised. ""The remarkable achievement in 'Top Gun' is that it presents seven or eight aerial encounters that are so well choreographed that we can actually follow them most of the time, and the movie gives us a good secondhand sense of what it might be like to be in a dogfight,"" wrote Roger Ebert, though he cautioned audiences to ""look out for the scenes where the people talk to one another."" Audiences didn't care; the film's sleek look and MTV atmosphere made it a box office smash. With $177 million in 1986 dollars, it was the No. 1 box office hit of the year. ""Top Gun"" also earned four Oscar nominations -- with one win, ""Take My Breath Away's"" best song nod -- and even boosted the sale of Ray-Ban sunglasses. His ensuing films ran the gamut of Hollywood forms: sequels (""Beverly Hills Cop II""), remakes (""The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3""), star-driven actioners (""Crimson Tide,"" with Washington and Gene Hackman, and ""Enemy of the State,"" with Will Smith and Hackman) and even Tarantino-esque pulp (""True Romance,"" Scott's best-reviewed film, which was based on Quentin Tarantino's first screenplay). Through it all, he brought a level of craftsmanship and professionalism to his work, earning praise from actors and colleagues. Many took to Twitter after his death, remembering him fondly. ""Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable,"" tweeted director and writer Joe Carnahan (""The Grey""). Scott made tense films for jittery times . It's no accident that Denzel Washington appeared in five Scott films -- the actor loved working with the director, as both were fond of immersing themselves in details and personalities. ""One of the reasons I like working with Tony is because, like myself, he's a research fanatic,"" Washington said at a press conference for ""Pelham 1-2-3."" ""(Like him), I like being with the real folks."" Scott also enjoyed giving interviews, even those to promote his films -- the kind of wearying task that prompts actors and other directors to turn monosyllabic. Scott, on the other hand, used the opportunities to wax expansively on special effects, his more famous brother and even his place in the Hollywood hierarchy. Perhaps he wasn't as well-regarded as his Oscar-winning sibling, he once observed, but things could change with time. ""I always get criticized for style over content, unlike Ridley's films like 'Alien' or 'Blade Runner' or 'Gladiator' that go right into the classic box right away. Mine sort of hover,"" he said. ""Maybe with time, people will start saying they should be classics, but I think I'm always perceived as reaching too hard for difference, and difference doesn't categorize you as the 'classic' category."" Maybe not, but when the lights went down, Tony Scott gave you your money's worth -- and then some. Tony Scott: Unstoppable Hollywood force .","Director Tony Scott died Sunday, an apparent suicide .

"(CNN) -- ""My MEDVOL number is 6856. I was at Edgewood Arsenal from January 1975 to April 1975."" With those words, Stephen Coffman reached out to CNN last week after seeing its stories about Edgewood Arsenal, where the Army conducted top-secret drug and chemical tests on soldier volunteers. Coffman was just 22 years old when he was recruited for testing at Edgewood, one of about 7,000 soldiers who took part in the program from 1955 to 1975. The Army field computer operator says that in December 1974, Edgewood Arsenal recruiters came to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he was stationed and told him he could help design the new field artillery computer system. In January 1975, he reported to Edgewood. His first test was non-chemical, simply determining what size keyboard to use, he remembers. A display would flash a series of numbers, and he would try to input them using the test keypad and his bare hands. Next, he repeated the task wearing gloves. Then mittens. ""Then it was with a gas mask on,"" Coffman said. ""Then with a gas mask on in a gas chamber. Then it was 'try to input the numbers after being exposed to some gas.' My accuracy rate went from 99% barehanded to 57% gassed."" The testing continued. One in particular haunts him to this day: He recalls being in a ""padded cell"" with just a thin exercise mat and a blanket. The room was orange; the walls ""flowed down onto the floor like lava."" ""I remember putting my finger in the lava and watching it flow around my finger,"" he says. ""There was a nurse who would come in and take blood samples, urine -- I had to wait till they came in to void -- and give me water. I do not know how many days I was in there. I lost seven pounds during this 'lost period.' "" Coffman said that after that test, he was told to report to the medical center and was shown a piece of paper that he had signed, volunteering for other experiments. He didn't remember signing but says it was his signature. ""I was told that if I did not do the experiment as I had agreed, I would be listed as UNSAT and returned to Fort Campbell."" UNSAT is a military term that means the service member is ""unsatisfactory."" In other words, the service member failed to complete his or her assignment. ""It is not a label one wants to have applied to them,"" Coffman said. ""We were isolated and given injections. I secretly wrote down what the vials said, but my notes were taken from me by a doctor. I was threatened with punishment. The tests continued."" In an effort to find out what drugs he had been given and what his health files contained, Coffman filed a Freedom of Information Act request. He got his records in 1985. They showed that he had been given a potentially deadly nerve agent called sarin gas -- and its antidotes. According to the records, he had also been exposed to physostigmine, scopalmine and 2-PAMC1, and these were used ""to treat anticholinesterase inhibitor overdoses."" He was also given a chemical called TAB. He still has no idea what it was. Coffman says that before the testing began, he was given a complete physical. His EKG -- a test that records the heart's electrical activity -- was perfect, and he was rated in perfect shape. ""According to the FOIA, I was subjected to the same chemical twice within 25 days,"" Coffman said. ""The doctor's note ... noted that two exposures so close together caused a negative reaction to the subject's heart."" For most veterans in the program, the stay was two months, but Coffman's stay was extended to four. When his Edgewood tour was up, he went back to Fort Campbell. ""I was sent back with the threat of 'don't tell anyone anything, and if anyone asks, say you are fine.' "" He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1977. He spent a year with the National Guard and joined the Coast Guard Reserve in 1988. In 1995, another EKG showed abnormalities. His began seeing a private cardiologist. An MRI revealed 98% blockage in one of his arteries, and the cardiologist asked whether he had ever had an injury to his heart. ""He said it looked like the heart had been damaged but not due to a heart attack."" In 2007, Coffman had a quadruple bypass. To this day, he wonders whether the damage was related to Edgewood. All things considered, the married father of two says, he does not regret his service. ""I believe it may have helped save the lives of other soldiers in the case of chemical attacks. I recall that (the doctor) who conducted the tests was instrumental in helping the victims of the Tokyo subway terrorist attack,"" Coffman said. ""I guess it is like when a service member goes to war and gets wounded but does not regret their decision to go to war."" 'Time bomb' His only concern, he says, is for his two children. ""There is nothing in the file about the experiments where I was kept in the padded cell. That is what I would like to know about for my children's sake. Considering Agent Orange has been shown to affect veterans' offspring and possibly second generation, it is like having a time bomb that may go off or may be a dud."" This was just one of the stories CNN got from Edgewood Arsenal test veterans responding to the special investigations of the Army's top-secret Cold War drug and chemical testing program. Buck Conder, 70, said he volunteered at Edgewood in 1964. He remembers putting on a hospital gown, getting in bed and having six or seven doctors arrive bedside in gas masks. They put a drop of liquid on the inside of his forearm. ""Whatever happened, I have no idea. I woke up in the same bed"" 24 hours later, Conder said. In 2000, Conder received a call notifying him that he'd been exposed to sarin gas. Conder, who says he was wounded while serving two tours in Vietnam, has a blood disease and a related skin condition that he blames on chemical exposure at Edgewood. Conder also said he was more nervous and irritable after his two-month temporary duty at the Maryland base. Read about widow who blames VA for her husband's death . Jeff Jefferson went to Edgewood in 1966 to be closer to his home in Reading, Pennsylvania. He recalls getting an injection on a Monday; he ""woke up"" on Wednesday. In the past year or two, Jefferson says, he applied for his records and learned that he'd been given BZ, an incapacitating agent. Jefferson says he remembers little of what happened while he was under the influence of BZ, but he thinks they went to the rifle range, because his thumb was bruised, apparently from getting caught in the breech of an M1 rifle. Jefferson, now 65, says his health has been good. Dr. James Ketchum, a former Edgewood researcher, took issue with veteran Tim Josephs, who said he was coerced into taking part in the tests after arriving at Edgewood. ""No one was forced to participate nor told they would be punished or imprisoned if they chose not to take part,"" Ketchum commented on CNN.com. ""Those who participated all received letters of commendation and all received thorough medical evaluations before and after being in the program."" Gordon Erspamer, the attorney who has filed a lawsuit seeking health care for Edgewood veterans, said Josephs' story is not unique. A number of Edgewood veterans have told him superiors threatened repercussions for soldiers who quit: . ""You're going to get a bad conduct discharge, or we're going to write you up and send you back, and we're going to send you right to Vietnam,"" Erspamer said. Read about Tim Josephs' time at Edgewood . 'I was easily swayed' Michael Cooney, now 62, was still a teenager when he started his two-month tour at Edgewood. ""Since I was only 19, I was easily swayed, wanting to do my patriotic duty,"" he says. ""I have no idea what they injected into me, as I can't recall much of my two months there."" Cooney says that since his discharge, he gets a survey every five to 10 years asking how his health is. ""I always responded by asking them for a physical and a request to know what they tested on me,"" Cooney said. ""Those questions were never answered."" He knows he was injected with atropine and was tear-gassed. He says that while he's not in perfect health, he doesn't blame Edgewood Arsenal but feels the government should take responsibility for those harmed. He says he'd do it again. ""I'm patriot, but don't send me out in a war unarmed, and if I come back injured, take care of me. I'd volunteer in a minute if there was a need, but there needs to be government responsibility on the back end.""","Several CNN.com commenters say they volunteered for secret Army drug tests .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer kept his gold medal dream alive after a marathon semifinal battle with Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro at Wimbledon Friday. Federer had to dig deep to beat the former U.S. Open champion 3-6 7-6 19-17 in four hours 26 minutes, the longest match in Olympic tennis history. He will play home hope Andy Murray, a repeat of last month's Wimbledon final, after the Briton swept aside Novak Djokovic 7-5 7-5 in the second semifinal. A single break in each set was enough to give Murray his chance for revenge and gold. ""I know how much winning tonight meant to me. It was one of the biggest matches of my career, one of the biggest wins of my career,"" Murray told BBC Sport. ""It was one of the most emotional I've been after a match. I'm so happy to win. You don't see me smiling that much normally. I haven't stopped smiling since I came off the court. ""The atmosphere was unbelievable. We always said night matches at the U.S. Open had the best atmosphere, but it's not even close to what it was today."" Earlier, the 30-year-old Federer showed his fighting qualities after trailing by a set and struggling to impose himself in the second where he had to save two break points on his own service. The tiebreak proved decisive as he gained a mini-break and held on to level the match. The third set proved nerve racking with both players having break points before Federer broke in the 19th game. But Del Potro immediately broke back to love as the drama continued on Centre Court. Federer finally finished off his resilient opponent as he broke again to lead 18-17 and he took victory on his second match point. ""I don't think I've ever played as long a set in a best of three match,"" he told gathered reporters. ""It was very physical at the end and so mental. I got lucky in the second set to get back and then in the third it was so tough,"" he added. World No.1 Federer is bidding to become the third man after Rafael Nadal and Andre Agassi to complete a career golden slam of the four grand slam titles and an Olympic singles title. His Wimbledon triumph over Murray was his 17th grand slam title but he has now claimed his first medal in singles competition in the Olympics. He won doubles gold with Stanislas Wawrinka for Switzerland in Beijing in 2008. The women's singles final will be a mouth watering clash between Serena Williams of the United States and Russian Maria Sharapova. Sharapova beat compatriot Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-3, while Williams thrashed women's No.1 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus 6-1 6-2 in just 63 minutes. Sharapova is competing in the Games for the first time and is also seeking a golden grand slam, but faces in Williams an opponent in ominous form after winning at Wimbledon last month.","Roger Federer beats Juan Martin Del Potro in longest Olympic tennis match .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge is once again weighing arguments over the ""show me your papers"" provision in Arizona's controversial immigration law. The provision was the only one of four major parts of the law upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. But opponents argued in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that new evidence shows that a federal judge should block enforcement of the provision. ""It is infected with racial discrimination,"" attorney Karen Tumlin of the National Immigration Law Center said outside the courthouse Tuesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. Court issues split decision on state laws . Attorney John Bouma, representing Arizona, argued that the law does not discriminate. ""You just can't say that Latinos are going to be primarily impacted and that's discriminatory,"" he told CNN. Outside the courthouse Tuesday, Bouma told reporters, ""If Hispanics happen to be the people who are the highest percentage who come across the border illegally, believe it or not, they're probably the highest percentage that will be prosecuted under the statute."" The ""show me your papers"" provision allows local law enforcement, when performing other state law enforcement functions, to check on the immigration status of those people they stop for another reason. Supreme Court justices said they upheld that part because it complements existing federal policy. When it upheld the provision, the Supreme Court was careful to say that depending on how this is implemented, it could very well be overturned one day. Immigrants line up for deportation relief . On Tuesday, the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union were among the groups to challenge this part of the law on what they said were new grounds. As part of their argument, they pointed to e-mails from Arizona Sen. Russell Pearce, a Republican who authored SB 1070 and then was ousted from office in a recall election in his suburban Phoenix district last year. ""It's very clear that they were pushing the implementation of SB 1070, and they have racially discriminatory motivations for doing so,"" said Alessandra Soler, executive director at the ACLU of Arizona. ""Race, ethnicity and stereotypes about Latinos were the driving force behind the passage of SB 1070."" Attorneys representing Arizona dispute that claim. ""You look at the legislative record, and there were a lot of very good legislators involved from both parties. ... There was nothing in there dealing with trying to discriminate against Hispanics. They were talking about illegal immigrants and they were trying to deal with illegal immigrants,"" Bouma told CNN Wednesday. Five things to know about immigration . Pearce has contended that dozens of other states are trying to pass similar legislation, showing the popular support and need for such measures. In June, he said that accusations of possible racial profiling as a result of the law were ""demeaning to law enforcement."" ""There's a lot of very professional, qualified law enforcement officers. .. who have been stopping people for crimes and making determinations that there's a reasonable suspicion that they were illegal,"" Bouma said. ""They've been doing that for years, and there's hardly any record of any racial profiling, and why would one suddenly suspect that they've got to do that now?"" The civil rights organizations presented three new arguments against the Arizona law Tuesday, Tumlin said. The first was that the provision should be blocked because it would result in unconstitutional detainment under the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Mexico has its own immigration problem . The opponents of the law also argued that the provision is inappropriately motivated by race, violating equal protection laws, she said. Finally, Tumlin said, the civil rights groups presented new evidence that the provision encroaches on the federal government's responsibilities to enforce immigration laws. Attorneys representing Arizona have argued in court filings that the civil rights' organizations evidence was ""entirely speculative"" and that ""evidence demonstrates that (the provision) can and will be implemented in a constitutional manner."" In court Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton did not indicate when she would rule in the case, attorneys said.","NEW: Attorney for Arizona says authorities are ""trying to deal with illegal immigrants""

"(CNN) -- An Air Force instructor convicted of rape, aggravated sexual assault and other charges against 10 female recruits was handed a 20-year prison sentence Saturday in a military scandal that spurred investigators to examine the extent of the abuse. Staff Sgt. Luis Walker was convicted Friday after being investigated on accusations of sexual abuse against his female subordinates while he was assigned to the 326th Training Squadron at Lackland Air Force Base in the San Antonio, Texas, region. Walker will be reduced to the lowest enlisted rank, be dishonorably discharged and forfeit all pay and allowances, according to a Lackland statement Saturday. Base reports more sexual misconduct charges . He is among 12 instructors investigated for sexual misconduct against at least 31 trainees, and one of six to face charges in the scandal. The commander of Air Force training earlier named Maj. Gen. Margaret Woodward to head a two-month inquiry, covering all four Air Force bases that handle basic training, which are located in Texas and Mississippi. At Lackland, one trainer had earlier pleaded guilty to having an improper relationship with a trainee, as part of a plea agreement. Rape victims say military labels them 'crazy' Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado was sentenced to 90 days in prison, 30 days hard labor and a demotion in rank and pay. In his plea deal, he provided testimony against two other trainers who have been charged. He also said he had inappropriate relationships with 10 trainees. Last year, the Defense Department recorded more than 3,000 cases of sexual assault throughout its branches. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in April announced plans to create a special victims unit to investigate and prosecute allegations of sexual assault. Betrayal of trust?

"(CNN) -- Coastal areas that ban fishing can provide havens for endangered wildlife, according to a new report. Findings from a research project conducted over 21 years and published in the ""Journal of Applied Ecology"" revealed that a marine sanctuary off the coast of Christchurch, New Zealand has significantly improved the survival of Hector's dolphins . They are one of the rarest species of dolphins, endemic to the waters around New Zealand, with only around 8,000 animals thought to be left in the wild. Marine Protected Areas (MPA) have long been advocated as a way to protect sea mammals, but the New Zealand project is the first to confirm this. ""This study provides the first empirical evidence that Marine Protected Areas are effective in protecting threatened marine mammals,"" said Liz Slooten of the University of Otago. Since the MPA was designated, the dolphin's survival has increased by 5.4%, according to the report. Covering 1,170 km2 of sea off New Zealand's South Island, Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary was designated in 1988 to prevent the dolphins being killed by gillnet and trawl fisheries. Between 1986 and 2006, researchers conducted regular photo-identification surveys of Hector's dolphins, photographing 462 individual animals whose survival they studied. ""We can identify individual dolphins from their battle scars -- which range from small nicks out of the dorsal fin, to major scarring following shark attacks,"" said Slooten . ""Estimating population changes in marine mammals is challenging, often requiring many years of research to produce data accurate enough to detect these kinds of biological changes."" The study also shows that to be effective, MPAs need to be sufficiently large. ""The take home message is that size matters. Marine Protected Areas work, but they have to be large enough in order to be effective,"" said Slooten.","Area off New Zealand 's east coast a haven for rare dolphins .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka rallied from a set and 4-0 down to unseeded Italian Alberta Brianti as she eventually emerged into the second round of the French Open on Monday. The 22-year-old looked like she would achieve the unwanted feat of becoming the first top-seeded player to lose in the opening round at Roland Garros in the Open era. But after Brianti moved to within two games of a landmark victory Azarenka, from Belarus, won 12 of the next 14 to finally earn a clash with Germany's Dinah Pfizenmaier.

""I was waiting a long time for my first match here, so I couldn't wait to get out there. Maybe I was rushing too much to finish the points. ""Plus I also have to give Alberta a lot of credit, she played really well, and she pushed me to dig deep today. Bad days happen. The important thing is how I came out of it."" Defending champion Li Na, from China, had no such difficulties as she eased into round two with a regulation 6-2 6-1 victory over Romania's Sorana Cirstea.

The 13-time major champion lost an epic three-hour duel 4-6 7-6 6-3 to her unseeded French opponent, who suffered from cramp through most of the match. It was Williams' 47th grand slam tournament and her earliest exit since sister Venus beat her in the second round of her first major -- the Australian Open in 1998.

Sharapova has only been beaten once on clay all season, in the Madrid Open final, and has taken titles in both Stuttgart and Rome leading into the tournament in Paris. And the Russian looked in merciless mood on Court Suzanne Lenglen as she set up a second round clash with Japan's Ayumi Morita. ""Nothing is ever easy, because you have to face whoever is across the net,"" Sharapova told a press conference. ""No matter how good or bad they're playing, you still have to win that match.

"New York (CNN) -- A veteran New York policeman, jailed since October after being accused of involvement with drug dealers, is now charged with plotting to kill a witness who was to testify against him. Officer Jose Ramos, from the NYPD's 40th Precinct in the Bronx, was charged Thursday along with his wife, Wanda Abreu, who is accused of using Ramos' pension money to pay off a hit man. The district attorney's office did not identify the hit man or the witness. ""Ramos once said, without him (the witness), there is no case. And so they began conspiring to have that witness killed,"" Omer Wiczyk, assistant Bronx district attorney, testified in court. ""He said explicitly: Go ahead, do it; but do it right away."" Both Ramos and Abreu pleaded not guilty. ""We're very shocked and my client denies all these charges, and we're going to fight them,"" Dawn Florio, Ramos' defense attorney, said Thursday. The Bronx district attorney's office said in a news release that the couple attempted to arrange the killing ""through face-to-face meetings and telephone calls, some of which were recorded at a detention facility on Rikers Island, where Ramos is awaiting trial."" Court papers say the conversations took place between September and May. Ramos and Abreu were charged with three counts of conspiracy in the second degree, and one of criminal solicitation in the second degree. If convicted of conspiracy, the most serious of the charges, they could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison, officials said. Ramos already faced numerous charges of attempted robbery, attempted grand larceny, transportation of what he believed to be drugs to drug dealers and revealing the identity of a confidential source. Those actions are alleged to have occurred from March to November 2009. He was investigated after an anonymous tip to police. Prosecutors say they also stumbled upon an alleged ticket-fixing scandal over the course of the investigation of Ramos, and officials have since accused 16 other police officers of getting rid of tickets for friends or family. The ticket-fixing charges are unrelated to Ramos. Bail for Ramos from the charges filed against him in October remains at $500,000 cash.","A New York Police officer and his wife tried to arrange the killing, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association's sanctions will devastate Penn State football for years to come. They will also harm the university as a whole, with consequences felt not only in the athletic and budget departments, but probably in the development and admissions offices, too. The severe penalties are probably appropriate, but I question whether the NCAA overstepped its legal authority in issuing them so hastily. Penn State acknowledges institutional responsibility by accepting the sanctions without a legal fight. It can try to repair the institutional flaws that enabled Jerry Sandusky to rape children and allowed a coverup of those crimes, but it misses a historic opportunity to legally challenge the scope of NCAA authority and how it's applied. News: 'Stark wake-up call' for Penn State . The NCAA is in the business of ensuring that college sports are separate from professional sports and that they keep within the academic mission of its members. Penn State supporters have reason to insist that the NCAA lacks the jurisdiction to punish its members for off-field, nonplayer related crimes. After all, what do Sandusky's crimes, however heinous, and the associated coverup, however despicable, really have to do with the NCAA's purpose? The NCAA's constitution, which all members must follow, requires that the coaches and athletic officials display ethical conduct. A football coach raping children and the head coach and athletic officials covering it up clearly constitutes unethical behavior. News: Paterno loyalists call NCAA sanctions excessive . The NCAA also knows that if the Penn State scandal been unveiled years ago, not only would some boys have avoided the horror of Sandusky, the football team probably would have faced NCAA sanctions. On balance, the NCAA had grounds to sanction Penn State. The heinous acts warranted a stiff penalty. But I'm less comfortable with how fast the ruling was made. The NCAA clearly bypassed its normal procedure for investigating and sanctioning. This procedure often takes more than a year and involves several hearings. Consider what the NCAA did not give Penn State. Normally the association notifies the school that an official inquiry is going to be held. Notice is followed by an investigation and, if the NCAA finds fault, a written explanation of the allegations is given. The school has 90 days to respond, after which it may request more time to respond or schedule a hearing before the NCAA's Committee on Infractions. Experts: What happens to Penn State football now? Then comes the hearing, which resembles a trial or arbitration hearing. If the school is found to be at fault, it can appeal to the NCAA's Infractions Appeals Committee. Penn State did not receive 90 days to respond, nor did it get a trial or an opportunity to appeal. To bolster that its decision-making process makes sense, the NCAA could maintain that Penn State President Rodney Erickson's decision to sign a consent agreement takes any potential challenge off the table. Besides, the U.S. Supreme Court, in NCAA v. Jerry Tarkanian, made clear the association is not a governmental actor and thus is not obligated to provide due process. Although the absence of due process does not mean the NCAA can act arbitrarily and capriciously, it does provide it with significant immunity from lawsuits. The NCAA could also assert that Penn State's own Freeh Report treated the school fairly in finding university officials covering up Sandusky's crimes. In addition, the NCAA could insist that Penn State is voluntarily a member and has contractually consented to NCAA authority. Last, the NCAA could emphasize that the extraordinary circumstances of Penn State compelled instant action. If the NCAA had waited until next year, Penn State would have played the 2012 season under a cloud of suspicion. News: Do sanctions alter history books on Penn State and Paterno's legacy? But does the NCAA's swift justice mean it will now regularly bypass its normal infractions process when it penalizes other schools? Will ""swift justice"" become the norm? Probably not, because the Penn State scandal is unique on many levels, including that the NCAA could rely on an extensive internal report commissioned by the university itself. Few schools could afford to commission such an internal report; even fewer would choose to do so. I imagine the NCAA would probably prefer to employ its more deliberate and transparent process as often as possible. A respected process helps to legitimatize NCAA penalties. If NCAA members were routinely subject to swift justice, they may seek alternatives to the NCAA for organizing games. Still, longstanding criticisms of the how the NCAA does business will only become louder because of today's news. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Michael McCann.","Michael McCann: NCAA's strict penalities will devastate Penn State football for years to come .

"(CNN) -- The USS Constitution, or ""Old Ironsides,"" sailed under her own power Sunday for just the second time in some 130 years. The Constitution set out on Boston Harbor in Massachusetts to commemorate the 200th anniversary of her victory over a British frigate during the War of 1812. The battle earned Constitution her ""Old Ironsides"" nickname. ""I cannot think of a better way to honor those who fought in the war as well as celebrate Constitution's successes during the War of 1812 than for the ship to be under sail,"" said Cmdr. Matt Bonner, Constitution's 72nd commanding officer. Some 285 people were on board the ship, which sailed under her own power for 17 minutes, traveling a distance of 1,100 yards. Tugs were then reattached to Constitution's sides and she returned to her pier by early afternoon. The ship, which doubles as a museum, receives more than half a million visitors each year. Sunday's sail marked the first time Constitution sailed on her own since 1997. Before that, the last time she sailed on her own was in 1881.

"(CNN) -- British rower Katherine Grainger ended her 12-year wait for Olympic glory after winning gold in the women's double sculls on Friday. The 36-year-old Scot, partnered by Anna Watkins, punched the air in delight after exorcising the demons of Sydney, Athens and Beijing. Grainger, who had suffered the agony of being made to settle for silver twice in quadruple sculls and once in the coxless pair, had targeted London 2012 as her final chance of success on the big stage. ""I am a bride at last,"" she told reporters. ""I did seriously consider what I would do after Beijing. For anyone who was there, Beijing was a really tough result and I wanted to make sure I continued for the right reasons. ""As soon as I made the decision, there was never a doubt. I have had three fantastic years."" The British duo were huge favorites for the race and did not disappoint, powering their way to an incredible 23rd consecutive victory. Watkins, who won a bronze in Beijing in 2008, teamed up with Grainger just two years ago. Since then, the British team have been unbeatable, winning two World Championship titles as well as all three World Cups in 2012. ""Just before halfway I knew we had won it,"" said 29-year-old Watkins. ""With the crowd there was no way anything was going to go wrong. We had time to enjoy it, which is more than you can dream of."" Their success makes them just the third and fourth British women to win rowing gold at any Olympics, following Thursday's triumph by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the women's pair. Wiggins makes history as Britain wins first golds at London 2012 . Kim Crowe and Brooke Pratley took silver for Australia with Poland's Magdalena Fularczyk and Julia Michalska grabbing bronze. Meanwhile, New Zealand enjoyed a glorious day on the water at Eton Dorney after claiming gold in both the men's pair and single sculls. New Zealand duo Eric Murray and Hamish Bond maintained their three-year unbeaten record after tearing through the field. France's Germain Chardin and Dorian Mortelette claimed silver with British duo George Nash and Will Satch taking bronze. New Zealand's Beijing bronze medalist Mahe Drysdale triumphed in the men's single sculls after coming home ahead of the Czech Republic's 2008 runnerup Ondrej Synek and Great Britain's Alan Campbell. Defending champion Olaf Tufte of Norway could only manage third in the ""B"" final. In the men's quadruple sculls final, world champions Australia were forced to settle for bronze with Germany taking the Olympic title ahead of Croatia. The German crew of Karl Schulze, Lauritz Schoof, Phillipp Wende and Tim Grohmann led from start to finish to win in a time of 5 minutes, 42.48 seconds. Poland, who won the 2008 gold, finished last.","Katherine Grainger wins first gold after claiming silver in previous three Olympics .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Iran is in an ""open war"" with Israel, President Shimon Peres said Monday, as he pointed the finger at Iran and Hezbollah for last week's bombing in Bulgaria that killed five Israelis. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Peres said Israel would act to prevent further attacks. Peres said Israel had ""enough"" hard intelligence to link the Bulgaria attack to Iran and its proxy Hezbollah and believes more attacks are being planned as part of what he called an ""open war against Israel."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah movement were responsible for a number of attacks and attempted attacks against Israeli targets in Thailand, Georgia, India, Greece, Cyprus and other countries. Asked whether the Bulgaria bombing and the other attempted attacks were revenge for the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, which Iran blames on Israel, Peres said that Israel has never claimed responsibility for the killings. But he noted that Israel has a right to prevent killing of its citizens. Read more on the tension between Israel and Iran . ""We don't have an initiative of terror,"" Peres said. ""We don't do it. But self-defense is the right and the must of every people."" He said Israel's policy was one of ""prevention,"" rather than ""retaliation."" ""If you have enough information about a certain person which is a ticking clock that can explode a bomb that can endanger civilian life, clearly you have to prevent him from doing so,"" Peres said, citing reports that the United States has killed as many as 3,000 people in drone strikes aimed at terrorist enclaves. With neighboring Syria in a spiral of violence, Peres said Israel will be forced to seize Syria's chemical weapons if there is a risk President Bashar al-Assad would use them against Israel or that the arsenal could fall into terrorist hands. Over the weekend, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he ordered the military to prepare contingency plans to attack Syria's chemical weapons arsenals, should the need arise. ""The use of chemical weapons is internationally forbidden... and what do you do when somebody violates the law? You fight against it,"" Peres said. ""You stop them. We shall not remain indifferent and tell them, 'Do what you want.'"" When asked how far Israel would go to secure Syria's chemical arsenal, Peres simply said: ""Until it will stop being a danger."" With Israel facing a potential influx of refugees, Peres said although no Syrians have tried to enter the country, Israel would not help any refugees who want to cross the border and would use force against any armed individuals. ""If they will come by force, we shall stop them by force,"" Peres said. ""If they shall come in without force, we shall stop them the way any country defended her border with civilian means."" Peres spoke a day after Israel marked the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Germany, where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed. While he wouldn't go into details, Peres said Israel was taking precautions to ensure Israeli athletes would not be targeted at the London Olympic Games, which start later this week. He argued, however, that if Israeli intelligence services been at Munich, they would probably have been able to prevent the attack.","Shimon Peres blames Iran and Hezbollah for an attack that killed 5 Israelis .

Israel will act on its own to secure Syria's chemical weapons if necessary, he vows .

"(CNN) -- Bulgarian police have widened their investigation into last week's bombing attack on Israeli tourists to towns near the border with Romania, asking hotels for surveillance video that might have captured the suspected bomber. Hotels in the Black Sea coastal city of Varna say police have been asking for video showing a particular suspect and are giving a sketch of the suspect to management. Investigators also have questioned workers at a car rental agency near the Black Sea coast where the man attempted to rent a car before Wednesday's attack, the agency's owner told CNN. Five Israeli tourists were killed and more than 30 other Israelis were wounded when a suicide bomber blew apart their bus at Burgas International Airport. Explainer: Bulgaria explosion amid growing Iranian-Israeli tension . Bulgarian authorities still have not been able to identify the bomber, who was seen on airport security videos about an hour before the attack. They have taken fingerprints and DNA samples and given that information to their counterparts in Israel, the United States and Interpol. The Bulgarian Interior Ministry says it is not ruling out the possibility that the suspect had help, though it won't comment on reports that authorities are looking for a second suspect. The owner and an employee of the Afrodita Car Rental Agency told CNN a suspicious man wanted to rent a car the Sunday before the attack and tried to use the Michigan driver's license later found at the scene of the attack. When the owner said he wanted to photocopy the license, the man grew nervous and refused to have it copied. At that point, the owner said he refused to rent the man a car and the man walked out. The car rental owner described the man as having short dark hair and speaking English with an accent. The woman who conducted the forensic reconstruction of the suspected bomber's face and body, told Bulgarian TV the man had a white face, light eyes and thick dark hair.","Police are asking hotels for surveillance video .

"London (CNN) -- For the past week, members of Britain's armed forces have been taking part in major exercises to prepare for the Olympics in London later this summer. Alongside the emergency drills and simulated alarms, designed to ready the city for potential terror threats to the 2012 Games, soldiers have also practiced launching missiles from the city's rooftops. The residents of an exclusive apartment complex in London's East End were horrified to discover that the UK Ministry of Defence planned to site ground-to-air rocket launchers from the roof of their homes. Now one historian has called on them to channel the spirits of the factory workers who once worked where they now live, and insist that the missiles are removed. Today Bow Quarter is an upscale gated community, complete with swimming pool, gymnasium, private gardens and its own restaurant, bar and shop. Makeup artist Susan Aherne, who has lived in the complex for 18 months, told CNN she was attracted to the complex by its air of security -- but now fears the missiles will mean her home becomes a terrorist target. ""I'm frightened of getting my head blown off,"" she said. ""I moved here because it's a gated community and it made me feel safe, but now it feels like we're living inside some military compound. They say it's going to make us safe, but in fact it's going to make us a target. They're going to convert a residential area into a war zone."" And security guard Mohammed Miah, who lives opposite Bow Quarter, agreed: ""If terrorists are a threat, this is now the first place they're going to come. Also, if something attacks us from the sky and they shoot it down, where is it going to land? This is a residential neighborhood, loads of families, loads of kids. It just doesn't make any sense bringing missile launchers here."" The Ministry of Defence says it chose Bow Quarter because ""it is situated close to the Olympic Park and offers an excellent view of the surrounding area, and the entire sky above the Olympic Park."" It says the ground-to-air missile system ""is operated by fully trained and experienced soldiers,"" and insists ""it does not pose any hazard to residents,"" adding that the missiles will be guarded 24 hours a day by a team of military personnel and police. For many of those living inside the high walls and security gates, what annoys them most is that no-one asked their opinion. Neil Midgley, Bow Quarter resident and one of the journalists who broke the story of the missiles, told CNN: ""In a Western democracy in 2012, I don't think the army should occupy private land without consulting the people who live there and getting their consent. ""People are grown-ups, they understand that the Olympics need to be protected, but there are questions: Do the missiles make us a target? If they are fired, where does the debris fall? And who pays for any damage caused?"" Bow Quarter was not always so glamorous and gentrified. The site was once home to the Bryant and May match factory, notorious for the horrific working conditions inside its walls -- until, that is, the mainly female workers rose up and demanded action, and changed British society for good in the process. The ""match girls"" at Bryant and May were paid a pittance -- less than five shillings a week -- and those earnings were frequently whittled away by a system of fines imposed for ""offenses"" including talking, lateness, talking, and dropping matches. In addition, the dangerous white phosphorous they worked with on a daily basis made them very sick, Louise Raw, historian and author of ""Striking a Light: The Bryant and May Matchwomen and their place in Labour history,"" told CNN. Many were in poor health because of their work, left bald from carrying heavy boxes on their heads and suffering the horrific industrial disease known as ""phossy jaw"" -- the necrosis of their jaw bones caused by the white phosphorus used in the matches. ""They were physically very frail,"" Raw said. ""They were working in the factory from the age of 10 or 11 -- sometimes even younger. Their growth was stunted, they were malnourished, and the phosphorus made them really ill. ""It's terrible stuff: Back then people used it to commit suicide or to cause abortions, and these women were working with it everyday. It made them really sick. The average life expectancy was just 25."" Disgusted by working conditions at the factory, feminist and social campaigner Annie Besant wrote a crusading article, ""White Slavery in London"" which brought the suffering of the match girls to a wider audience. They were, she wrote: ""Undersized because under-fed, oppressed because helpless, flung aside as soon as worked out. Who cares if they die or go on the streets provided only that Bryant & May shareholders get their 23%."" Bryant and May were furious, but when they tried to force the workers to sign a statement insisting they were happy with their treatment, the matchmakers refused, and when one of their number was fired, they walked out. But despite the match girls' lowly status, the resulting strike garnered the backing of high-profile supporters including playwright George Bernard Shaw, and led to a boycott of the company's products. ""The match women were the lowest of the low,"" said Raw. ""They were a wild and wonderful bunch: factory girls, working class, they were loud and dressed in colorful clothes -- they really had polite Victorian society reaching for the smelling salts. ""In contrast, Bryant and May were big, powerful men, and yet they had to give in to them."" Within weeks, the company reluctantly accepted the strikers' demands for improved pay and conditions, an end to the system of fines. The match girls went on to found the first union for female workers in Britain, and their actions helped shape the modern Labour movement. That a location of such importance to workers' rights should be the site of ""undemocratic"" actions today is not lost on those who live there -- or their supporters. Twitter user Anne McCrossan (@Annemcx) was among those quick to point out the irony: ""Laughable that BQ was the site of emancipation in the past, but authoritarian control today, is this the spirit of the games?"" Raw said the match women should be an inspiration to those at Bow Quarter who were unhappy at the MoD's decision. ""It is such Bryant and May-like behaviour to stick missiles on the roof without asking,"" she told CNN. ""The match women wouldn't have stood for it. They were, in theory, completely powerless in the face of authority -- nobody thought they could change anything, but they stood together and they did change things -- they had a huge influence. ""It was a victory for people power, and they are an example to us all."" But Midgley said he doubted that the residents would take action in quite the same way. ""I wish I could tell you I think there will be a Bow Quarter uprising, a Bow Quarter Spring over this, but I doubt it. ""In reality, people are very concerned, and they have questions which will need to be answered. If they are not, then people will try to stop it."" CNN's George Webster contributed to this report.","British Ministry of Defence plans to place missiles on top of east London apartment block .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Feuding among Michael Jackson's family reached a new level Monday when a ""scuffle"" erupted at Katherine Jackson's home in Calabasas, California, according a sheriff's spokesman. Paris Jackson, the 14-year-old daughter of the late pop icon, posted a Twitter message about the time the incident was happening: ""gotta love fam."" She also tweeted about her distress about not hearing from her grandmother for more than a week: ""8 days and counting . something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk directly to my grandmother!!<|3"" Michael Jackson's siblings attack estate executors . Deputies were called to the mansion where Katherine Jackson has been raising Prince, 15, Paris and Blanket, 10, since their father died three years ago, Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. A battery report was taken, but no arrests were made, Whitmore said. He would not identify who was involved because ""the investigation is ongoing."" Janet, Jermaine and Randy Jackson were on the scene, a source with firsthand knowledge of the incident said. The source asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. The drama happened as Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives closed a missing persons case opened for Katherine Jackson, who was found to be with daughter Rebbie in Arizona. ""Katherine Jackson has been located and she is fine and with family,"" Whitmore said. ""Our missing persons case is closed."" Deputies talked to two family members and were satisfied, he said. A lawyer for Katherine Jackson is not satisfied, saying the sheriff's deputies who tried to talk to her in Arizona Monday were blocked from seeing her. Because the 82-year-old matriarch of the Jackson music dynasty was taken across state lines, Katherine Jackson attorney Sandra Ribera said earlier, she hopes the FBI will investigate the circumstances of what she called her disappearance. Jermaine Jackson, in a statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, said his mother ""is safe and well in Arizona with her daughter and our sister, Rebbie, resting up on doctor's advice."" But Michael Jackson's three children still have not heard from their grandmother eight days after she left them at home, Ribera said. Jermaine Jackson's statement insisted the children were not ""being 'blocked' from speaking with Mother."" ""She is merely an 82-year-old woman following doctor's orders to rest up and de-stress, away from phones and computers,"" he tweeted. His statement did not explain why Paris was rebuffed during several attempts to reach her grandmother on the phone. That led to Paris posting messages on Twitter early Sunday pleading for help in finding her. ""Yes, my grandmother is missing,"" Paris tweeted. ""I haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now."" It is the latest chapter in a messy dispute between several of Jackson's children and her advisers. Whitmore confirmed that the sheriff's department is investigating allegations that Jackson was being ""emotionally and financially mistreated by family members."" Katherine Jackson has custody of Michael Jackson's children and a 20% share in her son's huge estate. Her husband, Joe Jackson, and her eight surviving children were completely left out of Michael Jackson's will. The abuse probe began when ""a business associate of the Jackson family"" reported the allegation to a sheriff's official in April, Whitmore said. ""Investigators contacted Katherine Jackson and she emphatically denied any and all of them,"" Whitmore said. When investigators met with Jackson she was ""in good health and voiced no complaints,"" he said. ""Out an abundance of caution, we have continued to interview legal representatives of the family about the possibility of financial abuses,"" he said. ""That investigation remains open.""
