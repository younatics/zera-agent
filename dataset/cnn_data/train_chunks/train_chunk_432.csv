"(CNN) -- Rumors that U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden hitched a ride on Bolivia's presidential jet have sparked a global diplomatic feud that's roiled leaders throughout South America. The drama started Tuesday after Portuguese authorities wouldn't let Bolivian President Evo Morales' plane land in Lisbon for refueling while on his way back from a conference in Russia, Bolivian Defense Minister Ruben Saavedra told CNN en Español. France, Spain and Italy also wouldn't let the plane enter their airspace, Bolivian officials said. With no clear path home available, the flight's crew made an emergency landing in Austria. ""We are told that there were some unfounded suspicions that Mr. Snowden was on the plane,"" Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said. ""We do not know who has invented this lie. Someone who wants to harm our country. This information that has been circulated is malicious information to harm this country."" Late Wednesday morning, Spain agreed to let Morales' plane stop in the Canary Islands on its way home, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said. The plane landed there as planned Wednesday, and subsequently took off for Fortaleza, Brazil, where it landed and refueled again Wednesday evening, Bolivia TV reported. The presidential plane was scheduled to return to Bolivia on Wednesday night. The state broadcaster showed crowds of supporters brandishing Bolivian flags and awaiting Morales' return. At the El Alto International Airport outside La Paz, the state broadcaster showed crowds waved signs saying, ""Sovereign Bolivia, colony no more"" and, ""You are not alone. The people of the world are with you."" Opinion: Snowden and a muzzle free press . The plane spent more than 10 hours in Vienna, where Austrian officials confirmed that Snowden was not aboard after Morales allowed an Austrian airport police officer onto his plane for a ""voluntary check,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck said. As Morales resumed his journey, differing accounts emerged of what happened. France denied that it refused to allow the plane to enter its airspace. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called his Bolivian counterpart to express regrets about a delay in the confirmation to authorize the plane to fly over its territory, the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The authorization was granted as soon as French authorities were informed that the plane was the Bolivian president's aircraft, the ministry said. France ""never intended to deny president Morales's plane access to (its) airspace,"" and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France, Fabius said. Snowden's asylum options dwindle . Bolivian minister: U.S. behind Snowden rumor . Bolivian authorities are investigating the source of the rumors about Snowden. Saavedra, the Bolivian defense minister, told CNN en Español that he believed the U.S. was behind them. ""This is a lie, a falsehood,"" he said. ""It was generated by the U.S. government."" Despite several attempts by CNN to get a response, Obama administration officials have declined to comment on Bolivia's allegations that the United States pressured European countries to deny landing rights to the Bolivian president's plane, referring all questions to the European countries in question. It isn't the first time Bolivian authorities have accused U.S. officials of trying to meddle with their presidential plane. In 2011, Morales said he was worried that U.S. authorities would plant something on his presidential plane to link him with drug trafficking when he attended a United Nations General Assembly meeting. Outrage in Latin America . Bolivian Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera described Morales as a ""hostage of imperialism."" ""The president has been kidnapped by imperialism, and he is being held in Europe,"" he said in a televised address late Tuesday night. The vice president called for workers worldwide to protest ""this act of imperial arrogance."" He said Bolivia would complain about the incident to the United Nations. The situation drew a stern rebuke from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, who said the incident was ""life-threatening"" for the Bolivian leader. ""The Brazilian government expresses its outrage and condemnation of the embarrassment imposed on President Evo Morales by some European countries,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""The pretext that led to this unacceptable behavior -- the supposed presence of Edward Snowden in the plane of the president -- was fictional and a serious disrespect to the law and to international practices and standards of civilized coexistence among nations."" The impact of the European countries' actions extends far beyond Bolivia's borders, she said. ""The embarrassment to President Morales reaches not only Bolivia, but all of Latin America. It compromises the dialogue between the two continents and possible negotiations between them,"" she said. ""It also requires prompt and explanation by the countries involved in this provocation."" The Union of South American Nations released a statement Wednesday saying the body ""rejects categorically the dangerous act"" of denying Morales' plane access. The leaders of the UNASUR countries are scheduled to meet on Thursday meeting in Cochabamba, Bolivia, to discuss the matter. By Wednesday evening, the presidents of Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Suriname, Ecuador and Bolivia had confirmed their plans to attend, said Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino, who called the situation ""very serious."" Cuba's Foreign Ministry also condemned the incident. ""This constitutes an unacceptable, unfounded and arbitrary act which offends all of Latin America and the Caribbean,"" the ministry said in a statement. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner described Morales' treatment in Europe as humiliating. ""This is not only a humiliation to a sister nation,"" she said during a military event Wednesday, ""but to the whole South American continent."" So where is Snowden? The situation is the latest twist in what has become a global guessing game over Snowden's next steps. Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States. He has applied for asylum in 21 countries, including Bolivia. 'Unbowed' Snowden seeks new havens . Morales, a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States, had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden. But Bolivian officials stressed that accusations that an official aircraft would harbor Snowden were baseless. ""We cannot lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers,"" Choquehuanca said. European concerns . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged Europe on Wednesday to demonstrate its willingness to defend freedom of information, whatever the fear of political pressure from its ""best ally,"" the United States. His comments came in a piece co-written with the secretary general of Reporters without Borders, Christophe Deloire, for French newspaper Le Monde. European Union states should accord Snowden their warmest welcome, their article said. If he is abandoned in the international zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, it will mean European countries are ""abandoning their principles and part of the reason for the EU,"" it said. In recent days, a number of European nations have voiced concern about reports -- based on documents apparently provided by Snowden -- that the United States has been conducting surveillance on its European allies. France believes it would be wise to delay U.S.-EU trade talks for two weeks in light of the allegations, French government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said Wednesday. She was echoing remarks made by President Francois Hollande this week after the claims first appeared in German and British media. Germany's Economy Minister Philipp Roesler has said the reports of spying do influence the planned talks, said his spokesman, Adrian Toschev. But the spokesman declined to back the French call for a delay to the talks, which are scheduled to begin Monday. All nations collect intelligence, Obama says .

"It's an international air disaster in a war zone -- a commercial flight with almost 300 people on board shot down in eastern Ukraine. As new details emerge, here is a look at basic questions about the tragedy: . Was the plane shot down? All evidence so far says yes. President Barack Obama declared Friday that a surface-to-air missile blasted the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 on Thursday over the Donetsk region of Ukraine near the Russian border. According to a senior American official, a U.S. radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before plane went down. A second system saw a heat signature, which would indicate a missile rising from the ground into the air at the time the airliner was hit, the official explained. Does anyone dispute that? Not at this point. While the Ukrainian government trades accusations of blame with pro-Russian rebels it is fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russia itself, no one has offered evidence of an alternative theory. The plane's debris field indicates a mid-air explosion. Who did it? A preliminary classified U.S. intelligence analysis concludes the rebels most likely fired the missile, according to an American defense official with direct access to the latest information. ""Evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile that was launched from an area that is controlled by Russian-backed separatists inside of Ukraine,"" Obama told reporters. However, he stopped short of blaming any particular group. Ukrainian officials accused the rebels, who denied it. Russia also denied involvement. Now Ukrainian officials have released what they say are intercepted communications in which rebels talk about downing the civilian airliner. CNN had no way of immediately verifying the authenticity of the audio recordings. The leader of the rebels in Donetsk said Saturday he believed the flight was shot down, but Alexander Borodai reiterated his denial that his forces did it. What kind of missile was used? We don't know for sure, but the altitude of the plane -- 32,000 feet -- means the missile must have come from a sophisticated system such as a Buk or Russian-made S-200 missiles. Both Russia and Ukraine have such systems, but Ukrainian officials say none of theirs were in the rebel-controlled area where the plane went down. Russia has been arming and supplying the rebels in eastern Ukraine, and U.S. officials said heavy weaponry, including rocket launchers, recently went across the border into the conflict area. Can anyone fire such a missile? No. The system requires a trained team to properly fix on a target and fire the missile that is longer than an average car. Obama noted the rebels get weapons and training from Russia and had previously shot down government aircraft, including a claimed strike of a fighter jet. ""A group of separatists can't shoot down military transport planes, or they claim, shoot down fighter jets, without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training, and that is coming from Russia,"" the President said. Did surface-to-air missile take down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17? Should downed Malaysian jet have flown over Ukraine? Why was the plane flying over what is essentially a war zone? The Malaysia Airlines flight left Amsterdam for Kuala Lumpur and flew over eastern Ukraine, a common route for international carriers. Most airlines follow the guidelines and rules set by their national civil aviation authorities and take the most direct route available, said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Federal Aviation Administration and other national civil aviation authorities had yet to designate the area where the Malaysian aircraft was shot down as part of the conflict zone in Ukraine, according to Schiavo. ""They hadn't defined it as a stay-away area"" even though there was violence in the region, she said. Have airlines now avoided that airspace? Yes. The FAA said U.S. airlines had voluntarily agreed not to operate in airspace near the Russian-Ukraine border. Later, it issued a notice prohibiting U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice. International airlines also were rerouting flights to avoid the region. Who are the victims? No survivors have been found from the 298 passengers and crew aboard. Malaysia Airlines said Saturday there were 193 Dutch citizens on the flight, the most of any nation. Passengers came from 11 other countries including two who held dual citizenship. The lone American had dual Dutch-U.S. citizenship, according to the list. Who will lead the investigation? Under international convention, Ukraine would as the country where the disaster occurred. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said experts from the International Civilian Aviation Organization, an agency of the United Nations, have joined the Netherlands, Malaysia and the United States on a special commission. A team of 131 Malaysia investigators arrived Saturday in Kiev, but it was unclear when it would get access to the crash site, Malaysia's official news agency Bernama reported. The FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday they were sending experts. Where are the black boxes? That is not clear. Some reports say separatist forces found the plane's data and cockpit voice recorders and handed them over to Russia, though that remains unproven. A Ukrainian official said Friday the recorders still were in the country, but he didn't know their exact location or who had them. On Saturday, Borodai -- the rebel leader in Donetsk -- said his group didn't have them. Examining the recorders will be key, but CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said the crash location in such a volatile region made their recovery uncertain. ""The big question will be, in whose hands will they fall, and will this be a really objective, international investigation?"" he said. Who is in charge of the crash site? It is in rebel-controlled territory, and the international community has yet to establish full authority over the area. Rebels were among the first to the crash site and some of them went through the debris. Photos show people standing on pieces of wreckage. ""It basically looks like one of the biggest, or the biggest, crime scene in the world right now, guarded by a bunch of guys in uniform with heavy fire power, who are quite inhospitable,"" said Michael Bociurkiw of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent a special monitoring mission to the crash site on Friday. ""And there didn't seem to be anyone really in control,"" he added. ""For example, one of our top priorities was to find out what happened to the black boxes. No one was there to answer those questions."" A Ukrainian government official said that talks were underway on creating a demilitarized zone around the crash site with a safe corridor to provide access for investigators and family members of the victims. The White House and Malaysia's government insist on full and immediate access for investigators. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai  said Saturday the crash site's integrity had been compromised, adding ""there are indications that vital evidence has not been preserved in place."" Why impede an investigation? If the rebels fired a Russian missile, as suspected, the international backlash could be severe. Russia could face increasing international isolation and tougher sanctions, while Ukraine could get military aid from the United States and Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he urged his nation's full cooperation with the investigation, but Ukrainian officials accuse Russia of trying to cover up its role in what happened. Vitaly Nayda, the counter-intelligence chief of Ukraine's Security Service, told reporters on Saturday that three Buk missile systems crossed into Russia before Thursday's disaster, all three have now left Ukrainian territory. CNN had no way to independently verify his assertion. How will the United States and its allies respond? Nations who had citizens die in the attack will demand a full investigation, as well as the normal response to any air tragedy such as return of remains and reparations for family of victims. Countries with particular expertise, such as the United States, also will participate in the investigation. The Ukraine unrest -- which pits the U.S. and European-backed government in Kiev against the rebels in eastern Ukraine backed by Moscow -- adds further complexity. Both Washington and the European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia for annexing Crimea from Ukraine and failing to take steps to stop the conflict. Some U.S. conservatives, such as Republican Sen. John McCain, already call for tougher sanctions and arming the Ukraine military in its fight against the rebels. Obama said further sanctions would come if Russia continued backing the rebels and otherwise contributing to a continuation of the Ukraine conflict. CNN Flight 17 full coverage .

"When Leopoldo Lopez turned himself in to authorities this week, he did it on his terms -- and not before climbing onto a statue of a Cuban national hero to deliver a passionate message to hordes of his supporters gathered at a square in the eastern Caracas neighborhood of Chacaito. Lopez, 42, a former mayor and presidential candidate, had planned the event in advance, making extensive use of social media to summon his supporters to Brion Square. He went into hiding last week after the government of President Nicolas Maduro accused him of terrorism and murder and blamed him for inciting anti-government protests throughout Venezuela.  The protests have so far left several people dead and countless injured. Venezuela: What's the crisis about? After staying in a secret location for days, Lopez announced to Venezuelans, and the world, that after talking it over with his family, he would turn himself in. That announcement came via a YouTube video. At the square, Lopez used a megaphone. ""The options I had were leave the country, and I will never leave Venezuela!"" he said to loud cheers and widespread applause as he stood on the statue of Jose Marti. Searching for truth in Venezuela . ""The other option was to remain in hiding, but that option could've left doubt among some, including some who are here, and we don't have anything to hide."" What you need to know about Venezuela . Later that night, his wife, Lilian Tintori, told CNN that Lopez was in good spirits behind bars. ""The last thing he told me was don't forget why this is happening, don't forget why he's going to jail. He's asking for the liberation of political prisoners and students and an end to repression and violence,"" Tintori said. Lopez, a fiery speaker and charismatic leader, has long been a threat to the socialists in power in Venezuela. Back in 2008, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez banned him from running for public office, accusing him of corruption and misuse of public funds. Lopez countered that it was all political retribution and that he had nothing to hide. He took his case all the way to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, where he was cleared three years later. Political roots . Politics runs in Lopez's veins. He's the great-great-grandson of Venezuela's first President and he also claims to be a descendant of Simon Bolivar, the South American liberator who, ironically, is revered by socialists in power, including Maduro. Lopez was elected mayor of Chacao when he was only 29 years old and was reelected with 81% of the vote four years later. After being cleared of all corruption charges in September 2011, he launched his presidential candidacy. In January of the following year, he chose to forge an alliance to unify the opposition, instead of running. He threw his support behind Henrique Capriles, another popular opposition leader, who narrowly lost to Chavez in October 2012. Lopez comes from a well-to-do family in Venezuela. He attended The Hun School of Princeton, a private boarding school, and graduated in 1989. He then attended Kenyon College in Ohio, where he graduated with honors, receiving a degree in sociology. Lopez completed his education at Harvard University's School of Government and earned a master's degree. Upon his return to Venezuela, he worked as an economic consultant and an economics professor at the Universidad Catolica Andres Bello, before jumping into politics in 1999. A magnetic personality . HLN Anchor Susan Hendricks, a close friend of Lopez's in high school, says the opposition leader had the kind of personality that drew people to him. ""He was a hit with the ladies, but he wouldn't even know (it),"" Hendricks said. ""He was very modest."" Hendricks says her heart broke when she learned he was in custody, but she is not surprised that he turned himself in. ""I've been tweeting and texting with people that are very good friends with him up until this day, have spoken with him about a month ago, and he said, 'I will not leave Venezuela,' "" Hendricks said. In a late-night hearing Wednesday, Venezuelan prosecutors formally charged Lopez with arson and conspiracy but dropped more serious charges of murder and terrorism. Conspiracy charges in Venezuela are punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Now the good-looking, easygoing star student is in jail at the military complex known as Ramo Verde in the municipality of Los Teques, Miranda state. Lopez's future seems uncertain at best. But family members say they're standing behind his decision to turn himself in. ""Manuela, my daughter, who's 4 years old, asked me about it,"" said Tintori, Lopez's wife. ""I told her, 'Manuela, he's working for Venezuela.' Because Leopoldo, wherever he is, in jail tonight, he's going to be working for us and thinking of us. He's going to keep on dreaming about a better Venezuela, as he always does.""","Leopoldo Lopez has long been a threat to socialists in Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- The gruesome images circulated by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria might have grabbed the headlines in recent weeks, but the group is merely the latest in the Arab world to try to manipulate Islam for their own ends. From the days of the first Islamic dynasty, ruling elites in the Muslim world have co-opted religion to advance their interests, a trend that has continued hand-in-hand with a willingness to use the state security apparatus whenever necessary. But despite the depressing videos of beheadings supposedly undertaken in the name of Islam, there is growing pushback from moderate voices. The Arab Spring may be on hold, but what I call an Islamic Spring is still very much alive. There are almost half a billion Arabic speakers around the world, but in its early incarnations, the Arabic-language Internet was dominated by conservative, Islamist and Wahhabi radical content. Indeed, what struck me most during my years as a counterterrorism researcher was the ease with which one could access hundreds of thousands of extremist texts. Al Qaeda, for example, offered free-of-charge audio and video libraries. The Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, offered numerous free online libraries. Even conservative religious books, rather than radical texts, were just more readily available online than secular-leaning content. Reform-oriented voices, meanwhile, were pushed underground, intimidated by the political and religious alliance confronting them. But pushed underground didn't mean not read, a point underscored by research I was involved with in 2008 as part of a study with the RAND Corp. Indeed, we marveled at the fact that many of these banned books were widely circulating, despite the fact that they were extremely difficult to obtain. Fast-forward to today, though, and many of these once-hard-to-find publications are readily available with a click of a mouse. So what happened? Unsurprisingly, technology has played a key role, rendering censorship ineffective. As recently as 2010, when I was undertaking doctoral research on liberal Islamic thought, I toured every major bookstore in Amman and could not find a single book by secularist Syrian intellectual Sadiq Jalal al-Azm. Now, however, pirated versions of his banned books, including ""Critique of Religious Thought,"" are available online. But while it is interesting to note how online sharing has extended to books written by current Islamic scholars, it is particularly fascinating how quickly access has improved to translated works such as those of Bertrand Russell and biologist Richard Dawkins. Arab young people now have access to a well of thought not only from their own heritage but from the global community. And while the Internet has expanded as a source of material, it has also, crucially, stimulated debate and discussion of issues, which has in turn generated even greater interest. The free debate of ideas was generally rare in classrooms in much of the Arab world, where education has tended to be based on rote memorization. The religious revolution has been particularly obvious on Facebook, with pages such as Takharif al-Bukhari (Nonsense of al-Bukhari), referring to one of the chief collectors of the Prophet's hadith, or oral tradition. The administrators of the page highlight contradictions in the hadith attributed to the Prophet Mohammed, unearthing all-but-forgotten episodes of Islamic history and sparking impassioned debate with every new post. And, far from insulting Islam, such pages urge readers to discover the truth for themselves, often linking to original texts in the process. Another forum, Al-Hiwar al-Mutamadin (Civilized Dialogue), which calls for a separation of mosque from state, has over 2 million participants. Such numbers are only likely to grow on the back of greater Internet access. Businessman and entrepreneurship guru Chris Schroeder noted in ""Startup Rising: The Entrepeneurial Revolution Remaking the Middle East"" that social media usage is growing by about 125% a year in the Arab world, a reality that has encouraged intellectuals to engage with Arab youth directly on issues such as reform and enlightenment. Many of these thought leaders are producing and uploading their own shows onto YouTube, reaching and interacting directly with their target audience. Indeed, YouTube has become a sort of official TV channel for the Arab masses. Adnan Ibrahim, a Palestinian physician who grew up in Gaza, delves deep into Islam to find and highlight humanistic messages of love, pluralism and tolerance. And while his sermons are sometimes delivered to just a few dozen followers in a small mosque in Vienna, hundreds of thousands of people are watching and downloading his sermons over the Internet. Similarly, a group of Egyptian young men and women created a show on YouTube entitled ""Al-Batt al-Aswad"" (""The Black Duck""). Muhammad Ismael, its charismatic creator, advocates freedom of conscience for all and calls for such freedom to be included in the Egyptian constitution. With well over 70 episodes, the show has seen its following grow, forcing several official television stations to report on its audacious ideas and interview some of the self-proclaimed atheists. Despite their diverse backgrounds and points of view, what is noticeable about these thought leaders is their humanist and secular perspective, their vast knowledge of both Western and Eastern thought and the creative, sometimes audacious, ways in which they present their messages to Arabic speakers. Like the scholars of the classical age of Islam, many of these intellectuals are physicians, engineers, lawyers and scientists able to engage with young people in debates in a way in which traditional theologians are often unwilling to tolerate. All this suggests that although the Arab Spring has disappointed many in the region who might have been hoping it heralded a new era of openness and tolerance, the long-term prognosis is actually extremely encouraging. Groups like ISIS might be grabbing headlines with their use of social media to circulate outrageous images, but the one-sided dissemination of hateful speech is no match for the more moderate voices able to engage in a free flow of debate and dialogue that is winning over many in the region, especially young people. These more moderate views are underscored in polling by Pew, which showed, for example, declining support for suicide bombing in Jordan (from a high of 57% believing it can be justified in 2005 to 15% this year) and Lebanon (where the number seeing it as acceptable dipped from 74% in 2002 to 29% this year). The impact of the Islamic Spring might be more subtle, and the results might not be as visually dramatic as those of the Arab Spring. But in the long run, it may have a more lasting impact in undermining the extremists and state puppets of religion.","Tech rendered censorship largely ineffective in Arab world, argues Nadia Oweidat .

"The nation's 44,000 airport screeners would lose the title ""officer,"" their metal badges and maybe even the stripes down their pant legs under a bill sponsored by a Transportation Security Administration critic. Called the ""STRIP Act,"" for ""Stop TSA's Reach In Policy Act,"" the bill was introduced by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, on Thursday in response to a series of alleged strip searches by TSA officers. The TSA denies that strip searches were conducted. ""Congress has sat idly by as the TSA strip-searches 85-year-old grandmothers in New York, pats down 3-year-olds in Chattanooga, and checks colostomy bags for explosives in Orlando. Enough is enough!,"" Blackburn said in a statement. ""The least we can do is end this impersonation, which is an insult to real cops."" The bill, which has 25 co-sponsors, would prohibit airport screeners from using the title ""officer"" and would ban them from wearing a metal badge resembling a police badge or a uniform resembling that of a federal law enforcement officer unless they receive law enforcement training. When the TSA was formed after the 2001 terrorist attacks, screeners wore white shirts with embroidered patches.  But in 2005, the TSA reclassified screeners as ""transportation security officers,"" and in 2007 introduced new uniforms in an effort to professionalize the workforce and boost morale. In 2008, metal badges were added to the uniform. At the time, the association representing federal law enforcement officers opposed the badges, saying that they would mislead the public into believing the screeners had traditional police powers. Transportation security officers are unarmed, do not have arrest powers and cannot use force, the association said. But the association on Friday opposed the changes. ""I think it is wrong to strip away the title. It's not the screener's fault,"" said Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. ""I think the bill in Congress should focus not so much on taking away a title but in assuring that the training and experience support the title. The answer is to build upon it; don't strip it away."" The union representing screeners called the bill an insult. ""Every single member of Congress should be supporting federal employees, not trying to demean them,"" said John Gage, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. ""Reps. Blackburn, (Florida Rep. John) Mica and their other cohorts in the House need to stop bullying the TSA workforce, and maybe just worry about doing their own jobs,"" Gage said. ""Instead of actually helping to fight terrorism,"" he said, ""they are inspiring the type of unnecessary and disrespectful behavior by a few members of the public with an agenda that in fact diverts attention from securing American skies.""","Rep. Marsha Blackburn's proposal is in reaction to alleged strip searches .
The bill also would take away the title ""officer"" and police-like uniforms .
This is the wrong way to go, the chief of the federal law officers' union says ."
"Al Qaeda-linked militants justified their takeover of a strategic opposition-held town near the Syrian border with Turkey by accusing the Syrian rebels who held it of being pro-democracy traitors who cooperated with Western officials like U.S. Sen. John McCain. The ousted rebels ""have called for democracy ... which conflicts with Islamic teachings,"" the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria announced in an online statement Monday. ISIS said it ""cleansed"" the northern border town of Azaz of more moderate fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army in the past week because the rebels ""received American Senator McCain and agreed with him to fight Islamists."" Earlier this year, McCain made a surprise visit to this border region to lend support to Syrian rebels. FSA rebels have controlled Azaz and the Syrian side of the Oncupinar-Bab el Salama border crossing with Turkey since seizing the town from the government of President Bashar al-Assad last year. ISIS militants attacked the Syrian rebels and drove them out of Azaz after the rebels refused to hand over a German doctor that the al Qaeda-linked group accused of being a Western spy. The deadly power play by ISIS left at least one prominent Syrian opposition activist from Azaz dead. The militant group also detained dozens of other anti-Assad fighters and activists, some of whom still remain in ISIS custody. ISIS' ranks are bolstered by foreign jihadi militants from North Africa, the Caucasus and Iraq. The group was denounced by the Syrian National Coalition, a Western-backed opposition group that operates largely in exile. ""ISIS no longer fights the Assad regime,"" the coalition declared in a statement published Friday. ""Rather it is strengthening its positions in liberated areas at the expense of the civilians. ISIS is inflicting on the people the same suppression of the Baath Party and the Assad regime."" But it is unclear how much the coalition can dictate events on the ground inside Syria, where the north of the country is controlled by an assortment of rebel factions that often compete for weapons, territory and financial resources. The Bab al Salama border gate is one of the main conduits for international aid to the opposition-controlled enclave in Northern Syria. International aid organizations have established logistical offices in the nearby Turkish city of Gaziantep to coordinate deliveries of badly needed food and medical supplies to millions of displaced Syrians. The U.S. State Department has used the gate for previous shipments of what it describes as ""non-lethal aid"" to Syrian rebels. The ISIS statement included a sharp warning to members of the Syrian opposition who work with Western governments and organizations. ""Those who cooperate with the Americans will be treated like them as per the holy Koran,"" ISIS announced. Several hundred FSA fighters still control the customs terminal at the border gate leading to Turkey. However, eyewitnesses tell CNN that ISIS militants now control the town of Azaz, located less than a five-minute drive away.","The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria says democracy conflicts with Islamic teachings .

So we actually went out to Wyoming this past fall to shoot deer and antelope,"" Kagan said, revealing some rare inside information about the justices and their interactions with each other outside the court. The newest member has become fast friends with one of the most conservative, and had earlier indicated they had been hunting for quail four or five times. All this started when President Barack Obama nominated Kagan, 53, to the high court in 2010 and she made the rounds with senators. Many of those private meetings involved questions about her views on hot-button issues. ""The NRA (National Rifle Association) has quite a presence in judicial confirmations,"" Kagan told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Saturday. ""And quite a few senators ask you your views on the Second Amendment,"" she said. While refusing to reveal how she would vote on such cases, Kagan promised to keep an open mind. She previously revealed Sen. Jim Risch asked her about gun rights, remarking the nominee may not realize how important the issue is to some Americans. Kagan admitted never having owned or fired a gun before. Elena Kagan: Fast Facts . ""But I told the senator if I was fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would go hunting with Justice Scalia,"" she said. And that promise has been kept, first joining him on an excursion to a Washington-area shooting range and then on several hunting trips. Kagan's point in all this is to reinforce what few American believe of a court with five more conservative members and four who are more liberal. Top Supreme Court Decisions . ""We get along remarkably well,"" she told the Aspen audience. ""There are true and genuine friendships. It's true the (ideological) disagreements test people's capacity to work together, but to come back the next day and find your colleague just as delightful as you found him the day before -- we're all grownups and we manage to do that, and the court is full of great people,"" she said. ""We schmooze more than people think we do,"" she added. What's next? Duck hunting, Kagan said. Hear Kagan at Aspen . 'Hot Bench' The current Supreme Court is considered a ""hot bench"" and not because of the courtroom temperature or the relative good looks of the nine justices. ""Hot"" as in the spirited, often competitive oral arguments that have livened up -- or injected chaos into -- public sessions where important legal and constitutional issues are openly debated and discussed. One person who thinks it is getting increasingly toasty is Chief Justice John Roberts, who said on Saturday that arguments have ""gone too far."" ""We do overdo it, the bench has gotten more and more aggressive,"" said the man who presides over those two-hour sessions. ""Recent appointees have tended to be more active in questioning than the justices they replaced."" Roberts revealed his concerns at a judicial conference in West Virginia, saying he is often put into an uncomfortable position. ""I've had to act as an umpire in terms of the competition among my colleagues to get questions out,"" he said. While not offering excuses, he does say one reason may be the nine justices do not discuss the cases among themselves before arguments. ""So when we get out on the bench it's really the first we begin to get some clues about what our colleagues think,"" he said. ""We do tend sometimes to debate each other through counsel."" Justice Samuel Alito, who is relatively subdued on the bench, was more blunt about the interruptions of counsel, and justices speaking over each other. ""Trying to get in a question at oral argument is really like trying to grab an item that's on sale at Walmart the day after Thanksgiving,"" Alito said in his trademark deadpan manner two weeks ago, in a speech at the State Bar of Texas. No joking . Justice Samuel Alito has long had a reputation of taking his job seriously. Unlike Chief Justice John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, or Elena Kagan, he rarely jokes from the bench. And for those who do not know him personally or covered him for any length of time, his personal demeanor can come off as harsh or overly intense. Now some progressive groups have suggested Alito's recent behavior was a violation of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. The Washington Post and Atlantic magazine said he acted with ""judicial intemperance"" and ""inexcusable rudeness"" at the June 25 public session of the court. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sitting next to Alito, was reading an oral dissent, criticizing the majority's ruling in a workplace discrimination case. The isolated media reports said Alito, without speaking, rolled his eyes, shook his head, and looked at the ceiling. The reporters claimed other incidents of ""rude behavior"" in the days prior when Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Kagan also spoke from the bench. CNN did not witness the alleged incidents, but other justices have long been observed appearing a bit distracted when opinions are read in open session. It is a process that can drag on for half-hour or more when the rest of the court must sit in silence. The backdrop to all this involves Alito's public display during the nationally televised 2010 State of the Union Address by President Barack Obama. Alito was among several conservative justices sitting just feet away, when the president attacked a majority ruling on campaign finance reform. Cameras showed Alito appearing to mouth the words ""not true"" at Obama's assertion the opinion would open floodgates to uncontrolled corporate spending in federal elections. The progressive Alliance for Justice now says Alito's demeanor last week suggested a disrespect for women. ""Perhaps Alito felt he could pull the same stunt again because this time, no one outside the courtroom actually would see his antics -- they could only be described by those who were there,"" said a blog posting by the group Monday. Cameras are not allowed in the high court. Those who know the 63-year-old New Jersey native are privately upset at suggestions Alito is personally antagonistic toward women, or to any of his colleagues. Several people close to him told CNN Alito is a sensitive, thoughtful man, without affectation or animus. They also admit he possesses an often biting sense of humor. In a letter to the editor published Friday in the Washington Post, two former law clerks called the media reports ""character attacks"" on the conservative justice. ""This suggestion is offensive and couldn't be further from the truth, as his many female clerks can attest,"" said William Ranney Levi and Dana Remus. ""Those of us who have been fortunate to work closely with Justice Alito know that he is a good man who serves every day with humility, dedication and incredible intelligence and insight."" Alito himself had no comment on the reports.","Conservative and liberal Supreme Court justices fast friends, hunt together .

"No matter what the ballots say, Friday will be historic for college sports. By noon, members of Northwestern University's football team will have cast the ballots that will decide whether they will form a workers union and start demanding more rights. It's a massive step toward changing the longstanding model of the NCAA, and the pressure has been mounting. There is some doubt that a majority will vote for it -- even though there initially seemed to be a lot of support on the team. How they vote won't be immediately known, since on Thursday the National Labor Relations Board granted Northwestern's request to review a regional NLRB director's decision that the players are employees of the university. It could be months before that review takes place and the votes won't be made public until that happens. Since the initial signatures were acquired and the petition was filed in January, the two main forces behind the union push -- National College Players Association President Ramogi Huma and former Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter -- went on a whirlwind tour meeting with lawmakers and lobbyists and speaking publicly about the push. They became especially vocal in February when Peter Sun Ohr, NLRB regional director in Chicago, ruled in their favor. Ohr agreed with their argument that the athletes are employees of the university who make money for their employer and are compensated with an education. The Chicago director agreed with them on almost every point they made at the hearing -- the most important being a recognition that athletes spend 40 to 50 hours a week focused on football -- well more than the maximum 20 that is allowed by the NCAA. But with that win came an influx of dissent from all directions. Former and current players, high-profile coaches, lawyers, lawmakers, college presidents, even some vocal NCAA reform advocates publicly said they didn't think a union was a good idea. Northwestern head coach Pat Fitzgerald, who initially tweeted in support of his former starting quarterback initiative, met with the current teammates and told them he didn't think a union was in their best interest. Two of the team's top leaders -- current quarterback Trevor Siemian and running back Venric Mark -- backed their coach and publicly said they would not be voting in favor of unionizing. ""I just hope the NCAA does understand some things do need to change,"" Mark told reporters after a spring practice on April 19, ""but we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches."" A majority of the players who decide to cast a vote must vote in favor of the union for it to be successful. Meanwhile, today, the NCAA appears to be trying to answer some of the concerns of the reform advocates by proposing changes that would give the five power conferences -- Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12 and Pacific-12 -- more options in how they treat athletes. Among many proposed changes, the NCAA may consider allowing schools to increase scholarships to cover the cost of living, and not just the cost of tuition, for athletes. This all comes weeks after a class-action lawsuit filed by current players who want the NCAA compensation cap to be erased, and more than a month before trial is set to begin in the case of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon lawsuit's against the NCAA. O'Bannon is suing on behalf of current football and men's basketball players, and is seeking to get them a share of the millions that the NCAA makes off of their likenesses.","Northwestern University football players vote Friday on whether to unionize .

"(CNN) -- Former law clerks to Judge Sonia Sotomayor sent a letter of support to the Senate leadership Monday, offering their ""enthusiastic and wholehearted support"" for the U.S. Supreme Court nominee. Judge Sonia Sotomayor . The letter -- addressed to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada; Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky; Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont; and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- was signed by 45 of her 49 former law clerks. The White House said it was unable to find two of the clerks, and the two others had conflicts of interest that precluded their signing the letter. ""Our group includes federal prosecutors and other government lawyers; private law firm partners and in-house corporate counsel; and legal academics and public interest lawyers,"" the letter said. ""Although our professional experiences are diverse, we are united in our strong belief that Judge Sotomayor is a brilliant and first-rate judge who is an ideal selection for our nation's highest court."" In an interview Monday on CNN, former law clerks Lisa Zornberg and Adam Abensohn sang their former boss's praises. ""The judge is a fantastic person to work for,"" said Zornberg, a Harvard Law School graduate who clerked in 1997-1998 and is now a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. ""Professionally and personally, she is a brilliant woman, she's a mentor, she's a fantastic personality."" ""She's, more than anything, incredibly hard-working, incredibly conscientious,"" concurred Abensohn, a Georgetown Law School graduate who clerked for Sotomayor in 1996-1997 and 1998-1999 and asked her to officiate at his wedding. ""Beyond being a mentor to all of her clerks professionally, personally she has been a big part of our lives."" Sotomayor, a Princeton and Yale graduate, spent six years as a district judge and a decade on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The letter came a day after leading Senate Republicans indicated that a filibuster of Sotomayor is unlikely, though they promised to not shy away from what they characterized as her troubling judicial record. Meanwhile, one of the Senate's top Democrats, Chuck Schumer of New York, told ABC on Sunday, ""I think she's virtually filibuster-proof when people learn her record and her story."" But the GOP leadership on Sunday's political talk shows did not back away from criticizing Sotomayor. McConnell, the Senate minority leader, highlighted her controversial remark at a 2005 panel discussion at Duke University, where she told students that the federal Court of Appeals is where ""policy is made [and] where ... the law is percolating."" ""Those of us who are elected are supposed to make policy, but those of us who are appointed are supposed to apply the law,"" McConnell said. In addition, Republicans criticized Sotomayor's 2001 speech at the University of California at Berkeley, where she said she ""would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" ""It does trouble me to say that one type of old person versus another one is going to make a different or better decision,"" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told CNN's John King on ""State of The Union"" on Sunday. The White House and other Democratic defenders of Sotomayor have said that her remarks have been taken out of context. Zornberg said criticism of Sotomayor's remark was misguided. ""What it says to me is that a lot of people still don't know her record,"" she said. ""I view it as a comment that is taken out of context and that, read in context, really just says what many people acknowledge is totally noncontroversial, which is that that life experience is a benefit to the process of judging cases and decision-making, and that you don't leave your life experience at the door, that diversity on the court is a good thing."" She added that, in her experience, Sotomayor ""sticks very closely to the rule of law. That's the kind of judge she is. She's moderate."" In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Obama warned Republicans not to play politics with Sotomayor's nomination. ""There are ... some in Washington who are attempting to draw old battle lines and playing the usual political games, pulling a few comments out of context to paint a distorted picture of Judge Sotomayor's record,"" Obama said. ""No nominee should be seated without rigorous evaluation and hearing; I expect nothing less. But what I hope is that we can avoid the political posturing and ideological brinksmanship that has bogged down this process, and Congress, in the past.""

"April 13, 1975 -- one of the darkest dates in Lebanese history. An attack on a busload of Palestinians in Beirut that day sparked a civil war that would rage for 15 years, leaving some 150,000 dead, the capital divided along sectarian lines and sections of the country in ruins. But ask students in the city today of the significance of the date, and you get mixed responses. ""I think it was a very important occasion for Lebanon,"" says Noor El-Hoss, a student in West Beirut's Al Iman School. ""But I don't know what happened."" Explains fellow student Zeina Naous: ""We are studying about ... World War Two. We are not studying about the civil war, or what happened to Lebanon."" More than two decades after the end of the country's civil war, generations of young Lebanese are growing up with little formal education about the conflict. Home to contesting political groups representing 18 religious communities, Lebanese society contains many deep divisions, and the country's recent past is widely considered too contentious to examine in depth. To avoid inflaming old hostilities, Lebanese history textbooks stop in 1943, the year the country gained independence. ""We have a vacant hole in our history books,"" said independent scholar Dr. Maha Yahya, adding that this absence from the textbooks reflected society's broader silence regarding the conflict. ""There's been no discussion, no writing,"" she added. ""It's almost as if we wanted to apply to history the amnesty laws that we applied immediately after the civil war, and said 'Nobody is to blame, everybody is equally not responsible for what happened.'"" See also: Lebanon's women prisoners find freedom behind bars . The country's Minister of Education, Hassan Diab, acknowledges it's all about politics. ""After more than 20 years ... the teaching of history in Lebanon remains, as it has always been, subject to the interests of various political groups,"" said Diab. Others caution that failing to teach younger generations a balanced view of their history could reinforce sectarian divisions. Yahya said that the absence of a comprehensive, authoritative history of the war left events of the period ""open for interpretation."" ""The children turn to their families and to their communities to learn very particular perspectives of this contemporary history,"" she said. Yahya said that a survey of 3,000 Lebanese 14-year-olds conducted in 2007-8 found that the historical Lebanese figures children most strongly identified with were leaders from their own sectarian background. ""What we discovered throughout ... the questionnaire is that children tend to learn and directly absorb the values of their parents and their communities. Schools were not places where children went to learn about these things,"" she said. ""I think this is in part playing a big role in the kind of sectarian division we're seeing today."" See also: Sights and sounds of Beirut's ""Little Armenia"" Dr. Reina Sarkis, a psychoanalyst and history researcher, agreed. ""They only have the oral history that their parents told them,"" she said. ""You grow up with deep divisions that become even deeper with time. There's no sense of closure, there's no coming to terms with your past."" The result, she said, was a heightened risk of communities becoming ""stuck in the cycle of violence."" In this regard, she said, Lebanon remained a society ""without closure."" ""This is the repetition ... that you get stuck in when you don't do your homework,"" she said.Follow the Inside the Middle East team on Twitter: Presenter Rima Maktabi: @rimamaktabi, producer Jon Jensen: @jonjensen, and producer Schams Elwazer @SchamsCNN.","Lebanese civil war lasted 15 years, leaving 150,000 dead .

"Imagine this:  You've toiled at a company for years and followed all the rules.  You're productive, diligent, and respected by your peers.  In short, you're a model employee.  But the latest round of raises that have consumed the office leave you thinking that your male colleagues -- despite having the same job title -- make more than you. You begin to suspect you're the victim of gender discrimination.  So, you decide it's time to ""lean in"" and secure the equal pay you deserve -- 77 cents on the dollar, the nation's going rate, just won't cut it. But when you take this information to your boss you're told that the company's pay practices are secret and you can be fired for discussing them. Throughout America, countless women find themselves between a rock and a hard place.   They suspect they're being denied equal pay, but have no way of confirming it.  Or worse, they don't know they're being shortchanged because company policies prevent them from discussing their wages. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to prohibit wage discrimination on the basis of sex and sought to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.  Its purpose was clear: Eliminate the gender wage gap, which hurts women and families.  But 50 years later, pay discrimination is alive and well.   Gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity. It's time for our wages to get out from behind the secrecy paywall. A majority of private sector workplaces in America  prohibit or discourage employees from discussing their wages with co-workers.  As a result, employees who mention what they earn are threatened with retaliation, including harassment, demotion, or termination. Women who believe they're the victims of unequal pay face an impossible choice: Jeopardize their economic livelihood or suffer the indignity and economic consequences of discrimination.  Low-wage women workers -- many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and are seen as replaceable by their employers -- are especially likely to choose silence and live with pay discrimination rather than risk their jobs. Still others will have no clue that they are being paid less. Pay secrecy policies can keep women in the dark for years.  Take Lilly Ledbetter, who worked as a supervisor at a Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, for  nearly two decades without knowing that she had been denied equal pay.  Had it not been for an anonymous note, she would never have learned that she was earning substantially less than her male colleagues.  Pay secrecy facilitated Goodyear's discrimination. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has exacerbated the problem.  For decades, plaintiffs were typically afforded discovery, the opportunity to secure testimony and documents from their employer, before resolution of their claims.  But in two deeply divided decisions, the Supreme Court recently abandoned that practice and now requires plaintiffs to provide more detailed information about the alleged discrimination before discovery. This higher burden is nearly insurmountable for women alleging unequal pay.  Because of pay secrecy, their complaints often begin with a strong hunch that can only be verified through corporate records and sworn statements.  Denying them access to this basic information is tantamount to locking them out of the courthouse. Unsurprisingly, workplaces that have abandoned punitive pay secrecy, like the federal government and many unionized workplaces, have been particularly effective in reducing the gender wage gap.  Female federal workers are paid 89 cents, and unionized female workers 88 cents, for every dollar paid to men. Economists have posited that more transparent workplaces will lead to greater worker satisfaction and productivity, while closed pay practices will lead to lower motivation and mistrust of management.  Permitting workers to discuss their wages would also make managers more accountable. The Paycheck Fairness Act,  reintroduced in Congress, would prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss their wages.  The legislation has been blocked, but if passed, would finally close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act. It would permit workers to compare notes and determine whether they're being paid fairly, without fear of retribution. If the legislation continues to stall, President Obama can and should act.  He can sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to abandon punitive pay secrecy and protect nearly 22% of the American workforce.  Those refusing to comply would lose the government as a client. And let's not let states off the hook.  State laws can provide important protections against employer retaliation.  In August, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law banning retaliation against workers who inquire about salary. New Jersey  joins states like Vermont, Colorado, Michigan and California in outlining explicit protections for workers seeking equal pay. Justice Louis Brandeis famously said the best remedy for social and industrial disease was publicity and sunlight its most effective disinfectant. Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act, pay secrecy still masks discrimination.  There is only one way to fight this darkness: light.

"At the start of Syria's civil unrest, Omar would rally against the government alongside his schoolmates, later taking to the streets in his hometown of Salqin. Two years later, at the age of 14, he became a child soldier, training to join the ranks of rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra. He learned how to use weapons, make bombs and use mines. But when it came to fighting on the front line, he was scared. ""Then our sheikh came to encourage us to go fight and gave us speeches about jihad,"" Omar told Human Rights Watch. ""So after two days, I went to front line."" Omar is just one of many boys being used on the battlefield in Syria's civil war, according to an HRW report released Monday. Many are forced to fight in battle. Others must act as snipers, man checkpoints, spy on opposing forces or carry out other, equally dangerous tasks. Amr, 17, told Human Rights Watch that he first joined the Daoud Brigade, an Islamist rebel group, when he was 15. He later agreed to sign up for a suicide attack mission, feeling socially pressured to sign the volunteer list. Other children had also signed on, he said. With Syria entering its fourth year of civil war, grim accounts of child soldiers being used on the battlefield are now emerging. Though the specific number of child fighters in Syria is unknown, the Violations Documenting Center, a Syrian monitoring group, has documented 194 deaths of ""non-civilian"" male children since 2011. Of the 25 boys interviewed by HRW for the report, many reported joining opposition forces simply to follow a relative or friend. Others become opposition fighters because of circumstance -- living in battle zones or suffering at the hands of government forces. The report demands the discharge of all soldiers under the age of 18 in Syria and warns anyone backing such organizations of being potentially complicit in war crimes. It also accuses the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a powerful jihadist group, of recruiting children through free schooling campaigns. Pro-government militias were not investigated in the HRW report, which cited logistical and security concerns. Enlisting anyone under age 18 in armed conflict is a violation of international law.","Human Rights Watch demands an end to child soldiers in Syria's civil war .

"Sherman Lee Criner is vacationing in a bull's eye. Emerald Island, North Carolina, is just west of where Hurricane Arthur came ashore late Thursday with 100 mph winds. The Category 2 storm made landfall at 11:15 p.m. between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, the National Hurricane Center said.  Arthur was charging to the northeast at 15 mph. Criner didn't plan it to be right in its path. He asked his two children and niece where they wanted to spend the holidays, they voted for the beach and he granted the wish. He thought of canceling the trip as the storm brewed but decided against it. ""It's a doable storm,"" Criner said. The lawyer lives in Wilmington and has sat out hurricanes before. He also felt confident sturdiness of their accommodations of concrete and steel. ""We're in an 8th floor condominium,"" he said. When Arthur's eye wall hits, he will wake up son Sherman, 9, daughter Elizabeth, 14, and niece Mary Brown, 10. They'll to look out the window at the surf below, as the storm surge pushes it up Indian Beach. Stormy holidays . Other vacationers hunkered down in hotels along the North Carolina coast Thursday evening as Hurricane Arthur grew into a Category 2 storm. CNN severe weather expert Chad Myers said the storm was getting more dangerous as it developed an inner eye wall. ""That's concerning, because the smaller the eye gets, the stronger the winds get,"" he said. Hurricane Arthur was bearing down on Morehead City, a popular vacation site for the Fourth of July. ""The dangerous part of this storm is going to travel right along the coast,"" he said. Rain was intermittently heavy throughout the day in much of the southeastern parts of the state. The National Weather Service in Wilmington said 1 1/3 inches of rain fell during one hour Thursday afternoon. The office also tweeted that there was some flooding just south of downtown. The storm's strongest sustained winds were 100 mph. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory told residents and tourists to stay inside while it was dark outside. He said the potential track for the storm would move it closer to land. ""We did not expect this western movement,"" he told reporters Thursday night. ""So we're most concerned now about flooding inland and storm surges in our sounds and in our rivers."" There were no immediate reports of injuries and some counties reported only minimal damage. The good news: the storm hit Thursday at low tide, the governor said. The bad news: the storm was now stronger. CNN correspondents at Wrightsville Beach near Wilmington and Atlantic Beach said most people in those two tourist destinations were heeding authorities' calls to stay out of the surf. But people were getting out on the sand to see the dark clouds roll in before heading in for the night. ""We are starting to see the water come up a little further,"" said Marc Leford, the facilities manager at the Shell Island Resort in Wrightsville Beach. ""The guests are hanging tight. They seem to be having a good time. They're ready to wait it out."" At the Frying Pan Tower, 34 miles offshore from Wilmington, Richard Neal said the winds had shaken the old Coast Guard light station enough to cause some apprehension. Neal has turned the tower into an ""adventure bed and breakfast."" But after 99 mph winds and 35-foot waves, he said, ""We were not expecting it to be this much of an adventure."" Neal said there were no guests there and he and his children were sitting around playing cards as the eye passed through. He warned people on land to evacuate. ""These are very large waves and the swells are enormous,"" he said. Arthur is expected to bring storm surges of up to 7 feet, as well as large, damaging waves, high winds and dangerous rip currents that authorities warned could sweep even the strongest swimmers out to sea. Hurricane warnings were up for most of the state's coastline. Parts of Massachusetts, South Carolina and Virginia were under tropical storm warnings. The National Hurricane Center said the storm was moving to the north-northeast. A tornado watch was in effect for 10 counties of North Carolina. McCrory declared a state of emergency for 23 eastern counties. As of Thursday evening, at least 7,200 customers of two of the largest power companies in the Wilmington area were without power. Up the coast in Hyde County, authorities instituted a 12-hour curfew beginning at 8 p.m. ET. Earlier in the day, authorities issued a mandatory evacuation order for Hatteras Island and a voluntary evacuation order for Ocracoke Island, both in North Carolina's Outer Banks. Some of those residents headed north to Kill Devil Hills and other communities and found a hotel room to wait out the storm. Track the storm . Holiday impact . The storm interrupted some holiday plans, including a decision by the town of Surf City, North Carolina, to scrap its planned Thursday night Fourth of July show. The city's website said the storm's fury is likely to be short-lived and encouraged visitors to keep their beach vacation plans: ""Surf City is very much open for business."" But vacationers should not take the warm welcome as an all clear. To avoid tragedy, they should stay on land. The storm is expected to spawn deadly rip currents: rapid flows of water from the shore back out to the ocean that can pull people to sea and exhaust even the strongest swimmers. Tropical cyclones killed six people in 2009, the National Weather Service said. All drowned in large waves or rip currents. Despite the warnings, a handful of families frolicked in the surf Thursday in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. Among them was Derek Cornwall's family, who arrived for vacation in the resort town late Wednesday. ""We were banking on a couple of hours today before the storm moves in,"" he said. His daughter, Hannah, was taking full advantage, playing in the waves despite being ""a little nervous"" about the storm. ""But I'm actually kind of excited because I've never been in a severe storm,"" she said. ""It's kind of on my bucket list."" Robin Banning, her children and a friend planned to ride out the storm at a Walmart parking lot in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. They had relocated there from an RV campsite closer to where the storm is expected to hit, but didn't want to go home to Virginia. ""I lived through Bertha,"" she said, referring to the 2008 hurricane that killed three people. ""This is good. It's just rain."" See Images as CNN crews cover Hurricane Arthur . Keeping the Boston Pops dry . Despite the risks farther south, the storm shouldn't force a total washout of East Coast Independence Day celebrations. With rain forecast for parts of New England on Friday, the annual Fourth of July Boston Pops concert was moved to Thursday. If it rains then, the fireworks part of the show can start, but the concert may have to go, event organizer Rich MacDonald told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""It affects the instruments, and these instruments are valuable and old."" In the nation's capital, the weather looks cheerier for the holiday.

A new national law introduced this week requires the offspring of parents older than 60 to visit their parents ""frequently"" and make sure their financial and spiritual needs are met. ""People are accusing young people of not visiting their parents enough,"" says Wang, adding she agrees with the aims of the law. ""Admittedly, some of them use their career and long working hours as an excuse. My problems are that I do care about my parents, but I have little vacation and my parents live far away."" According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, China had about 185 million people above the age of 60 at the end of 2011. The figure is expected to surge to 221 million in 2015 and by 2050 a third of China's population will be classed as elderly. Neglect . The ""Law of Protection of Rights and Interests of the Aged"" was amended by China's legislature in December after a spate of reports about elderly parents neglected by their children. In one particularly horrific case in China's eastern Jiangsu province, a local television station reported that a farmer had kept his 100-year-old mother in a pigsty with a 440lb sow. Chen Shoutian told the station his mother had been happy to live there: ""She wants to stay here because she feels it is convenient,"" he said. A modest pension and social welfare system, particularly in rural areas, means elderly people are usually dependent on their children for support. More than a fifth live below the poverty line, according to figures from the National School of Development at Peking University. Changing values . Although respect for the elderly is still deeply engrained in Chinese society, traditional values like filial piety have been weakened by the country's rush to modernity. ""The traditional family support system is eroding for many reasons and I think the government would like to slow this process down,"" said Albert Park, the director of the Emerging Markets Institute at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The law stipulates that children cannot give up their inheritance rights in attempt to evade their duty to take care of their parents. It adds that children should pay a monthly allowance to their parents if they refuse to take care of them. The legislation also allows for the elderly to sue their children but does not specify the process or what penalties they might face. It may also prove difficult to enforce, says Ding Yiyuan from Beijing Yingke Law Firm. He told the Guangzhou Daily newspaper the law fails to qualify the word ""frequently."" He added that few elderly people were likely to sue their own children. First case . On Tuesday, XInhua reported that a 77-year-old woman from Jiangsu city of Wuxi sued her daughter for neglecting her. In the first case after the new law came into effect, the local court ruled that her daughter must visit her at least twice a month and provide financial support. But the law's introduction has proved controversial. Some say it puts too much pressure on those who move away from home for work, study or other opportunities. Cheng Zhegang, 50, whose only child is studying for a master's degree in the United States, said the law ""distorts the parent-child relationship."" He hopes his daughter will head to a big city like Shanghai or Beijing to find a job on graduation and not return to the small town where she grew up. ""I don't want my daughter to have a burden both physically and spiritually,"" he told CNN. ""For me, my daughter's career is the most important thing. As the parent of an only child, I have spent so much time and money on my daughter's education and now I want her to be successful.""","New Chinese law requires children to visit elderly parents .

"(CNN)Tommy Thompson was an ocean explorer, an entrepreneur, an author and a diver for sunken gold. So when he dropped off the map in 2006, many wondered what had happened. The feds say they know. Thompson, they say, was also a multimillion dollar scammer who went on the lam rather than pay back his investors after he found millions in treasure at the bottom of the Atlantic. To cover their tracks, Thompson and Alison Antekeier, his girlfriend, used false names, the U.S. Marshal Service said. And they allegedly paid for everything in cash. They likely had plenty of it. Speculations of what the gold loot was worth, and money they allegedly hijacked from investors, have run into the hundreds of millions. The Marshal Service finally caught up with the pair Wednesday. They found Thompson in a room at a Florida Hilton hotel, where he and his girlfriend had hidden in plain sight for a year. He will appear in a Florida federal court Thursday. Thompson, an oceanographic engineer from Columbus, Ohio, was fascinated by the SS Central America, a side-wheeler steamship that sank off the coast of North Carolina in 1857. More than 400 people drowned in the throes of the hurricane that wrecked it. Officially a mail ship, it had left San Francisco flush with coins, bars, nuggets and dust just a few years after the California Gold Rush. Tons of it, Thompson wrote in a book about his quest. He was determined to scour the depths of the ocean for its loot with a cutting edge robotic submarine. In the 1980s, he began infecting investors with his dream, and they fronted him funds to help him realize it, according to a report by Forbes Magazine. The report put his unconfirmed fundraising target at $55 million. He spent it on a team of scientists, engineers and crew, who sailed aboard a ship equipped with sonar and the robotic submarine, which they called Nemo. And Thompson hired historians, who documented the ship's history and artifacts. Years later, Nemo arrived at the ocean floor at the wreck of the Central America. Some of the gold, which lay sunken for over a dozen decades, made its way to the surface. In 1998, Thompson published photos of it and other artifacts in America's Lost Treasure, full of scholarly and technological details. He commissioned a documentary, Forbes wrote, and sought the attention of the media. Then, a few years later, in 2006, he disappeared. His stakeholders feared he had run away with their investments and with perhaps even more millions made from the sale of gold coins. They sued, but he and Antekeier skipped out on multiple hearings, the U.S. Marshal Service said. Counsel representing them stood in court without them. In 2012, federal authorities issued arrest warrants for the couple.  Thompson and Antekeier ducked out of sight, and were last spotted in Vero Beach in 2013. ""It appears they have known they were wanted and were doing anything they could do to cover their tracks,"" U.S. Marshal Barry Golden told CNN affiliate WPTV. As officers tracked Antekeier on Tuesday, she allegedly went from a taxi to a bus then walked about a mile on foot. The couple read up on how to evade authorities, and it worked, the feds said.  Marshals investigated around the globe for them. Then on Wednesday, they found them in the West Palm Beach hotel room.  Thompson and Antekeier told officers they knew they had been searching for them. The couple went with marshals peaceably. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Tommy Thompson hired scientists and engineers to dive for gold in sunken historic ship .

"Muslims in America just lost their right to privacy.  Last week, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that blanket, suspicion-less surveillance of Muslims is permissible under the U.S. Constitution. Since September 11, 2001, the New York Police Department has used community mapping, video surveillance, photography and confidential informants to map Muslim life in and around New York.  No detail has proved too remote for the prying eyes of the NYPD.  Mosques, student groups,  restaurants, even grade schools, have all been surveilled. In 2012, a group of New Jersey plaintiffs sued the NYPD, alleging that the spying program chills religious expression and stigmatizes Islam.  The plaintiffs include an Iraq war veteran, a prominent mosque and a math teacher.  Each was monitored by the NYPD absent any evidence of wrongdoing. The judge, however, ruled the plaintiffs failed to prove discrimination, and found that monitoring Muslims was the only way to stop terrorism arising from the Muslim community.    The court also dealt a damaging blow to whistle-blowers, ruling that The Associated Press revelations about the program caused the plaintiffs' injury, not the NYPD.  According to the judge, the harm to Muslim communities was caused by overzealous journalists, not snooping cops. The most immediate effect of the decision is that it will deepen the isolation of Muslims in America.  A report by The Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility Project at CUNY Law School illustrates this sharply. Many Muslims in New York live under an umbrella of fear.  Not because they have anything to hide, but because they want to be left alone, what Justice Louis Brandeis once called the right most valued by civilized men. They hesitate before speaking Arabic or Urdu in public, dither before attending religious services or joining faith based groups, and shy away from embracing emblems of faith, like hijabs and beards.  Not even students are immune from this incessant second-guessing.  Many vacillate before joining Muslim groups on campus or speaking on controversial issues like religious profiling in the classroom. Nor is the problem confined to Muslims in and around New York.  Indeed, the court's decision raises the specter of something far more ominous.  What stops the federal government from mapping and monitoring Muslims nationwide? Permitting dragnet religious surveillance of Muslim communities will also exacerbate anti-Muslim sentiment.  The NYPD spying program comes on the heels of a nationwide maelstrom against Islam. More than a dozen state legislatures have considered legislation criminalizing sharia law.  Mosques have been burned and vandalized, and Muslims have been the target of countless hate crimes. Congress has joined the chorus as well, with some members repeatedly overblowing the threat posed by home-grown Muslim extremism. This widespread animus has led to a disturbing paradox: More Americans fear Islam today than just after the 9-11 attacks. Still, it's not just Muslims who should be troubled by the court's decision.  It's every American, for in its faulty reasoning, the court has also diminished the U.S. Constitution.  Consider an example.  What if the NYPD had mapped the state's African-American population to stop criminal activity in that community?  The practice would be denounced and defeated in a court of law. Why then, is religious surveillance tolerated?  Race and religion both have a storied role in American history, and both are afforded similar protection under the U.S. Constitution. But, time and again, we ignore the enduring wisdom of the Bill of Rights, and succumb to political whim and social fiat.  The Japanese relocation camps after Pearl Harbor; the blacklisting and harassment of communist sympathizers during the Cold War; the surveillance of civil rights, feminist and anti-Vietnam war activists throughout the 1960s and '70s; and more recently, stop and frisk in New York.  The examples are legion.  So is the disgrace. These policies once enjoyed widespread support and were considered necessary law enforcement tools.  Today, they are a stain on our national consciousness.  Religious surveillance of Muslim communities will one day join this tragic, shameful legacy. But until then, the New Jersey plaintiffs have vowed to press on.  They announced last week that they intend to appeal the court's decision and vindicate their rights.  I hope they succeed.  In the end, they're fighting for the U.S. Constitution, and thus, you and me. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arjun Sethi.","A federal judge dismissed a suit challenging broad NYPD surveillance of Muslims .

"Elliot Rodger's difficulties with women were so devastating to him that he vowed to kill anyone he couldn't win over. ""My orchestration of the Day of Retribution is my attempt to do everything, in my power, to destroy everything I cannot have,"" Rodger wrote in a 137-page manifesto obtained by CNN affiliate KEYT. ""All of those beautiful girls I've desired so much in my life, but can never have because they despise and loathe me, I will destroy."" He also said he despised men who had luck with women and said he would eliminate them, too. ""I will kill them all and make them suffer, just as they have made me suffer,"" he added. ""It is only fair."" On Friday, that ""day of retribution"" came. Authorities say Rodger, 22, fatally stabbed three men in his home before killing two women outside a sorority house and then shooting a man at a deli in Isla Vista, California. By the end of his rampage, six victims were dead. Rodger died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. And perhaps the only clues to the reasons are in the gunman's haunting dissertation of his life. A life-changing divorce . For most of his early childhood, Rodger was a happy boy. But he said his first major traumatic event came when he learned at 7 that his parents were divorcing. He described his parents' divorce as a devastating, ""life-changing event,"" but said he gained more respect for his father after he quickly acquired a girlfriend. ""Males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men, even children,"" Rodger wrote. ""How ironic is it that my father, one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend, has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend."" Bitterness after puberty . But the impetus for most of Rodger's angst stemmed from his unfulfilled desires for women. ""As children we all play together as equals in a fair environment. Only after the advent of puberty does the true brutality of human nature show its face,"" he wrote. ""Life will become a bitter and unfair struggle for self-worth, all because girls will choose some boys over others. The boys who girls find attractive will live pleasure-filled lives while they dominate the boys who girls deem unworthy."" He described himself as a very jealous person, ""and at the age of nine my jealous nature sprung to the surface."" Rodger wrote about the website PuaHate.com as a ""forum full of men who are starved of sex, just like me. ""Many of them have their own theories of what women are attracted to, and many of them share my hatred of women, though unlike me they would be too cowardly to act on it. Reading the posts on that website only confirmed many of the theories I had about how wicked and degenerate women really are."" The site was down Sunday. ""I certainly would not want to blame a specific website for the violence and a tragedy that was carried out by one specific individual,"" Josh Glasstetter, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told CNN. ""But his online activities on forums like PuaHate gave his thoughts and beliefs more of a definition, and direction."" Traumatized by porn . When Rodger was 11, a friend he met through a chat room sent him photos of ""beautiful naked girls,"" he wrote. ""When I looked at the pictures, I was shocked beyond words. I had never seen what beautiful girls looked like naked, and the sight filled me with strong and overwhelming emotions,"" Rodger said in his autobiography. ""I was traumatized. My childhood was fading away. Ominous fear swept over me. ... Indeed, a whole new world had opened up before me, and I had no idea how to prevail in it. I still wanted to live as a child."" The trauma got worse two years later, Rodger said, when he was at an Internet cafe and saw an older teen watching porn. ""The sight was shocking, traumatizing, and arousing. All of these feelings mixed together took a great toll on me,"" he wrote. ""I walked home and cried by myself for a bit. I felt too guilty about what I saw to talk to my parents about it."" ""Not getting any sex is what will shape the very foundation of my miserable youth,"" he said. Taunting and bullying . Rodger said he endured a spate of bullying in the eighth and ninth grades, causing him to be ""more shy and timid than I ever was in my life."" ""I felt very small, weak, and above all, worthless,"" he wrote. ""I cried by myself at school every day."" He said one of his worst days came at the end of ninth grade, when a classmate was bragging about having sex with his girlfriend. ""I defiantly told him that I didn't believe him, so he played a voice recording of what sounded like him and his girlfriend having sex,"" Rodger wrote. ""I could hear a girl saying his name over and over again while she panted franticly. He grinned at me smugly. I felt so inferior to him, and I hated him."" That sense of inferiority carried over into his college days at  Santa Barbara City College. ""Every day that I spent at my college, the more inferior and invisible I felt,"" he wrote. ""I felt like such an inferior mouse whenever I saw guys walking with beautiful girls."" 'Sophisticated, polite gentleman' Some of Rodger's social media posts were more positive than the rants in his autobiography. He portrayed himself as an affluent young man who drove a black BMW Series 3 coupe and traveled the world. ""I consider myself a sophisticated, polite gentleman, unlike most boys my age,"" according to a statement posted on ""Elliot Rodger's Official Blog."" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the social media posts. According to the blog, Rodger was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the United States at age 5. He was raised in the shadow of Hollywood, in the affluent Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, by his father -- a commercial photographer and sometimes director -- and his stepmother, an actress who appeared with Matt Damon in ""Green Zone."" Pictures posted on Rodger's Facebook page show him with his father, Peter, on the red carpet at the premiere of the 2012 film ""The Hunger Games."" Peter Rodger briefly worked as a second unit assistant director on the film, according to a spokeswoman with Lionsgate Entertainment, the company behind the ""Hunger Games"" movie franchise. But it's also in the blog where Rodger railed against life in Isla Vista. ""I have tried very hard to fit in with the social scene there, but I have ultimately been unable to do so,"" the blog states. ""There are too many obnoxious people who have ruined my whole experience at that place."" 'Day of retribution' The day before before the rampage, a video posted on YouTube featured Rodger ranting for nearly seven minutes against women who he said rejected him and popular kids who ignored him. ""For the past eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me,"" he said. ""Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you."" Rampage killings: Fast Facts .","""All of those beautiful girls I've desired ...

"(CNN)It's not up there with Iwo Jima. Okinawa. Hiroshima. It doesn't come to mind as quickly as the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II draws near. September 2, 1945. The day the Japanese formally surrendered in ceremonies aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Many who will mark the various dates preceding that Sunday are old enough to remember the actual events; others will simply pay homage to those who did their part to bring about the Japanese surrender. The date to mark here: January 30, 1945. ""The Great Raid."" A raid led by U. S. Army Rangers to rescue American prisoners of war in the Cabanatuan prison camp in the Philippines before the advance of Gen. Douglas MacArthur's forces caused the Japanese to move them to Japan or, more probably, kill them. After MacArthur's landing October 20, 1944, the Japanese high command sent out instructions on the circumstances under which POWs could be killed to keep them from being liberated. At one camp they were burned alive. World War II magazine's ""American Prisoners of War: Massacre at Palawan,"" said, ""Japanese soldiers ... doused the wooden shelters with buckets of gasoline, and set them afire with flaming torches, followed by hand grenades.  ...  As men engulfed in flames broke out of their fiery deathtraps, the Japanese guards machine gunned, bayoneted and clubbed them to death."" Only 11 of the 150 survived. The Sixth Army, fearing for POWs in other camps, decided to launch rescue efforts.  The first was the raid on the Cabanatuan prison camp. A group of more than 100 Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas traveled 30 miles behind Japanese lines to reach the camp. Along the route, other guerrillas in the villages muzzled dogs and put chickens in cages lest they alert the Japanese. The 30-minute raid liberated 513 POWs. Some of them weighed so little the Rangers could carry two men on their backs. At a rendezvous point, trucks and 26 carabao carts -- local wooden carts -- waited to carry them to safety. Villagers along the way contributed more carts because the Americans had little or no clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. By the time they reached American lines, 106 carts were being used. News of the rescue was released February 2 in the Philippines (because of the international date line), February 1 in the United States. I remember the day vividly. I was halfway around the world. In Chicago. An 18-year-old copy girl at the Chicago Daily News. In my sixth week that Thursday morning when I arrived for work. I was told not to go to my usual spot at the city desk. Instead, Jack Gullickson, the director of copy kids, led me to a square of four dark green metal desks like the others in the city room. The only items on the huge square surface: a stack of copy paper about an inch thick, a pair of scissors, a glue pot and a streamer of Associated Press wire-service copy with the names of the prisoners of war who had been rescued. In the interest of speed, no attempt was made to put the names in alphabetical order. That, as Gullickson explained, was where I came in. I was to alphabetize them. Another copy kid would pick up the latest list for each edition. I'd been there long enough to know the edition deadlines and set to work. When cut apart, the names were quarter-inch wide strips of paper. Names and hometowns spelled out in the distinctive, typewriter-like letters of the AP Teletype machines. I laid them out, with space for new names, and as the 10:30 deadline approached, I reached for a sheet of copy paper, applied a wide strip of glue down the center and started sticking the strips down. As I worked, reporters nearby were leafing through their telephone directories in search of local families, to let them know their son or brother or husband was among the rescued. I noticed City Editor Clem Lane, during a break, stroll over to the reporters' desks. The reporter nearest me, beckoned him with a nod and, placing his hand over the telephone mouthpiece, said, ""His mother wants to know how he is. Is he OK? All right?"" The slow, solemn shake of Lane's head told me ... and the reporter, who removed his hand from the telephone mouthpiece and said, ""We don't have much information on that yet, Ma'am. But he's been rescued. That's for certain. He's one of those who were brought out, brought back to Allied lines. He's in good hands, now."" A final, upbeat note.  ""And I'm sure you'll be hearing from him soon."" It was a little thing, and you can say it was basic kindness. But I remember it, along with the narrow strips of paper on the runway-like strip of glue. And how, because I didn't trim the streamers of AP copy, the paper ends curled up on either side of the names. The slow, solemn shake of Lane's head told me it was bad. An AP story told me how bad. ""SIXTH RANGER BATTALION CAMP, LUZON -- (AP) -- There is a long, dusty, twisting land near here which should become a war monument, for today it bridged two worlds. It leads across the plain toward the death camp where 513 prisoners of war were rescued by American Rangers and Filipino guerrillas. ""... There were also those who limped from beri-beri, legs scored by tropical ulcers and other diseases, and of course, there were those who looked up helplessly from litters. They tried proudly to be soldiers, carrying themselves as erect as possible. ""Many saluted, promptly and stayed at attention when talking to officers. One man who did this crept into a truck and sank back exhausted a minute later."" And they talked. That was when the world began to learn about the horrors of the Bataan Death March -- when the men who had surrendered at Bataan were force marched to POW camps. To begin to comprehend, consider this account from Ken Burns' PBS series ""The War"" -- taken from the companion book by Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns: . ""Here and there along the road, water gushed from artesian wells. Some guards allowed men to pause long enough for a swallow or two. Others shot or clubbed or bayoneted those who tried. .... For Glenn Frazier, as for most of those who somehow survived, the sights and stench and random cruelty all merged in memory, until it was hard to tell one day's horrors from the next. "" 'I saw men buried alive. When a guy was bayoneted or shot, laying in the road, and the convoys were coming along, I saw trucks that would just go out of their way to run over the guy in the middle of the road. And likewise the rest of the trucks, and by the time you have fifteen or twenty trucks run over you, you look like a mashed tomato. ... I saw Filipino and Americans beheaded just with one swipe of a saber.' ""Hissing vultures too engorged to fly battled over the blackening corpses sprawled along both sides of the road. ... One officer thought it his duty to keep track of the number of cut-off heads he passed. He stopped counting at twenty-seven, afraid that further tallying would drive him mad."" That is what the 513 rescued men had endured ... and three years in a POW camp. The names on the narrow strips of AP copy, the two ends curling up. Men who were safe. Cared for. Cared about. Again. No wonder -- 70 years ago or not -- I remember ""The Great Raid."" And think everyone should. January 30, 1945.","It's been 70 years since a daring raid freed more than 500 POWs in World War II .

"President Xi Jinping made a splash by announcing that China will ease its one-child policy and end its notorious policy of re-education through labor camps. This is good news and represents an important step forward in reducing human rights abuses. But it would be naive to think this effort will seriously address the human rights problems in China. If human rights were the primary concern, more specific actions would have been taken. Xi and the Communist Party have other priorities. Under the new family planning policy, couples will be able to have two children if one spouse is an only child. Until now, both spouses need to be only children or they must be from the ethnic minorities to be allowed to have two children. This is a modest change that will mainly benefit the upwardly mobile middle class living in cities. The easing of the one-child policy cannot end the main abuses associated with it since it does not put an end to forced termination of unauthorized pregnancies, even at very late term. Nor does it remove power from the local authorities in enforcing the one-child policy, who have regularly been responsible for abuses. The changes introduced are meant to deal with the projected decline in population, which would threaten China's capacity to sustain its economic growth. They're also meant to lessen the burden on the state in looking after the aging population before China becomes wealthy enough to handle the demands of its ""pensioners."" The abolishment of the system of ""re-education through labor"" camps is a much more significant move. The existing policy gives local law enforcement agencies the power to detain ""undesirables"" -- people who are considered social misfits, prostitutes or troublemakers for authorities. The government can jail these people for several years and force them to work at next to no wage -- all without going through the judicial process and without receiving a conviction. There is absolutely no place for such a policy in any country in the 21st century. It's about time that China do away with it. However, if the Communist Party were committed to tackle human rights abuses, it would have also outlawed other similar practices. Many of those jailed in labor camps are individuals who had grievances and tried to seek redress. Some of them were simply petitioners. They were deemed by local authorities to have challenged their power, or they were seen as destabilizing elements in society. Unless the practice of putting petitioners in ""black jails"" (informal detention facilities) is abolished, ending the labor camps will have limited effect in reducing human rights abuses. There is no indication other similarly repressive measures will be terminated. What the party will achieve is removing a source of discontent toward the government. By doing so, Xi projects himself as a reformer who is going beyond where his predecessors were willing to do. But so far, he has done nothing to allow ordinary citizens to challenge the Communist Party's monopoly of power in any way, or acknowledge that the rights of dissidents or petitioners must be protected. What is obvious with these Xi reforms is that they are really meant for one purpose only. It is to strengthen the capacity of the Communist Party to govern more effectively and to reduce the reasons for the Chinese population to find the party's rule objectionable. These changes will not alter the nature of the political system at all. China's political system is anti-democratic in nature and is first and foremost dedicated to keeping the Communist Party in power.","Steve Tsang: It's good that China ending one-child policy and system of labor camps .

"New York (CNN) -- A settlement in New York City will pay out hundreds of millions of dollars to ground zero workers exposed to toxic debris after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, lawyers said Friday. Plaintiffs narrowly approved the deal after facing a Tuesday night deadline that required 95 percent of some 10,000 people who worked at ground zero to approve the measure, according to Marc Berns, an attorney for the plaintiffs. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected an earlier settlement, saying that it did not do enough to address the workers' ailments. Friday's agreement concludes a seven-year fight between the city and first responders, who have said they were not properly outfitted for rescue and cleanup efforts after the 9/11 attacks, leaving them exposed to toxic dust that later prompted respiratory health issues. The deal paves the way for at least $625 million in city payouts. ""It's a fantastic deal for everybody,"" Berns said. ""Is it perfect? No. Is there a perfect deal? No. But this is as good a deal as you're going to get."" Former New York City Police Department Detective John Walcott, who has leukemia, was less enthusiastic. ""There's too much risk and no guarantees,"" and he rejected the settlement because he did not trust how the funds were going to be allocated, he said. Kenny Specht, a former firefighter suffering from thyroid cancer, said he signed on to the settlement to avoid continued litigation. ""I supported the settlement because it was the only game in town,"" he said. ""What you're being offered is not everything you deserve, but your case won't get dismissed."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the deal ""a fair and just resolution of these claims, protecting those who came to the aid of this city when we needed it most."" ""We will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring of those who were present at ground zero,"" Bloomberg said on Friday. Congressional reaction to the announcement came quickly. ""The agreement reached today on the 9/11 settlement is a positive step for many ailing first responders -- but the problem isn't over,"" New York Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Peter King and Carolyn Maloney said in a joint statement. ""Nearly everyone agrees that the settlement does not provide adequate funding to fully compensate those who are injured among the more than 10,500 plaintiffs in this case, nor does it cover the tens of thousands of 9/11 responders and survivors who are injured but have not filed lawsuits."" New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg praised the deal, pledging to ""continue working to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 health bill in the Senate to create a long-term solution that meets our responsibility to the heroes of September 11th."" Those who signed onto Friday's settlement would still be eligible for the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. If passed, the bill would provide $7.4 billion in aid and medical coverage for 9/11 workers and survivors exposed to toxic substances after the World Trade Center attacks. The House approved the measure on a mostly partisan 268-160 vote in September. Earlier this week, Bloomberg and state lawmakers called on the U.S. Senate to pass the bill.","NEW: NJ Sen Frank Lautenberg praises deal, pledges work on long-term solution for workers .

It was ""crickets and coyotes"" at first, Shivery said, but as the funding deadline approached, support swelled. It came from photo enthusiasts, art lovers, friends, neighbors and customers of Portland's Blue Moon Camera and Machine, where Shivery holds a day job.

"As millions of Americans gather in their homes for the holidays, there will be those who will congregate in a different kind of home. An abode common to other parts of the world now proliferates across America: Tent cities. The total number of homeless people residing in tents and makeshift homes is unknown. Many of these communities are small and hidden from public view, while others claim hundreds of residents and are sprinkled through major urban areas. Some, like those tucked under roadways, are temporary and relocate frequently.  Their conditions are vile, unsanitary and fail to provide refuge from storms and winds.  Then there are communities, such as Dignity Village in Portland, Oregon, that have a more sustained presence.  The 13-year-old ""ecovillage"" set up by homeless people is hygienic and self-sufficient. Preliminary findings by The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty show that tent cities have been documented in almost every state, and they're growing. A report released by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, for example, found that homelessness and hunger rates are rising, culminating in 47 million Americans living below the poverty line.  A fledgling economic recovery, high unemployment and contracting government services are largely to blame.  So is the paucity -- or paradox -- of affordable housing.  While homelessness is increasing, more than 10% of homes in America are empty. Emergency services, meanwhile, aren't filling the void.  Homeless families and single adults are routinely turned away by shelter homes because of lack of bed space. Tent cities are an organic, last resort response to crushing economic circumstances.  Yet, rather than ameliorating the conditions that give rise to these communities, many states and municipalities are cracking down. While some encampments are legally sanctioned or permitted to operate on church grounds, officials routinely invoke prohibitions against public camping and sleeping to disband these encampments, leaving tenants languishing out in the cold. Epithets suggesting that homeless people are mentally ill, lazy, criminal, violent or some combination thereof only fuels the fire. These accusations are largely urban myth. Most homeless people do not suffer from mental illness or drug abuse. Many homeless people have jobs but simply can't afford housing.  Some tent cities, for example, cater to local economies, and many of their residents are gainfully employed. Homeless people also tend to be the victims of countless hate crimes, even though they are a protected class under numerous state hate crime statutes. Lost in this shameful rhetoric is the fact that the right to housing is a bedrock of international law and protected by U.S. law.  Some courts have held that tearing down camps when no alternative is available amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and a deprivation of property without due process of law. That we can even stroll through our cities while some of the residents languish in squalor is hard to believe.  A few decades ago, tent cities would have been unimaginable. In 1964, a group of researchers famously roamed the parks of New York City and found only one homeless man.  Fifty years later, homelessness in New York City has reached a record high.  The same can be said for much of America: Homelessness has doubled since the 1980s.  Those who declare that we're close to ending poverty just need to look around and see the victims of the Great Recession. Tent cities are an ugly reminder of America's growing income inequalities. Yet, in the absence of meaningful economic reform, these self-reliant communities must not be dismantled. Nor should they be forgotten.  For in sanctioning them, we risk capitulating to the epidemic of poverty and shifting our public policy from eliminating poverty to accommodating it. This is already happening in other parts of the world. In Mumbai, India, for example, slums freckle the landscape like skyscrapers.  But sprouting from the dilapidation are antennas and electrical wires. Some of the housing units have electricity, cable programming and mail delivery.  And so the discussion no longer concerns extricating human beings from the slums but making the slums more habitable. We must not succumb to America's great divide.  Doing so isn't just a repudiation of the downtrodden; it's a stain on our national consciousness.","Arjun Sethi: As Americans go home for the holidays, some homeless go to tent cities .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Senate Democratic leaders met Thursday night with White House officials to consider including a government-funded public health insurance option, along with a provision allowing states to opt out of it, in a health care overhaul bill. Sen. Olympia Snowe has been the only GOP supporter of health care legislation. Two senior Democratic Senate sources told CNN that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is leaning toward a public option with the state opt-out provision in the Senate health care bill that will reach the full chamber in coming weeks. According to one source familiar with the White House meeting, the matter was discussed with President Obama but no decisions were made. Republicans and some moderate Democrats oppose a public option, threatening the chances for a bill that includes the provision to get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Senate filibuster. The state opt-out provision is considered a possible way to get moderate Democrats to support a bill with a public option. However, the spokesman for Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a key moderate, said Nelson opposes the idea of a national public option with an opt-out for the states. In addition, the idea is opposed by Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, the only Republican to support any kind of health care proposal so far. Snowe's spokesman, John Gentzel, confirmed to CNN her opposition to the modified public option. Obama and Democratic leaders say the nonprofit public option will bring competition to the health insurance industry and lower costs while expanding access to Americans currently without coverage. Republican opponents contend a public option would drive private insurers from the market and lead to an eventual government takeover of the health care system. Of five health care bills approved so far by House and Senate committees, four include a public option. The other bill, from the Senate Finance Committee, includes nonprofit cooperatives instead of a public option and is the proposal supported by Snowe. In recent days, two administration officials have told CNN that the prevailing White House opinion is for the Senate health care bill to include a so-called ""trigger"" mechanism proposed by Snowe that would bring a public option in the future if thresholds for expanding coverage and lowering costs go unmet in coming years. The source familiar with Thursday evening's meeting said Obama ""pushed for a so-called trigger, because it's the more bipartisan way to go,"" due to Snowe's support for the concept. A critical White House goal in passing a health care bill is the ability to call it bipartisan, so Obama officials are wary of doing anything to alienate Snowe. Also Thursday, 36 moderate House Democrats threatened to vote against the current health care bill the chamber's leaders are drafting because they don't believe it will sufficiently reduce long-term health care costs. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, the fiscally conservative Democrats cited recent testimony by Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf that indicated health care costs under the House legislation could rise after 10 years. Elmendorf ""has already indicated that the bill does nothing to rein in the costs of health care, and therefore may not be sustainable outside the 10-year budget window,"" the letter said. ""We will be unable to support any health care legislation that doesn't meet the president's goals of driving down and holding down the cost of health care, as determined by"" the CBO, the letter concluded. A Democratic leadership aide told CNN that final analysis from the Congressional Budget Office will be crucial to passing a bill in the House. ""If we do not get a reasonable sort of indication from CBO that we're going to bend it, that will be a problem,"" the aide said of lowering costs in the future. House Democratic leaders learned earlier this week that the CBO projected their bill would cost $871 billion over 10 years and also reduce the deficit during that time. But the CBO was unable to assess what the impact would be in the next 10 years. Moderate Democrats have asked leaders for details about the long-term costs from CBO, but no final analysis has yet been released. Rep. John Barrow of Georgia, a leader of the fiscally conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats, initiated the letter because ""the question of cost isn't one that should be swept under the rug,"" said Barrow's spokesperson, Jane Brodsky. CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.","Senate Democrats propose leaving public option up to the states .

"(CNN) -- How's the broadband access in your community -- or perhaps in other places where you'd like to live, work or send your kids to school? Now you can look that information up via an interactive National Broadband Map, unveiled February 17 by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission. It's one way to understand the current state of the digital divide. Broadband internet access is one of the main tools for businesses and people to get ahead or, increasingly, to access many basic services. But not all Americans have broadband access. In fact, a new telecommunications administration report, Digital Nation 2010, says that about one-third of U.S. households still lack a broadband internet connection. Furthermore, 5% to 10% of Americans only have access to internet services that are too slow to even support a basic set of online functions, such as downloading Web pages, photos or video. Mobile broadband is a huge part of the future of internet access, which is why the Obama administration is pushing for its National Wireless Initiative, which would expand wireless broadband networks to cover where 98% of Americans live. However, ubiquitous availability is not the same thing as equitable access, and lax federal net neutrality requirements for wireless carriers might especially hinder the internet experience for cost-conscious mobile users. According to the telecommunications administration, 36% of Americans ""have access to wireless internet service at maximum advertised download speeds of 6 Mbps or greater, which some consider the minimum speed associated with '4G' wireless broadband service."" The catch is that often mobile users never actually see those maximum advertised speeds, as Ars Technica reported last year. Most users who run network speed tests on their phones (something you can do with most smartphones and some other phones), typically see considerably lower actual speeds much of the time. The National Broadband Map is based on data ""collected from broadband providers or other data sources,"" so it may be interesting to compare this map with the crowdsourced cell coverage maps I wrote about earlier this week. Those are based on data about signal strength and network speed collected from mobile users' phones running apps such as Open Signal Maps or RootMetrics. The vast majority -- 95% -- of Americans live in places that at least have access to 3G-speed wireless networks, with advertised minimum speeds of at least 768 Kbps. But increasingly, that's not enough to really be considered ""wireless broadband."" The National Broadband Map, says the telecommunications administration, ""includes more than 25 million searchable records showing where broadband internet service is available, the technology used to provide the service, the maximum advertised speeds of the service and the names of the service providers. Users can search by address to find the broadband providers and services available in the corresponding census block or road segment, view the data on a map or use other interactive tools to compare broadband across various geographies, such as states, counties or congressional districts."" It might also be interesting to consider the implications of local demographics, which can easily be explored via The New York Times' interactive map of U.S. Census data. In some cases, there are interesting correlations between the broadband options available in an area and the race, income or education level of the people who live there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Gahran.","5% to 10% in U.S. have access to internet too slow to support basic functions .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City, that land of hustle and bustle, took on a new character Saturday: Quietness, punctuated by bursts of activity. The imminent approach of Hurricane Irene made for some mighty unusual scenes. Long lines were common at grocery stores as residents stocked up, but streets appeared empty just a couple blocks away. ""Once you get outside major hotel areas it gets quiet pretty quickly,"" said Dan Pinter, a sales associate at New York Running Company, an athletic shop near Central Park in Manhattan. Under siege from natural forces and under a tornado watch late Saturday, the city was going without its subway system, incoming flights and other transportation services. Mayor Michael Bloomberg had issued a mandatory evacuation order for more than 370,000 residents of low-lying areas in the city. Thousands of public housing residents on the Lower East Side were being taken by bus to shelters. CNN iReporter Jon Michael Gimpel, 42, a resident of the Upper West Side, took photos of closed businesses and buildings. He likened the emptiness of the streets to the eerie aftermath of September 11, 2001. ""We got cabin fever and walked around,"" said Gimpel, a system engineer. ""A lot of shops are closed. No one knows what to do."" Besides telling people to heed evacuations and to stay away from windows, Bloomberg asked residents to stop being a little too helpful. Saturday morning, city crews turned over trash baskets, trying to make them less likely to cartwheel away when anticipated strong winds arrive Sunday. Some citizens turned them rightside up. CNN iReporter Elie Shaby submitted a photo of sandbags in front of the Apple Store on West 14th Street, which planned to reopen Monday. Shaby said the mandatory evaluation ends at 41st Street, one block away from where she lives. She does not plan to evacuate but said, ""living in New York City all my life and never experiencing a hurricane before, I have no idea what to expect."" Eden Pontz, executive producer at CNN's New York bureau, said only two riders were on her subway car as she rode from Brooklyn to work at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. Cabbies scoured neighborhoods for evacuees and other riders. Tourists were still evident in many parts of the city. Gimpel saw several eating from the bar stools at an Irish pub. Normally, they would be dining in Manhattan's restaurants, he said. Irene, a Category 1 hurricane with top sustained winds of 80 miles per hour, was heading into Virginia later in the day, taking aim for the Norfolk area. It will pound the Delmarva Peninsula overnight and hit the New Jersey coast early Sunday, with Philadelphia and New York City in its sights. The massive Metropolitan Transportation Authority was shut down at noon. The system, which provides 24-hour subway and bus service across the city, is the transit lifeblood of New York. Its buses, subways and railroads carry about 5 million riders daily. And it might not be fully back up by Monday, Bloomberg said. At the Seventh Avenue station in Brooklyn's Park Slope section, more than a dozen people waited for one of the final subway runs. ""What I'm hoping is that they will run trains for the next hour or two to pick up the stragglers,"" Kate Sandberg, who was headed to visit a friend, told CNN affiliate WABC. Saturday, Bloomberg exhorted residents to leave immediately. ""Let's stop thinking this is something that we can play with. Staying behind is dangerous, staying behind is foolish, and it's against the law. And we urge everybody in the evacuation zone not to wait until there are gale force winds and driving rain to leave,"" Bloomberg said. Pinter, 25, said the running store kept busy Saturday, but he expects it to be much quieter Sunday -- if it remains open. He lives about 50 blocks away and said he is prepared to jog home if he can't get a cab. ""We'll take it as it comes,"" he said of Irene. ""I say there is more curiosity than concern."" The evacuation zone included Battery Park City on the southwestern tip of Manhattan. ""It's very quiet,"" said state Sen. Daniel Squadron, whose district includes the community. ""There are few people out who do not have large shopping bags."" CNN's Phil Gast, Eden Pontz and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","NEW: Resident talks about cabin fever .

"There is a new scandal breaking involving an elected official, a young woman and Twitter. And, nope, it's not what you think. This one involves 18-year-old Kansas high school senior Emma Sullivan, who was on a school trip last week to the Kansas state Capitol as part of the Youth in Government program. On her way back from the event, she jokingly tweeted to her then-65 followers on Twitter the following about Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback: ""Just made mean comments at gov. brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot."" When you tweet to 65 people on Twitter, it usually just ends there, quickly evaporating into the cybersphere -- tweets are truly the epitome of ephemeral. That is unless you happen to tweet about the governor of Kansas. In a move that would have undoubtedly impressed Richard Nixon, the Kansas governor's director of communication, Sherriene Jones-Sontag, is charged with the daily monitoring of any negative comments about Brownback on social-media websites. Jones-Sontag, finding this 73-character tweet by a high school student a threat to the good name of the governor, bolted into action. She contacted the Youth in Government organizers and expressed her outrage over the tweet. In turn, the event administrators, no doubt concerned that the governor's director of communication had taken the time to contact them, informed Sullivan's high school principal. Sullivan soon found herself in her principal's office being scolded for nearly an hour.  Bottom line: The principal has mandated the student write a letter of apology to the governor that is due Monday. Sullivan, who says she was making a political comment on Brownback's conservative policies that she disagrees with, announced her refusal to apologize for criticizing the governor. See an interview with Emma Sullivan . To me, there are a few issues that quickly jump out: . • Who else has the governor confronted for making negative remarks about him?  Recent polls indicate that Brownback has a 52% disapproval rating -- with a majority of Kansas residents unhappy with his work. Responding to these type of tweets could become a full-time job. • Is the governor spending taxpayer dollars to monitor his critics on social media? • Which websites does his office monitor? Obviously Twitter, but what about Facebook and Foursquare? What about MySpace or Friendster? You never know -- someone stuck in 2007 could still be using those websites and making disparaging remarks about Brownback. • Why is it that a conservative such as Brownback -- who generally opposes government regulations -- wants to regulate free speech? Is there an exception to his philosophy of less government when it is a regulation he likes? • Can Brownback demand an apology from me because I tweeted this: ""Rep Governor Brownback of Kansas demands that teen apologize for tweeting he sucks. #Brownbacksucks"" -- and because I'm one of the people who boosted Sullivan's Twitter follower count to more than 7,000 since this story broke? But the biggest question to me: Does the First Amendment apply in Kansas? The message of Brownback's office and of the high school principal is alarmingly clear: If you criticize the governor, you could suffer consequences. That is something you hear about in a Third World nation that does not guarantee freedom of speech, not the United States of America. We need to be especially vigilant in protecting freedom of speech when it involves commenting on the actions of our elected officials. That is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. Having to apologize to an elected official for criticizing him or her, however, undermines our nation by creating a chilling effect on free speech. Brownback did announce this afternoon: ""My staff over-reacted to this tweet, and for that I apologize."" Governor apologizes for 'overreaction' He should be applauded for that. It sends an unequivocal message that criticism of our elected officials must not be limited in any way, and in fact, should be encouraged -- especially by the younger generation of Americans learning about our government. However, it is still troubling that state funds are used to monitor social media websites to determine if anyone is mocking the governor.  It has an eerie Big Brother feel, not to mention that it's a waste of tax payer dollars. Brownback should end that practice today, making his focus solely the issues facing all the residents of Kansas -- not whether he's popular on Facebook and Twitter.","Kansas student tweeted her disapproval of Gov.

"As April 15 approaches, the fact that we tell time in circles brings us to remember the attack on the Boston Marathon one year ago. But what exactly is there to remember? Beyond the facts, what's worth keeping so close that it becomes a part of ourselves? That matters. Every memory changes us, so what we choose to remember depends on -- and reveals -- what sort of people we want to be. Of course, the memories of the three people who were killed that day certainly will stay forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved them. The pain of the survivors will not be forgotten quickly. But for those of us who do not know any of the victims, what does it mean to remember their pain and the suffering of their loved ones? That terrible things happen? That sometimes those terrible things are caused on purpose? We'll be reminded of those facts by the heightened security at the 2014 Boston Marathon. It would be foolish to forget that the marathon is an inviting target. Why hundreds will race for Boston . But focusing solely on the pain and loss of the victims doesn't lead us any further. In fact, if taken to an extreme, it can cause us to forget some of our rights and freedoms, just as the memory of 9/11's horrors led us to cede freedoms of movement and privacy to which we had been long accustomed. So we will learn lessons about security -- perhaps not all of them appropriate. More positively, what should we be remembering and thus letting change us? For me, one thing to remember is that not a single person who made it to the local medical facilities died. Not one. In part it was because of the calm determination of those who took care of the injured at the site, moving them to  medical facilities where professionals cared for them immediately and through long rehabilitations. It's well worth remembering that in the midst of chaos and danger, the needs of others can drive off our fear. But from this I also remember the importance of having a medical infrastructure in place, with people and equipment ready to help. The power of training, dedication and an investment in facilities is worth remembering, and then acting on. I remember how wrong the mainstream media went in its early reportage, and how lost we could become on the Web. The mainstream media made flat-out errors, and a discussion at Reddit misidentified a killer, causing the falsely accused student's family great pain. We should remember that there are consequences to idle speculation. That should make us more patient and more tentative in our judgments. Knowledge can be hurried but not rushed. Boston bombing survivor, a year later . Likewise, I remember being shocked that the younger of the brothers accused in the attack was described so warmly by his school friends as an accepting and empathetic person. From these descriptions, we could learn that no one is to be trusted. I take a different lesson, although one not nearly as neat and clean: People are infinitely complex and never entirely knowable. I remember the day Boston stayed inside as the killers were hunted. We did this not out of fear -- the chance that they would come down your street with guns blazing was minuscule -- but because it was all we could do to help bring to justice the murderers who attacked our city at a moment of civic celebration. Boston was strong because Bostonians acted in solidarity. That strength is well worth remembering. And then there is the memory of the murderers themselves. But I see no reason to remember their names.","David Weinberger: What is worth remembering a year after the Boston Marathon attack?

"When the planes struck the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, New York City Police Detective Ernie Vallebuona raced from Staten Island to the site to help look for survivors, along with his fellow police officers. ""It was like a surreal scene. There was a lot of confusion, a lot of smoke,"" he said. ""You couldn't see when you were trying to walk through the smoke to search for survivors. You know, you could barely see your hand in front of you."" Vallebuona spent the next six months at the site. Three years later, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphoid tissue. He underwent extensive treatment, including stem cell transplants, radiation and chemotherapy. He is currently in remission.  He had to drain his retirement savings to pay for medical bills not covered by insurance. Firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk . ""Most city workers do have health insurance, but unfortunately a catastrophic illness such as cancer or anything like that, you know, not everything is covered,"" he explained. ""There is a lot of expenses that fly under the radar, you don't realize it until you are getting them and like most police officers I know, you are only maybe like three or four paychecks away from the homeless shelter."" Vallebuona is one of thousands of first responders, volunteers and residents who say they became ill as a result of working or living near the attack site. ""People are terribly sick. People can't support their families. People are having trouble getting by,"" said Noah Kushlefsky, an attorney who represents Vallebuona and 3,800 other first responders. ""I have clients who have been evicted from homes. I have clients who can't pay their rent, their phones have been shut off, and these people are in desperate need of some assistance so that they can live their lives,"" he said. ""These are people that dropped everything and ran down to ground zero to try and help.  I have clients who volunteered for the Salvation Army, worked in St. Paul's Church. I have a client from Minnesota who was watching TV, got in his pickup truck, drove to New York, and then spent four months on the pile, and he is so terribly disabled that he can barely walk up the stairs and is on oxygen 24 hours a day."" While 9/11 victims and their families received compensation from the federal government in the years immediately following the attacks, those who came in afterward to help with rescue, recovery and cleanup efforts and then became sick have yet to receive such assistance. For years they were caught up in disputes over whether the air at ground zero was really toxic -- the Environmental Protection Agency long claimed it was safe -- and whether the illnesses could be linked to the attack site. In January 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Zadroga Act, named after New York Police Detective James Zadroga, who died of a respiratory illness after working at the World Trade Center site. The law sets aside money for medical care and $2.775 billion dollars to compensate claimants for lost wages and other damages related to the illnesses. The money has yet to be dispersed, although lawyers and government officials involved in handling the claims expect payments to some who developed respiratory, digestive and other conditions to begin in the next couple of months. Triple-amputee veteran gets 'smart' home on September 11 . Cancer was initially rejected for coverage under the Zadroga Act, but that decision was reversed earlier this year. On Monday, federal health authorities outlined the 58 types of cancer that will be included. ""I think it is way far overdue as far as being added on,"" Vallebuona said. ""Common sense alone tells you that cancer was all along linked.""  He went on to list several other police officers he worked with who had gotten cancer. ""What are the odds with all of these people coming down with the same type of, the same exact type of cancer or a linked cancer?"" he asked. He said early in his career at the NYPD, he would hear about one case of cancer a year. ""Now it's like ... too numerous to even count."" The decision to include cancer has added another layer of complexity to the law's implementation, Kushlefsky said. For one thing, it's possible that some people will not be diagnosed with cancer until years down the road, creating challenges for determining whether the cancer originated because of work at ground zero.  More immediately, adding cancer will undoubtedly mean the $2.775 billion dollars set aside for compensation will be exhausted before everyone is taken care of, meaning that Congress will have to step in to provide additional funds. Kushlefsky is confident that will happen. ""I would be shocked if the federal government decided somebody was sick from being down there, has been damaged in a certain amount, and then decided that they're only going to pay a fraction of it,"" he said. ""I mean, it's pretty obvious that at some point the government's going to have no choice but to fully fund this for all covered illnesses."" Vallebuona, now retired from the NYPD, is grateful his cancer is in remission and a little unsure about whether any money will ever come through. ""You know, it's really an unknown,"" he said. ""I'm not sure what it holds. It's been something they've been talking about for 10 years now, and it's always this little carrot dangling."" And if the money does come through, Vallebuona has no idea how much he could get. ""I'm not even thinking about that,"" he said. ""If I can recoup what I lost alone in terms of co-payments and parking garage bills, I will be a happy man."" 58 cancers receive 9/11 fund coverage .","Zadroga Act set aside funds for those exposed to toxins while working at ground zero .

After Deadline reported Tuesday that Disney is considering the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star for a possible reboot of the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise, hard-core Pratt fans and the not-so-much so took to social media to cast their votes. Even ""Modern Family"" star Sarah Hyland and Matt Shively  of ""True Jackson"" weighed in to give their thumbs up. ""MythBusters"" co-host Adam Savage offered an assist. But not everyone was ready to jump on the ark with this casting decision. For the record, this is not the first time this discussion has been had. Months ago, Latino Review reported that Bradley Cooper was being considered for the Indiana Jones role as part of a James Bond-ian recasting, in which different actors would helm the franchise over the years. Variety writer Justin Kroll tweeted that Pratt didn't even know he was under consideration. Neither the actor nor Disney has commented on the speculation. What do you think?

"Militants shot down a Ukrainian military helicopter late Tuesday afternoon in eastern Ukraine, less than a week after Ukraine's President declared a cease-fire in Kiev's fight against pro-Russian separatists, a Ukrainian anti-terror spokesman said. All nine people who were aboard the Mi-8 helicopter near Slovyansk are believed to have died, said Vladislav Seleznev, spokesman for Ukraine's anti-terror operation. A missile fired from a man-portable air-defense system hit the helicopter, Seleznev said. Afterward, the militants who brought down the aircraft hid in a nearby village, Bylbasovka, according to Seleznev. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March when Russia annexed the previously Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and massed troops along other parts of its border with Ukraine. Ukraine's government in Kiev has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russia separatists, who have led uprisings in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday declared a cease-fire with pro-Russia separatists, saying military units would respond only if they're attacked. He warned militants to abandon their weapons before the cease-fire expires on June 27. The cease-fire includes the closure of the Ukraine-Russia border, and Poroshenko called for changes to Ukraine's Constitution to decentralize power. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week welcomed the cease-fire and said it ""should be used to begin constructive negotiations and political compromises between the opponent parties in eastern Ukraine,"" according to the Kremlin. On Tuesday, Putin asked Russia's upper house of Parliament to cancel a March 1 resolution that authorizes Russia to use force in Ukraine, state-run news agency ITAR-Tass reported. Lawmakers had passed that resolution weeks before Russia annexed Crimea. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine came after Ukraine's Parliament ousted Viktor Yanukovych from the presidency on February 22. Yanukovych's departure came after months of protests in Kiev -- demonstrations motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.","Militants hit helicopter with missile, Ukrainian spokesman says .

"Get ruthless. That is Rio Ferdinand's message to soccer's authorities in the fight to tackle the scourge of racism. The former England and Manchester United star also believes football's world and European governing bodies should consult current players when meting out punishments. Ferdinand, currently plying his trade for English Premier League strugglers Queens Park Rangers, thinks the game still has a long road to travel in what is proving an exhaustive and complex battle. The 35-year-old's brother Anton was at the center of one of the most high-profile English cases of recent times, when he accused Chelsea captain John Terry of racial abuse. And Ferdinand is resolute in his belief that the war on discrimination is one football cannot wage alone. ""There were a lot of campaigns that were going on over the years that I was a part of and I thought 'Yes. Football is doing a great job, especially in England,'"" Ferdinand told CNN. ""And then all of a sudden (the Terry case) made me realize that it was just put under the carpet a little bit and it was still there. But it made me realize that football can't be the tool that kind of eradicates racism. ""It's got to be a social element to it. Schools, parenting, education has got to play a bigger role in getting rid of racism. ""There has been progress but there's also been times where you think 'I thought we'd got past that.' ""I think sometimes the powers that be sometimes aren't ruthless enough in handing out punishments and that where I'd like there to be sometimes more dialogue maybe with people that are playing the game still -- people of different races to be in the decision making process as well. ""So that people who are making the decisions understand that it does hurt when these type of things happen on a football pitch or a stadium or around sports."" Ferdinand cites the incident involving his brother and ex-England captain Terry, as well as former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez's eight-match ban for abusing Patrice Evra -- then of Manchester United -- as evidence that racism is still a major issue in today's game. Terry was found not guilty in court of abusing Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in October 2011 but the Football Association later banned him for four matches and fined him £220,000 ($355,000) on the same charge. Terry later apologized for the language he used. Ferdinand calls Terry ""an idiot"" in his autobiography #2sides in reference to the case and now thinks a conversation at the time might have helped heal some of the wounds. ""I do a whole chapter on the relationship between myself and John and my brother and, yes, I think that would have solved a lot of problems if there would've been a conversation, an apology, at the beginning,"" he explained. ""I think things might have gone a bit differently, but again the powers that be made a lot of decisions that we maybe didn't agree with at the time. ""That could've maybe had a different outcome to the whole situation if we were listened to. But, as I said, it's all stuff that I've had to go over and talk about in the book and it's been a bit of a healing process so to speak."" Incidents of racism haven't been restricted to on-field events, with chants from fans also prompting soccer's authorities to issue sanctions. There have been a string of incidents over recent seasons, with  CSKA Moscow's European Champions League tie with Bayern Munich on Tuesday held behind closed doors due to a racist incident in last season's competition. Brazilian club Gremio was banned from a cup competition in September after an opponent's goalkeeper was racially abused during a match. And Ferdinand thinks heftier fines would act as firm deterrent, with stadium bans dished out to repeat offenders. ""If it's going to be money, then it's got to be huge amounts,"" he explained. ""There's vast amounts of money in the game so it should be reflected in the punishment. ""If you're going to hand a Federation a £60,000 ($96,000) fine when that Federation's pulling in millions a year that is not going to hurt. So it's got to equate to what they generate I think. Or you ban them from playing in their home country. ""If you say to a country 'Listen you're not going to play your national games in your country now after what just happened in the stadium,' I think the fans will start thinking a bit differently. ""And as I said that doesn't stop racism. It just stops it in a stadium. ""So that's why I always talk about a bigger idea on racism and a social element rather than just football but it stops it in a stadium and hopefully that can be then hopefully replicated, maybe, in society."" Much of the spotlight has centered on Russia, hosts of the 2018 World Cup. The country's football association was fined after its fans directed racist abuse at a Czech Republic player during Euro 2012. CSKA Moscow has twice been forced to play matches either behind closed doors or with part of its stadium shut due to racist incidents, one after Manchester City's Yaya Toure was subjected to monkey chants in October 2013. The most recent, against Bayern Munich this week, was in response to an incident during a match with Czech club Viktoria Plzen, also last season. But Ferdinand thinks countries should be given a chance to clean up their act, with Russia being no exception. ""Yes they've had issues in the past but I think they should be given that opportunity to rectify that,"" he said. ""There's no bigger event on the planet than the World Cup and this is a time they can cover themselves in some glory. ""That's down to their federation and the people that run their game to make sure that they put in place things to happen that if they do step out of line there's going to be big punishments and as I said, that's the only way that they can kind of rectify any mistakes they've made in the past."" Ferdinand has been linked with a role within FIFA but says while he is always available to consult he is firmly focused on playing for the time being. ""No I'm not in the line for any of those positions to be honest with you,"" he added. ""I'm concentrating on playing football. I'm happy playing football. If they want a conversation about various things, I'm always here and willing to be speak. ""Once I retire then things like that maybe can be approached and looked upon but right now all my efforts are in trying to help QPR stay up in the Premier League.""","Rio Ferdinand says soccer's authorities must get ruthless on racism .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi forces detained the suspected leader of a terrorist cell network believed to be funded by Saddam Hussein's eldest daughter, who is wanted by Iraqi authorities on terrorism charges, the U.S. military announced Monday. Raghad Hussein is currently living in Jordan under the protection of the royal family. The raid happened Sunday in Hussein's hometown of Tikrit. It was carried out by Iraqi forces, advised by U.S. Special Forces, the military said. The network, believed to be funded by Raghad Hussein, has been ""linked to a series of attacks on coalition forces"" using rocket-propelled grenades and roadside bombs, the military said. ""These attacks have claimed the lives of numerous Soldiers and Airmen,"" a military statement said. Other leaders of the network have been detained in previous raids, the military said. The international police organization Interpol last year issued an alert to authorities across the world that Raghad Hussein is wanted by Iraqi authorities. The Iraqi government has issued an arrest warrant for the 38-year-old daughter of the late Iraqi leader on charges of inciting terrorism and crimes against life and health. Interpol -- based in Lyon, France -- issued a Red Notice in the case. That is a request to police anywhere to help track her down and extradite her to Iraq.

"There were three of them, one of them probably a child, and at least one met a gruesome end at the hands of a terrifying predator. About 67 million years later, a Wyoming rancher led scientists to their remains. Now experts are digging out one of the most complete skeletons yet of a Triceratops, the three-horned, plant-eating dinosaur that was one of the last of the giant reptiles. ""There's only three other skeletons that will match the completeness of one of the specimens we're excavating right now,"" said paleontologist Peter Larson, president of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. Most of the remains found before now have included fewer than half of the prehistoric creatures' bones, Larson said Monday. The most complete to date, now on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas, has about 76% of its skeleton. ""The largest, more mature individual appears to be the most complete,"" Larson said. ""One is just a bit smaller, and there's another one that by live weight is probably only half the size."" Will mammoths be brought back to life? Liquid blood fuels cloning hopes . The dig is going on near Newcastle, Wyoming, more than 200 miles north of Cheyenne. ""The fact that there are three of them together is really cool,"" Larson said. The trio could be male and female and their young, or they could be two females looking after a juvenile dinosaur, he said. And before now, there was no indication that the Triceratops moved in groups. The Black Hills Institute is working with the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, from the Netherlands, on the dig. Larson called the discovery of a young Triceratops a ""very significant"" find as well, since it will give scientists an insight into how the great lizards grew up. Newly discovered dinosaur fossil is a primitive bird . Triceratops lived in the twilight of the Cretaceous Period, about a half a million years before the dinosaurs' extinction. Much of what is now the Great Plains and southern Canada was once part of a vast inland sea, and the region is rich in fossils. ""Like most of the specimens that were found, it was brought to our attention by a rancher,""  Larson said. The rancher sent photos to the Black Hills Institute, located in neighboring South Dakota, in late 2012. Excavation began in May and is expected to take about a month. So far, the bones that have turned up point to a violent end, probably at the hands of the feared Tyrannosaurus rex. On the largest of the three specimens, at least two of the major limb bones were ""bitten through,"" Larson said. ""If you can imagine, this is a bone that is nearly four feet long,"" he said. But a T.rex ""would kind of chop the carcass up with their giant, shearing jaws,"" ripping through flesh and bone alike. ""I think we also have a feeding site for Tyrannosaurus rex, which is very exciting,"" he said. ""This is potentially a site where we can learn the behavior of two different species.""

"Perhaps they could be called X-Women. For 50 years, Marvel Comics' X-Men have been known for being ahead of their time in terms of diversity and tackling issues of social justice. In this week's ""X-Men"" #1, the team of mutant superheroes will look a little different than what fans are used to: They're all women. Not only is it the first time that an X-Men team has been all female (in a primary ""X-Men"" title, no less), but Storm, Rogue, Jubilee, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke join the Fearless Defenders as one of two Marvel female super-teams. Before that, the best-known all-female super teams were DC Comics' ""Birds of Prey,"" introduced in 1996, and 1998's indie book ""Danger Girl."" (Another all-woman team was pitched to Marvel and reportedly rejected, and in 2011, the sole Marvel title with a solo female protagonist, ""X-23,"" was canceled because of low sales, while  ""Red She-Hulk"" will be canceled as of August). Never before has a household name team like X-Men been turned over to only women. But the late Professor Charles Xavier's school has been named after the X-Men's first female member, Jean Grey, since 2011. If any existing superhero team were going to be rebooted this way, it would be the X-Men, with its many strong female characters. CNN recently spoke with ""X-Men"" writer Brian Wood and editor Jeanine Schaefer about this historic moment in X-history. CNN: Did you originally set out to put together an all-female team? Schaefer: This is 100% something I've wanted to do in my heart of hearts for years. And when Brian started on X-Men, his team was only women. Wood: It's kind of hard to pin down exactly how it got to this. It was kind of easy to make that leap. Schaefer: People seemed to be connecting with it. It was just the team that worked and gelled. It was the team Brian wanted to write and the team that I wanted to read. There's been a lot of talk about female characters in comics. This felt like the time was right. Wood: X-Men is so rife with powerful female characters anyway, more so than any comic book universe or group. Our lineup is total A-listers. You can build a team with your eyes closed. All the stars aligned. CNN: How was it decided who would make up the team? Wood: Jeanine and I spoke for six months about this. New ideas came to us; other X-Men books were being developed. I don't know if we picked the cast first and figured how they would work together. Schaefer: It went through so many iterations, I honestly don't know how we got here either. You love Storm. Wood: I like Storm. I wanted her without a doubt. We were gonna bring Jubilee back; she has been absent for a period of time. These were like the best of the best characters. It made sense  to pack it with big names. The characters have histories with each other which makes for a natural team makeup. CNN: Do you think this is in keeping with the X-Men tradition? Schaefer: This is definitely not the first all-female team in comics, but there's also a history of finding it harder to do. For me, it's tough because you want to do it. If it doesn't succeed, it gets pointed out that  that's because it's a team of all women. Wood: I've seen that happen. Even now, there's a lot of peanut gallery comments about the fact that it's a female team. It's happened before and been unfairly blamed. I think what makes this so great. Through Jeanine's hard work at Marvel, this is ""X-Men"" #1. If any book is gonna have a shot at it, I truly believe it's gonna stick. We're not gonna bring in dudes to bring up sales. It's gonna be a powerhouse seller. CNN: Since this is book is part of the ""Marvel Now"" line, will we see any changes in some of the characters? Schaefer: A couple of the costumes are recently new. Wood: So far, there's one modification to one of their powers. There's a child in the mix, and that's a pretty big change. Schaefer: A lot of these characters are in other books also. We want to make sure you're getting the same character across all these books. We want to make sure that we're reflecting what's going on with Rogue in ""Uncanny Avengers,"" for example. Wood: I definitely have a lot of flexibility with Jubilee. She's a favorite character of mine. I wouldn't call her the leader, but she's definitely the focus at the beginning here. CNN: What else can we expect in the first few issues? Wood: There's this existing X-Men villain called Sublime, an infectious bacteria that can infect host bodies. We have that guy back as a new persona. He brings along his evil twin who becomes sort of an uber-villain. The X-Men and Sublime are forced to work together. This is an action book.

"The suspect in last week's deadly shooting rampage inside a crowded Colorado movie theater booby-trapped his Aurora apartment with more than 30 homemade grenades and 10 gallons of gasoline, a law enforcement official who viewed video showing the apartment's interior has told CNN. The sophisticated setup at the sparsely furnished third-floor, one-bedroom apartment of James E. Holmes was meant to harm, or possibly kill, anyone who entered -- and tested the skills of bomb squad members charged with clearing it. ""Imagine that fireball ... you would have an explosion that would knock down the wall of (nearby) apartments,"" the official said Monday. ""That flame would have consumed the entire third floor."" Focusing on the victims, not the shooter . ""By the time a fire truck would have arrived, they would have arrived to a building that would have been completely consumed in flames."" The grenades were wired in the kitchen to a control box, which bomb technicians used a robot to disable by squirting water on it. ""It looked like spaghetti,"" according to the official, who said it resembled explosive setups more commonly used in Iraq and Afghanistan. The control box has been sent to Quantico, Virginia, for forensic analysis at the FBI laboratory, the official said. Shooting survivors recount Colorado movie theater horror . The setup appears to have been ""rigged"" to explode, the official said. The forensic analysis is expected to determine whether it would have done so had it not been disabled. The gasoline was divided into glass containers and gas cans to ""enhance the thermal effect"" of any explosion, the official said. Over the weekend, Aurora Police Chief Daniel Oates told reporters there was ""evidence of ... some calculation and deliberation"" in the Friday attack at the Century Aurora 16 multiplex. Holmes received deliveries over the past four months at his home and work addresses, which may explain how he may have obtained some of the materials that were used in the attack or found at his apartment, Oates said. The University of Colorado-Denver School of Medicine, where Holmes enrolled as a doctoral candidate in its neuroscience program but later withdrew, was investigating whether he received any of shipments while working as a research assistant at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. Tales of heroism abound from Colorado movie theater . Authorities have been tight-lipped about a possible motive in the case; police spokesman Frank Fania told CNN that Holmes has been uncooperative with investigators. The multiplex, where the shootings occurred during a midnight premiere of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" will remain shuttered at least until Wednesday while police complete their investigation of the crime scene and allow the suspect's defense team access to it. On Monday, Holmes made his first court appearance. Looking dazed at times, Holmes -- who after the attack identified himself to police as ""the Joker"" -- wore a maroon jumpsuit over a white T-shirt and gave little indication that he was paying attention to the courtroom procedure that ensured he will continue to be held without bond. Grief counselors offer solace amid tragedy . He was then led from the courtroom and back to the Arapahoe County Jail, where he is being held in isolation. Formal charges are expected to be filed July 30. ""The charges on which the court found cause included first-degree murder,"" Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers told reporters outside the courthouse. She said prosecutors have a lot of work to do. ""I would say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case,"" she said. ""We're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence."" Opinion: Looking into the minds of killers . Deciding whether to pursue the death penalty is a long process that involves input from victims and their relatives, she said. A capital case would require a finding of either extreme indifference or deliberation, she said. Holmes is being held in connection with the shootings that killed 12 people and left 58 others wounded. As of Tuesday evening, 20 people remained hospitalized -- six of them in critical condition -- in five area hospitals, hospital spokespersons said. Four of those killed were active members of the the U.S. military. The Department of Defense was flying flags at half-staff in their honor. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . Meanwhile, Lisa Damiani, an attorney representing the Holmes family but not the suspect, said his family members were keeping their location secret. ""I don't think they would like the media to know where they are,"" she said, adding that she feared for their safety. ""They're doing as well as they can, under the circumstances,"" Damiani told reporters at her office in San Diego, California, where the family lives. ""I think everyone can imagine how they're feeling -- anyone who's ever been a parent."" She added, ""The family has elected not to discuss James or their relationship with James at this time."" The family issued a statement Friday saying, ""Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved.""

"By now we're all familiar with the term Bitcoin, the notorious digital currency with dozens of copycats. But most of us would find it difficult to imagine actually using this crypto-currency or even picturing what it looks like. In fact, only a handful of venues in bustling London actually accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. That could be changing though, as the UK's first Bitcoin ATM machine arrived earlier this year at The Old Shoreditch Station café and bar in modish East London. CNN set out to find out more about the machine which allows customers to buy coffees and cakes in the café. Jaguarshoes Collective founder and café owner Nick Letchford was already using Bitcoin as a form of currency when he decided to install the machine after meeting a fellow enthusiast who pitched the idea to him. ""I am quite a sci-fi enthusiast and well, immediately I was captivated by the idea of it. I saw it as very much the way forward,"" Letchford told CNN's Nina Dos Santos, at the café in London. ""I mean, a virtual currency or a digital currency is definitely the way the future of finance is headed,"" he said. The owner of the machine, Joel Raziel, said he had the idea to install a machine in Letchford's café after seeing one at a convention several months ago. ""I was so amazed by the machine. I thought someone might bring one to the UK,"" said Raziel. ""The reason I really like Bitcoin is our financial system is very limited. We can send music, we can send messages, we can send any type of information, the only thing we can't send is money without having to go through banks,"" Raziel told Dos Santos. If it sounds too much like a movement of the anti-establishment, Raziel is quite sure it's grown into something much greater than that. ""It's about freedom, it's not about trying to go against something, it's just about trying to make the world a financial place we'd like to operate in,"" he explained. So how does it work? ""We can put a 5 pound note into the Bitcoin ATM and it will give you a value of Bitcoin that exchanges to that value of 5 pounds,"" explained Letchford.

Raziel couldn't agree more. ""We now have online banking, we now have chip and pin, we pay with wire transfers over the internet. In fact, very few people are using cash these days,"" says Raziel.

"China announced Sunday that it had landed a fighter jet on the deck of an aircraft carrier for the first time, but it may be years before the ship is fully operational. China's ""first generation multi-purpose carrier-borne fighter jet,"" known as the J-15, successfully completed its first landing on the Liaoning, an aircraft carrier China built using an abandoned Soviet hull, according to China's official news agency Xinhua. The J-15's capabilities are comparable to the Russian Su-33 jet and the U.S. F-18, Xinhua reported. The Chinese-designed jet can ""carry multi-type anti-ship, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, as well as precision-guided bombs, the report said. The U.S. military, in its latest annual assessment of China's military capability, predicted ""it will still take several additional years for China to achieve a minimal level of combat capability for its aircraft carriers."" The Liaoning will be able to carry 30 J-15 fighter planes and will have a crew of 2,000, according to a People's Daily Online report published when it completed its first sea trials in August 2011. China bought the shell of the carrier, then called the Varyag, from Ukraine in 1998. Its construction was begun under the Soviet military before the breakup of the Soviet Union. The Pentagon report said another carrier, one made from components made in China, may already be under construction and ready to sail in 2015. ""China likely will build multiple aircraft carriers and associated support ships over the next decade,"" the U.S. assessment said. The United States, Britain and Japan launched the first aircraft carriers nearly a century ago. The U.S. Navy, with 11, is the only fleet that currently operates more than one.","China's J-15 jet completed its first landing on the aircraft carrier Liaoning, Xinhua says .

"At least 79 people were killed and roughly 270 others wounded Sunday in a fresh wave of violence largely targeting Iraqi security forces and predominantly Shiite areas, government officials said. The blasts and shootings across Iraq come on the heels of a particularly brutal few recent weeks in the Middle Eastern nation. More than 70 Iraqi security force members, for instance, were killed last month, according to the Interior Ministry. ""I strongly condemn the heinous attacks and the senseless violence that, once again, have claimed dozens of lives,"" the United Nations' special representative for Iraq, Martin Kobler, said in a statement Sunday. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad also released a statement late Sunday condemning what it called ""terrorist attacks that targeted innocent men, women and children across Iraq today,"" calling them ""heinous acts (that) targeted Iraqi communities indiscriminately."" Few parts of Iraq were immune to violence Sunday. Here is a breakdown, according to officials with the Iraqi Interior Ministry: . Baghdad . A car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in the Nahrawan district in southeastern Baghdad, killing one civilian Sunday evening. In the al-Shulaa neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, a car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant, killing five people and wounding 38 others. In the al-Washash neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, a car bomb exploded at the entrance of an outdoor market, killing seven people and wounding 21 others. A car bomb exploded in an outdoor market in the al-Hurriya neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, killing three people and wounding 14 others. And in Sadr City, a largely poor and predominantly Shiite area in eastern Baghdad, at least 13 died and 43 were wounded after a car bomb exploded outside a popular coffee shop in Al-Falah Square. Earlier, officials reported two dead in this blast. Four were killed by yet another car bombing in a busy square in another predominantly Shiite neighborhood, this one in the southeastern part of the Iraqi capital. Amara . Two car bombs exploded in central Amara, killing two people and wounding 10 others, according to two officials with the Iraqi Interior Ministry. The attacks took place on a busy commercial street, the officials said. Kirkuk . A car bomb targeting a police recruitment center killed eight people and wounded 36 others, officials said. In another attack, two blasts -- from car and roadside bombs -- hit the intelligence headquarters, killing eight and wounding 50 others. A car bomb and a roadside bomb in the town of Tuz-Kurmato targeted Iraqi security forces, killing three people and wounding 11 others, officials said. Tikrit . Gunmen targeted an army checkpoint that leads to a military base, killing four Iraqi soldiers, the Interior Ministry said. Afterward, the gunmen planted homemade bombs at the checkpoint. When more Iraqi soldiers arrived at the scene to investigate, several of the devices detonated, killing seven soldiers and wounding seven more, Interior Ministry officials said. Western Basra . A car bomb exploded at an outdoor market, killing three people, the Interior Ministry said. The blast, which took place near an army checkpoint, also wounded 25 people. Taji . Car bombs exploded in three separate locations, killing one and wounding seven. Nasiriya . Two bombs exploded on a busy commercial street, killing six people and wounding 10 others, the Interior Ministry said. The bombings took place near the French Consulate, security officials said, adding that they did not know whether the consulate was targeted. Falluja . Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi soldier at a checkpoint in central Falluja, officials said. Abu Ghraib . Gunmen attacked an Iraqi army checkpoint and killed three soldiers, officials said. Recent attacks . Last week, gunmen killed at least five police officers in the city of Ramadi, police said. Iraq has battled political infighting among Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds, raising worries that the political conflict will return to the level of violence that nearly tore the country apart in 2006. While violence has decreased since the height of the U.S.-led war in 2005 and 2006, there has been a sharp escalation in attacks in recent months. In July, the number of dead hit a two-year peak with 325 deaths reported, according to the Interior Ministry. That's the deadliest single month since August 2010, it said. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. U.S. troops completed their withdrawal from Iraq in December.","U.S. Embassy condemns ""heinous,"" ""terrorist attacks"" targeting ""innocent"" people .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the most interesting kick of the World Cup so far comes from a young adult who is paralyzed from the waist down. Clad in a metal vest, sporting a blue cap dotted with electrodes, he kicked off the world's biggest soccer championship in an exoskeleton. It was, according to the scientist behind the exoskeleton's kick, ""meant to shock the world."" But even more shocking than the exoskeleton's first tentative steps is learning how it worked: controlled by the paralyzed patient's mind. Let's back up. Before there was a mind-controlled exoskeleton, there was a neuroscientist named Dr. Miguel Nicolelis who was curious about ""brain storms,"" flurries of activity caused by neurons at any given moment. ""We have about 100 million cells interconnected in our brains,"" said Nicolelis, a professor of neuroscience at Duke University. ""They communicate with one another through electrical signals."" Nicolelis wanted to know how brain storms generated behavior, so he began recording them. ""We wanted to understand how large populations of brain cells interact,"" how memories are built, how we move our bodies or how we sense the world around us, said Nicolelis. Scientists quickly realized that decoding the alphabet of neurons in the brain meant that its language could be transmitted to devices outside the brain. Thus began the creation of the mind-controlled exoskeleton, or what Nicolelis and his colleagues call a ""brain-machine interface,"" a way of connecting brain tissue to artificial devices. ""We realized that there was a tremendous potential application for rehabilitation in severely paralyzed patients,"" Nicolelis said. Paper-thin electrodes (that can both record and transmit neuronal information to the exoskeleton) are the conduit between the patient's brain and the exoskeleton. In the case of human patients, most of the electrodes reside in a cap that he or she wears. The patient thinks about moving, the generated activity is translated, and that activates the exoskeleton. ""We are able to show that you can read the signals and send them to devices,"" said Nicolelis, adding that the devices, in turn, move according to the voluntary intention of the patient. That is the simple explanation. What is more complicated is how brain signals, muscle movement and spinal cord activity all coalesced into that dazzling opening kick. Nicolelis is hoping to build on what he and his team have already accomplished to create a full-body exoskeleton. That will involve recording tens of thousands of neurons simultaneously, he said. ""(One day) we'll be walking in New York and we'll see a person walking on the streets that could not walk before,"" he said. ""I think in our lifetime we'll see that.""","Paralyzed patient kicks off the 2014 World Cup in an exoskeleton .

"It's not just the United States grappling with the issue of same-sex marriage. Many countries around the world are re-examining their laws, and some appear to be on the brink of changing them. Senators in Uruguay approved a marriage equality bill Tuesday that puts them on course to be the 12th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. And this week, senators in France will begin weighing a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage and allow same-sex couples to adopt children. The bill, which has the support of President Francois Hollande, has cleared the lower house of Parliament. It ""would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights,"" said the French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT. ""The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity."" But like the United States, France is far from united on the issue. In January, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Paris to protest same-sex marriage. Most of France is Catholic, and the Roman Catholic Church strongly opposes the bill, along with social conservatives and other religious groups. ""I do not personally agree with gay marriage, as I am a Christian and believe what the Bible says about marriage being between one woman and one man for a lifetime,"" said CNN iReporter Oluwasegun Olowu-Davies, who shot video of the Paris march on his phone. ""If your lifestyle doesn't allow you to conceive, there is a reason."" Across the English Channel, the United Kingdom is also considering legalization. In February, lawmakers in the House of Commons approved the second reading of a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in England and Wales. (Scotland has its own legalization bill in the works, while Northern Ireland rejected a similar measure in October.) More debate and more votes are still necessary before the bill can become law, but the wide margin of February's vote -- 400-175 -- suggests that it may have the support it needs to eventually pass. Prime Minister David Cameron is also in favor of the bill, despite opposition within his own party. ""I am a great supporter of marriage,"" Cameron said in the House of Commons. ""I want to promote marriage, defend marriage, encourage marriage. ""The great thing about (February's) vote is that two gay people who love each other will now be able to get married, and I think that is an important advance. I think we should be promoting marriage rather than looking at any other way of weakening it."" A former British colony, New Zealand, could legalize same-sex marriage this month. After a marriage equality bill passed two readings in Parliament -- the latest in March by a 77-44 margin -- the third and final vote is widely expected to be a formality. The public, however, might be more split than its lawmakers. According to a survey conducted last month by the country's largest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, opposition to same-sex marriage has increased to 48%.  That sentiment is more in line with nearby Australia, where lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against a legalization bill in September. In Uruguay, the bill approved Tuesday by a 23-8 margin now goes back to lawmakers in the lower house of parliament. That house approved a different version of the bill in December. In 2009, Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children. It was also one of the first Latin American countries to allow civil unions. Same-sex marriage is backed by President Jose Mujica and, according to one poll, the majority of the public. But Argentina is the only country in Latin America that has legalized same-sex marriage, doing so in 2010. Brazil and Mexico, like the United States, have same-sex marriages only in certain states. Of the 11 countries where same-sex marriage is legal, eight are in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal and Denmark. Argentina, Canada and South Africa are the three non-European countries in the group. There are no Asian countries where same-sex marriage is legal, but perhaps that might soon change. Last year, a same-sex Buddhist couple married in Taiwan, where a legalization bill has been pending since 2003. Taipei is also home to Asia's largest annual gay pride parade, according to organizers. The Supreme Court of Nepal ruled in favor of legalization in 2008, but those rights haven't been put into effect because the country's new constitution has been stuck in limbo for years. In July, the Justice Ministry in Vietnam said it would consider a provision for same-sex marriage rights in an amendment to the country's marriage laws. ""It's time for us to look at the reality,"" Minister Ha Hung Cuong said in an online debate at the time. ""The number of homosexuals has mounted to hundreds of thousands. It's not a small figure. ... They may own property. We, of course, have to handle these issues legally.""","The Netherlands was first country to legalize same-sex marriage in 2001 .
Several countries have pending legislation and may join that group soon .

"There has always been a fine line between freedom of speech and the right to practice one's religion in the way one sees fit.  The Founding Fathers struggled over these rights in framing the First Amendment, with Thomas Jefferson calling for ""a wall of separation"" between church and state -- a wall that has become mighty thin in recent years. But now, the freedom to practice religion on campuses around the country, including at Bowdoin -- an elite liberal arts college in Maine -- has crashed into anti-discrimination policies, which also have a long and complicated history in this country. The gist of the story is this:  The Bowdoin Christian Fellowship, a conservative religious group that has lived quietly on campus for four decades, is being kicked off the official roster of college-backed groups.  Their keys to college buildings have already been confiscated, and the administration won't recognize them any longer.  The problem is that this group, like many groups of its ilk, insist their leaders must adhere to its version of Christian doctrine. This problem is widespread now, playing out across the country, as at Cal State and Vanderbilt, where Christian groups, including, earlier, a Roman Catholic organization at Vanderbilt, have been forced off-campus because they refuse to allow their leadership to be drawn from people who don't adhere to their essential tenets.  Let me put this plainly: Houston, we have a problem! I've been a college professor for nearly four decades, and I've seen problems with the so-called thought police come and go over the years.  At the height of the problem in the mid-'80 and '90s, it was imagined by many -- especially those on the right -- that universities had become politically correct to the point where any kind of conservative thought was forbidden. Certainly these were vital years for the advancement of feminist thought in particular, and for the acceptance of gays as full citizens within the academy (full acceptance by the society at large is only now taking hold).  For the most part, I always thought the idea of a liberal thought police was nonsense. I'm a progressive Christian, and I don't support any kind of discrimination. Jesus himself certainly demonstrated that one should seek to bring those at the margins of society into the fold. I'm quite appalled by what is going on at Bowdoin, Cal State, Vanderbilt and elsewhere. Doesn't common sense suggest that you should not be the leader of a Christian organization if you don't adhere to Christian tenets?  Would a university or college really tell the Islamic Society on campus that they can't elect only Muslims to leadership positions?  My gut tells me that it's only sensible to allow religion organizations to elect leaders who adhere to the teachings of the religion that serves as the organizing principle for that group. There is, indeed, a bias against conservative Christians on campuses.  And there are some reasons for this, as certain strains of conservative religious practice have been fiercely discriminatory over the past couple of centuries in the United States.  There has also been an unfortunate anti-intellectual strain in the more fundamentalist groups of Christians, one that pervades American society as a whole, and creates problems for the practice of science, for instance, when it comes to subjects such as evolution and climate change. It's no wonder that academic communities tend to resist groups that abhor rational thought. But there is no basic conflict between -- again, for instance -- science and religion, between having a profound spiritual practice and wishing to uphold the highest standards within the academy when it comes to nondiscrimination.  Tolerance, in fact, may well be one of the benefits that comes from having both an intellectual and a spiritual life.  This means allowing for certain differences of opinion, letting a thousand flowers bloom. For the most part, conservative groups on campuses simply wish to study the Bible together, pray and worship in ways that deepen their own sense of Godliness.  These groups welcome nonbelievers. They might even let someone like myself -- a Christian of a different stripe -- sit down and discuss their views.  A campus is, or ought to be, a space where contradictory ideas are allowed to flourish, where genuine and deeply respectful debate can occur. I would urge colleges and universities to give these kids their keys back.  Let them elect officers in their organization who actually adhere to the ideas promoted by the group.  That's the essence of democracy. As long as these groups don't practice hatred or discrimination, or try to impose their views on others, let them be. Our intellectual communities flourish when there are all kinds of ideas circulating, even ones we find curious or objectionable.","Jay Parini: Campuses are placing problematic restrictions on evangelical groups .

"(CNN) -- You couldn't really call him a ""Bond villain"" in the grander context of Dr. No, Auric Goldfinger, Hugo Drax or that annoyingly resilient cat-fancier Ernst Stavros Blofeld. Those guys were schemers, planners, twisted visionaries of mass apocalypse whose Big Ideas were to be played out at humanity's expense. They thought they were so much smarter than the rest of us that it made it easier to invest our collective hope that James Bond would ultimately ruin their parties. But Jaws? We could never get as worked up about him any more than you get upset about a lower-level employee called upon do to a dirty job, even if the employee is over 7 feet tall and has the chromium grill of a compact car for teeth. In the fantasy universe of henchmen and human tool-kits, Jaws was the uberstooge, an angel of death who couldn't soar far or fast enough to deliver the coup de grace to 007. It's not that we (necessarily) rooted for Jaws any more than we really wanted Wile E. Coyote to catch the Road Runner. Wait, maybe we did. Jaws often resembled that poor scrawny desert wretch whenever he fell (literally) short of his quarry. In any case, we had so much fun watching him chase Roger Moore's plummy-voiced version of Bond in 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" that we cheered upon first seeing him return in 1979's ""Moonraker."" Imagine how Goldfinger's henchman Oddjob would have been received if his hat hadn't gotten caught in that electrified grill. Monstrous as Jaws was, there was something deep inside that made us feel a little sorry for him when having all that muscle and menace and grillwork did him little good. (I mean, c'mon, man, you can take down a real shark by yourself, but can't do away with a smarty-pants secret agent smaller than you?) The man who played the role, Richard Kiel, died Wednesday in Los Angeles at 74. And it's no surprise to learn, from an interview he did in 2009, that he insisted on making him less a walking prop and more like a person with such ""human characteristics"" as ""frustration"" and ""perseverance."" There was more of the latter than the former in Kiel's post-Bond career. He embraced his Jaws-inspired notoriety with abiding grace and generosity. He continued to act, became a born-again Christian after a bout with alcoholism and even co-wrote a biography of the Kentucky abolitionist Cassius Clay for whom the Louisville-born Muhammad Ali was originally named. With Kiel's passing, you suddenly realize how inimitable Jaws was. Is there anybody like him in movies now? Beyond, maybe, the pro wrestling circuit, is there anybody like him anywhere?","Gene Seymour: Jaws wasn't standard, scheming Bond villain. He was no Dr. No or Hugo Drax .

"Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Paris on Sunday decrying the French president's plan to legalize same-sex marriage and adoptions. They converged near the Eiffel Tower, chanting and waving flags, posters and balloons. ""I do not personally agree with gay marriage as I am a Christian and believe what the Bible says about marriage being between one woman and one man for a life time,"" said CNN iReporter Oluwasegun Olowu-Davies, who shot video of the march with his phone. ""If your lifestyle doesn't allow you to conceive, there is a reason,"" he said. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. After his win, the Cabinet approved a draft bill that is expected to go before the National Assembly and Senate soon. It is likely to be voted on in February or March. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. The plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Same-sex marriage around the world . Opening up marriage to same-sex couples ""would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone,"" he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a ""deceit"" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups in France, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and more than 100 lawmakers are against the legislation, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Hundreds of mayors around the country have also voiced their opposition, which has won wide backing from gay rights advocates. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT said the law, if passed, ""would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights."" Lawmakers have a ""unique opportunity"" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. ""The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity,"" it said. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government.

"(CNN) -- The license plates on our police escorts' Land Cruisers read ""Borno State, Home of Peace."" Many of those we meet during our stay in Maiduguri, northeast Nigeria, smile bitterly at the irony of that statement. The state's capital is now better known as the birthplace of Boko Haram and peace here is always uncertain. Down the dusty streets we drive, passing checkpoint after checkpoint manned not by soldiers but civilians, mostly armed with little more than machetes and swords. These vigilante groups, driven by a determination and motivation that the Nigerian security forces largely lack, have managed to establish some semblance of security in Maiduguri. Their pursuit of Boko Haram has become relentless -- hardened as they are by losses to the terror group over the years -- and they show no mercy, not even to family. WATCH: Hunt for Boko Haram focuses on Lake Chad . ""I caught him with my hand and handed him over to the authority,"" one of the sector's leaders, Abba Ajikalli, tells us unapologetically. He is speaking about his 16-year-old nephew, who he says was with Boko Haram. ""He has been executed,"" Ajikalli informs us, without a hint of remorse on his face. ""He was like my son, I have no regret."" What started as a home-grown movement for Sharia law in northern Nigeria is now a full-scale insurgency. Boko Haram attacks have terrorized this part of the country for years, but their kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls in Chibok in April has brought them an unprecedented level of international infamy. Since then the insurgents, seemingly galvanized by the attention, have stepped up the frequency and brazenness of its attacks on villages in the region. A presidential fact-finding mission is in Maiduguri at the same time as our trip. Each morning we receive word that they will travel to Chibok; each morning the residents and parents of the girls stolen from Chibok wait; and each afternoon everyone is disappointed by another postponement. One woman, who is part of the mission and asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation, told us that she would be quitting . ""[The parents] need to know that the nation is with them, that people are with them,"" she said emotionally. ""But there are people that wouldn't let us even call them. They keep saying it's security and that's why we can't go, but some of us are willing to risk it."" More than six weeks after the kidnapping, the Nigerian government and its forces have done little to ease the agony of the girls' parents and those who have rallied behind the cause. Last week, officials banned all protests in support of the ""Bring Back Our Girls"" campaign, calling them ""lawless,"" before reversing tack in the face of a public outcry. Traveling outside of Maiduguri is a risk, and our time on the ground is limited by security concerns. Just twenty minutes outside the city limits we find entire villages empty after recent attacks. Maiduguri may be Boko Haram's birthplace, but its terror is spreading. Refugees have been flowing into neighboring countries, where borders exist in name only, and each person has a harrowing tale of escape, a heartbreaking story of loss from which few will recover. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimates that as many as 1,000 refugees a week are crossing the border into Niger's Diffa region. Four out of five are women and girls. The IRC estimates that if the violence continues in northern Nigeria, up to 100,000 refugees could be living in Diffa by the end of the year. Orphaned by Boko Haram . All that 14-year-old Bintou and her little sister Ma'ou, 12, have of their former life in Nigeria are tattered photos of their parents. Bintou curls up and buries her face, her shoulders shuddering with each silent sob. Ma'ou seems to have utterly internalized her pain, and speaks in a numb monotone. They tell us they want to go back to Maiduguri, but for now they can't. They are orphans -- their mother died of natural causes before they can remember, and their father was killed in a Boko Haram attack about five months ago. We find them living with their aunt on a small plot in Diffa, Niger, uncertain about a future they are now forced to navigate alone. ""She [Bintou] can't understand how this could have happened,"" the IRC's Mohammed Watakane, explains. ""She is a victim going through a psychological trauma, she needs protection."" There are no refugee camps in Diffa, and Nigerians fleeing across the border have been absorbed into the local populations. The World Food Program is helping to ease the burden on host families by providing aid to the refugees, but it only has a quarter of the money it needs for its Niger programs, according to the country's WFP director. On the outskirts of town, the village of Guessere's population has doubled. Its new residents all come from a Nigerian village located 3 kilometers from the border. Many fled a Boko Haram attack in the middle of the night and spent the night hiding in the bush before crossing the river into Niger. Haidjia Fandaou tells us how she came across her brother's lifeless body in the middle of her escape. He had been dragged out of a mosque, executed with his prayer beads still in his hand. ""The only thing I could think in that moment was 'survive,'"" Fandaou often tells us. Her walk to Niger took just thirty minutes. Here, the border is more an idea than a reality. A shallow river along the edge of Guessere marks the line between relative safety and terror. But fear continues to haunt people who cross it. Few dare to even utter the words ""Boko Haram,"" as if merely calling the group by name will bring the same violence and terror across the border as well. Local government officials in Niger refuse to speak about security, and brusquely warn us not to ask about it and to stick to our pre-planned program. U.S. and Nigerian security sources tell us Boko Haram tends to use Niger as more of a logistics hub or to escape military operations in Nigeria. There have been concerns that fighters are hiding themselves among the refugees, and recruiting among Niger's disgruntled unemployed youth -- a concern shared by Nigeria's other neighbors as Boko Haram morphs into a transnational terrorist organization. The journey to Lake Chad . We leave Diffa in the morning, along tracks barely visible in the sand. We travel in a convoy through the remote, unforgiving landscape. Pickup trucks stacked high with cargo pass us in the opposite direction, laboring over the dunes. Our driver tells us they're carrying dried fish from Lake Chad. Sources tell us the lake is an area of interest in the search for the missing Nigerian schoolgirls. Bordered by Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad, islands now cover half of the once-massive lake as its waters continue to recede. It is an ideal hideout for Boko Haram. In March, along the area of the lake just south of where we are headed, Nigerian forces raided a Boko Haram camp, capturing weapons, ammunition and explosives. But for the most part, these are lawless waters. We leave the port of Kirikiri, but not before hearing more stories of another town dealing with the influx of refugees. It seems no one and no place here is lucky enough to escape the effects of Boko Haram's brutal campaign. We charter a fishing boat and head out on the water. We travel as far as we're told we can safely go, then land on one of the islands closest to Niger. All we can see is dense vegetation along the shoreline. Inland, we find a small fishing village. The village leader, Boulama Noma, tells us he and many others here lived on one of the islands closer to Nigeria. One day, Boko Haram arrived on what was essentially a shopping trip -- but before they left with all of the produce and food, Noma says they torched all of the homes and killed so many villagers that he says he lost count. This is just one of the many horrifying tales about Boko Haram that we hear during our time in Niger. It makes us think of all the stories we haven't heard from the countless victims of the last few years when the group has operated with impunity. Before we came to Lake Chad, we'd met two informants in Nigeria who live among Boko Haram members and know the terrorist organization's tactics better than most. We ask them what the group has planned for the kidnapped schoolgirls. ""They will use them to negotiate with the government about those of their members that have been detained by the government,"" one tells us. ""Or they will use them as human shields.""

"Social media messages are once again playing a role in an investigation of two teenagers in Steubenville, Ohio, according to authorities. This time, it's for allegedly threatening the 16-year-old rape victim of two star Steubenville High School football players, who were convicted over the weekend for the sexual abuse of the girl that was partially documented in texts, tweets and pictures posted to the Internet. The two girls, ages 15 and 16, were charged Tuesday with intimidation of a witness, a felony charge in the third degree, according to Fred Abdalla Jr., chief probation officer for Jefferson County Juvenile Court. Steubenville, weary of investigation, not done yet . They also were charged with a misdemeanor count of aggravated menacing and a misdemeanor count of telecommunication harassment, he said. A judge ordered the girls held in the county's juvenile lockup until March 27, when they will appear in court to answer the charges, Abdalla said. The arrests are the latest fallout in a rape case that has roiled the down-on-its-luck town along the Ohio River. ""People are allowed to be obnoxious, and they're allowed to say crazy things, and that's fine,"" Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine told CNN on Tuesday. ""But they can't under Ohio law threaten to kill someone, and we had to take action."" Healing process after rape never ends . In one of the tweets, the writer appears to threaten to kill the girl at the center of the rape case. Another warns that she will be beaten. The messages were among a swarm of tweets posted Sunday, shortly after the verdicts for two teenage boys found guilty of raping the girl by putting their fingers in her vagina while she was too intoxicated to consent during a series of end-of-summer parties in August. That case prominently featured photographs, videos and text messages documenting portions of the abuse. Victim in Steubenville rape case says she woke up naked . In addition to the threatening tweets, other Twitter users posted messages harshly criticizing the rape victim's character, according to screen shots captured by a website dedicated to fighting online bullying. The accounts from which the tweets reportedly originated were either deleted or password-protected Tuesday afternoon. The girl accused of tweeting the death threat turned herself in after learning that investigators were looking for her, Sheriff Fred Abdalla said. The other girl reportedly apologized on Twitter before her mother deleted her account, according to the anti-bullying website. The site said the girl's mother also apologized in a posting, saying her daughter is ""in tears and is more sorry than I have ever seen her."" The sheriff called the arrests a warning to anyone else considering threats against the victim. ""And I can assure you we've been monitoring Twitter for 24 hours and continue to,"" he said. ""If there's anybody else there crosses a line and makes a death threat, they're going to have to face the consequences."" Steubenville rape trial focuses on text messages, cell phone pictures . DeWine, whose prosecutors handled the rape case against the football players, also warned that any further threats won't be tolerated. ""People who want to continue to victimize this victim, to threaten her, we're going to deal with them and we're going after them,"" DeWine told CNN on Tuesday. ""We don't care if they're juveniles or whether they're adults. Enough is enough."" Steubenville has been in a harsh spotlight since the rape accusations became national news in December. A crime blogger and former Steubenville resident, Alexandria Goddard, uncovered some of the social media documentation of the abuse and wrote pointedly about the possibility that the boys had been given preferential treatment because they played on the town's highly regarded high school football team. Police have denied that claim. National media picked up on the case, followed by the loosely organized hacker group Anonymous, which found and posted a lengthy video in which another teenager -- who has not been charged -- made joking references to the rape. The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight. On Monday, the victim's mother told CNN that the verdicts are ""the start of a new beginning for my daughter."" But she added, ""We need to stress the importance of helping those in need and to stand up for what is right."" ""We hope that from this something good can arise,"" she said. ""I feel I have an opportunity to bring an awareness to others, possibly change the mentality of a youth or help a parent to have more of an awareness to where their children are and what they are doing. The adults need to take responsibility and guide these children."" While the verdicts seemed briefly to indicate the case was winding down, DeWine announced a grand jury investigation to determine if anyone else should be charged with a crime as a result of incidents surrounding the abuse.

"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange declined to discuss government abuse of the press by the country that has been shielding him from arrest in a CNN interview that was more remarkable for what he didn't say than any revelations about his plight. In a sometimes combative interview Wednesday on ""OutFront with Erin Burnett,"" Assange described strategic surveillance by governments as a ""sea change in politics"" that puts freedoms at risk. When pushed about Ecuador's press freedom record, described by the Committee to Protect Journalists as one of the worst in Latin America, Assange said: ""Its people have been generous to me, but it's not a significant world player."" ""Whatever little things occurring in small countries are not of concern,"" he said. ""We must concentrate on what is happening in the entire civilization of the world."" Embassy life like 'a space station,' Assange says . Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in June to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks. He has repeatedly said the allegations are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website, which facilitates the publication of secret documents. WikiLeaks has published hundreds of thousands of pages of American government diplomatic cables and assessments of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He has not been charged in the United States, though Assange and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empanelled to consider charges against him. Army Pvt. Bradley Manning, 24, has been charged with leaking classified military and State Department documents while serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. Assange nor WikiLeaks have ever confirmed Manning was the source. Assange appeared on the CNN news show to promote a new book he co-authored: ""Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet,"" which examines the threat of the Internet. He wrote the book with Jacob Appelbaum, Jeremie Zimmermann and Andy Muller-Maguhn. The interview turned testy when he declined to discuss Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's press freedom record. Correa, according to CPJ, has shuttered 11 local radio stations and had a record of filing lawsuits in civil and criminal courts as a means of intimidation. ""It's not the topic of what we are doing here,"" Assange said, adding that he agreed to appear on the show to discuss ""the surveillance state."" During the interview, Burnett asked Assange whether he felt any guilt about the plight of Manning or concern he might broker a plea deal that could implicate him. How notoriety has changed a trapped man . Assange deflected the questions and focused on the effort of Manning's attorney to get the case dismissed over alleged abuse the private suffered to implicate him and WikiLeaks. ""As far as we know, there has been no such confession."" Assange also declined to answer questions about his health following comments from Ecuador's ambassador to the UK that the WikiLeaks founder is suffering a chronic lung infection. ""I don't think it's important,"" Assange said. Assange has been effectively confined for the past five months to the Ecuadorian Embassy, which granted him asylum in August. The move sparked a diplomatic row with the UK, which has said it will arrest Assange if he leaves the embassy. The UK says it has a legal obligation to hand Assange over to Sweden, after his legal effort to avoid extradition were rejected by British courts.","Ecuador granted Julian Assange asylum in August .

"At 33 years old, Jamie is trying to get clean. The native Bostonian started at a young age: drinking, then smoking pot, then taking pain pills and eventually heroin. ""I never thought in my wildest dreams I would stick a needle in my arm,"" said Jamie, who didn't want his last name revealed. ""Not in a million years."" But the low cost, the readily availability and the prescription pill-like high makes heroin a draw that's hard to resist. ""It's a monkey on your back that you can't shake,"" he says. If autopsy results bear out what officials suspect, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman will be the latest in a growing list of substance abusers who paid a deadly price for using heroin. In July, heroin (mixed with alcohol) took the life of ""Glee"" star Cory Monteith. In August, Emylee Lonczak, a 16-year-old Virginia high school student who'd never injected heroin before, died when a friend shot it into a vein for her. And last week, Maryland officials said that heroin tainted with fentanyl had claimed at least 37 lives since September. Another 22 cases were reported in Pittsburgh and other towns in western Pennsylvania. To be sure, heroin has been a scourge for a long, long time. But lately, it's showing an uptick that has authorities, health officials and parents disturbed. ""Heroin is pummeling the Northeast, leaving addiction, overdoses and fear in its wake,"" said James Hunt of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York Office. A 2012 survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (PDF) found that about 669,000 people over age 12 had used heroin at some point in the year.  About 156,000 of those were first-time users, and roughly 467,000 were considered heroin-dependent -- more than double the number in 2002. ""I've been here over six years, and literally this is the first year that I can remember seeing this many people coming in here with an addiction to heroin,"" said Robert Parkinson, director of the Beachcomber Rehabilitation Center in Delray Beach, Florida. It's not at an epidemic level yet, he says, but ""it's going to be there. ... It's that bad."" Heroin remains comparatively rare, according to administration figures. By comparison, more than 31 million people used marijuana or hashish in 2012 alone, and another 4.7 million used some form of cocaine that year. But about 4.6 million people -- about 1.8% of the teenage and adult population -- reported using heroin at some point in their lives, the survey found. The average first-time user was 23. Here, we examine the reasons behind the rise in heroin use and its fatal draw: . It's cheap. Bill Patrianakos was hooked on OxyContin, a prescription pain reliever. He didn't just like it; he loved it. The problem was, he couldn't afford it. ""I was pawning things: stealing from my parents, my sister, everyone who cared about me,"" he said. ""Even that wasn't enough."" So he moved on to heroin. It gave him the same high, he said, but at a fraction of the cost. ""I started out snorting,"" he said. ""And, of course, to conserve my money, I moved on to shooting it."" The bottom line for users: Heroin is cheap. Part of the reason is the nationwide crackdown on prescription pill abuse, which has made those drugs harder and more expensive to obtain. In the first two weeks of 2014, police in Delray Beach, Florida, say, they seized more heroin than they did in the past 10 years combined. ""People were getting pills for $10 around here, and now it's much more expensive,"" said Delray Beach Police Sgt. Nicole Guerriero. ""People are now turning to heroin to get their high."" And how cheap is heroin? ""We've heard for as low as $6 a capsule,"" she said. It's everywhere. David is a self-described addict who doesn't want his last name revealed. His drug of choice is oxycodone. But he knows that when he can't get it, he can always score some heroin. ""It's literally five minutes down the road,"" he said. ""It's everywhere. Everywhere."" Pam Anderson of Atlanta lost her college-age son to a heroin overdose. ""In the college campuses what they are doing with it, is like they are just passing bowls of pills,"" she said. ""They give it out for free to get somebody hooked. And then they start with a lower price on the pills and jack it up, jack it up as they are more addicted."" Indeed, heroin availability rose in 2012, according to the DEA, most likely because of an uptick in Mexican production and traffickers expanding into new markets. Authorities are doing what they can to put a dent in those activities, but they have a ways to go. Between 2008 and 2012, the amount of heroin seized each year at the southwest border more than tripled. But pushers are getting creative. Last month, police said they arrested a McDonald's employee in Pittsburgh for selling heroin in Happy Meal boxes. It's potent.  Heroin makes for a common substitute for prescription pills. But unlike pills, there's no way to regulate the dosage of heroin, given the undetermined purity. And that can be a fatal recipe. ""Unlike with prescription drugs, heroin purity and dosage amounts vary, and heroin is often cut with other substances, all of which could cause inexperienced abusers to accidentally overdose,"" the DEA says in its drug threat assessment report for 2013. Between 1999 and 2009, 32 states saw an increase in heroin-related patients, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. But rather than acting as a deterrent, the drug's undetermined potency actually serves as a draw for some users. Last month, at least 22 people in western Pennsylvania died after using heroin that had been mixed with fentanyl, a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients' pain. The drug cocktails were being sold under harmless sounding names, such as ""Theraflu"" and ""Bud ice."" Andrew, a 19-year-old Pennsylvanian who didn't want his last name revealed, overdosed on the drug mixture twice and almost died. But he kept going back. It took his friend's overdose death to scare him back into rehab. ""That's the sick thing about addiction,"" he said. ""When someone knows that there are heroin bags that are killing people or making them overdose, then we know that those are the good bags."" It's hard to kick. Last year, Hoffman told TMZ he strugged with substance abuse but kicked the habit for 23 years. But then he fell off the wagon. He started slowly with prescription pills and slipped into snorting cocaine. That experience is not uncommon. ""Someone with opiate addiction, they are doing pushups their whole lives,"" said HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky. ""And they must work on it all the time. And even working on it, there's a high probability of relapse. And God willing, they get adequate treatment, and they re-engage in treatment, and things go well."" ""But often,"" he added, ""it's a frequently fatal condition.""","""It's a monkey on your back,"" says a man trying to kick the habit .

"The Justice Department said it won't challenge state laws that legalize marijuana and will focus federal enforcement on serious trafficking cases and keeping the drug away from children. Attorney General Eric Holder, in a conference call Thursday morning, notified the governors of Colorado and Washington that the department, for now, will not seek to pre-empt those states' laws, which followed voters' approval of ballot measures that legalized recreational marijuana use. Marijuana will remain illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act. But a department memo to federal prosecutors tightened federal marijuana prosecution standards. Opinion: How to regulate pot when it's legal . Under the new guidelines, federal prosecutors are required to focus on eight enforcement priorities, including preventing marijuana distribution to minors, preventing drugged driving, stopping drug trafficking by gangs and cartels and forbidding the cultivation of marijuana on public lands. The guidelines, issued by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, have been months in the making and took on some urgency after citizens in Colorado and Washington approved the ballot measures last fall. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow some legal use of marijuana, primarily for medicinal purposes. The attorney general told the Washington and Colorado governors that the Justice Department will work with the states to craft regulations that fall in line with the federal priorities, and reserves the right to try to block the laws if federal authorities find repeated violations. Are American opinions on marijuana changing? The memo to prosecutors also seeks to address one common complaint from medicinal marijuana dispensaries in some states, which have been subject to raids by federal agents because they were deemed too big or profitable. The size and profitability of marijuana businesses will still be a factor prosecutors can consider, but there also must be additional illegal activities for prosecutors to take action. The new guidelines don't change federal money laundering rules, meaning that some large banks may still be leery of doing business with marijuana producers and sellers. However, Justice Department officials said there is some leeway for banks to provide services to such businesses, so long as they don't violate the eight priorities being assigned to federal prosecutors. ""We received good news this morning when Attorney General Eric Holder told the governor the federal government would not pre-empt Washington and Colorado as the states implement a highly regulated legalized market for marijuana,"" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. ""We want to thank the attorney general for working with the states on this and for finding a way that allows our initiative to move forward while maintaining a commitment to fighting illegal drugs. This reflects a balanced approach by the federal government that respects the states' interests in implementing these laws and recognizes the federal government's role in fighting illegal drugs and criminal activity,"" they said.","Washington state officials cheer the ""good news""

"(CNN) -- Shortly after we filed our case challenging the Defense of Marriage Act, my client Edie Windsor was asked what it felt like to be a plaintiff suing the federal government. Edie, who grew up in a middle-class household after the Great Depression, said it was one thing to be ""out"" as a lesbian but another thing entirely to be the ""out lesbian who happens to be suing the United States of America."" One year ago on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Edie's case by issuing a landmark decision that gay people have have the same right to dignity and respect under the law that straight people do. The so-called Defense of Marriage Act, also known as DOMA, was passed in 1996 and defined marriage as a union exclusively between a man and a woman. As a result, otherwise valid marriages of same-sex couples were rendered null and void under federal law and gay married couples were denied the full range of federal benefits that straight married couples received. When we filed Edie's case in 2010, only five states and Washington, D.C., permitted same-sex couples to marry. When the Supreme Court's decision came down last year, 12 states and D.C. did. Today, 19 states and D.C. -- representing almost 44% of the U.S. population -- do. If you had told me last June that the world would look the way it does today for gay people, I would have said you need to be more realistic. How did this happen? First and foremost, from the very beginning, our strategy was, to borrow a phrase from Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, ""It's all about Edie, stupid."" Unlike many previous LGBT civil rights cases, our case involved only one plaintiff. The trouble with cases involving multiple plaintiffs is that the plaintiffs' stories often got lost in the shuffle. After all, it's hard for a judge or jury to focus on several plaintiff couples at once. It is much easier to focus only on one. And unfortunately, when the plaintiffs' stories get lost in the background, a gay civil rights case can sound more like a debate between Fox News and MSNBC than a case about real people and their lives. Our view was that the best way to defeat DOMA was not to focus on lawyers or pundits, but instead to explain how DOMA harmed two real people, Edie Windsor, and her late spouse, Thea Spyer. So how did we do that? We decided to tell the story of Edie and Thea's lives as the great love story that it was. Our goal wasn't to write a Harlequin romance. Rather, what we hoped to do was to show that Edie and Thea, who spent 44 years together in sickness and health till death did them part, lived their lives with the same decency and dignity as anyone else. We demonstrated that Edie and Thea had what Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called a ""grand partnership,"" surely the kind of marriage any one of us -- straight or gay -- would be lucky to have. And the $363,000 federal estate tax bill that Edie received upon Thea's death solely because of DOMA didn't hurt either. If Edie had been married to a man -- if ""Thea"" had been ""Theo"" -- then her estate tax bill would have been zero. Any American, gay or straight, Democrat or Republican, can understand how unfair it is to have to pay a huge tax bill simply because you are gay. In our brief for the Supreme Court, we made three points to illustrate why the Supreme Court needed to be suspicious of Congress' motivation for passing DOMA. First, DOMA was enacted because of moral disapproval of gay people who at the time were largely feared and misunderstood; second, DOMA essentially wrote gay people out of much of federal law; and third, by instructing the federal government to ignore the marriages of only gay people by denying them benefits, DOMA upset the historic relationship between the federal government and the states. The federal government had always otherwise deferred to the states' definitions of marriage. Fortunately, these three themes are interwoven throughout the Supreme Court's opinion. On the moral disapproval point, Justice Anthony Kennedy explains that ""interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages was more than an incidental effect of [DOMA]. It was its essence."" As for DOMA's scope, the Supreme Court notes that ""DOMA writes inequality into the entire United States code"" and describes DOMA as ""touching many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound."" And on our third point, the Supreme Court points out DOMA's ""unusual deviation"" from the federal government's practice of recognizing otherwise lawful marriages. As the court concludes, DOMA was invalid because ""no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity."" In other words, ""by treating [gay people] as living in marriages less respected than others, [DOMA] is in violation of the Fifth Amendment."" The Supreme Court uses the word ""dignity"" 10 times in its 26-page opinion in United States v Windsor. Sometimes, it's the simplest and most obvious things that say the most. Dignity, the state of being worthy of honor or respect, is exactly what the Windsor case was all about. Now that the Supreme Court has recognized that gay people and their relationships are equally worthy of respect under the Constitution, the legal equivalent of the Battle of Normandy in the struggle for gay rights has been won. And you don't have to take my word for it. Twenty-five decisions throughout the country in states as far apart in geography and culture as Ohio and Utah, New Jersey and Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Arkansas, have relied on Windsor to extend rights to gay people. As of today, there's not a single case that has gone the other way. It seems as though nearly every week, another court in another state expands the rights of gay people using the logic and language of the Windsor decision. Although I have the greatest regard for the superhuman bravery and brilliance of the playwright and activist Larry Kramer, I have to respectfully disagree with his recent statement that ""considering how many of us there are ... we have achieved very little."" The truth is that no other minority group in American history has seen more progress toward equality more rapidly than gay people have. I completely agree with Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch when he recently conceded that ""anybody who does not believe that gay marriage is going to be the law of the land ... isn't living in the real world."" But why is this so? What has changed? The answer isn't complicated. It's because of the incredible courage of people such as Larry Kramer and Edie Windsor who came ""out"" and told the rest of the world ""I'm here and I'm gay"" that full equality for gay people under the law is about to become a reality.","A year ago Thursday, a Supreme Court ruling dismantled Defense of Marriage Act .

"After months of questions and pressure from whistle-blowers, academic reform groups, the public and members of Congress, the NCAA has decided to reopen its investigation into The University of North Carolina over its so-called paper class scandal. UNC has been under scrutiny since 2011, when it was revealed that it had hundreds of classes in the Afro-American studies program that required no attendance and just a single paper. The issue received national attention after CNN highlighted literacy problems at UNC. In one CNN report, whistle-blower Mary Willingham said the so-called ""paper classes"" were well known by the athletic support staff as easy classes for athletes who needed to stay eligible, and that the papers were often plagiarized. Willingham's job was to help athletes who weren't quite ready academically for the work required at UNC at Chapel Hill, one of the country's top public universities. She said she learned about the fake classes through her work. Even though many athletes were enrolled in those paper classes, the NCAA had previously decided the scandal was not an athletic one, and did not sanction the university. That left a lot of unanswered questions and prompted Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California, to write a letter to NCAA President Mark Emmert demanding answers. Willingham said she was not interviewed by the NCAA during its first investigation. On Monday, she said the NCAA had lost credibility by not investigating the issue. Now, she said, the NCAA shouldn't focus on punishment: ""Instead, they should focus on how to use the UNC example to reform the entire system."" Several athletes have also said publicly that they were forced to major in Afro-American studies by athletic staff. For years, and after several internal investigations, UNC said a single professor, Julius Nyang'oro, knew about the fake classes. Until now, the NCAA stood behind the university on that claim. Then, earlier this year, after a flurry of national reporting, UNC commissioned yet another investigation, this time by former Homeland Security Secretary Ken Wainstein. Wainstein has received 1.5 million e-mails and documents, interviewed more than 30 employees, and acquired athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s in his investigation. While he is not giving updates, he did tell the UNC board at a meeting recently that his team has gotten ""extremely valuable"" information from people who have reached out to help the investigation. Among those cooperating, he said, is Nyang'oro. Nyang'oro was indicted on a fraud charge in December, but Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall said recently that he is considering dropping the charge because Nyang'oro has been so cooperative. ""Even though it's a noncriminal investigation, that is more important than this,"" Woodall said, referring to Wainstein's review. ""The money is paid back already,"" Woodall said. ""This was more of an academic scandal than any kind of criminal issue. ... In the criminal probe what we're left with is one low-level nonviolent felony for a person never in trouble before in his life."" UNC said it directed Wainstein to share what he finds with the NCAA, and both UNC and the NCAA said that it was the cooperation from ""additional people"" that prompted the NCAA investigation to be re-opened. Cardenas' office has received a response from the NCAA. A spokesman for his office said it is still going through the response.","UNC is accused of putting athletes in easy Afro-American studies classes .
The classes required no attendance, had one paper assigned .
NCAA originally did not classify the issue as an athletic one ."
"The wife of imprisoned U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross traveled to Cuba Tuesday as part of her ongoing effort to free her husband. Judy Gross did not talk to a CNN reporter outside Havana's Jose Marti International Airport, and she and Gross' attorney quickly boarded a bus provided by the Cuban government. Last week, Gross' mother died after a long fight with cancer, Gross' attorney, Scott Gilbert, said. The Cuban government refused Gross' request to travel to the United States to say goodbye to Evelyn Gross before she died. Gross had promised that after seeing his mother he would return to his prison cell at a military hospital in Havana. ""We would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to his relatives,"" Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Josefina Vidal said in a statement. ""It is necessary to clarify that neither the Cuban penitentiary system nor the U.S. penitentiary system provide the possibility for inmates to travel abroad, no matter the reason. "" Gross, 65, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to Cuba as part of his work as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in March 2011. U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access and have said his imprisonment is one of the major obstacles to improved relations with Cuba. In April, Gross embarked on a hunger strike to protest his continued imprisonment. He later said he was suspending his hunger strike after his mother pleaded with him to begin eating again. Since his arrest, Gross has suffered a slew of health problems, his attorney said, and lost more than 100 pounds. ""Alan is confined to one room, 23 hours a day."" Gilbert said during an interview with CNN in April. ""He spends his day there in pajamas, he's fed meals in his room. He's let out for an hour a day, to exercise an hour a day in a small, walled courtyard where you can barely see the sky."" Cuban officials have said they want to negotiate Gross' case with representatives of the United States in conjunction with the fates of three Cuban intelligence operatives serving lengthy sentences in U.S. prisons. But U.S. officials have called that effort blackmail and said the cases are separate matters because Gross was not working as a spy in Cuba. The diplomatic impasse is taking its toll on Gross, Gilbert said. ""The White House has yet to engage on this issue; we need the president to make this a priority. Without that, Alan will die in Cuba,"" Gilbert said.","Alan Gross' wife, Judy, visits husband in Cuba a week after his mother's death .

"Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain announced Wednesday the withdrawal of their ambassadors from Qatar because Doha had not implemented an agreement among Gulf Arab countries not to interfere in each others' internal affairs. The three countries, which are all part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) along with Qatar, announced the unprecedented move in a joint statement. They said GCC members had signed a deal November 23 that included ""a security agreement and a commitment to the principles that ensure non-interference in the internal affairs of any of the GCC countries, either directly or indirectly, and not to support any activity that would threaten the security and stability of any of the GCC countries from organizations or individuals, including support for hostile media."" GCC foreign ministers met in Riyadh Tuesday to try to persuade Qatar to implement the agreement, the statement said. ""Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain hoped that the agreement will be implemented, however, after more than three months after the signing of the agreement, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain feel that the State of Qatar did not take the necessary actions to put it into practice,"" a statement on the Saudi Foreign Ministry Facebook page said. ""Therefore Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain regret to announce that they will take what they deem to be the appropriate steps to protect the security and stability of their nations by withdrawing their ambassadors from Qatar."" Tensions . Qatar expressed ""regret and surprise"" at the decision and said it would not reciprocate with the same move, a cabinet statement published on the state Qatar News Agency said. It said it would remain committed to ""preserving and protecting the security and stability"" of the GCC countries. Tensions between Qatar and the rest of the GCC have increased in recent years. Wednesday's announcement is the clearest sign yet of a rift between Gulf Arab nations and Qatar, a perceived supporter of Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East -- which are viewed with suspicion or outright hostility by some fellow GCC members. Qatar denounced last year's ouster of Egypt's Islamist President Mohamed Morsy, who hails from the Brotherhood. The GCC, formed in 1981, consists of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.","Qatar expresses ""regret and surprise"" at the decision .

"Most people expect to fight frigid temperatures and fierce winds as they climb Mount Everest. But a group of three climbers say they faced unexpected adversaries over the weekend while scaling the storied peak: Sherpa guides. Nepalese authorities say they're investigating reports that a fight broke out on Saturday between the guides and the climbers, nearly 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) up the world's tallest mountain. ""If the Sherpas hit the foreign climbers, action will definitely be taken against them,"" said Dipendra Poudel, a mountaineering official in Kathmandu. The fight started after three professional climbers from Italy, the United Kingdom and Switzerland told the Sherpas they wanted to climb on their own, according to Nima Nuru Sherpa of Cho-Oyu Trekking, the agency that is managing their climb. ""Our clients said the Sherpas manhandled them,"" he said. A statement posted Sunday on the website of Italian climber Simone Moro gave a harrowing account, claiming that 100 Sherpas attacked him, Swiss climber Ueli Steck and British climber Jonathan Griffith. This account said the fight broke out after Sherpas said the climbers knocked ice onto a Sherpa located below them. ""They became instantly aggressive,"" the statement said, ""and not only punched and kicked the climbers, but threw many rocks as well."" After nearly an hour, the situation calmed down, the statement said. ""The climbers, who had been pushed away and told to hide, had regrouped and were told that if they weren't gone in one hour that they would all be killed,"" the statement said. ""The climbers packed the bare essentials and made a circuitous route back down to the base of Mount Everest in heavily crevassed terrain with no rope on, feeling that given the current situation this was the safest place to be."" Nepalese authorities said their investigation into the report was ongoing. ""The Sherpas got angry when hit by the ice and there was a fight,"" said Dambar Parajuli of the Expedition Operators' Association, a group representing expedition organizers. In addition, he said, the climbers had been instructed not to go up while Sherpas were laying ropes, but they went ahead despite the warning. On Monday, he said, both sides had a meeting, reconciled and agreed to go ahead with the climb. In their statement on Sunday, the climbers said no Sherpa had come forward with any evidence of injury. ""The climbers believe that the lead Sherpa was tired and cold and felt that his pride had been damaged as the three climbers were moving unroped and much faster to the side of him,"" the statement said. ""Whatever the reason may be, there is no reason to instigate vigilante rule and to try and kill three visiting climbers."" About 4,000 people have scaled Everest since Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first climbed the mountain in 1953. According to mountaineering officials, 340 foreign climbers from about 30 expeditions have been given permission to climb Everest this year with about the same number of high-altitude Sherpas set to assist them. The majority of climbers are on commercial expeditions and are aided by Sherpas to reach the summit. Sherpas from different expeditions put down ropes to the summit and later, other climbers hold on to them to scale the mountain. Turning Everest waste into art . Among climbing enthusiasts on social media, word spread quickly of the fight in one of the world's most hard-to-reach, but well known, locales. In a Facebook post, Climb Magazine described what it called a ""shocking scene"" on the mountain, sparking debate among readers over whether the Sherpas or the climbers were responsible. One post on Adventure Journal's website described the incident as ""an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on Mt. Everest."" In another post, a guide said mistakes were likely made on both sides, but that those responsible for the violence should be prosecuted. ""Everest is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts. This is true for professional and recreational climbers, and for Sherpa who earn most or all of their family's annual income in these two months on the mountain,"" guide Adrian Ballinger wrote. ""The constant pressure to break records, attempt new routes, and be the strongest, whether for personal pride, sponsors, future job offers, or media, can cloud the purity of our climbing here. And these pressures can lead to disagreements, arguments, and hurt feelings. But none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence, or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other,"" Ballinger added.

"The German government said Thursday it is expelling a person it describes as the representative of U.S. foreign intelligence services based at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. The move comes after two allegations emerged of Germans spying for the United States over the last week, claims prompting an investigation by German prosecutors of a suspect accused of passing secrets. The call comes against the background of the current investigation by the federal prosecutor and questions that have remained unresolved for months about the activity of U.S. intelligence in Germany. ""The German government views these events as very serious,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. In a statement, Seibert stressed the importance of ""mutual trust and openness."" ""It remains essential for Germany, in the interest of the security of its citizens and its armed forces abroad, to cooperate closely on the basis of trust with its western partners, in particular with the USA."" Seibert said the government ""is ready to offer that, and expects its closest partners to do the same."" German prosecutors said Wednesday they are investigating a suspect accused of passing secrets. ""Officers of the federal criminal office have since this morning searched the living and office rooms of an accused in the Berlin area because of initial suspicion of secret service agency activity. They said ""an arrest did not take place."" As a matter of policy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to comment on the reported intelligence activity. ""The reason for that is there's an important principle at stake, which is declining to comment on them publicly allows for the sufficient protection of our national interests, in some cases the intelligence assets, and more generally, American national security,"" he said. Only last week, German prosecutors ordered the arrest of a German citizen on suspicion of spying for foreign intelligence agencies. On Friday, the German foreign office called in the U.S. ambassador to discuss it. Both the German prosecutor and the foreign office released scarce information then, but officials have spoken in detail with German journalists, who published many reports on the allegations of U.S. spying on the country. ""If the reports are correct, it would be a serious case. If the allegations are true, it would be for me a clear contradiction to what I consider to be a trustful cooperation between agencies and partners,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Her warning came as U.S.-German relations are already shaky in the aftermath of disclosures by National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden that showed the United States was listening in on Merkel's phone calls. Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview Tuesday with the German news site Spiegel Online, said both countries need to talk about what intelligence collection should be allowed and what might thwart intelligence and security cooperation. ""Clearly, the surveillance on Chancellor Merkel's phone was absolutely wrong,"" she said. Germany and other friendly countries complained when Snowden's leaks last year revealed U.S. surveillance of foreign leaders as well as screening of foreign phone calls and Internet contacts in investigating terrorist ties. The Obama administration responded that all countries conduct surveillance on each other, but the President also has ordered changes in U.S. programs.

"Actor Robert Brown has reached a ""settlement in principle"" in his racial profiling lawsuits against Macy's and New York,  according to court documents and a statement from the retailer. Brown, who appeared on the HBO series ""Treme,"" made headlines last summer after he claimed that he was targeted because of his race while shopping at Macy's flagship store in Manhattan's Herald Square. Papers filed in federal court Wednesday said Brown reached a settlement with both Macy's and the city of New York, whose police department he accused of targeting him because of his race. The settlement terms were not disclosed. In a statement, Macy's Vice President of Media Relations Elina Kazan said the retailer had also settled various other lawsuits accusing the retailer of racial profiling. The statement did not identify the plaintiffs. ""The lawsuits by various plaintiffs who alleged racial profiling by Macy's have been settled in principle,"" the statement said. ""Our company strictly prohibits discrimination of any kind and has zero tolerance for racial profiling. We value every customer who chooses to shop at Macy's, and we remain committed to ensuring that every individual who steps into our store feels welcome and appreciated."" Retailers post customer 'Bill of Rights' after racial profiling allegations . After buying a $1,300 Movado watch for his mother, Brown was shopping for a pair of sunglasses for himself when he was stopped in the middle of the store by three men, whom he believed to be NYPD officers. They accused him of committing credit card fraud and detained him inside the store, according to court documents. ""They cuff me, parade me around the store, all the while maintaining, 'we do this all the time; it's a fake card; you're going to go to jail,' "" Brown said in October, recounting the incident on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Racial profiling costs Arizona county $22 million . Brown was the most notable of several people who said they were targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race last year and the second to accuse Macy's of the practice.

"Aereo, the embattled startup that captured shows from the broadcast airwaves and let users stream them digitally to their computers, smartphones or tablets, is essentially dead after a Supreme Court ruling Wednesday. The court, in a 6-3 vote, ruled that the service violated copyright laws, even though it was using miniature TV antennas to access publicly broadcast signals from local TV stations. The startup has said there was ""no Plan B"" for its survival if the court ruled against them. The owners of ABC, Fox, NBC, Univision and other broadcasters had filed suit against Aereo. (Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, was not a plaintiff in the case, but did support the broadcasters.) Aereo started in the New York City metropolitan area and is now online in New York and 10 other U.S. markets. It charges $8 a month and has never revealed how many users it has. So, now, the question becomes: What will Aereo's users do instead? Presuming that Aereo does, in fact, cease service as it now exists, there are other options out there for folks still unwilling to fork over the money for cable TV. From apps to Web-streaming hardware, products exist with which millions have already ""cut the cord."" But, as with much of life, there are upsides and downsides to this approach. Here's a look at what's out there, what people like about it and what cable still has that the Web can't duplicate. Streaming hardware . In the past few years, the market has been flooded with devices that can stream Web content to your television. Startups with dedicated devices, like Roku, soon were joined by some of tech's major players. Apple, Google, Amazon and Samsung all have streaming devices with varying capabilities, and all the major video game consoles can be used to do so as well. Once a techie luxury, devices like Google's Chromecast or a low-end Roku can now be had for as little as $35-40. That's come in handy for folks looking for alternatives to traditional television because ... Apps are everywhere . Ask people who don't have cable or a satellite dish what they use to watch television and a short list of apps are mentioned again and again: Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. Streaming accounts for each offer TV shows and movies. Hulu focuses on new TV episodes (or, at least, newer ... more on that later) while Amazon and Netflix are mostly movies and previous seasons of popular shows. For some, that's enough to substitute for the full array that cable offers. Especially when paired with ... Rabbit ears! OK, so maybe the antenna you'd go out and buy today wouldn't bear much of a resemblance to the twin-pronged, set-top gadgetry many of us remember from our childhoods (tinfoil wrapped round the tips optional). But with a digital antenna, you get the major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox), PBS and other local stations in a lot better quality than you used to get. Put that together with the streaming options and you're starting to build yourself back up. However ... The drawbacks . Despite all the digital options, there are some things that you just can't replace when you pull the plug on cable. If you fall back on watching only broadcast networks, for example, your picture quality may suffer. Also, none of the above-mentioned apps stream TV shows as they are airing. On Hulu, many shows aren't available until 24 hours after they air. In the age of plot spoilers online and on social media, that's risky. And it gets worse. Fox and ABC have chosen to wait eight days before letting non-subscribers watch new shows. It's even tougher to keep up with your premium cable favorites. HBO made news in April by announcing it would make some old shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" available on Amazon. But a three-year delay means ""Girls"" or ""Game of Thrones"" fans are still out of luck. As are those fans hoping to watch ... The big game . Ask non-cable subscribers about the holes in their new TV setup and many bring up live sports. While many cable networks stream via their websites and mobile apps, most, like WatchESPN, require a cable subscription to access them. If you enjoy hitting your local sports bar, this may not be such a big deal. If you're more inclined to kick back and watch sports at home (particularly if you follow a team outside the city where you live) it's tough. In the end, the cable-vs.-digital debate appears set to continue for a while, much like many other situations in which emerging technology has collided awkwardly with entrenched institutions. But, for better or for worse, the Supreme Court on Wednesday didn't help the digital side's cause.","The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against streaming startup Aereo .

"The road was melting. Extreme heat from thermal features at Yellowstone National Park, created by the active volcano below the park, caused oil to bubble on a road surface on July 9 and damage it. Park crews had to close and repair the 3.3-mile loop road that takes visitors past White Dome Geyser, Great Fountain Geyser and Firehole Lake. Blame it on the Yellowstone Volcano. Yellowstone National Park -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- sits atop one of the world's largest volcanoes, and some of the thermal spots have damaged the popular Firehole Lake Drive. The park features over 10,000 thermal spots, about half the world's known thermal spots. Yellowstone: One of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites . Although the volcano is active -- evidenced by the thermal features and 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes annually -- park officials don't expect a catastrophic eruption anytime in the next 1,000 or even 10,000 years. Yellowstone's first supervolcanic eruption occurred 2.1 million years ago, and there were other Yellowstone supereruptions 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago. The park has instruments monitoring the volcano throughout the park, and there would be plenty of warning -- weeks or even months -- if an eruption were going to occur. In the meantime, enjoy the park! Maintenance crews quickly repaired the road, and it was reopened to visitors Saturday.

"On a holiday marking the birth of a nation of immigrants, protesters and counterprotesters began a new round of angry demonstrations Friday in a California town that was scheduled to receive new busloads of migrants arrested for entering the country illegally. The small Southern California city of Murrieta, named after a Spaniard whose family set up a sheep ranch there in 1873, is now a national flashpoint in the U.S. immigration crisis: Protesters are denouncing the federal transfer of detained migrants to their town for processing at a local U.S. Border Patrol office. Demonstrators successfully blockaded busloads from entering the town earlier this week. A second convoy of federal buses carrying migrants to a U.S. Border Patrol station in Murrieta was expected Friday, and Murrieta resident Jason Woolley joined protesters to express his outrage about illegal border crossings. A surge of undocumented Central American immigrants has created a federal crisis, and some of them are supposed to be processed in Murrieta. ""There's a right way and a wrong way to come into this country. If you are going to come in the wrong way, we're not going to stand for it. That's just how it is,"" Woolley said. ""There (are) thousands and millions of other people who've done it the right way. But for people to just come in here and ask for a free handout, that's my money."" Erica Suarez of Long Beach defended the immigrants' rights to due process -- and noted how the United States was built by immigrants. ""It's not a us versus we situation. It's a we. It's everybody together,"" said Suarez, who described herself as an undocumented student. Police arrested at least one protester Friday morning. No further details were immediately available. Exchange of hard words . The protests have been emotionally charged, with racial slurs uttered against Latinos defending the rights of the arrested immigrants, some of whom may be refugees, the immigration rights advocates say. But on Independence Day, protesters held placards saying, ""It's not about race. It's about law."" Others said, ""No human is illegal,"" and ""No white supremacy."" Police secured the road so the entry to the Border Patrol office was clear, though a smaller group of protesters found a way to camp on the side of the road. A quarter of a mile away, a yellow police line held back the larger demonstration of dozens of protesters, and by Friday afternoon, police put up a second yellow tape and stood between the two factions of demonstrators to stop their pushing and shoving. Protesters chanted, ""USA! USA!"" Counterprotesters chanted, ""La raza unida jamas seran vencida,"" which translates as ""The (Latino) race united will never be defeated."" Apparently supporting them, men and women in Indian costumes trimmed with feathers danced to a drumbeat. Police warned participants not to fight. Some of them suffered heat exposure in the 100-degree sunshine and found relief under a tent. ""We don't want anyone to get hurt. There's children here,"" a police officer told protesters. Both sides waved American flags, but one demonstrator held a shredded U.S. flag, angering an adversary who yelled: ""Absolute disgrace!"" Counterprotester Dara Glanzer didn't mind spending the Fourth of July in a protest that was hot by any standard. ""It's Independence Day -- for whom and why,"" Glanzer said. ""This is a refugee crisis that we're dealing with.... If these people were from say, Ukraine, trying to get here from the violence that ruptured the Ukraine, maybe these people would be for that."" Murrieta's concerns and compassion . Residents object to how U.S. agents may ""dump"" the Central American immigrants into their community once their processing is completed, a practice that was true in the past, said Murrieta Mayor Alan Long. Both sides of the protest, he said, seek a legal, efficient process for the overflow of arrested migrants. ""We're sending people in inhumane conditions and dispersing them across the nation,"" Long said. On Tuesday, the federal government began busing 140 migrants for processing in Murrieta every 72 hours, raising concerns about operational capacity, Long said. The initial federal plan called for 500 people, which was lowered to 300, but the city strongly opposed those plans. ""The concern we have is the sustainability of 140 every 72 hours,"" Long said. ""We don't see this stopping any time soon."" Long said earlier this week that his city ""continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local Border Patrol office."" A subsequent protest in agreement became raucous Tuesday; a counterprotester was spat upon. Long described portions of that protest as ""unfortunate"" and ""deplorable."" The city had offered U.S. officials a mobile health clinic to help them provide health screenings and inoculations for the migrants, but the federal approval process would have been too long. ""The world has never been able to see how compassionate our community is because we never got there,"" Long said. The first protest . Federal officials weren't disclosing arrival times Friday for the immigrants or even the cities receiving them, citing safety concerns in light of Tuesday's protests in Murrieta. The town became a battleground over immigration that day as angry crowds chanted, ""Go back home,"" and forced buses carrying immigrants to turn around. Counterprotesters squared off with demonstrators, leading to a shouting match over the nation's immigration system. As chaos ensued, federal officials rerouted the 140 undocumented immigrants to U.S. processing centers at least 80 miles away, in the San Diego and El Centro areas. A tide of Central Americans illegally entering the United States has overwhelmed a system already buckling under the weight of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Unlike undocumented Mexican migrants, who are often immediately deported, the United States detains and processes Central Americans, who are eventually released and given a month to report to immigration offices. Protests and tension . Many never show up and join the undocumented population, according to the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents. The immigrants rejected by Murrieta protesters were initially held in Texas, where U.S. facilities are overflowing, forcing detainees to be sent to other states for processing. The government doesn't have the room to shelter the children with adults: There's only one family immigration detention center, in Pennsylvania. To assist the unaccompanied children, the Obama administration opened shelters last month on three military bases because federal facilities more designed for adults were overrun with minors. Tuesday's busloads didn't include any unaccompanied minors, said Murrieta Police Chief Sean Hadden. The children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults, said an official with the National Border Patrol Council. Immigration rights advocates denounced the protesters. ""It is deplorable that people espousing anti-immigrant hate language created unnecessary tension and fear for immigrant mothers and their children,"" said Pedro Rios, a community representative of the San Diego Immigrant Rights Consortium. ""Even more concerning is that elected officials in the city of Murrieta instigated this tension. Mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma."" Journey from Texas . The U.S. government earlier flew the 140 Central American immigrants from south Texas to San Diego. Federal agents were busing them to Murrieta for processing at the Border Patrol station when the standoff took place Tuesday. After the buses turned around, the immigrants were taken to a U.S. Border Patrol station in San Diego, said Ron Zermeno of the National Border Patrol Council. The United States is struggling to accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants, particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from  El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The U.S. government doesn't have enough beds, food or sanitary facilities. Authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children will cross the border without parents this year in what the White House has called an ""immediate humanitarian crisis.""","Murrieta mayor calls parts of earlier protest ""unfortunate"" and ""deplorable""

"Washington (CNN)Call it a brief intermission: There's a three-week break in the action after a slew of primaries in May and June and a couple big headlines. The major story line so far this election cycle is the ongoing battle that pits mainstream Republicans against tea party groups and anti-establishment organizations. After a few high-profile tea party victories in late May and early June put to bed premature stories of the death of the 5-year-old grass-roots conservative movement, incumbents and establishment candidates ran the table in last week's contests. Complete coverage: 2014 midterm elections . The calendar ahead doesn't look as promising for outsiders looking to knock off another incumbent in the remaining primaries in the 18 states yet to vote. ""The primaries produced only a few fights between the tea party and the establishment wing of the GOP because many congressional Republicans took their primaries seriously and kept their votes consistently conservative,"" GOP consultant Ron Bonjean told CNN. ""The few primary battles we saw produced victories based on combinations of intensity, fund-raising and motivating voters one way or another,"" said Bonjean, who has been a top strategist and adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders. The resounding defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his congressional primary in Virginia to a little-known and underfunded anti-establishment candidate rocked the GOP.  But two weeks later, the tea party lost out on a golden opportunity to oust a sitting GOP lawmaker when Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi edged out state Sen. Chris McDaniel in a primary runoff. McDaniel, who enjoyed strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups, narrowly edged out Cochran in the June 3 primary, but with neither man cracking 50% (there was a third Republican candidate on the ballot who grabbed 1.5% of the vote), the contest moved to last week's runoff, which Cochran won by fewer than 7,000 votes. Would Cochran's strategy work elsewhere? The senator's victory was aided by votes from African-American Democrats, who were courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces. But McDaniel alleges his team has found voting irregularities and is not conceding. ""Interpreting the Cochran win as some kind of 'Empire Strikes Back' moment is an overreach,"" Republican communications strategist Keith Appell told CNN. ""Republican leaders and their establishment backers dodged a bullet in Mississippi, but there is still a deep and active discontent among the grass roots, and it will only continue to manifest until the leadership reconnects with its base. Anyone who seriously thinks otherwise is delusional,"" said Appell, a senior vice president at CRC Public Relations, a Washington public relations firm that has had many conservative clients. Some victories but a lot of defeats . Anti-establishment forces have scored some victories this season. They knocked off another GOP incumbent, 91-year-old Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas, who lost his congressional primary runoff last month to a tea party-backed candidate. And in May, tea party-backed Ben Sasse came out on top in Nebraska's GOP Senate primary. The same night conservative Alex Mooney, who was supported by anti-establishment groups, won the GOP contest in West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District. But those were the major highlights for the tea party in a year when mainstream Republicans have enjoyed most of the victories. Primary challenges from the right shook up the Republican Party in the last two election cycles. But they have also hurt the party's chances of winning back control of the Senate from Democrats, effectively costing the GOP five potentially winnable elections since 2010. So what's happening this cycle? ""Establishment Republicans and incumbents have learned to run against tea party-backed candidates,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. And outside help is making a difference. ""I think the Republican establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles. There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""I think in the past it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,"" Inside Politics: The Chamber of Commerce's next target . The battles ahead . Anti-establishment forces still have an outside chance to score an upset in Tennessee and Kansas in early August. ""For those folks who are looking to knock off a Republican senator in a primary this cycle, the opportunities are down to Tennessee and Kansas,"" Gonzales said. ""There is still some time for those races to develop, but they will both take work to get the challenger campaigns to the same level as Chris McDaniel in Mississippi."" Two-term Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee is an inviting target. He's known as a lawmaker willing to work with Democrats to broker bipartisan deals. He's facing off against a bunch of primary challengers. The one with the best shot of toppling Alexander appears to be state lawmaker Joe Carr. ""Make no mistake about it -- the fight that Chris McDaniel started in Mississippi will continue here in Tennessee,"" Carr said after the Mississippi runoff. But unlike McDaniel, polls indicate Carr's the distinct underdog to Alexander. In Kansas, Sen. Pat Roberts is seeking a fourth term in office. Milton Wolf -- a second cousin (once removed) of President Barack Obama -- touts himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the GOP establishment. Wolf's campaign has tried to portray Roberts as more about Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent out a room to him. Roberts owns a rental property in his hometown of Dodge City and a home in the Washington suburbs, where he spends much of his time. But Wolf, a radiologist, came under attack over old Facebook postings in which he exposed private patient X-rays and other personal information -- poking fun at the dead or wounded. Wolf was forced to admit he made ""insensitive"" comments. Like Carr, polls indicate Wolf trails far behind Roberts. But Sal Russo, chief strategist for the Tea Party Express, a national tea party group that backs Wolf, told CNN that the challenger is ""able to bring a lot of excitement and enthusiasm among the grass roots. And that's the problem Roberts has. He lives in Washington. He's pretty much out of touch with the people of Kansas. So I think that that frustration with Washington has manifested itself in growing support for Milton Wolf."" Winning by losing? The next high-profile primary is Georgia's GOP Senate runoff on July 22, but the tea party doesn't appear to be much of a factor there. Businessman David Perdue and Rep. Jack Kingston advanced to a runoff, but the three more conservative candidates didn't. But regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, tea party leaders said they've changed the conversation in Washington. ""The tea party is winning by losing in the sense that you don't see any Republicans saying, 'Let's pass immigration reform that gives a path to citizenship. Let's make it easier for the President to raise the debt ceiling.' Almost all Republicans have shifted right,"" said John King, CNN's chief national correspondent. Another strategist said this year's contests aren't the final chapter in the struggle between the grass roots and the establishment. ""The party remains deeply divided, and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016,"" wrote Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""The war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences. That should please Democrats."" What does that mean for November? The candidates who emerge from this year's primaries could have an immediate impact come November. Democrats have a 55-45 majority in the Senate (53 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the party). But in the midterm elections, the party is defending 21 of the 36 seats up for grabs, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. In the House, the Democrats need to pick up a challenging 17 Republican-held seats to win back the majority from the GOP. ""We learned that Republicans across the board have picked highly electable candidates and have improved their chances of taking over the Senate,"" said Bonjean, the GOP consultant. But Democrats disagree, and say that even though mainstream Republicans are winning in the primaries, those candidates are moving further to the right to secure victories, which will likely hurt them when they face a more moderate general election electorate in November.","Outsiders vs. insiders is the dominant story line in GOP primaries so far .

"When James Theodorou reflects on mistakes from past jobs, he cringes to think about the role he played in printing 4 million copies of a well-known U.S. magazine with the wrong date on the cover. It was the early 1980s and Theodorou was working as an offset stripper, who performs platemaking and stripping for presses. He said he could only wait in horror as his little mistake was distributed across the country. The memory is burned into his brain. It resurfaced earlier this month when he learned of the nurse in the United Kingdom who put through a prank call from two Australian DJs to the ward where Prince William's wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was being treated for acute morning sickness. Who was nurse Jacintha Saldanha? While the circumstances of the nurse's death remain unclear, the incident prompted Theodorou and many other CNN.com readers to share stories of dealing with stressful situations on the job, making mistakes and moving on. Mistakes are an opportunity to see how you can do something differently, said commenter RealityChk101, a software engineer from North Dakota who has had ""code blow up in my face several times, sometimes with disastrous results,"" he said. ""In almost every case I have had to take the action of documenting every little thing that went wrong, why it went wrong and how this was never going to happen again."" The commenter, who asked not to have his real name used, said he once was mortified to find that he had somehow stripped last names from everyone in a database. His co-workers made up a song about him, to the tune of ""Candy Man,"" asking ""Who can take the last name, and throw it all away?"" After his initial panicked reaction, he calmed down and came up with ways to rectify the situation. ""I spent two days calling those 500 people, getting their last names,"" he said. ""Management figured that was punishment enough."" The commenter said his situation pales in comparison to the stress nurses and hospital workers deal with daily, where lives are at stake. ""Hospitals are by their nature a stressful place: you have births, sickness and death, all under one roof,"" he said. ""Caregivers are bombarded by every type of emotion on a daily basis."" The incident caused him to fear that he would lose his job. But talking to co-workers proved to be helpful, he said. ""In most of those cases, my co-workers were supportive, and when I needed more support, I just unloaded emotionally on my wife of 33 years."" Seeking support from others can be helpful, especially in cases where you think you might be in danger of losing your job, said Christine Porath, associate professor of management at Georgetown University. They may help you see things differently. Porath said people of all occupations often place their self worth in their jobs because they see them as much more than a task. ""Their heart and soul is in their job, so their identity is wrapped in it, which is great, but when your job is threatened or you make a mistake, that makes it all the more harder."" It helps to get a bit of perspective on the situation by disengaging and ""stepping away from the workplace to focus on everything else that you have,"" she said. ""I think it makes the support aspect all the more important. You really need to focus on other parts of your life."" Employers also benefit from keeping their employees happy, said Porath, who researches the effects of incivility in the workplace. Most people are focused on the outward display of anger and far less aware of the devastating effects of being afraid or sad about one's status in the organization, she said. These latter two emotions are the ones that are more likely to cause people to leave their jobs, she said. Since his first public gaffe, Theodorou said he has learned to handle workplace stress by maintaining an emotional detachment from the task at hand while making decisions. ""By using logic, and following the (standard operating procedures), everything is no longer personal, just business. Even errors. I then go home and engage my hobbies."" Theodorou had no choice but to try to do better on the next issue of the magazine. He slowed down and went over his work again carefully. He made a checklist and had another technician perform a quality control inspection before starting the four-hour process of printing the covers. ""It only added about 15 minutes to the job, but they were a well-spent 15 minutes,"" he said. Corporate recruiter Steven Raz said the recession can increase people's concerns about doing well at work. He advised that if you do make a mistake, you should have a plan to correct it. If the mistake is big, get help. ""It's always recommended that if something happens like that, and it's too big to handle, that's when you should bring in your boss,"" Raz said. Some people may be tempted to say nothing, but that can be dangerous, he added. ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to worry about what truth you've told,"" Raz said. What do you think?

"Mohammed Abu Khedair, a Palestinian teenager who was abducted and killed in Jerusalem this week, died from being burned alive and hit on the head with a blunt object, according to Palestinian General Prosecutor Mohammed al-Auwewy, citing a medical autopsy. Al-Auwewy said the autopsy discovered traces of smoke inside the lungs of the 16-year-old, indicating that it was inhaled while the fire was burning. Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said his country is aggressively investigating the killing. ""We'll get to the bottom of it and catch those responsible,"" he told CNN on Saturday. Relatives accuse Israeli forces of beating visiting U.S. teen. The teenager's death sparked widespread outrage among Palestinians, many of whom believe he was killed in retaliation for the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens. Israeli authorities are investigating who killed Khedair and why, said Netanyahu. After the Palestinian teen's funeral on Friday, more than 60 people were injured in clashes with Israeli security forces in parts of Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, a group that said it was involved in evacuating injured Palestinians. It said the injuries mostly involved rubber bullets fired at the upper body and chest. Israeli police said 13 of their officers were slightly injured in clashes in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat, where Palestinian protesters were throwing rocks at police, who responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas. Clashes erupt after Palestinian teenager's funeral in Jerusalem . Meanwhile, a 15-year-old cousin of Khedair is at the center of a new controversy that's become an international incident. Tariq Khdeir, 15, a high school sophomore in Tampa, was visiting his Palestinian relatives in Jerusalem when he was attacked and detained, relatives told CNN. The family claims that Khdeir is seen in separate videos being held down and pummeled by men in the uniform of Israeli security forces. Israel's Justice Ministry is investigating an incident that U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called ""troubling."" Rockets from Gaza get Israeli response . Khedair's death has raised the ire of many Palestinians in Jerusalem. But that city is hardly the only place in the region that's fraught with tension. Gaza and Israeli communities within rocket's reach have seen plenty of intermittent violence in recent weeks. This comes after Israeli authorities blamed Hamas -- the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza -- for the kidnapping and killing of the three Israel teens whose bodies were found earlier this week. Hamas has praised the kidnappings of the Israelis but denied that it was responsible for what happened. It also warned if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" While it could still ratchet up significantly, the dangerous back-and-forth between the two sides continued this weekend. That includes more Israeli warplanes striking targets in Gaza, as well as more rockets being fired across the border into Israel early Sunday morning. Israel Defense Forces said in a press release that ""following constant rocket fire at (southern) Israeli communities,"" its aircraft targeted 10 ""terror sites"" in central and southern Gaza. The targets included ""concealed rocket launchers and a weapon manufacturing facility,"" the military said. And on Saturday, Israeli military aircraft targeted a militant in southern Gaza who earlier in the day fired rockets at the town of Ofakim in southern Israel, IDF said in a statement. Initial indications suggest that three rockets were intercepted above the area of Ashkelon, the military said. At least 14 rockets have been fired at Israel  since midnight Saturday with one being intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome above Be'er Sheva, according to IDF. Twelve rockets landed in Israeli territory and another fell in Palestinian territory. Opinion: Slain teens call for justice, not escalation .

"Less than 24 hours after being named the winner of the third season of ""The Voice,"" Cassadee Pope is still catching her breath. ""I don't think it's really settled in yet,"" she tells Rolling Stone. ""It's just unreal. I can't believe it. I haven't had a chance to sit down and soak it up. But it's just crazy. I'm very excited."" In addition to winning the show, Pope, 23, is still coming to grips with the fact that she sang ""I'm With You,"" one of her ""all-time favorite songs,"" with its original vocalist, Avril Lavigne. Pope has long admired the Canadian singer. ""She's always had that thing about her that always spoke to me, which is being who she is and not apologizing for it,"" explains Pope. ""That's something that I have trouble with, honestly. I do care about what people think about me sometimes, and sometimes it affects me in a negative way. Her music has always been there to remind me to not care what other people think and be myself."" Cassadee Pope wins season three of ""The Voice"" Pope -- a native of West Palm Beach, Florida, and the former lead singer of the Warped Tour vets Hey Monday -- admits she was hesitant at first to audition for ""The Voice."" Last year, while still a member of her band, Pope turned down an offer to audition for Season Two. But after moving to Los Angeles to try her hand at a solo career, struggling to pay the bills and exhausting all her contacts in the music business, Pope says she was forced to reconsider her options when The Voice came calling again. ""I almost passed on it again,"" she admits. ""I don't know why. . . just being in the band world, you tend to get a little proud. A part of me just didn't want to do this show because I wanted to do it from the ground up. I really wanted to do it the old-fashioned way, which is kind of impossible nowadays -- especially when everyone thinks you're going to sound exactly like your band and no one's interested."" 'The Voice:' Rolling Stones complete coverage . Not surprisingly, Pope has no regrets now. ""Doing the show was, I think, the best career decision I've ever made,"" she says. ""It got people to really take a second to listen. It's not going to be Hey Monday; it's going to be something entirely different."" That's not to say Pope didn't have second thoughts throughout the season. The singer admits she was taken aback when many on the Internet protested that her previous music-industry experience put her at an unfair advantage in the competition. ""When I came into [the show], I got a lot of that and it was discouraging,"" she says. ""But I had to just prove myself and try to prove people wrong. I thought it was kind of crazy to think that someone like me -- who's been working towards this my whole life, since I was four years old, and then toured in bands and did all that, and really has been working hard -- doesn't deserve it as much as someone else next to me who's never done it before. I feel like if you have the heart and the passion for it, you deserve it."" 'The Voice:' Season three awards . Pope evolved significantly as a singer on The Voice, shedding her pop-punk roots and embracing country music, the genre of choice for mentor Blake Shelton. In fact, the singer's standout moment of the season was her performance of the Shelton ballad ""Over You,"" which became the sole song on the show this season to top the iTunes charts. While initially dismissive of the genre, Pope says now that she sees many similarities between it and her more familiar pop-rock. ""Country music tell stories,"" she says. ""That's something that I can relate to."" Having secured a record contract with Universal Republic in her victory, Pope will soon hit the studio to record her debut solo album. ""[It will be] a little bit more of a Nineties, early 2000s feel,"" she says. ""Pop-rock but with a little bit of a country twist on it. There's a lot of things to work out and I know that it's going to take some meetings to figure it out. But I would love to do pop-rock/country [album] so I'm able to cover all the bases.""

"What is tech but yesterday's dreams realized? From touchscreen tablets to virtual reality, it all has to start in somebody's mind before it ends up on the shelves of a store (or, let's be honest, in an Amazon warehouse somewhere in the middle of nowhere). No, we here at CNN Tech haven't dreamed up any technological breakthroughs that will change the world. At least none that we're willing to discuss publicly. But we do think about tech stuff a lot and ponder how to make it better. So as this new year dawns, we came up with these five wishes for the tech world in 2013. Are they all likely to come true? Almost certainly not. But some might, and the others may be useful as conversation starters if nothing else. Let us know what your tech hopes and dreams for 2013 are in the comments. The Wozniak Initiative . You don't have to be an Apple fanatic to love The Woz. Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple who is known more as a gadget geek than a ruthless businessman, showed where his heart is when asked about the constant barrage of lawsuits flying back and forth between tech companies these days. Apple sued Samsung. Samsung sued Apple. Apple sued Google. Google sued Apple. And so on. And so on. Wozniak, who has dropped out of the business end of things at Apple, had a solution. ""I hate it ..."" Wozniak said. ""I wish everybody would just agree to exchange all the patents and everybody can build the best forms they want to use everybody's technologies."" We're with Woz. If the consumer-tech titans quit squabbling over the details and use all the tools at their disposal to make great products, we as consumers win, right? But we're not holding our breath. Estimated chance: 2% . The perfect social site . More than 1 billion of us have made social networking a regular part of our lives. So why is everyone so unhappy? With Facebook, if it's not concerns about privacy, it's irritation at ads or frustration with ""friends"" who share those stupid ""click this or you hate puppies"" posts. Twitter's microbursts of news and info, much of it snarky commentary, definitely aren't for everybody. (That said, can even the biggest Twitter haters agree with us that ""Twitter is for twits"" is an old, tired, unoriginal insult and move on?) So let's hope for the perfect networking site to come along out of nowhere in 2013. Failing that, maybe the existing sites will put their differences aside and combine the best of each into a single super-network. (Google+ sure does look pretty. But how many folks do you know who use it on purpose?) Oh ... and our pipe-dream social network will be bankrolled by some billionaire as a public service, so there'll be no annoying ads or worries about your data being used to serve advertisers. Hear that, billionaires? Get busy. Estimated chance: 7% . Affordable 3-D printers . OK ... so, ""affordable"" is one of those things that's definitely in the eye of the beholder. And by some early-adopter standards, the $2,200 or so you can plunk down for a MakerBot Replicator or other 3-D printer qualifies as a bargain. But we'd love for 2013 to be the year that these living-in-the-future devices gain enough traction for the inevitable price drop that always eventually comes with new technology. (Witness: The $1,389 VCR) The potential of 3-D printers is one of the truly exciting promises of emerging tech. The ability to reproduce tiny parts of bigger, more complicated objects -- say, cameras, appliances, etc. -- could help consumers extend the lifespans of our increasingly disposable gadgets. But, let's be honest. We'd probably use ours to make action figures or dinosaur skulls or a bunch of bad guys from Doctor Who. So, yeah. Hurry up with that price drop. Estimated chance: 46% . Made in the U.S.A. It's not just about the goodwill they'd get from customers, although there would probably be no shortage of that. But it's increasingly looking like good business for top tech companies to start making their products in the United States. In 2012, we saw glimmers of hope. Apple announced that it will begin manufacturing one of its computers in the United States in 2013. Lenovo, the Chinese electronics company, announced it will be opening its first U.S. factory in North Carolina. And Google gave ""Made in the U.S.A."" a shot as well, with its ill-fated Nexus Q device. Apple, among other tech firms, has taken some lumps over reports of poor worker conditions on its assembly lines in China. Now, with production, transportation and other costs in China increasing, experts say it might not be long before it makes financial sense to move factories back to the States. As the U.S. economy continues to slowly rebound, let's hope 2013 sees its fair share of that move. Estimated chance: 50% . Battery life . We get it. We ask our smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices to do more, and do it faster, every year. We also want them to be small enough to act as fashion accessories (even as their display screens get bigger). And we realize that all that surfing, texting, streaming and downloading burns power. But is it too much for us to dream of a day when we can go from sunup to sundown without having to stay tethered to a USB port? A day when we can stream music or videos without growing anxious about preserving the precious remaining drops of juice in our gadgets? There's some room for optimism here. MIT researchers say a new amplifier design they're working on could double battery life in smartphones. Research on consumer applications is underway, and, if we're lucky, it will mean durable, environmentally friendlier batteries that will make finding public spots next to power outlets less of a blood sport. Estimated chance: We have no idea, but our fingers are crossed .","As 2012 ends, here are our tech dreams for 2013 .
Will the big guys stop suing and start making the best gadgets possible?
We'd love a ""perfect"" social networking site .
More ""Made in the U.S.A."" tech and longer battery life would also rock ."
"Four years ago, a young female journalist driving home from work at 3 a.m. was shot dead in her car in India's capital, New Delhi. The state's chief minister, Sheila Dixit, a woman, remarked that the girl was returning home all by herself ""at night in a city where people believe ... you know ... you should not be so adventurous."" This week, a 23-year-old woman, accompanied by a male friend, boarded a bus on a busy road in the capital at 9 p.m., only to be brutally raped by a group of men. She was then savagely beaten, stripped and thrown onto the road. The girl and her friend, who was attacked for trying to protect her, were returning home after watching a movie. She is battling for life in hospital, according to her doctors. India's rising rape cases -- one every 22 minutes, according to the National Crime Records Bureau -- betray what is wrong with society. Millions of Indians continue to believe that women invite trouble on themselves by being careless. Mothers often chide daughters for wearing provocative clothing, in most cases a sleeveless garment or a pair of hip-hugging jeans. In cities such as New Delhi, easily the most-policed state in the country, few women will take public or private transport unescorted after nightfall. More than 600 rape cases have been reported in New Delhi alone this year, according to government records. Worse still, many more go unreported because a large number feel insecure about reporting rape or even sexual harassment to lawmakers, either because they are not taken seriously or because in several cases the protectors have turned perpetrators. Earlier this month, a girl who was raped in her village by four men, was then allegedly raped by a police officer who was handling her case, according to medical examiners. She had to be rescued by a police team that raided the hotel where she was being held. The incident happened in Uttar Pradesh, which borders Delhi. Around the same time in Punjab, another northern state, an officer who was protecting his daughter against sexual harassment -- locally referred to as ""Eve teasing"" -- was shot dead in public view, allegedly by a local political party member who was troubling her. The truth is, when most women report sexual harassment in India's cities, towns and villages, they are typically met with a shrug. Slowly, but firmly, the onus of remaining safe seems to have shifted to women, instead of being shared by society and law-keepers. At a protest rally held in the city on Tuesday, when women waved placards saying: ""Don't teach me what to wear, teach men not to rape,"" it was meant as a wake-up call for society, for mothers and fathers, for law-keepers as well as lawmakers. Other posters saying: ""Don't get raped,"" with words crossed out to read: ""Don't rape,"" were a chilling reminder of how vulnerable and isolated women feel in India. India's apparent nonchalance towards sexual harassment has escalated into a major crisis. And we're not just talking about the odd sly remark or attempt to grope a woman but far more serious assaults. India's misplaced tolerance has helped this cascade into a brutal, violent menace.

"(CNN)Much of the focus in Cooper Mills Harris' death has been on Justin Ross Harris, the father who failed to drop the toddler off at day care. The 33-year-old Georgia man faces charges of murder and child cruelty in the case, but authorities have repeatedly mentioned the actions of his wife, Leanna. She has not been charged with any crime. Leanna Harris told CNN at the beginning of the investigation that a lawyer had advised her not to speak to the media, so not much is known about her. A new set of search warrants obtained by CNN on Monday detailed authorities' focus on computer hardware, as well as her son and husband's medical records, but didn't shed much light on her involvement in the case. Still, questions persist. Here's what we know about the mother whose toddler died in a hot car in Cobb County on June 18. 1. Who is she? Leanna Harris is a 30-year-old dietitian licensed in Georgia and Alabama, records show. She's lived in Georgia since 2012. While CNN affiliates report that she worked out of her Marietta home, she is employed by DaVita Inc., a Demopolis, Alabama-based health care firm. Before moving to Marietta, she lived in Moundville, Alabama, a town of about 2,400 people 17 miles south of Tuscaloosa, home to her and her husband's alma mater, the University of Alabama. She moved into her Moundville home in 2007 and apparently worked at some point as a dietitian for DaVita during her time there, records show. 2. Does she have a happy marriage? She and Ross Harris had their eighth anniversary in May. We haven't heard from Leanna Harris, but Ross Harris told police he was happily married, according to background in one of many search warrants issued in the case. ""Nonetheless, evidence of inappropriate sexual communications with other women has been obtained,"" the warrants say. In court last week, a detective alleged that while Cooper was dying in his father's SUV, Ross Harris messaged six women, sending and receiving explicit texts -- some including nude images -- during work. One of the recipients of Harris' messages was underage, said Cobb County police Detective Phil Stoddard. Stoddard also said that messages between Leanna and Ross Harris indicated the two were having financial problems and that Leanna had made complaints about some purchases Ross had made. He did not elaborate, but a search warrant says the two had ""outstanding student and car loans,"" and Ross Harris had recently incurred about $4,000 in credit card debt to acquire airline miles. A friend of the couple, Winston Rowell Milling, however, told the court that things seemed normal. Milling and his wife had joined Ross and Leanna Harris for festivals, picnics, hiking on Kennesaw Mountain and other family events. Both parents seemed to have a loving relationship with Cooper, he said. More search warrants released . 3. Is she a suspect? Leanna Harris has not been named a suspect. Officer Michael Bowman, a Cobb County police spokesman, said Monday, ""Leanna Harris has been interviewed. Detectives continue to work on the case."" Police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her 22-month-old boy. Some actions that Stoddard said investigators found curious: . • Ross and Leanna Harris took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care, and on the day Cooper died, Leanna arrived and was told that Cooper hadn't been dropped off that morning. ""Ross must have left him in the car,"" she allegedly told day care employees. The day care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that Cooper wasn't dropped off, but she insisted that Ross left him in the vehicle, Stoddard testified Thursday at a probable cause hearing for Ross Harris. Defense attorney H. Maddox Kilgore told the court that Ross and Leanna had just learned of Gov. Nathan Deal's Look Again program, which was launched in mid-May. The program aims to ""remind parents, caregivers and the public about the dangers of leaving children unattended in vehicles."" • The defense also cited the governor's program to explain several Internet searches Ross and Leanna Harris conducted in the days before Cooper died. Police have alleged that the couple told them they looked up how hot a car needed to be to kill a child and that Leanna specifically ""made similar statements regarding researching in car deaths and how it occurs."" The exact time frame for the alleged research remains unclear. A search warrant states that Leanna Harris told police that losing her child because he was left in a hot vehicle was ""her worst fear."" ""Investigators questioned her further about this. Leanna stated specifically that her fear was that her child would be left in a hot vehicle, not the fear of losing a child,"" the warrant states. Ross Harris' attorney said his client forgot Cooper was in the car. • Stoddard alleged that Leanna Harris made an odd remark to her husband while the two were in an interview room after Ross Harris' arrest. Ross told Leanna that Cooper looked peaceful and said, ""I dreaded how he would look,"" Stoddard said. At another point, Stoddard said, Leanna Harris asked her husband what he had said to police. ""She asked him -- she had him sit down, and he starts going through this. And she looks at him, and she's like, 'Well, did you say too much?' "" the detective testified. 4. Was she called as a witness at Ross Harris' probable cause hearing? She did not testify, but she did attend. It's not clear whether she'll be called as a witness, but according to Georgia law, the state's spousal privilege -- which protects a wife from testifying against her husband or vice versa -- does not apply here. The Georgia code says spousal privilege ""shall not apply in proceedings in which the husband or wife is charged with a crime against the person of a minor child, but such person shall be compellable to give evidence only on the specific act for which the defendant is charged."" Leanna Harris arrived before the proceeding began and took a seat with family members, holding hands with the woman sitting next to her. When Ross Harris was brought into the courtroom in his orange prison jumpsuit, she appeared to get emotional. When Stoddard began his testimony, she held the hand of another woman sitting next to her and at one point appeared to wipe away tears. She put her head down when Stoddard was questioned about Ross Harris sexting other women. Later, she looked straight ahead without expression. She hung her head again when Stoddard discussed her alleged conversation with day care workers. Leanna Harris seemed most attentive when the hearing turned to the matter of her husband's bail. 5. Did she speak at Cooper's funeral? Leanna Harris told mourners in Tuscaloosa that before Cooper's birth, she was concerned ""about never being able to have a child."" She described the toddler as perfect and told how he changed her and Ross Harris' lives. ""As children do, he turned our lives upside-down,"" she said. ""Cleaning, changing diapers, dinner, bath time. Finally, what I would call mommy time. I wouldn't trade it for the world."" She said Cooper had had trouble sleeping of late, and he had slept with her and her husband the two nights before he died, ""snuggling in between both of us."" ""I remember turning over in the middle of the night. His mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face. I will cherish that moment forever."" She further said she was ""happy"" that Cooper would miss some of life's letdowns, including his first heartbreak, his parents' and grandparents' deaths and who to sit with at lunch at middle school. ""I miss him with all of my heart. Would I bring him back? No. To bring him back into this broken world would be selfish,"" she said. She closed by saying that she wasn't angry with her husband and that Cooper ""meant the world"" to Ross, whom she described as a ""wonderful daddy."" Death highlights key role of digital evidence .

"It's not the type of plane either Kent Brantly or Nancy Writebol likely planned to take home. But when health officials evacuate the two American aid workers infected with Ebola in west Africa, it will be the plane they take. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has outfitted a Gulfstream jet with an isolation pod designed and built by the U.S. Defense Department, the CDC and a private company. The pod, officially called an Aeromedical Biological Containment System, is a portable, tentlike device that ensures the flight crew and others on the flight remain safe from an infectious disease. A U.S.-contracted medical charter flight left Cartersville, Georgia, Thursday afternoon, to evacuate the Americans, a source familiar with the travel plans told CNN. At least one of them will be brought to Emory University near the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, hospital officials told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. The CDC raised its travel warning for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone from Level 2 to Level 3 on Thursday, warning against any nonessential travel to the region. Since 2003, the agency has only issued Level 3 alerts on two occasions: during the outbreak of SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2003, and in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The CDC is sending 50 additional personnel to the three countries, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said. They will be working to speed up laboratory testing, trace potentially infected people and strengthen the local health care systems. Ebola is believed to have killed 729 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria between March 1 and July 27, according to the World Health Organization. Stopping this particular epidemic could take months. It's like fighting a forest fire, Frieden says -- if you leave even one burning ember, the epidemic can start again. ""It's not going to be quick. It's not going to be easy. But we know what to do."" Evacuating Brantly and Writebol was ultimately up to the aid organizations they work for, Frieden said. Moving them could do more harm than the good that might come with better treatment options in a developed country. ""I can tell you that airplanes are tough environments,"" said Dr. Lee Norman, chief medical officer at The University of Kansas Hospital. Norman was a flight surgeon for 16 years in the Air Force. ""You want to have the shortest trip possible for the best quality medical care. That is as available in Europe as it is in the U.S. It's a matter of how much flight they can handle."" The American health care system is well-prepared for Ebola patients, experts say. ""I think any major medical center can take care of any Ebola patient,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine. ""We have isolation rooms we use all the time."" These isolation rooms are used for patients suspected to have tuberculosis, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome or another infectious disease. Schaffner said not much would be different for an Ebola patient, though more stringent precautions might be taken to ensure health care workers are following all protocols. ""But all that is minor compared to the adjustments you have to make during influenza (season), for example,"" he said. The CDC has quarantine stations around the country staffed 24/7. And most hospital staffs have been alerted and are on the lookout for Ebola symptoms, said Dr. Eric Legome, chief of emergency medicine at Kings County Hospital in New York. Symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhea and vomiting. Some patients have trouble breathing. Doctors are asking patients with these symptoms if they have traveled recently to the three countries primarily affected by the Ebola outbreak: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. They're also asking if patients have been in contact with anyone else who has traveled to the region lately. Legome said hospitals have a low threshold to isolate patients, meaning anyone who is even remotely suspected of being infected will immediately be put in an isolated ICU room so health officials can run tests. ""They would most likely be flying in civilian aircraft and seek care in civilian hospitals, urgent care clinics, physicians' offices and emergency departments,"" said Norman. ""That is exactly why this awareness is important for all caregivers."" Ebola is not airborne, he said. It cannot be transmitted via coughs or sneezes. If an infected person is exhibiting symptoms, he or she can transmit the disease via bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. The virus does not die with a patient -- so deceased bodies can transmit the disease. There is no specific treatment for Ebola. Doctors can only administer what they call ""supportive therapy,"" which means supporting the patient's own immune system as it tries to battle the infection. This usually involves intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and shock, said Christopher Mores, associate director of Louisiana State University's Center for Experimental Infectious Diseases. This therapy for Ebola patients could also include blood or platelet transfusions and oxygen therapy. Ebola can last two to three weeks, Mores said, so patients would remain in isolation until their symptoms subside and tests come back negative for the virus.","American aid workers are being evacuated from Liberia .
At least one victim will be brought to Emory University near the CDC .

"Dr. Kent Brantly answered a calling. That's what friends and colleagues say about the man who garnered national headlines when he became the first known Ebola hemorrhagic fever patient in the United States. Brantly, 33, arrived Saturday in Atlanta from Liberia, where he and another American missionary worker contracted the deadly virus while caring for Ebola patients. From an early age, Brantly was driven by his faith in God to make a difference, friends and former colleagues said. He took mission trips to Uganda, Honduras, Nicaragua, Tanzania and Haiti, they said. ""He intended to be a missionary before he became a doctor,"" friend Kent Smith, an elder at Southside Church of Christ in Fort Worth, Texas, told CNN. ""Eventually, he decided medical mission is what he wanted to do."" Brantly went to Liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a two-year fellowship through Samaritan's Purse post-residency program. He was there initially to practice general medicine. But when the Ebola outbreak began, he took on the role of medical director for the Samaritan's Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia. It's there that he tested positive for the virus, according to the evangelical Christian relief charity. There is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola, and it has a mortality rate of up to 90%. iReport: Ebola patient arrives . Brantly is in an isolation ward at Emory University Hospital, near the headquarters for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctor put sick patients first . The news Brantly contracted Ebola has prompted many to ask why would he put himself at risk. The answer might be difficult for some to understand, his former college and medical school professor wrote in an op-ed published this week in The Indianapolis Star. ""Simply put, he would say that he had been called to care for the patients in Liberia,"" Richard Gunderman wrote in the newspaper. Brantly went to Liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a two-year fellowship through Samaritan's Purse post-residency program. Brantly was there initially to practice general medicine. But when the Ebola outbreak began, he took on the role of medical director for the Samaritan's Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia. It's there that he tested positive for the virus, according to the evangelical Christian charity. None of it has been surprising to Smith, who first met Brantly five years ago at church. ""When he first started coming to our church, he and his wife made it clear ... they were committed to medical missions,"" he said. Before heading to Liberia in October 2013, Brantly did his residency at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. 'What do I bring to the table?' ""We're kind of proud that there was a hero out there trying to do his best to make life better for other folks under the circumstances,"" a physician who knows him, Dr. Paul Pepe of Dallas' UT Southwestern Medical Center, told CNN affiliate WFAA this week. Brantly attended high school in Indianapolis before graduating from Abilene Christian University (Texas) in 2003 and Indiana University's medical school in 2009. While at Abilene Christian, he spent a summer interning overseas with a program focused on vocational missions experiences, ACU's online alumni magazine reported. ""Everyone here who has been connected with Kent knows him to be someone who is very compassionate, considerate and always upbeat in all he does,"" the program's director, Dr. Gary Green, told the magazine. ""... Kent's the kind of guy who would weigh benefits versus risk, then try to take himself out of the equation so that he would be thinking, 'What do I bring to the table? Is the risk worth taking because I can benefit so many people?'"" It perhaps may explain why when only one dose of an experimental serum to treat Ebola was made available this week in Liberia that Brantly turned it down and asked that it be given to his colleague. ""I would have been surprised if he had not done that,"" Smith said. In an e-mail this week from Monrovia, Brantly told a fellow doctor at John Peter Smith Hospital that he is ""terrified,"" according to The Indianapolis Star. ""I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease,"" Brantly said in an e-mail to Dr. David McRay, the newspaper reported. Though Brantly's wife and children had been in Liberia with him, they were in the United States when he became ill. ""Many people have been asking how I am doing,"" Amber Brantly said in a statement released earlier this week. ""The children and I are physically fine."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said neither Brantly's wife or his children are symptomatic. Brantly's wife, parents and sister cried when they saw him on CNN, walking from the ambulance into the hospital, a family representative said on condition of anonymity. His wife, Amber, later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the United States. ""I spoke with him, and he is glad to be back in the U.S.,"" she said in statement sent to CNN. ""I am thankful to God for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital."" Brantly's wife visited with him from behind a glass wall for about 45 minutes, the family representative said. Kent Brantly was described as being ""in great spirits and so grateful.""","Report: ""I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive,"" the doctor writes .

"Once known as the deadliest city in the world, the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez deserves a new nickname. The city -- infamous for tales of unsolved murders and gangland shootings -- recorded 750 homicides in 2012, a significant drop from the previous year when 2,086 people were killed. Statistics from the Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office show that Juarez ended 2012 with the fewest killings the city has seen since drug-related violence encapsulated it five years ago. Opinions differ on why the homicide rate has dropped so quickly, but one thing is clear: Juarez is now a city where residents feel safe enough to walk the streets and go out with a relative sense of safety. ""There is no superman, or one person that did all the changes,"" said Arturo Valenzuela, president of the bureau of public safety in Juarez. ""It was a multifunctional process."" Between 2007 and 2011 more than 9,000 people were killed, with the peak coming in 2010, when Juarez saw a record 3,116 homicides, or about 8 murders per day, according to figures released by the attorney general's office. No single factor is responsible for restoring relative tranquility, but a key factor was that for the first time there was a team effort and coordination between local police and civil society organizations, Valenzuela said. ""The players [that helped bring down the violence] have also been leaders of the local police and the politicians,"" he said, referring to new government administrations that came to power during this period. In 2010 Mayor Hector ""Teto"" Murguia took the reins from Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, and the state of Chihuahua also got a new governor. The withdrawal of federal agents -- often accused of corruption -- in 2011 also brought relative calm to Juarez, Valenzuela said. At the same time, the municipal police received better equipment and salaries under new Police Chief Julian Leyzaola. The drop in violence is reflected in the city's economic growth, Murguia said. At least three new high schools and sports facilities opened in 2012, and hundreds of businesses -- including restaurants, nightclubs and grocery stores -- reopened throughout the city, Murguia said. The growth was supplemented by funds earmarked by the administration of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, he said. Murguia credits law enforcement, security specialists and ""no one else"" for the changes in Juarez. But the sentiment among many Juarez residents is more cynical. They say that the bloody turf war between the Sinaloa cartel and the Juarez cartel that was responsible for the carnage has been won by the Sinaloans, led by the world's most wanted drug lord, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. Chihuahua state prosecutor Jorge Gonzalez Nicolas disputed that view, saying that the most important factor in 2012 was the arrests of the heads of local criminal groups, including ""El Diego,"" the head of La Linea, the armed wing of the Juarez cartel. Since October 2010, there were at least 4,000 arrests, including the detention of 250 kidnappers and 200 extortionists, as well as the seizure of 2,500 guns, Gonzalez said. The strides made to improve security in Juarez are noticeable, but the city's homicide rate is still twice as much as it was five years ago. In 2007, there was an average of about 0.82 murders per day. In 2012, there were two murders per day, according to the attorney general's office.","Violence in Juarez has dropped from its peak in 2010 .

Authorities don't credit one single tactic for the reduction in violence .

"Adam Lanza brought three weapons inside Sandy Hook Elementary school on December 14 and left a fourth in his car, police said. Those weapons were a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle and two handguns -- a Glock 10 mm and a Sig Sauer 9 mm. In the car he left a shotgun, about which police have offered no details. Lanza used one of the handguns to take his own life, although police haven't said whether the gun was the Glock or the Sig Sauer. In fact many details remain unknown about the weapons Lanza used that day to kill 20 children, his own mother, six other adults and then himself. Here's what is known so far: . Bushmaster AR-15 rifle . The primary weapon used in the attack was a ""Bushmaster AR-15 assault-type weapon,"" said Connecticut State Police Lt. Paul Vance. The rifle is a Bushmaster version of a widely made AR-15, the civilian version of the M-16 rifle used by the U.S. military.  The original M-16 patent ran out years ago, and now the AR-15 is manufactured by several gunmakers.  Unlike the military version, the AR-15 is a semiautomatic, firing one bullet per squeeze of the trigger.  But like the M-16, ammunition is loaded through a magazine.  In the school shooting, police say Lanza's rifle used numerous 30-round magazines. An AR-15 is usually capable of firing a rate of 45 rounds per minute in semiautomatic mode. Police didn't offer details about the specific model of the rifle Lanza used. A typical Bushmaster rifle, such as the M4 model, comes with a 30-round magazine but can use magazines of various capacities from five to 40 rounds. An M4 weighs about 6 ½ pounds and retails for about $1,300. Under the 1994 federal ban on such weapons, buying some variants of new AR-15s was against the law. The ban expired in 2004. Bushmaster is the No. 1 supplier of AR-15 rifles in the United States, according to the company website. Their weapons are used by more than 100 police departments and by the militaries of 50 nations, according to Bushmaster. Private citizens use them for ""hunting, recreation, competition and home defense and security,"" the website says. Gun control: 'This one feels different' Glock 10 mm handgun . Police haven't said what kind of Glock 10 mm handgun Lanza used. But Glock lists two types on its website, including the Glock 20 and Glock 29. Lanza had ""multiple magazines"" for the Glock, Vance said. Such magazines are widely available. The Glock 20 model has a 15-round magazine. Glock describes it as an ideal weapon for hunting because of its larger bullets, referred to as the ammunition's caliber. The Glock 20 measures nearly 8 ¼ inches long and weighs about 2 ½ pounds when loaded, according to Glock's website. Guns and Ammo magazine said of Glocks: ""They point naturally, their triggers aren't too heavy ... but most importantly of all, they're reliable."" Sig Sauer 9 mm handgun . The other handgun police said Lanza had with him during the school massacre was a Sig Sauer. Authorities didn't say what kind, but possibilities include the P226, P229 or P250, P290, and if it was an older pistol, possibly the P220.  The 9 mm P220 is no longer sold in the United States . Like the Glock, Lanza's Sig Sauer also allowed a high-capacity magazine, Vance said. Lanza used ""multiple magazines"" that are widely available to feed ammunition to the Sig Sauer, Vance said.  Sig Sauer makes 9 mm pistol magazines with a maximum capacity of 20 bullets. And like the Glock, Vance said the Sig Sauer handgun was a semiautomatic. The P226 has a 15-round magazine, measures 7 ¾ inches and costs about $1,142, according to Sig Sauer's website. They can be found cheaper at some gun shops. The Handguns magazine website says of the P226: ""Adopted by the [Navy] SEALs nonetheless, it has proven to be durable, reliable, accurate and adaptable. What it has not had a reputation for is compactness."" Read more: Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns?","Police: Newtown, Connecticut, gunman came to school grounds with four weapons .

"She has said it before. Now she's saying it again. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow has written at length in an essay published in the LA Times about the scenes of torture featured in the movie, insisting once more than ""depiction is not endorsement."" The controversy has dogged the movie for weeks as politicians and pundits attacked the movie, which was based on screenwriter/producer Mark Boal's interviews with intelligence and military sources, for showing CIA agents beating and torturing suspects who later give up information that leads to Osama bin Laden. In the essay, Bigelow declares herself to be a pacifist who abhors the so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" the movie shows, but says she felt obliged to put on screen the gruesome details of what was done in the name of counter-terrorism. An excerpt: . ""First of all: I support every American's 1st Amendment right to create works of art and speak their conscience without government interference or harassment. As a lifelong pacifist, I support all protests against the use of torture, and, quite simply, inhumane treatment of any kind. But I do wonder if some of the sentiments alternately expressed about the film might be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered these U.S. policies, as opposed to a motion picture that brings the story to the screen. Those of us who work in the arts know that depiction is not endorsement. If it was, no artist would be able to paint inhumane practices, no author could write about them, and no filmmaker could delve into the thorny subjects of our time."" This comes at a critical time for the movie, which just opened nationally last weekend, coming in at first place with $24 million at the box office. It's also a strong contender for several Oscars, including best original screenplay for Boal, best actress for star Jessica Chastain, and best picture — although Bigelow was snubbed in the directing category. Her essay in the LA Times expresses things she has already stated several times. ""I'm not sure I have anything new to add, but I can try to be concise and clear,"" she wrote. Can this help at the box office? Does it need to if it's already faring well? Will this satisfy Academy voters who may be troubled by the criticism? We'll see as it plays out. Right now, the only certainty is that sometimes in an echo chamber, you have to repeat yourself.

"Ebola is brutal. Those afflicted often bleed uncontrollably, vomit profusely, lose function of their kidneys and other organs, and -- in over half the cases recently in West Africa -- die. So faced with the prospect of coming face-to-face with this terrible illness at their Atlanta hospital, where its first documented Ebola cases ever are soon set to arrive, what did two nurses do? They canceled their vacation. ""They said, 'We have been training for this,'"" Dr. Bruce Ribner, who heads the Emory University Hospital unit where the two Americans with Ebola will be treated, told CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta -- himself a neurosurgery professor at Emory. ""'We are not going to miss this opportunity to care for this patient."" Online and on street corners, in homes and in businesses, the idea of purposefully bringing Ebola into the United States has rattled the nerves of many. Ebola coming to U.S. for first time . There is lots of evidence of this sentiment on Twitter, where some opined that ""we're being very foolish"" -- and that's one of the kinder remarks. ""Why willingly bring infected ebola victims to this country?"" wrote one woman. ""Why purposely spread the infection?"" But you won't hear that kind of thing at Emory University Hospital. According to Ribner, it's been just the opposite. ""As I came in this morning, I had people congratulating us for accepting these patients."" They know how the virus spreads . Yes, Ebola in the United States is unprecedented.  But that doesn't mean experts don't know anything about it. Talking to reporters Friday, Ribner said that Ebola spreads much like HIV, Hepatitis B or C -- through the transmission of bodily fluids, not by simply being in the same room as someone infected. It's not like someone is contagious the second they are infected. The virus doesn't spread until that person shows symptoms, which typically takes two to 21 days, according to the World Health Organization. Those working at Emory also can take comfort in that they have a unique place -- one of only four such facilities in the United States, according to Ribner -- to treat such a contagious disease. What you need to know . The isolation unit was created 12 years ago in conjunction with experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is based down the street. It features ""special air handling,"" strict protocols on everything and everyone who goes in and out of a patient's room, and other measures to ensure that any potential dangers are contained. Everything is thought out, right down to how visitors can interact with patients. They can be within 1 to 2 inches of each other, looking through a plate-glass window and talking through an intercom. It's a unique facility that's rarely used. Ribner said it was last activated a couple of years ago, when someone came from Angola amid a Marburg virus outbreak. ""It's kind of like an insurance policy,"" the Emory physician said. ""You can complain about the fact that you didn't collect on your ... policy or you can say -- as in this case -- 'Boy, we're lucky we've been supporting you all these years because now we really need you.' And it would be really challenging to develop this on the fly."" Giving the body a chance to fight back . The renowned hospital's wide variety of tools will be put to ample use given how Ebola -- without the existence of any FDA-approved treatments -- will be addressed at Emory: using what Ribner calls ""supportive care."" That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function and taking measures, such as blood transfusions and dialysis, to keep him or her as stable as possible. ""We just have to keep the patient alive long enough in order for the body to control this infection,"" Ribner explained. What the Emory doctor doesn't have, as American patients Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly arrive for treatment at his hospital, is hesitation or trepidation. Ribner told reporters he has ""no concerns"" about his health or that of his colleagues. Another person who also didn't express any worry was Ribner's wife. ""My wife knew when she was getting into when she married an infectious disease doctor... It went fine,"" he said of his conversation with his wife. ""She said, 'Great, that's what you've been dreaming for 12 years.'"" Ebola doctor in Sierra Leone dies .","Two Americans with Ebola are being transported to Atlanta hospital .

"A Mississippi man pleaded guilty Thursday to a federal hate crime charge in connection with a group of young men and teenagers who carried out racial attacks against African-Americans in 2011. Joseph Dominick, 21, from Brandon, entered a guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi, to one count of conspiracy to commit federal hate crimes. Dominick and others began in the spring of 2011 to harass and assault black people in Jackson and the surrounding area, according to the FBI. In one case, Dominick was part of a group that used a slingshot to hurl metal ball bearings at several African-Americans, a statement from the U.S. Department of Justice said. The young men also threw glass beer bottles at black people, the news release said. On June 25, 2011, Dominick attended a party in Puckett, about 45 minutes from Jackson, where members of the group discussed going to the Mississippi capital to find African-Americans to harass, authorities said. While seven white men went in two trucks that night to Jackson, Dominick wasn't among them. James Craig Anderson, 47, a black man, died after he was beaten and run over in the early morning hours of June 26, 2011. The truck was driven by Deryl Dedmon, a member of the group, prosecutors said. Anderson's death became national news after CNN obtained and aired videotape capturing the gruesome murder as it happened. ""We hope that today's guilty plea provides further assurance to the victim's family and to the community that the Department of Justice will leave no stone unturned to find those responsible for these senseless racially motivated attacks,"" said Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez. ""Our investigation is ongoing, and we will continue to pursue those who participated in this violent conspiracy, which culminated in the tragic death of James Craig Anderson."" Four of the men who were there that night pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes in 2012. Dedmon, John Aaron Rice and Dylan Butler, all now around age 20, and 23-year-old William Kirk Montgomery each admitted to conspiracy and violating the 2009 federal hate-crimes law. They face sentences of up to life in prison and $250,000 in fines, federal prosecutors said. Dedmon also pleaded guilty to murder and hate-crime charges in a state court and was sentenced to life in prison.

"Florida A&M University is undertaking reforms to address hazing on and off campus, according to a written response the school put out after a scathing report that alleged it had done too little. It will develop a centralized database to better track complaints and conduct violations, while increasing collaboration with local police, according to the 27-page response submitted Wednesday. The Florida Board of Governors, which manages the state's universities, put out the report after drum major Robert Champion died following a beating he took in November 2011 aboard a school bus after a football game in Orlando, Florida. The hazing was part of a ritual known as ""Crossing Bus C,"" in which pledges attempt to run down the bus aisle while being punched, kicked and assaulted by more senior members of the school's famed marching band. The university has since created staff positions charged with implementing and monitoring FAMU's anti-hazing policy and is expected to provide additional training to school employees. But FAMU also disputed parts of the report that suggested it had not processed certain hazing allegations, and the school said that its judicial affairs office had acted properly. Last month, the school was put on probation for one year over its handling of the November incident.

"I was sitting in the cockpit of my AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter when my division got a desperate call for help. It was August 2004, and I was a part of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Iraq. Insurgents were hitting our troops with mortar rounds. The Marine squad was out of ammunition and couldn't shoot back.  They had just fought a long and fierce battle, supply reinforcements couldn't reach them and they didn't even have any green smoke to mark their position for us. They needed assistance immediately. We took out the enemy target with the last remaining missile on our aircraft. Several months later, I was talking to a Marine. When he found out I flew Cobras, he started to recount an experience he had in Iraq in which a Cobra shot a missile and saved his squad. Turned out, it was the same mission; the missile came from my aircraft. He stared at me and said, ""Ma'am, you saved my life."" Did it matter that the one who fired that missile was a woman, or that she was black and gay? Absolutely not! Fast forward almost 10 years to 2013, and history has been made for women in the military. The ban on women in military combat has been lifted, allowing women to apply for jobs in front-line positions and elite commando units. Opinion: Will infantry men accept women as peers? According to statistics from Women In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation, as of September 2011, there were 214,098 women serving on active duty in the military. While that might sound like a large number, these women make up only 14.6% of all active-duty service personnel. In the Marine Corps, women make up just a little more than 6%. The Pentagon says women have been barred from roughly 237,000 positions, and they will now start looking to qualified women to fill these roles. This is long overdue. The debate the move has raised presents an obvious reality check: Our American community needs to be educated that women are capable of taking on military roles and have done so throughout the nation's history. Women have already proven we can handle ourselves on the front lines. And in recent times, even with the ban on women in combat in place, women have been POWs.  The Lioness Program, the Marine Corps all-female search team, is an example of why we can't accomplish our front line missions without women. The reality of modern warfare is that there are no front lines. Honestly, I am offended by how many times I hear ""women in combat"" and ""lowering standards"" used in the same sentence. True, the average man is physically stronger than the average woman. Standards should not be lowered and women don't want them to be. No one should be in a job where he or she doesn't meet the standards -- not every man, for example is fit to be a Navy SEAL. News: Single mom fought alongside combat troops in Afghanistan . The argument that women in combat will have a negative impact on unit cohesion and morale is the same argument that was used to keep blacks and gays out of the military. At what point do we bring a stop to these ridiculous arguments and address what really matters? Having more women on the battlefield will improve the military's ability to carry out its mission. During my two tours flying helicopters in Iraq, my unit experienced many dangerous and potentially life-threatening scenarios. The ultimate sacrifice wasn't meted out by gender. For those who are against women serving on the front line, know this: Opening up combat roles for women is merely formalizing the reality of what was already happening; it's just opening more roles and opportunities. The bottom line is if you can do the job, you should be out there doing it, whether you're a man or a woman. The military has been a personal journey for me. My grandfather served in World War II and was a Montford Point Marine. My stepdad was a Marine and served three tours in Vietnam, and my father retired as a major from the Army Reserves after 24 years. I love being part of this legacy, and the legacy of service to our great nation. It's time we give women the same opportunity to serve this great country. We're all in this together.","Vernice Armour: In 2004 battle in Iraq, she saved a Marine squad by shooting a missile .

"Everybody knows the Republican Party is basically an all-white bastion, right?  After all, even Colin Powell condemned the ""dark vein of intolerance"" that has flowed through his party since the post-civil rights era political realignment. Now with President Barack Obama leading the Democrats into a second term -- buoyed by overwhelming victory margins among African-Americans and Hispanics -- it's clear the GOP has some serious catching up to do. This is why it might surprise you to hear that Republicans are by far the more diverse party when it comes to statewide elected officials such as senators and governors.  On this front, they leave Democrats in the dust.  And that's why the GOP actually has a greater depth of diversity on their potential presidential bench looking to 2016 and beyond. It's counterintuitive but true.  Numbers don't lie.  Let's start with a look at the governors, the traditional launching pad of presidential ambitions. Among the Republican ranks is Brian Sandoval, the Hispanic governor of Nevada. The 49-year-old former federal judge took on a corrupt conservative incumbent and is now racking up an impressive reform record in his first term. Likewise, there is New Mexico's Gov. Susana Martinez, a former district attorney who remains popular in her state despite an otherwise Democratic tide. How many Hispanic governors do the Democrats have in office? Zero. Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal . America's Indian-American population is fast-growing and successful.  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is one of the nation's most innovative governors, and the former Rhodes scholar is newly committed to making the GOP no longer ""the party of stupid."" If he chooses to run for president in 2016, Jindal could make a major dent in the race and possibly emerge toward the front of the pack.  There is also South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who climbed from the General Assembly to the Governor's Mansion, breaking a number of historical barriers along the way.  In the past two months, she has appointed the first African-American Republican from the South to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction (Tim Scott), and her husband was deployed to Afghanistan. How many Indian-American governors do Democrats have in office? None. Now let's move over the U.S. Senate. The aforementioned Scott just was tapped by Haley to finish out Sen. Jim DeMint's term, making the former congressman the first African-American Republican senator serving since Ed Brooke of Massachusetts in the 1970s. He is also the only black senator of either party. Likewise, the GOP is looking at two young new Hispanic stars in the Senate chamber -- Florida's Marco Rubio and the newly elected Ted Cruz from Texas.  Interestingly, both men are of Cuban descent. Presidential buzz surrounded Rubio almost from the moment he entered office after defeating the sitting governor, Charlie Crist, in a contentious primary.  He has put forward an innovative immigration reform proposal in recent weeks, which could help shape national debate, and he's already decamped to Iowa to speak at a political dinner. Cruz is a former member of the Harvard Law Review who donned the tea party mantle to defeat a powerful sitting lieutenant governor in a primary.  He was born in Canada to an American mother, a fact that hasn't stopped the fast-forward presidential projection.  At the very least, Cruz will be a real force in the Senate for decades to come. On the Democratic side, the only Hispanic senator is New Jersey's Robert Menendez. While in line for the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee, he has been beset by ethical allegations for much of his career, most recently the accusation that federal agents held off from arresting an office intern who was also an undocumented immigrant and registered sex offender until after Menendez's re-election. (Menendez has said he didn't know about any possible delay.) Menendez might have influence, but he is not a charismatic figure.  That's why the Democratic National Convention chose to highlight San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro at its keynote, rather than anyone more senior or nationally known. Bennett: At convention, GOP leaders reflect U.S. diversity . The Republicans' surprising diversity edge when it comes to statewide elected officials cannot erase the very real diversity deficit they face below this level.  In the House of Representatives, often called ""The People's House,"" the disparity is stark. The new 113th Congress is the most diverse in history, but that diversity comes almost exclusively courtesy of the Democratic side of the aisle.  For example, there are 42 African-American members of the House -- all are Democrats. The Hispanic population is comparatively less skewed, with 27 congressional Democrats and eight Republicans.  Among Asian-Americans, we're back to the lopsided totals -- 11 Democrats and no Republicans. It is a historical irony and a barely slumbering scandal that the Party of Lincoln lost its edge on diversity in pursuit of short-term political gain by realigning the Southern states of the former Confederacy in the wake of the Civil Rights bills that conservatives such as Barry Goldwater believed were unconstitutional.  The times when Martin Luther King Jr.'s father, like millions of other African-Americans, was automatically a Republican are a distant memory. But Democrats should not rest on their laurels after Obama.  Their lack of statewide-elected diverse Democrats is striking and could provide an opening for Republicans in the next generation (if conservatives don't keep alienating that community with anti-immigrant rhetoric and legislation). The old stereotypes don't hold when looking at the facts -- Republicans have been quietly making inroads into communities of color, even if that hasn't yet registered in overall voting patterns.  And rising Republican stars such as Rubio, Jindal, Sandoval, Scott, Haley, Cruz and Martinez are reasons for optimism as we look toward the future of American politics.","John Avlon: GOP senators, governors more diverse than Democrats .

"For the first time, the number of active daily visitors checking Facebook on mobile devices is higher than the number of people checking the social network on the Web. Overall, the company says there are 1.06 billion active Facebook users in the world. Of those, 618 million of them are visiting daily and 157 million are doing it from mobile devices. The company's focus on putting mobile first, with new apps and features, is paying off. Facebook is the largest social network in the world, and it was the most-used mobile app across iOS and Android devices in the United States in 2012, according to recent comScore numbers. ""In 2012, we connected over a billion people and became a mobile company,"" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement announcing the fourth-quarter results. This is great news for the company, which is figuring out the best way to make money off all those smartphone and tablet users. Its biggest earner is advertising, which makes up 84% of the company's revenue. The big story this quarter is mobile ads, which the company said accounted for 23% of its ad revenue, a huge leap from the third quarter of last year when it was just 14%. Big companies like Wal-Mart are tapping into Facebook's audience. The retailer served up 50 million mobile ads in the fourth quarter. Facebook also makes some money off social games like Zynga's ""FarmVille,"" which share revenue with the social network. But the company is hoping to move beyond Zynga's games to become the default platform for mobile games from all developers. The company is constantly testing new ways to squeeze cash out of users and partners, with a steady stream of features and ads. Recent smaller projects that are still finding their legs include Facebook Gifts, which lets you buy real and virtual goods for friends, and charging a small fee to send messages to strangers. While ads and visits are taking off on mobile devices, the company's latest big feature is still Web-only. Graph Search, a new advanced search feature that lets you scour your extended network for people based on their likes or profiles, is still in its beta stages and cannot be accessed through mobile apps. Currently the search feature doesn't make money, but Zuckerberg said it could become a meaningful business ""down the line.""","Facebook announced its latest earnings on Wednesday .

"(CNN)Most visitors to Niagara Falls consider it a place for romance. Ice climber Will Gadd thinks of the famous falls as a spot for adventure. There have been countless attempts by daredevils to ride down both parts of Niagara Falls -- the American Falls on the U.S. side and Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. But earlier this week, Gadd made history when he became the first person to climp up the falls. The Canadian ice climber used only ice hooks to scale the frozen cliffs at Terrapin Point, a 147-foot section directly next to Horseshoe Falls. ""I checked out the spot we were thinking of climbing in the summer. You'd be swept away by the torrential downpour then,"" Gadd said on redbull.com. ""On a warm winter (day), there's no climb here."" But on a cold, freezing day in late January, the wall of water is a wall of ice -- the icing is so heavy that the area is closed to tourists during the winter months -- a perfect scenario for Gadd. He clambered up the frozen walls three times, taking about an hour each trip, according to redbull.com. Gadd described the ice as ""unstable"" because it formed in distinct layers of ice and snow, which made the climb more difficult. ""That climb beat me up,"" he said. ""I may have reached the top, but Niagara won the war. At the end of the day I was hypothermic."" Indeed, Gadd's biggest challenges in the climb seemed to be getting really cold and really wet. As he climbed, right next to him 681,750 gallons of water per second surged down Horseshoe Falls. ""I was so close to the water, I could reach out and stick my ice tool in the Niagara Falls,"" Gadd told redbull.com. ""At one point I was behind the water, climbing on ice that froze behind the falls. I got a whole lot of Niagara down my neck!"" Scaling the falls is the latest feat for Gadd, who was recently named a Nat Geo Adventurer of the Year. He's also a three-time gold medalist at the X Games and won the Ice Climbing World Cup, according to his website.

"An effort by the Library of Congress to archive Twitter posts has amassed more than 170 billion tweets, which the library is now seeking to make available to researchers and other interested parties. Created in 1800, the Library of Congress serves as the unofficial library of the United States, as well as being Congress' official research library. In April 2010, the library signed an agreement with Twitter to gain access to all public tweets since the site's founding in 2006. ""Twitter is a new kind of collection for the Library of Congress but an important one to its mission,"" Gayle Osterberg, the library's director of communications, wrote in a blog post. ""As society turns to social media as a primary method of communication and creative expression, social media is supplementing, and in some cases supplanting, letters, journals, serial publications and other sources routinely collected by research libraries."" Osterberg wrote that the library has completed digitally archiving all of the tweets it currently possesses and is now working on how to best make them available to the public. The library already has received about 400 requests from researchers all over the world looking into topics ranging from the rise of citizen journalism to tracking vaccination rates to predicting stock market activity. The archive promises to keep growing fast. Currently, the library is processing roughly 500 million tweets per day, up from about 140 million daily messages in 2011, according to the blog post. Making such a vast database publicly available is proving to be a challenge unto itself, according to the Library of Congress. ""It is clear that technology to allow for scholarship access to large data sets is lagging behind technology for creating and distributing such data,"" library executives wrote last week in a government white paper updating their progress. ""Even the private sector has not yet implemented cost-effective commercial solutions because of the complexity and resource requirements of such a task."" Currently, the library is working on partnerships with the private sector that would at least allow access to the archives in its Washington reading rooms. The Twitter archive might be its biggest and most challenging effort, but it's not the first time the Library of Congress has sought to document the digital world. Since 2000, the library has been collecting pages from websites that document government information and activity. Today, that archive is more than 300 terabytes in size and represents tens of thousands of different sites. The library's entire collection of printed books has been estimated to total about 10 terabytes of data (although staff at the library suspect it's probably more).","Library of Congress has compiled more than 170 billion Twitter messages .

"(CNN)In Uganda, more than 28 million people in the country are without electricity. To put that into perspective, the entire population of the beautiful landlocked east-central African nation is less than 38 million people. To tackle energy poverty, many entrepreneurs are increasingly devising innovative solutions to explore feasible alternative power options. One of them is Rose Twine. Having grown up in both urban and rural areas of Uganda, Twine knew first hand the challenges faced by many homes when it came to cooking a simple meal. A passionate environmentalist, she decided to do something about it. In 2009, she teamed up with her brother to found their Kampala-based company with their flagship product: the ""eco stove."" The siblings' green oven uses a type of volcanic rock combined with solar power to act as the fuel for the kitchen appliance. Cook food, charge your phone . ""The whole point was to ... reduce deforestation, as well as the chores involved in finding firewood for the local person who can't access electricity or gas,"" explains Twine. The stove has an internal air system that helps heat up the volcanic rocks, which are ready to cook when they turn bright red in color. When the device is switched off, the rocks cool and return to their natural state until the next use. Meanwhile, solar panels on the appliance charge up and help provide additional heat to the stove. Alternatively, Twine explains, the appliance can also be used to provide an additional light source, charge cell phones, play a radio or even iron clothes through steaming. At the moment, the most common solid fuels for cooking and heating homes in Uganda are firewood and charcoal, both of which release thick, acrid smoke into the household. This exposes residents to a number of respiratory health problems -- the World Health Organization estimates that 4.3 million people die annually as a result of hazardous household air pollution. As the Ugandan capital of Kampala continues to flourish more people are choosing to relocate to the city. But an increasing population also means more man-made health factors. Societal problems include extra trash and traffic, which in turn add to the worsening air pollution. Outside of the city, in rural areas, the once green and fertile forests are disappearing at an alarming rate. Deforestation has seen the country lose two thirds of its forests between 1990 and 2005 making it harder for villagers to find wood for burning. Twine hopes her product will provide users with immediate environmental, social, health and economic benefits once they have upgraded their existing kitchens with her eco-alternative. Part businesswoman, part eco-warrior . She says: ""Everybody says I want (the eco stove) because charcoal is expensive, firewood is hard to find, electricity is very expensive and its not reliable."" Surrounded by countless families facing these hardships of accessing sustainable energy everyday, Twine made it her mission to provide a reliable fuel source through her social enterprise startup. It's a vision that has proved fairly popular as more Kampala residents adopt this eco-friendly way of cooking. But Twine explains it usually requires a live demonstration of the product to clinch the sale. ""This is a new innovation in the continent that a lot of people need more understanding. It's not something that you can go on TV and say 'this a stove here that will solve all your cooking challenges.' No! ""That's why we are always cooking beans (outside the store). You need a lot of stuff on site to be able to demonstrate for anybody who comes in, because it's not something somebody is going to read about it and say 'a stone that cooks and lasts two years' and believe in it. No -- they want to see."" It's still early days but the sustainable business has seen some local success in promoting renewable energy -- a cause of great importance to Twine. And it's this passion that spurs the environmental entrepreneur onwards. She explains: ""Believe in the dream (and) I think you'll go all the way. Once you believe in it it's easy to transmit the same passion and the same conviction to the person who is going to buy into it. ""Once you believe in what you're doing, don't be distracted and don't even be discouraged."" Read this: African entrepreneurs get billionaire boost .

"(CNN)A telemarketer making a sales call from Las Vegas helped to end a domestic violence situation 900 miles away in Oregon on Wednesday evening, according law enforcement officials. Chamille McElroy of Americare Health & Nutrition placed a call to a woman in Lebanon, Oregon, but instead of a ""hello"" she heard what sounded like a violent struggle on the other end of the line. McElroy alerted her supervisor, Tina Garcia; then her boss Mario Gonzalez, CEO of Americare, stepped in. Gonzalez says he was walking around the sales floor when one of his managers asked him to listen to a call, and what he heard was very traumatic. Call center workers say they heard a woman screaming for her life and yelling ""please don't kill me,"" according to a press release from the Linn County (Oregon) Sheriff's Office. ""It just got progressively worse,"" Gonzalez told CNN affiliate KLAS in Las Vegas. ""We were not going to hang up this phone on the young lady,"" said Garcia. ""As far as I was concerned, the people in that room -- we were the only lifeline."" Gonzalez was about to call Las Vegas police, but decided to look up local Oregon officials. He alerted the Linn County Sheriff's office, which dispatched personnel to check out the home. ""When deputies arrived on scene a female was heard calling for help, while a male voice could be heard saying 'quiet,' "" according to the press release. Deputies reported seeing 33-year-old Walter Warren John Ruck holding a woman from behind when they entered the home. Ruck let go of the woman, who was crying and grasping for air, according to officers. Officials are not releasing the name of the victim. After an investigation, deputies learned the woman claimed she was physically assaulted and smothered with blankets and pillows during the alleged attack. The victim told officials Ruck threatened her with a rifle, shoving the stock of the gun into her chest, according to the press release. She said she feared for her life and was convinced Ruck wanted to kill her and himself. The woman's cell phone was in her back pocket during the attack and she wasn't aware that someone called the police. Gonzalez said the arresting officer called him back to thank him. Deputies credited Gonzales for intervening and possibly saving the woman's life. Ruck was booked into the Linn County Jail on charges of assault, menacing and strangulation. CNN reached out to Ruck's attorney, Mark Heslinga, for comment but has not heard back.","Call center workers in Las Vegas alerted authorities to a possible assault in Oregon .

"(CNN)From leading the fight against colonial rule in Africa to triumphing in major sporting events, Ghanaians have a lot to feel proud of their country. This is after all one of Africa's major economic powerhouses and a country with a rich history that is consistently held up as a successful example of democracy in the continent. Despite its relatively small size and population, Ghana boasts today one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, driven mainly by its substantial natural riches and strong agricultural production. Previously known as the Gold Coast (because of the vast quantities of the precious metal found there), Ghana gained its independence from Great Britain in 1957, becoming the first sub-Saharan nation to break the chains of colonialism. Since then, it has navigated stormy periods of army rule and political uncertainty to emerge in recent decades as a vibrant democracy that has enjoyed several peaceful transitions of power. Over the last six years, Ghana's economy has grown each year by an average of 6%, hitting a record-breaking 15% in 2011. Growth declined in the following years, but in 2015 economists expect the country to post strong growth of around 8%. Unsurprisingly, the west African country has traditionally relied heavily on exporting precious metals and minerals, including aluminum, diamonds and, of course, gold -- Ghana is the continent's biggest gold producer, following South Africa. Another economic driver and big source of income is oil. Since he the discovery of the Jubilee field off the coast of Ghana in 2007, there have been 23 new oil and gas finds. In 2012, oil earned the country $3 billion, while reserves are estimated at around 2 billion barrels. Besides oil and gold, agriculture is a major pillar of Ghana's economy. The sector makes up around 20% of the country's GDP but, more importantly, provides employment for more than 60% of its total workforce. At the heart of this is cocoa. Ghana is the world's second-largest producer, following the Ivory Coast, with the commodity being the country's third export product, below oil and gold. Yet, lately the Ghanaian government has stepped up its efforts to diversify the economy, pushing for more vegetable production to help boost growth. Last year, the country exported more than 42,000 tonnes of vegetables, up nearly four times compared to 2009. Currently, the vegetable industry pumps almost $3 million into the country annually, but with continued investment in local farms and crops that figure is expected to jump to more than $25 million each year.

"(CNN)An American pastor imprisoned in Iran has written a letter to President Barack Obama, thanking Obama for meeting with his wife and children last week in Idaho. Saeed Abedini, who was born in Iran and whose family home is now in Idaho, relayed the letter of gratitude through his father during one of his sanctioned weekly 20-minute visitor sessions. ""Thank you again for standing up for my family and I and for thousands of Christians across the world who are persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ,"" Abedini wrote. In 2009, Abedini was arrested in Iran and later released after formally pledging to stop organizing churches in homes. He returned to Iran in 2012 to help build a state-run secular orphanage. It was during this visit that he was abruptly pulled from a bus and imprisoned. Over the last two-and-a half years, Abedini has endured beatings and torture at the hands of his jailers and fellow inmates, according to his family. At one point, reports circulated regarding death threats targeting Abedini from ISIS prisoners held at the same Iranian facility. ""President Obama, you have my prayers from inside of these walls,"" Abedini wrote. ""I pray for God's guidance, wisdom and blessing for you as you lead this great nation."" Abedini's letter to Obama was posted online by the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), an organization founded by television evangelist Pat Robertson that has worked to publicize Abedini's situation. In the letter, Abedini thanked Obama for meeting with his wife, Naghmeh Abedini, and their children in Boise, Idaho on January 22. ""They have had a heavy burden to carry in my absence, and your presence helped to relieve some of that burden,"" Abedini wrote. ""With this meeting I feel more hopeful now; it's becoming a higher priority,"" said Naghmeh Abedini. The 10-minute face-to-face meeting with the President was ""an answer to my prayers,"" she added. ""The meeting took place in a personable and intimate setting. The kids were there and I saw a lot of compassion and care as we talked,"" Naghmeh Abedini said. The Abedinis have two children, Rebekka, and Jacob, both under the age of 8. Jacob asked Obama if he would be able to bring his father home in time for an upcoming birthday, according to the Abedini family. Sharing some words of comfort, the President responded that he would try. ""I could see that he cared as a father,"" said Naghmeh Abedini. During their meeting, the President reassured Naghmeh Abedini that her husband's case was a high priority. He told her that he and Secretary of State John Kerry meet regularly regarding the issue, and Kerry continues to bring up Abedini and to push for his release in ongoing meetings with the Iranians. Naghmeh Abedini said Obama promised her the United States will ""keep at it until Saeed is released."" The Abedini family has been fighting for his release for the last three years. Earlier this month, the Obama administration called for Abedini's immediate release, along with other Americans held in Iran, including Washington Post Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian. In a subsequent briefing, White House press secretary Josh Earnest emphasized that the issue of American citizens imprisoned in Iran is of great concern for the administration. The fact that Kerry raised the issue in his diplomatic exchanges with the Iranians ""is an indication of how seriously the United States takes this case,"" said Earnest. Abedini continues to be denied adequate medical attention for injuries, said Tiffany Barrans, International Legal Director for the ACLJ. ""It's not that they haven't given him any treatment. It's that they continue to give him medications that have not helped and doctors' medical tests have concluded surgery is necessary,"" Barrans said. Despite their grueling emotional journey, Abedini family members say they continue to hold on to hope as they make headway in bringing increased attention to Saeed Abedini's story, both in the United States and internationally. Since meeting the President, Naghmeh Abedini said she has received follow-up calls from the White House and is set to meet with U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom David N. Saperstein at the end of February.","""President Obama, you have my prayers from inside of these walls,"" Saeed Abedini wrote .

"(CNN)Oregon State University's main library just went viral, and not because of its state-of-the-art computer lab. A 19-year-old woman was cited Tuesday evening for allegedly using the university library at the campus in Corvallis, Oregon, as a backdrop to shoot an adult video last year. The woman was cited for public indecency and released, according to Steve Clark, Oregon State vice president of university relations. She is not a current student but attended the school for the 2014 fall term. The former student's name was not released by the school, but an Oregon State Police log says that 19-year-old Kendra Jane Sunderland of Corvallis was cited for public indecency in connection with a video posted to a pornographic site along with the claim that it was shot in an Oregon State library. The log says the performer in the video engaged in a ""solo act."" The misdemeanor charge could bring up to one year in jail and a $6,250 fine. CNN's attempts to reach Sunderland for comment weren't immediately successful. Clark said the university learned about the video Tuesday afternoon. Officials believe the video, which was published on the popular adult website Pornhub.com, was filmed in October on the sixth floor of OSU's Valley Library. ""The university does not condone such behavior. This type of behavior does not represent the values of the university. And it definitely does not represent the values of the more than 30,000 students and 5,000 employees that make up Oregon State University,"" said Clark. Valley Library occupies more than 340,000 square feet and is routinely patrolled by members of the Department of Public Safety and Oregon State Police troopers as well as by two security guards, who patrol the library during overnight hours.​ .","A former student allegedly films porn in the Oregon State University library .

"Among Republican insiders, Bob McDonnell, governor of Virginia, isn't considered a leading presidential contender. Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan and Rand Paul have all garnered more attention. The more interesting question has been -- until this week, at least -- why that is the case. McDonnell has the virtue of not only having won a gubernatorial race in one of America's most important swing states but of having remained relatively popular. A new Quinnipiac University survey found that McDonnell had an approval rating of 53% and a disapproval rating of 28%. And though Virginia bars its governors from seeking a consecutive second term, there is a better than even chance that McDonnell would defeat Terry McAuliffe, the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee, if he were allowed to run in 2013. The same can't be said of tea party stalwart Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican attorney general who is running to succeed McDonnell. Moreover, McDonnell's 2009 campaign was in many respects an excellent template for a national GOP campaign, as it focused on job creation and energy development while largely avoiding ideological bromides. Part of the reason McDonnell was able to run as jobs-centric pragmatist is that his socially conservative convictions were not in serious dispute. Indeed, Democrats in 2009 sought to highlight McDonnell's anti-abortion views, but to no avail. Just one year after Barack Obama had rallied moderate voters in Virginia's affluent northern counties, McDonnell managed to win many of them back. He aggressively courted Asian-American and Latino voters, an effort that helped blunt the growing Democratic advantage in these constituencies. One would think Republicans would be beating down McDonnell's door. But recently, many conservative activists have soured on McDonnell. For much of 2012, the Virginia governor has struggled to make progress on his policy agenda. Progress in some areas, like K-12 education, has been overshadowed by inaction in others, like the privatization of Virginia's state-owned liquor stores or the all-important issue of alleviating traffic congestion. Last week, however, McDonnell finally brokered a deal with the Virginia General Assembly to finance a sharp increase in new transportation spending with new taxes. This is despite the fact that McDonnell had pledged to resist any and all tax increases in his 2009 campaign. McDonnell has touted the potential benefits of the deal, emphasizing the economic costs of traffic congestion and the enormous gains that would flow from reducing it. But the tax increases have met with strong opposition from Cuccinelli, whom McDonnell has endorsed, and Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform and guardian of its Taxpayer Protection Pledge. This reaction is hardly surprising. Virginia's new transportation plan scraps the commonwealth's $0.175-per-gallon tax on gasoline, the value of which has eroded with inflation since it was first set at that rate in 1987, and replaces it with a 3.5% whole tax on motor fuel that will grow with the economy and the price level. It also raises Virginia's retail sales tax on most items from 5% to 5.3%, with a further increase to 6% in the most traffic-congested regions to pay for local transportation projects. All told, these new revenue measures will raise as much as $880 million per year, with an additional $200 million to be shifted to transportation from other spending priorities. Not everyone is furious about McDonnell's measure that would increase taxes. Some prominent voices, including Washington Post conservative commentator Jennifer Rubin and Washington Post columnist Robert McCartney, have praised the governor for addressing Virginia's transportation woes. One wonders whether McDonnell might somehow be able to turn a liability -- having reneged on his tax pledge -- into a strength by presenting himself as a pragmatic, bipartisan problem-solver. It's a long shot, given that primaries tend to be dominated by highly ideological voters. But it might be worth a shot all the same, particularly if the Republican presidential field proves thinner than expected in 2016.","Reihan Salam: Gov. Bob McDonnell isn't a leading GOP presidential contender .

"Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has said more could be done to reach out to the militant Islamist group Boko Haram to find out what leads it to carry out acts of violence. In an interview with CNN, Obasanjo suggested the current government should adopt a dual-track approach rather than just cracking down on the group. Read more: Gunmen attack Nigerian police station, kill 4 . ""To deal with a group like that, you need a carrot and stick. The carrot is finding out how to reach out to them,"" he said. ""When you try to reach out to them and they are not amenable to being reached out to, you have to use the stick."" Obasanjo said President Goodluck Jonathan was ""just using the stick"" in his efforts. ""He's doing one aspect of it well, but the other aspect must not be forgotten."" Read more: Nigerian forces kill 13 Boko Haram militants after church attacks . The Islamist militants, who operate chiefly in Nigeria's restive north, have carried out numerous deadly attacks on mosques, churches and businesses and are suspected of having links to al Qaeda. Obasanjo said he had tried to reach out to Boko Haram about a year and a half ago through a lawyer who was acting as the group's proxy, and had asked if they had external backing. The lawyer told him that the group was receiving support from other Nigerians who have resources overseas or ""other organizations from abroad,"" Obasanjo said. Read more: 22 killed in three attacks in Nigeria . ""If they had 25% support a year and a half ago, today that support has doubled,"" the former president said. Analysts suggest that reaching out to Boko Haram may be increasingly difficult because the group has split into different factions, some with a domestic focus and others with a more pan-jihadi approach. Resolving the issue is key to Nigeria's progress, according to Obasanjo, who now heads an eponymous foundation that is working to promote human security across Africa. ""Boko Haram undermines security, and anything that undermines security undermines development, undermines education, undermines health, undermines agriculture and food and nutrition security,"" he said. International rights group Human Rights Watch says Boko Haram has killed more than 2,800 people. Read more: Boko Haram terror designation plan misses point . In a report published late last year, Amnesty International condemned the increasingly brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009, but said Nigeria's security forces ""have perpetrated serious human rights violations"" in response. A military spokesman rejected the allegations. The militant group, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" is fighting to impose a strict version of Sharia law in the northern part of the country. In the past, the group attacked other Muslims it felt were on an immoral path, but it has increasingly killed Christians. The U.S. State Department has accused Boko Haram of attacking mosques and churches to incite tensions between the two religious groups, hoping to drive a wedge between them. It has condemned some of the group's leaders for alleged ties to al Qaeda. Nigeria has almost equal numbers of Christian and Muslims, with the south predominantly Christian. Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of Jonathan, a Christian. Report: Nigeria guilty of abuses in pursuing Boko Haram militants . However, despite the ongoing challenges the country faces, Obasanjo said he does not foresee Nigeria ever splitting in two, into north and south.

"As a tide of Sunni militant fighters sweeping toward Baghdad threatens the government of Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a flood of refugees sought safety in the autonomous region of Kurdistan. At one checkpoint in northern Iraq, CNN's Arwa Damon witnessed a bumper-to-bumper procession of cars and trucks fleeing from Mosul and surrounding villages. A virtual parking lot of vehicles filled with woman and young children, the two-lane road was choked with dust and engine exhaust as Iraqi civilians fled the rapid advance of the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS. ""Mosul has fallen to the terrorists,"" one young man told CNN. ""It's fallen to al Qaeda."" That unraveling began in earnest on Tuesday as Iraqi security forces fled and militants overran Iraq's second-largest city in a stunning collapse that heightened questions about  al-Maliki's ability to control not only Mosul, but the entire country. Militants seized Mosul's airport, TV stations, the governor's office and other parts of the northern Iraqi city. There also were incursions into the oil refining town of Baiji. Fighting alongside ISIS militants are other Sunni insurgent groups active during the U.S. invasion of Iraq that believe in fighting the Shia dominated government and its perceived anti-Sunni agenda, though they don't subscribe to ISIS's ideology or the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. But this is much more than a battle between an insurgency and a government. Much of the lands that have fallen to ISIS and its current allies is predominantly Sunni, where much of the population despises al-Maliki and his Shia-dominated government's polarizing policies. It's a battle of survival between Sunni and Shia contingents. Additionally, Shia religious leaders and others have called for volunteers to join Iraqi security forces in the fight. Numerous reports of police and soldiers running from their posts in Mosul -- leaving uniforms, vehicles, weapons and ammunition behind -- raised the prospect that the Iraqi government did not either have the will or resources to combat the advancing threat. ""They have melted down, unfortunately,"" Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said of a video purporting to show hundreds of Iraqi forces captured by militants in Tikrit, hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein. ""I mean, two army divisions in the city and their commanders escaped to the north. The government needs to take serious action."" On Friday, President Barack Obama said the United States ""will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,"" but that he would be reviewing a range of other options in coming days. Pressure for the United States to provide military support to Iraq's struggling government has increased, with conservative Republicans blaming Obama for the crisis by pulling out U.S. troops in 2011 to create a security vacuum. The conflict could potentially escalate with reports that Iranian special forces were in Iraq to bolster the government of al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite. Iran rejected that claim. At the northern Iraqi border crossing, families waiting in traffic described relative calm streets on streets where militant gunman roamed. Running water and gasoline were available, they said, but their biggest concern was airstrikes by the Iraqi military. One such airstrike came against a former Iraqi military base south of Mosul where ISIS militants were believed to the staying. There also were warnings from Baghdad for residents to stay away from government buildings. On Friday, Iraqi State TV reported that military airstrikes had killed 70 ISIS militants and wounded 40 others in Tikrit. At the border crossing between Mosul and Iraqi Kurdistan, some returning refugees explained their willingness to come back by noting that ISIS had not conducted mass executions or pillaged towns. A few hours later, however, ISIS published ""rules"" for residents based on a strict interpretation of Sharia law. A spokesman for the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights reported summary executions of Iraqi security forces and of 17 civilians thought to be working for the police in Mosul.","Iraqi civilians flee toward Kurdistan region .

"A Colorado school has caused a stir with an advisory that suggested women could urinate or vomit to deter a rape. The list of 10 tips by the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs was billed as ""last resort"" options to deter a sexual assault. ""Tell your attacker that you have a disease or are menstruating,"" read one tip. ""Vomiting or urinating may also convince the attacker to leave you alone,"" read another. By Tuesday night, the list was taken down and replaced by an explanation and an apology. But it was too late. The backlash had hit the Internet, and a hashtag on Twitter was created. Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was one of many who criticized the eyebrow-raising list using the hashtag #UCCSTips. ""New #UCCSTips for women: If vomiting or urinating doesn't deter your attacker, try passing gas,"" Malkin tweeted. ""#UCCSTips or if all else fails, ask attacker to pull your finger!"" Jason Griggs  tweeted. Police: Man raped woman he met on Christian dating website . Some women on the Colorado campus said they were confused by the list. ""Tell your attacker you have a disease or menstruating? I don't understand how that will keep someone from attacking you,"" student Leah McFann told CNN affiliate KRDO. Some on campus also wondered why the list did not emphasize more conventional ways of fighting back. Tom Hutton, a spokesman for the university, said the list had been taken out of context. ""It was part of supplemental information intended for women who had completed a self-defense class on campus,"" Hutton told KRDO. Gang rape victim fights back for girls' education . Hutton said the list was created in 2006 but may have resurfaced because the issue of rape on campus had been in the news recently in Colorado. Last week, Colorado lawmakers debated legislation that would ban firearms in college campus buildings. The debate made headlines after Democratic State Rep. Joe Salazar made controversial statements about ways to protect women on campuses. ""Because you just don't know who you are going to be shooting at,"" Salazar said last week. ""If you feel like you're going to be raped or if you feel like someone's been following you around or if you feel like you're in trouble and when you may actually not be -- that you pop out that gun and you pop-pop a round at somebody.

"The future of space travel will depend on our ability to make rockets that can be used more than once, says SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. And on Saturday, he gave a crowd at the South by Southwest Interactive festival the world's first look at a step in that direction. Musk, whose SpaceX Dragon is currently docked on the International Space Station, showed a packed exhibit hall a two-day-old video of Grasshopper, an experimental rocket. If fully realized, the rocket would propel spacecraft out of the earth's atmosphere, then flip around, sprout landing gear and return intact to the launch pad. In the video, a 10-story-high Grasshopper rocket did just that -- except for the leaving-the-atmosphere part. It blasted off, hovered, and then set itself down at virtually the same spot where it began. The video, with its Johnny Cash ""Ring of Fire"" soundtrack, drew cheers from the crowd. Friday wasn't the first time Grasshopper has left the ground, but it was the most ambitious test to date, Musk said. ""With each successive test, we want to go higher and further,"" he said. Musk, a festival keynote speaker, made his fortune as the founder of Paypal. From there, he's taken on private spaceflight as CEO of SpaceX, electric vehicles as CEO and chief designer of Tesla Motors, and solar energy as chairman of Solar City. ""Elon may be the planet's most exciting entrepreneur,"" said SXSW Interactive director Hugh Forrest. Historic launch of private rocket heralds new era . During a question-and-answer session with ""3D Robotics"" editor-in-chief Chris Anderson, Musk said that affordable commercial space travel will never be possible with the current model, which relies on single-use booster rockets. ""Every mode of transportation we're used to ... they're all reusable, but not rockets,"" Musk said. ""If we can't make rockets reusable, the cost is just prohibitive."" He said a reusable rocket could make space launches 100 times cheaper. The price of fuel, oxygen and the like for a launch currently amounts to just a fraction of 1% of its overall cost, he said. Musk also recounted the stressful moments around last week's launch of the unmanned Dragon cargo vessel, which linked up with the Space Station last Sunday. ""It's extremely nerve-wracking,"" he said. ""The thing about a rocket launch is that all your work is distilled into these few minutes, especially the few seconds before liftoff."" The Dragon mission had some extra nail-biting moments. Once in space, three of its four thruster pods malfunctioned. Engineers were able to write new code and beam it to the capsule and ""pressure slam"" oxygen into tanks that had failed to oxidize. ""We were sort of trying to give it the spacecraft equivalent of the Heimlich maneuver,"" he said. ""It was hardcore. I don't want to go through that again."" Musk also confirmed that, while he's in Texas, he's meeting with state lawmakers about the possibility of building a commercial launch site in the state. Currently, SpaceX -- which both works alongside NASA and counts the agency among its clients -- launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, which are both government sites. Musk said Texas is the leading candidate for the launch site and that, if things go smoothly, construction could begin as early as next year.","Elon Musk: Commercial space flight won't be affordable without reusable rockets .

"Remember ""peak oil""? Five years ago, some oil market speculators became convinced that the world was nearing the limits of oil production. Sometime soon -- the 2010s? the 2020s? -- oil production would begin a long steady decline. Think again. World oil production continues to rise. Leading the oil renaissance: the United States. The International Energy Agency predicts that the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to become (again!) the world's leading oil producer by 2017. If the agency's estimates prove correct, the United States and Canada together will become net energy exporters by about 2030, and the U.S., which uses 20% of the world's energy, will achieve energy self-sufficiency by the mid-2030s. Predictions that the world would imminently ""run out of oil"" have been worrying oil consumers since at least the 1920s. They always prove wrong, for reasons explained by the great oil economist M.A. Adelman after the last ""oil shortage"" in the 1970s: . Oil reserves, Adelman writes, ""are no gift of nature. They (are) a growth of knowledge, paid for by heavy investment."" For all practical purposes, the world's supply of oil is not finite. It is more like a supermarket's supply of canned tomatoes. At any given moment, there may be a dozen cases in the store, but that inventory is constantly being replenished with the money the customers pay for the cans they remove, and the more tomatoes that customers buy, the bigger an inventory the store will carry. Someday, of course, consumers will decide they want less oil at the current price. Someday we may move beyond oil altogether. When that day comes, the investment will stop -- and nobody will ever know or care how much oil remains in the ground. Adelman's assessment is being corroborated once more, this time in Mexico. Mexican oil production has been declining over the past decade, mostly because of under-investment and mismanagement by the state oil monopoly, Pemex. (On January 31, a deadly tragedy reminded the world of Pemex's troubles when a methane leak in a Pemex building in downtown Mexico City exploded, killing more than 30 people and injuring 120 others.) In October, Pemex announced discovery of a big new field in the Gulf of Mexico. Newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is urging his country to amend its constitution to allow foreign investment in Mexican oil fields. Experts assess that opening the Mexican oil industry to global investment will revive Mexican oil production and boost Mexico's economic growth by potentially 2 points a year. Nieto's PRI party -- the very party that nationalized Mexican oil 80 years ago -- is expected to vote this weekend to approve the new policy. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency is warning oil markets to ready themselves for a ""flood"" of cheap oil from Iraq. Last year, Iraq for the first time exceeded pre-1990 oil production. The agency expects Iraq eventually to overtake Russia as the world's second-largest oil exporter. In 1972, the year of the famous ""Limits to Growth"" report by the Club of Rome, the world produced about 55 million barrels of oil per day. In 2011, the world produced almost 80 million barrels. If today's prices hold, many experts expect production of 90 million barrels by decade's end. Our oil problem is not that ""we're running out."" Our oil problem is that we're producing so much of the stuff that we are changing the planet's climate. Yet on the environmental front too, there's reason for optimism. One of the technologies developed by the oil industry -- fracking -- has made available vast new supplies of cheap natural gas. Gas has become so cheap that it can be substituted for coal as an electricity-generating fuel. In just eight years, coal's share of the U.S. electricity market has tumbled from one-half to one third -- and still falling. Gas emits only half the carbon per unit of energy of coal. The transition from coal to gas explains why U.S. carbon emissions declined 8% from 2011 to 2012, reaching the lowest level since 1992. Soon the United States and Canada will be producing so much gas that they can export it to Europe, perhaps also to China, helping to cut carbon emissions in those economies as well. No, it's not the answer to everything: Gas still emits carbon. But it's an improvement -- and that's how progress comes. Instead of fantasizing about catastrophes (running out of oil) and miracles (a rapid transition to solar power), our energy thinking needs to emphasize the achievable and the incremental. Convert from coal to gas. Tax gasoline to induce people to live closer to work and to buy more fuel-efficient cars. We can enjoy a rising quality of life with declining energy inputs. Put us on the path to the right kind of ""peak oil"" -- and peak carbon -- the peak that comes, not because we find less and less, but because we want less and less.","Five years ago, speculators predicted that oil production was peaking .

"First a meteor exploded over Russia, followed closely by an asteroid fly-by. Now, two comets are expected to put on a naked-eye spectacle for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere. Up first is Comet Pan-STARRS, which gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001: the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii. The comet is already visible through telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere, and it should swing into view over the Northern Hemisphere beginning around March 8. It's hard to predict exactly how bright Pan-STARRS will be, but you should be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes, said Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program. It should be about as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper. Science Seat: Don Yeomans . ""There is a chance that it will be a little brighter than this, but likewise, it might not get quite that bright,"" said Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab. Graphic: How to tell space rocks apart . Part of the brightness will depend on how close Pan-STARRS gets to the sun. Comets are made up of water, ice, dust and other elements and minerals, all loosely packed together, Battams said. As a comet gets closer to the sun, the sun's heat causes these elements to melt, spewing out dust and gas in a brilliant tail. ""The closer it gets, the more intense the radiation and the more elements will be melted,"" he said. Pan-STARRS is expected to get fairly close to the sun. That's bad news for the comet, but it could be a boon for sky watchers if the comet is brighter and easier to see. Pan-STARRS also could fall apart and fizzle. But if it survives its sunbath, we should be able to see it low on the horizon in the western sky for a couple of weeks, Battams said. ""About half an hour after sunset would be a good time for people take a look,"" he said. Here are some key dates: . March 5: Pan-STARRS will be closest to Earth; . March 10: The comet will pass closest to the sun; . March 12 and 13: The best dates to look for Pan-STARRS; it should emerge in the western sunset sky not far from the crescent moon. Battams has these viewing tips: . 1) Safety first: Don't try to look at the comet until the sun sets. Do not look at the sun using regular binoculars or telescopes. Ever! You'll burn up your eyes. 2) Comet Pan-STARRS will stay close to the horizon, so you'll need to get away from trees and buildings. 3) Look carefully! The sky will still be bright at dusk, which can make it hard to spot comets. 4) If the skies are clear, and you are away from city light pollution, you may be able to see the comet with your bare eyes. If not, use binoculars. 5) If you can't escape the city, try using binoculars. Second chance to catch a comet . If your quest to see the first comet doesn't pan out -- get it? (OK, that's bad) -- we might get to see a better comet later in 2013: Comet ISON. ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012. It's named after their night-sky survey program, the International Scientific Optical Network. Some early comet prognosticators -- and reporters -- have tagged ISON ""the Comet of Century."" But Yeomans isn't buying it just yet. He remembers being duped by another comet with that same moniker. In 1973, Kohoutek was hyped, too, and it fizzled. ""Predicting the behavior of comets is like predicting the behavior of cats -- can't really be done,"" he said. So here is the hype on ISON: On November 28, it is expected to dive into the sun's atmosphere. If it survives, it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight. Its tail might stretch far across the night sky. Battams is optimistic, but he said we won't know until late summer what to expect from ISON. ""I'll be surprised if we don't have a bright comet this fall and/or winter, but it's still just too early to speculate,"" he said. So, like Pan-STARRS, ISON's fate will be decided by the sun. It could burn brightly and earn that ""Comet of the Century"" title; it could melt or it could just break apart. Scientists say neither comet poses any threat to Earth, but if both comets hold together, sky watchers will get a rare treat: two comets, both bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, in one year. Fingers crossed! More space and science news from CNN Light Years .","Comet Pan-STARRS will swing into view over the Northern Hemisphere beginning March 7 .

"Serena Cervantes has been struggling to earn her bachelor's degree for seven years. With tuition for two courses at her California university demanding $2,300, it's not the workload that has her putting off the final class she needs to graduate in May. Money is tight. The 25-year-old has worked as a maid and retail clerk to make ends meet, but she says that dating the men she encounters on Sugardaddie.com has proved to be a more lucrative endeavor. ""I've had a hard time finding jobs and keeping jobs,"" she said. ""I thought this would be a good way for me to have a relationship with someone and also make it, as these sites all say, mutually beneficial."" Cervantes is just one of many students who've sought out sugar daddies online in a time of need. Dating site SeekingArrangement.com, which connects wealthy men with women looking for financial support, reports that female college students made up 44% of the site's total users in 2012. With tuition on the rise, that number will likely continue to climb. While some may compare the practice to prostitution or question the morality of trading money and gifts for affection, the people who use these sites contend that they're merely a conduit for both parties getting what they want. What's the draw? Men who engage in such relationships, many of whom are older and married, enjoy taking care of young women and assuming a mentor role in their lives, said Steven Pasternack, who launched Sugardaddie.com in 2002. ""You have some guys who like to spoil and pamper their women by taking them out to nice dinners, buying them gifts. Some maybe help with the utility bills or take them on trips,"" Pasternack added. ""And there are other guys that will have an ongoing relationship in which they'll say, 'OK, I'll give you an allowance and you can put this toward whatever your needs are.' "" The average monthly ""allowance"" sugar daddies on the site said they shell out is $3,000, according to SeekingArrangement.com. So what do these ""sugar daddies"" get in return for all their generosity? Surprisingly, sex isn't a given. It's obviously on the table, says Cervantes, but there are other motivations. ""Some of them just wanted to go out to eat,"" she said. ""Some of them just wanted someone to talk to. Some of them just said outright, 'Can we (have sex) for this amount of money?' And I've said no."" But she admits that sex ups the ante -- if a sugar baby consents to an intimate relationship, she's likely to get more gifts out of her benefactor. ""If you look at the language of various state statutes, the terms of many of the relationships fall under the definition of prostitution,"" said New Jersey attorney Alex Miller, who has studied ""sugar dating."" Authorities shy away from prosecuting sugar websites and their users because the relationships can mirror a typical romance, Miller said. Plus, users are savvy enough not to broadcast online whether they're trading sex for cash. Sex isn't the only motivator for sugar daddies, according to Brandon Wade, the founder and CEO of SeekingArrangement.com. Some also want to help a struggling young woman. Wade, 42, (who met his wife, 27, on the site) said most of the men on the site begin communication with potential sugar babies by asking them why they're looking for a sugar daddy. He's found that women who say they need money to pay for school get asked out more often than those who admit they want cash for breast implants, for instance. While most of the sugar daddies Cervantes has met through the website prefer to arrange a per-date per diem, one married man wrote her a check for $1,600 to go toward her tuition and rent after their monthlong courtship. She said she prefers dating married men because they tend to be more paternal and offer a steadier source of income than single men. Is it prostitution by another name? SeekingArrangement.com's Wade said the men who subscribe to his site are discouraged from offering money on a per-date basis to avoid operating like an escort service. By crosschecking users' photos with those on Craigslist.com and Backpage.com, as well as monitoring conversations between members, Wade says he is able to weed out the escorts posting on his site. Atlanta-based criminal defense attorney Bernard Brody said there's no crime in paying someone solely for his or her companionship. ""The crime is when you pay someone to engage in sexual conduct,"" he added. Read more: Pimps hit social networks to recruit underage sex workers . Kimberly Mackey, who attends college in the South, says she had one Sugardaddie.com suitor pay her $500 to have lunch with him. She said she doesn't consider herself a prostitute because she doesn't have sex with most of the men she meets through the site. The 23-year-old started engaging in relationships with older, wealthy men after moving away from home at 18. An older colleague saw she was having trouble supporting herself, so he started inviting her on golf trips with his friends and buying her gifts. The man told her, ""You're only going to be young and hot for so long. Take advantage of it while you can."" Mackey got used to the perks. She said sugar daddies have offered her cars, vacations and apartments, but she prefers cash. Why go the sugar route? Atlanta-based licensed mental health therapist Harrison Davis said sugar relationships are all about power and youth. On one hand, he said, these relationships remind the men of a more carefree time in their own lives. On the other hand, there's a great sense of control. ""They can take things away and limit the amount of money they're going to spend on the young lady. They can steer (the relationship) into any direction they want to."" Though Mackey says she's not ashamed of her unconventional part-time job, she doesn't make a habit of telling everyone about it. When her mother asks how she can afford to not work, she says her ex-boyfriend helps her pay her credit card bills, which some people might consider a sugar relationship in its own right. Cervantes, on the other hand, said her relationship with a family member suffered after she opened up about her experience dating sugar daddies: ""He said, 'You're selling your body online.'"" Despite Cervantes' qualms about accepting money in exchange for her companionship, she has no plans to deactivate her account anytime soon. She said she doesn't have parents who can help her pay for school, so she relies on the kindness of wealthy men out of desperation. Without the extra income, Cervantes said she'd be back at the homeless shelter she lived in for three months in 2009. ""In my heart of hearts I don't really like the situation,"" Cervantes said. ""Right now it's a survival mechanism."" Sugardaddie.com's Pasternack said the relationship between a sugar baby and sugar daddy is all about perspective. ""I helped my wife get through school, I pay for the bills, take her on trips, buy her nice gifts,"" he said. ""I guess you could say a lot of married guys are sugar daddies without them realizing it. I think you can say basically any guy who wants to impress a woman is a sugar daddy.""","Serena is one of many college students who've sought out sugar daddies in a time of need .

"Before we had ""16 and Pregnant,"" push-up bras for tweens or mandatory sex education, girls like Donna Liska-Johnson learned about the birds and the bees from author Judy Blume. Liska-Johnson was 11 years old when her aunt gave her a copy of Blume's breakthrough novel, ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret."" She formed an instant bond with 12-year-old Margaret Simon who, like her, was embarking upon puberty at a time when people didn't talk openly about boys, bras and periods. She had finally found someone she could relate to. ""I would close my door and the world would fall away,"" she said. Blume's first-person narrative ""always connected me with the character because she wrote so close to the heart."" Believe it or not, it's been nearly 43 years since ""Are You There God?"" jump-started Blume's prolific career, which changed the way a generation of readers learned about menstruation, masturbation and sex, among other growing pains. Though she's had her critics over the years, Blume, who turned 75 this year, can still draw a crowd in this latest chapter of her career, which includes a forthcoming novel and the first major motion picture adaptation of one of her novels -- and it's not ""Are You There God?"" ""Tiger Eyes,"" which opened June 7, may not be Blume's most popular book, but it's the one she and son Lawrence Blume (the inspiration for Fudge) had always wanted to bring to the big screen. Both said they felt a strong connection to lead character Davey Wexler, a teen whose mother uproots her from New Jersey to visit relatives in New Mexico after her father is killed in an armed robbery. Plus, it was the only novel they could film in 23 days on a budget that only allowed them to cast three professional actors from outside New Mexico, said Lawrence Blume, who directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with his mother. Still, they managed to pull together a strong cast that included Willa Holland, best known for her roles in the OC and Gossip Girl and former pink Power Ranger Amy Jo Johnson. American Indian activist Russell Means was cast as the father of Wolf, who is played by Means' real-life son, actor Tatanka Means. Even Blume and her husband, the film's executive producer George Cooper (who she met while writing the book, dedicating it to him), have cameos. Because of religious themes in the movie and Blume's own heritage, the film has shown at Jewish film festivals including the Atlanta Jewish Film Festival, where it was screened on a Sunday afternoon in February. For Blume's fans, though, it probably didn't matter which film was showing as long as she was there to talk about it. A sold-out crowd showed up to the suburban Atlanta movie theater for a screening and Q&A of ""Tiger Eyes,"" many carrying tattered copies of Blume's books for her to sign afterward. Among them was Donna Liska-Johnson, now a 44-year-old special education teacher with a bookshelf full of first edition Judy Blume novels procured via eBay. She arrived two hours early with copies of ""Are You There God?"" and ""Tiger Eyes"" in hand and a purple fabric flower in her hair, a play on the word bloom, she said. When her turn came to meet her hero, she got choked up, struggling for words and fighting back tears while her husband gently rubbed her back. ""I can die happy now,"" she said after regaining composure. ""It's kind of like meeting a superhero."" Across the table, Blume smiled patiently and nodded her head in the gracious, knowing way of someone who's used to this sort of thing. Normally, Blume keeps a box of tissues on the table at book signings, she said, keenly aware of her effect on fans. Usually, they're mothers and wives, teachers, doctors or cancer survivors (like Blume herself) in their 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond. In her presence, though, they revert to gushing, hand-wringing teens who show their excitement through nervous laughter, professions of adoration or tears. ""I represent to them something from their childhood, wherever she was in her life when she was reading those books,"" Blume later said. Dressed in a sleek black ensemble of straight-legged jeans, fitted leather jacket, short leather boots and patchwork scarf, Blume carried herself with the poise and confidence of someone who has spent decades in the public eye writing and talking about herself. To answer some of the recurring questions, she maintains a website decorated with cartoon bodies bearing Blume's head and containing annotated bibliographies, information on her battle with censorship and tidbits like her favorite color. She wears her signature friendly grin whether she's chatting with a fan or demanding extra lighting for a book signing. She doesn't hesitate to speak her mind if, say, someone asks her to sign the 1981 unauthorized biography purportedly ""based on firsthand information from the writer herself."" ""I'm not sure if I want to sign this. I didn't even write it!"" she wondered out loud before deciding to acquiesce with the note, ""Do not believe anything you read in this book!"" The fan apologized, but Blume flashed her grin and told her not to worry. ""Don't be sorry. I'm so glad you came,"" she said, beaming. Blume is evolving with the times in other ways, having cultivated a respectable Twitter following of more than 82,000 ""tweeps"" whom she gave out a shout-out to during Sunday's screening. She uses Twitter to share information about screenings and thoughts like how one advantage of turning 75 is that she no longer has to take off her shoes at airport security. Otherwise, little has changed over the years within the pages of her classics, she said. Sure, in new editions, Margaret's sanitary napkin and belt have been replaced with adhesive pads. Fudge, the insufferable younger brother of Peter Hatcher, has new electronics. Otherwise, the struggles of her protagonists still resonate with her devoted fanbase. ""I don't think people change; electronics change, the things we have change, but the way we live doesn't change,"" Blume said as she waited in the lobby Sunday for the screening. A few changes were made in transition from novel to film, which became the natural focus of questions after the screening. Why was the relationship between Davey's mother and her nerdy suitor downplayed, one person wondered, or why did Davey's aunt became her mother's sister in the film instead of her father's sister? Blume and her son assured the audience that changes were made to preserve the film's narrative flow, which can be challenging in adapting a first-person novel. ""There's only so many times she can go to her room and slam the door,"" Blume told the audience. ""I think a lot of stuff in the movie is better than the book."" She also told the audience that cries a lot when she's writing, especially if she's on the right track. ""I know it's working when I'm writing a book if I'm laughing or crying,"" she told the audience during a Q&A session after the screening. If so, it bodes well for the film, during which she still tears up even though she's seen it several times. Audience member Melissa Rabb admitted that she ""cried like a baby"" during the screening. Her real reason for showing up was to meet Blume for the second time in her life. She'd brought with her a copy of ""Deenie"" that Blume signed 30 years ago, when the author visited Rabb's elementary school in Calhoun, Georgia. During the book signing, the two shared stories of cancer treatment while Blume signed Rabb's tattered paperback for the second time.

"In five years on YouTube, Francesca Ramsey says, only one of the nearly 200 videos she's posted has been explicitly about race. Yet when the actress, comedian and video blogger hosted a meet-up with fans here at the South by Southwest Interactive festival, only three out of about 150 of them were white. Of course that one video, ""S**t White Girls Say ... to Black Girls,"" has accounted for nearly 10 million of the roughly 18 million views her videos have gotten, combined. ""It's a double-edged sword,"" said Ramsey. ""It's opened a lot of doors for me, but I know that because of that video, there are some people who are never going to watch my videos and are never going to give me a chance and see that I'm so much more than that video."" Ramsey spoke Sunday on a panel addressing racism and race issues on YouTube, the Web's No. 1 video site. Viewing of online video has surged, with YouTube attracting 800 million unique visitors a year. In 2011, the site saw a mind-boggling 1 trillion-plus views. But among the content creators posting to YouTube who are ethnic minorities, race remains a troubling issue. Drawing a large fan base is a challenge, and commenters on YouTube videos can be vicious. Of the top 100 most popular YouTube channels that aren't industry-sponsored, there is one black creator, four Asians and one of  Middle Eastern descent, according to Web researcher Jenny Unghba Korn. Expanding that to the top 200 adds two more African-Americans, two Asians and one user from India. ""Everyone gets hate comments on YouTube,"" said Andre Meadows, the creator of the Black Nerd Comedy channel. ""You can make the most wonderful video in the world and you will get 'Fake!' and 'Gay!'"" But for minority creators, ""when you get comments, it seems to be targeted toward race almost immediately. A lot of people get 'dumb video, stupid video' -- but with mine it immediately goes to racial slurs."" YouTube has the reputation of hosting some of the nastiest comments on the Web. YouTube says it's mindful of its users' concerns, and works to help them manage, or remove, hateful comments on videos. ""YouTube's guidelines against hate speech and harassment apply to comments as well as videos,"" a YouTube spokesperson told CNN. ""We encourage people to flag inappropriate comments using the Help & Safety Tool so that we can remove anything that breaks the rules. We also give video owners tools for managing comments on their channels -- they can moderate comments, remove individual comments, or disable commenting completely."" But Korn, a researcher who focuses on cultural issues online, said the site is not unique. ""YouTube in and of itself isn't some special device,"" she said. ""It's actually a reflection of the culture that we're in right now. There's a reason that folks feel empowered to say things online that they would not say in person. In person, you almost want to dare them to say something like that, because they wouldn't get away with it."" Ramsey thinks the nature of YouTube just makes the hate easier. ""On Facebook, you have to like my page,"" she said. ""On Twitter, I get a lot of negativity, but usually it's only if I'm talking about top trending topics and people are just trolling those. ""(YouTube) is such a visual medium. If I have a blog, you don't need to know what race I am. If you watch my videos, you know I'm a black woman."" Ramsey and Meadows both said their initial reaction was to respond to haters. ""I have a bad habit that sometimes I do fire back,"" Meadows said. ""I'm a jokester. Someone will misspell something and it's like I cannot not say something."" But  ultimately, they both said that instead of trying to fight racist comments, they now just ignore them. Ramsey says she's created an e-mail filter that sends any message with racial slurs directly to trash. Meadows called the ""block"" button ""the most amazing button"" on YouTube. Is there a solution other than just hiding from the hate? Both say nurturing your own community of fans helps. ""If someone comes in with that kind of craziness, my audience will go after them,"" Meadows said. ""They police my comment section for me."" Ramsey has begun posting the nastiest racial comments she gets on her Facebook page. ""We laugh at them,"" she said. ""We laugh at the bad spelling. We laugh at how stupid it is."" Along those lines, she's resolved to ignore the trolls and, instead, respond more to comments from her loyal followers. ""My New Year's resolution was not to feed the trolls,"" she said. ""For every time you respond, you're taking time away from the fans who love you. How bad does it  make my fans feel that I didn't take the time to talk to them, but I took the time to talk to this awful person?""","Among YouTube content creators who are minorities, race remains a troubling issue .

"With moist eyes and soft voices, former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife pleaded guilty to federal charges on Wednesday related to years of using campaign funds for personal expenses that included purchases of Michael Jackson memorabilia and a Rolex watch. ""Guilty, your honor,"" Jackson responded to U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins while dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief after he looked back at family members in the courtroom, including his father, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. ""I used monies that should have been used for campaign purposes,"" Jackson, 47, acknowledged to the judge. When Wilkins asked if Jackson realized that the guilty plea meant giving up the right to a trial, he responded: ""I have no interest in wasting the taxpayers' time or money."" Jackson admitted to diverting about $750,000 for personal purposes from 2005 to 2012. Wilkins set sentencing for June 28, when Jackson could face up to five years in prison. At a separate hearing later on Wednesday, former Chicago Alderman Sandra Stevens Jackson, 49, also pleaded guilty in a quavering voice to one count of filing false tax returns in connection with the misuse of her husband's campaign funds. The charge involved a failure to declare more than $600,000 in income from 2005 to 2011. The total came from campaign funds. She wept openly after returning to the defense table. Wilkins set her sentencing for July 1, when she could receive up to three years in prison. Wednesday's hearings completed the fall of the once politically powerful Chicago couple. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat, won re-election to Congress last year despite personal problems, including a mood disorder, that caused him to drop out of sight for months during the campaign. That coincided with the investigation of campaign fund irregularities dating back several years. Jackson resigned a few weeks after the election, while his wife resigned her position as alderman in January. Prosecutors said the former congressman betrayed the public trust. ""The guilty plea today is so tragic because it represents such wasted potential. Jesse Jackson Jr. had drive the ability and the talent to be the voice of a new generation, but he squandered that talent. He exchanged that instead to satisfy his personal whims and extravagant lifestyle,"" U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said at a news conference. As he left the courthouse following his wife's hearing, Jackson said to reporters: ""I'm sorry I let everybody down."" At his morning hearing, the former legislator responded to standard legal questions about his soundness of mind by acknowledging his treatment by a psychiatrist. The treatment was not for alcohol or drug abuse, Jackson said, adding that he had a beer on Tuesday night but ""I have never been more clear in my life than I am now."" ""I fully understand the consequences of my actions,"" he said. His wife's lawyer later told reporters that her decision to plead guilty was influenced in part by her husband's ""mental and health issues."" The plea showed that Sandra Jackson admits ""she'd made some mistakes in judgment regarding expenditures in campaign contributions,"" said the lawyer, Dan Webb. ""She saw this as a chance to accept full responsibility for the conduct she engaged in,"" he added. Jesse Jackson Jr. pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, mail fraud and false statements. Wilkins noted that prosecutors and defense attorneys said sentencing guidelines indicated an appropriate term of 46 to 57 months in prison and a fine of between $10,000 and $100,000. The maximum fine under the law for both Jackson and his wife would be $250,000. However, Wilkins said he was not bound by sentencing guidelines, telling Jackson:  ""The bottom line is, I don't know what sentence you're going to get and you don't know what sentence you're going to get."" Jackson's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, told reporters after the hearing that he would mount a strong legal case for a fair sentence, noting his client is the father of two young children and has the health problems mentioned in court. ""It turns out that Jesse has serious health issues,"" Weingarten said. ""... We are going to talk about them extensively with the court and those health issues are directly related to his present predicament. That is not an excuse. That is just a fact.  And Jesse has turned a corner there as well."" But Machen said Jackson's illegal activity could not be dismissed as the result of recent mental illness. ""It's hard for me to imagine how they're going to reconcile this scheme as being the byproduct of any recent medical condition,"" he said. ""Mr. Jackson engaged in this scheme starting in 2005. It's a seven-year scheme."" Last week, prosecutors filed charges against the couple in separate criminal documents used when parties strike plea agreements. The documents say the former congressman misused campaign funds. According to court documents, Jackson's campaign credit cards were used for $582,772 in personal expenditures. Jackson's purchases included a gold-plated men's Rolex watch costing more than $43,000 and almost $10,000 in children's furniture. As part of the plea agreement, Jackson is supposed to repay the $750,000 in improperly used funds. Prosecutors said they would seize and sell many of the pieces of memorabilia and other items Jackson purchased and apply the proceeds to the debt. The items include two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $8,000; a $5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee. Another expenses incurred using the campaign credit card were a five-day stay at Martha's Vineyard Holistic Retreat in 2008 for $5,687.75, and a $4,272.78 charge in 2006 for on-board cruise expenses to Navigator of the Sea, according to court documents. Jackson issued a statement through his attorneys on Friday that said, in part: ""I offer no excuses for my conduct and I fully accept my responsibility for the improper decisions and mistakes I have made."" Jackson's wife is not mentioned by name in the document outlining misuse of campaign funds. But there are references to her as ""Co-Conspirator 1,"" a former consultant and later the manager of Jackson's re-election campaign. According to the court documents, ""Co-Conspirator 1"" bought $5,150 worth of fur capes and parkas and had them shipped from Beverly Hills, California, to Washington. Jesse Jackson Jr. had represented 2nd Congressional District in Illinois since 1995. His name came up during the investigation of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, linked to allegations that Blagojevich attempted to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. No charges were filed against Jackson, but the House Ethics Committee decided to look into whether Jackson or an associate offered to raise a large amount of money for Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson getting the Senate seat. Jackson dropped out of sight last spring and his office later said he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic for a mood disorder, depression and gastrointestinal problems. He was re-elected in November but resigned a few weeks later. His father recently said his son was ""taking his medication and handling his challenges."" The elder Jackson had no comment after Wednesday's hearings, telling reporters, ""not today.""","Lawyer says Sandra Jackson accepts responsibility for ""mistakes in judgment""

"(CNN) -- After posting a series of disturbing tweets about rape, musician CeeLo Green has returned with a 140-character apology. The controversy started last weekend after Green pleaded no contest Friday to one felony count of giving a woman the drug Ecstasy at a dinner in 2012. The woman also accused Green of sexually assaulting her, but prosecutors concluded at an October 2013 hearing there was insufficient evidence for a charge. CeeLo Green accused of giving woman Ecstasy, but DA declines rape charge . According to Billboard, Green aired his thoughts about the case Sunday on Twitter. ""If someone is passed out they're not even WITH you consciously! so WITH Implies consent,"" he tweeted in a post that's since been deleted but was preserved by a Twitter user. ""Women who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!"" At first, Green deleted those remarks and attempted to offer an explanation. ""Let me 1st praise god for exoneration fairness & freedom! Secondly I sincerely apologize for my comments being taken so far out of context,"" Green tweeted Monday. ""I only intended on a healthy exchange to help heal those who love me from the pain I had already caused from this. Please forgive me, as it was your support that got me thru this to begin with. I'd never condone the harm of any women. Thank you."" CeeLo Green leaving 'The Voice' Yet those messages, captured by Billboard, were soon gone too as Green appeared to shut down his Twitter account altogether. By Tuesday, the ""Crazy"" singer had returned, this time keeping his commentary brief: . ""I truly and deeply apologize for the comments attributed to me on Twitter. Those comments were idiotic, untrue and not what I believe,"" he said Tuesday. That mea culpa arrived just as TBS, which shares a parent company with CNN, canceled Green's new reality show, ""The Good Life."" An online petition urged the network to end the program after Green's tweets, but a source from TBS told CNN the series wasn't picked up for a second season due to low ratings. CNN has also reached out to Green for comment. CNN's Alan Duke, Topher Gauk-Roger and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Singer issues an apology on Twitter for remarks he made about rape .

"Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey lives in San Francisco, not New York. But the tech entrepreneur, who also founded mobile-payments company Square, tells ""60 Minutes"" he wants to move to New York someday and run for mayor. ""What I love about New York is just the electricity I feel right away,"" he told CBS News' Lara Logan in a segment that aired Sunday. ""It's chaos. It's kind of like being in a car in the middle of a thunderstorm. Everything is raging around you, but you're safe inside that car. So New York feels very much to me like that."" With a net worth of more than $1 billion, Dorsey would follow in the footsteps of Michael Bloomberg as a billionaire-turned-New York politician. Moving to the Big Apple also would be a homecoming of sorts for Dorsey, who attended New York University and as a teenager was hired by a New York dispatch company after he hacked into its website. Dorsey, 36, grew up in St. Louis and spent a lot of time at home playing with computers and studying trains. He also had a police scanner and told CBS the inspiration for Twitter came from listening to the short bursts of chatter from the city's emergency dispatch center. ""They're always talking about where they're going, what they're doing and where they currently are. And that is where the idea for Twitter came (from) ... ,"" said Dorsey, who created the code for Twitter's 140-character messages. ""And (with cell phones) suddenly we could update where I was, what I'm doing, where I'm going, how I feel. And then it would go out to the entire world."" In December, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users. Dorsey said he is proud of how quickly people adopted Twitter, which launched in 2006, ""and used it in a million different ways. They're all over the world. And Twitter enables them to take a $5 cell phone and, wherever they are, communicate with the world for free."" Launched in 2010, Square now has more than 400 employees and has been adopted by Starbucks to help the coffee chain process sales transactions. Dorsey said the idea for Square came from talking to a friend, a glassmaker, who was frustrated that he lost a $2,000 sale because he couldn't accept a credit card. Dorsey also said that to keep his employees inspired he leads company outings to a place in San Francisco called Lands End, which offers stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge. Dorsey says he admires the bridge's utility and elegant design, which he called ""this perfect intersection between art and engineering,"" and believes software should work the same way.","Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says he wants to move to New York someday, run for mayor .

"U.S. authorities regard Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, 47, as a core member of al Qaeda -- present with the group's leadership during Osama bin Laden's final stand at Tora Bora in December 2001, and subsequently as one of its key spokesmen. He is married to one of the late al Qaeda leader's daughters, Fatima. After al Qaeda's leadership was scattered, Abu Ghaith escaped to Pakistan and subsequently turned up in Iran. The Islamic Republic was not overjoyed by his presence and in 2003 tried to return him to his country of birth: Kuwait. But the then-Kuwaiti foreign minister said the idea had been rejected. Abu Ghaith had been stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship soon after 9/11. And so Abu Ghaith spent much of the next decade in Iran, in some sort of loose house arrest. According to Turkish media reports he arrived in Ankara at the beginning of February -- traveling on a forged Saudi passport. Bin Laden's son-in-law, once al Qaeda's 'mouthpiece,' held by U.S. Sources in Turkey say he checked into an upscale hotel in the capital, but was subsequently detained at the United States' request. The Turkish authorities were apparently anxious that to extradite him directly to the United States could provoke a backlash by al Qaeda sympathizers. He had not committed any crime on Turkish soil -- and according to Turkish law, foreign nationals who enter the country on a forged passport must be deported to the country from which they had traveled. But the Iranians refused to take him back, according to Turkish sources. So after several weeks in limbo, the decision was made to deport Abu Ghaith to Kuwait. And a few days ago, according to one source, he was put on a plane for Amman, Jordan -- an intermediate stop on his journey home. But somewhere along the way, he was handed over to U.S. custody and diverted to New York. The capture was confirmed Thursday by two administration officials and a federal law enforcement official. It's unclear how much, if anything,  Abu Ghaith knew about the planning for the 9/11 attacks. One detainee at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Adel Zamel Abd al Mahsen al Zamel, is said to have moved his own family and Abu Ghaith's from Kuwait to Afghanistan ""immediately prior to the September 11 2001 attacks,"" according to his detainee assessment. According to the 9/11 Commission report, there was disagreement among al Qaeda's leadership about launching a major operation against the United States in 2001. Taliban leader Mullah Omar was opposed, but those who reportedly sided with bin Laden included Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- and Abu Ghaith. 'Nightmare' at home for SEAL who shot bin Laden . The picture that emerges of Abu Ghaith from the testimony of detainees at Guantanamo Bay is of someone close to decision-making in al Qaeda immediately after the 9/11 attacks. Several reported seeing him in meetings at Tora Bora with other al Qaeda leaders. Other detainees describe meeting him in Kabul, Kandahar (a Taliban stronghold) and at al Qaeda's al-Faruq training camp. Said Salih Said Nashir said Abu Ghaith addressed detainees there. And his phone number was found on the SIM card of another detainee. A U.S. Justice Department complaint said, ""On the morning of September 12, 2001, Abu (Ghaith) appeared with Bin Laden and Zawahiri, and spoke on behalf of al Qaeda, warning the United States and its allies that ""[a] great army is gathering against you"" and called upon ""the nation of Islam"" to do battle against ""the Jews, the Christians and the Americans."" As the United States launched air strikes against Taliban and al Qaeda targets in October 2001, Abu Ghaith emerged as the voice of al Qaeda, recording one video message in which he said: ""The Al-Qaeda organization declares that Bush Senior, Bush Junior, Clinton, Blair and Sharon are the arch-criminals from among the Zionists and Crusaders."" And in a later statement, published in 2002, he said: ""We are continuing with our blows against the Americans and the Jews, and with attacking them, both people and installations [so as to stress] that what awaits the Americans will not, Allah willing, be less than what has already happened to them. America must prepare itself; it must go on maximum alert."" In the same statement he said: ""The Americans have still not tasted from our hands what we have tasted from theirs ... We have (the) right to kill four million Americans,"" including with chemical and biological weapons. One Moroccan detainee interviewed after being transferred home from Guantanamo said he and Abu Ghaith had spent time in bin Laden's company after the beginning of the U.S. bombing offensive in Afghanistan in October 2001 before traveling with al Qaeda's leader to Tora Bora. The new story of the death of Osama bin Laden . ""During the month of Ramadan....we entered Tora Bora where we stayed for 20 days. From there, Ayman al-Zawahiri fled accompanied by Suleiman Abu Ghaith and Uthman, the son of Osama Bin Laden,"" the detainee stated. And in an interview with Al Majallah magazine in 2002, one of Osama bin Laden's wives described Abu Ghaith as one of the closest confidants to the al Qaeda leader. In the 1990s, Abu Ghaith developed a reputation in Kuwait as a militant preacher . Nasir al Bahri -- who was bin Laden's personal bodyguard in the late 1990s -- told the newspaper al Quds al Arabi in 2005 that Abu Ghaith ""gave a Friday sermon in Kuwait and spoke about Osama bin Laden and defended him and about the Al-Qa'ida Organization.... He attacked the United States and its allies, and incited the youths against the United States ... He was immediately arrested."" ""I think that the harassment he faced in Kuwait and the ban on his sermons there made him go to Afghanistan and officially join the al Qaeda organization,"" al Bahri said. It was the beginning of a long journey that will culminate in Abu Ghaith's appearance in a Manhattan federal courtroom Friday.","Detained man believed to be core al Qaeda member .

"As President Obama continues to push for new gun control measures, new FBI data shows that January was the second-highest month on record for gun background checks. FBI figures posted Tuesday show there were 2,495,400 background checks done through the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS. The number was more than 1 million higher than any previous January. Also in January, 8,980 of the background checks resulted in gun purchase denials. U.S. law requires background checks for all people who try to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Obama still backs new gun ban . The data does not indicate exactly how many weapons might have been purchased, as some customers buy more than one gun at a time. December was the top record-setting month, with 2,783,765 background checks. The FBI makes the data available on its website without comment. The figures typically show high numbers of background checks during the holiday shopping months of November and December, and the background check numbers usually decline in January. There also is often a spike in checks after a dramatic incident of gun violence. The NICS system was launched in November 1998 after being mandated by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. Federal law does not require background checks for ""private transactions,"" such as sales between hunters. Many states have their own statutes requiring such checks for private sales.

"Hugo Chavez's voice boomed through the speakers at a Venezuelan campaign rally Monday, just minutes after the country's interim leader filed papers to run for president. The message was clear as Nicolas Maduro and his supporters from the United Socialist Party of Venezuela sang along with a recording of Chavez belting out Venezuela's national anthem. As Maduro spoke to a cheering crowd, a large photo of Chavez saluting hung behind him. As he filed his campaign platform with election officials, the 50-year-old former bus driver and union leader stressed his commitment to continuing the late president's legacy. ""I am not Chavez, but I am his son,"" Maduro said. ""And all together, the people, we are Chavez."" Venezuela's interim leader thrust into spotlight . In a national television broadcast less than a week ago, a tearful Maduro, then vice president, announced Chavez's death after suffering from cancer for a long time. Maduro was sworn in as interim president on Friday, and elections are scheduled for April 14. In December, Chavez didn't mince words when he told Venezuelans who he wanted to succeed him. ""My firm opinion, as clear as the full moon -- irrevocable, absolute, total -- is ... that you elect Nicolas Maduro as president,"" Chavez said, waving a copy of the Venezuelan Constitution as he spoke. ""I ask this of you from my heart. He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" But on Sunday, opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski said he was ready for a tough fight. ""Nicolas, I will not give you a free path,"" Capriles said to reporters. ""You will have to defeat me with votes."" Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost. But he mounted one of the fiercest challenges during the late president's 14 years in power. On Monday, he also filed paperwork to run for the presidency, CNN affiliate Globovision reported. On Sunday, Capriles accused the government of manipulating Chavez's death for political gain. ""My fight is not to be president. My fight is for Venezuela to move forward,"" Capriles said Sunday night. Whether Chavez's popular political movement will have enough momentum to win at the polls after his death remains to be seen, analysts have said. Venezuela: Will 'Chavismo' survive? ""Since he does not have charisma, he does not have the experience, he does not have military roots, I think that the Cubans and other friends of Chavez are looking at this election with a bit of nervousness,"" said Lino Gutierrez, a former U.S. ambassador in Argentina and Nicaragua who now runs an international consulting firm. But it remains probable that with Chavez's party backing him, Maduro has the necessary strength and support to win an election, said Carlos Manuel Indacochea, a professor at George Washington University. ""No victory is absolutely predictable, but it is very likely,"" Indacochea told CNN en Español on Monday. ""It is very likely because again the government will use all the resources of the state and the recent fact of the death and the aura of the leader who has just departed. So it is very likely that he wins the election.""","""I am not Chavez, but I am his son,"" Maduro says as he officially enters the race .

"(CNN) -- Over the past few days, politicians and experts have been debating the merits of the Obama administration's strategy in Iraq -- or whether there is in fact a strategy. The debate generally ignores a key underlying fact: The United States no longer has the ability or the will to shape the outcome in Iraq to the degree that American policy makers would like. At the same time, politicians on both sides of the aisle appear constrained in their ability to talk candidly about U.S. foreign policy objectives and strategy because of concerns about domestic public opinion and so they often default to partisan sound bites. In an ideal world, U.S. strategy would be carefully calibrated and aimed at a number of political, military and economic goals for the country and the region. Yet the dynamics of the U.S. relationship with Iraq is similar to most dysfunctional relationships in which problematic patterns repeat and persist over time. One party may in fact be able to change the entrenched dysfunctional behavior of another person at the margins, but at the end of the day, countries -- as do people -- need to take responsibility for their behavior, their mistakes and their future. How religion could complicate U.S. intervention in Iraq . Unfortunately, the reality is that after more than 10 years of trying to shape outcomes in Iraq, the United States is forced to acknowledge it doesn't have the leverage we expected. The next best option is to find a solution that encompasses our values but doesn't err on the side of unrealistic idealism. America's greatest failure has perhaps been our unwavering belief that we are always able to positively influence and shape the behavior of others through rhetoric, coercion, force and diplomacy. Leverage, as the United States has historically defined it, is not as relevant in today's conflicts. However, the conditions are not ripe for the United States to pull Iraq out of this quagmire given the lack of interest in America after over a decade of war and the political gridlock here and in Iraq. In our time as analysts at the CIA, we were asked to present the opposite of what political punditry and partisan speeches tend to do. We were often asked to outline worst-case scenarios, speak truth to power and accurately assess dynamics on the ground. We were not supposed to sugarcoat our analysis to make it more palatable or to cater to the audience with empty words or false optimism. We were trained to try to objectively assess and analyze the veracity of reporting to help inform policymakers' decisions. So, while it may not be politically popular for a leader or a president to say that ""we can't influence longer-term outcomes to the degree that we'd like in Iraq, so we are adopting a strategy to avert worst-case scenarios and contain catastrophe,"" this is precisely the strategy we believe ought to be adopted right now. We need an honest strategy based on containing catastrophe. In other words, our strategy at this point ought to be designed to thwart the worst outcomes from occurring and it should focus on preventing moral, humanitarian and security catastrophes. The United States can make a significant difference in the lives of Iraqis and in the realm of our own national security even if the future of Iraq ultimately rests in hands of Iraqis. The Islamic State, known by the acronym ISIS, is on a rampage to take over and control territory. The United States must degrade ISIS capabilities so that it is unable to launch a significant terrorist attack on U.S. interests (or a large mass casualty attack anywhere in the world). ISIS is a product of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's organization dating back to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. After Zarqawi was killed in 2006, the Islamic State of Iraq emerged from his original organization and began to flourish. ISIS has capitalized on (former) Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's unwillingness to work with the local Sunni populations and the power vacuum left by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. ISIS and Zarqawi's organization have thrived on sectarian violence, but ISIS has managed to professionalize military and humanitarian aid. As ISIS disperses and embeds in populated areas, it will become more difficult to root out. Its possible Achilles heel is the eventual erosion of local support from Sunnis while ISIS asserts control to govern and maintain territory. This gives the U.S. an opening to work with the Iraq and Kurdish government, in addition to regional allies, by helping to resolve a humanitarian crisis and limiting the group's ability to acquire new territory for safe haven. The U.S. ought to continue targeted airstrikes with cooperation from Iraqi security forces and allies -- whether that takes days, weeks or months. Second, we can and should prevent the potential for genocide or ethnic cleansing in Iraq. Arguing that the United States hasn't acted in other areas of the world or can't act in every single case of violence is not an argument against acting when we are able to make a difference. And, we are able to make a difference right now in northern Iraq at a moment of crisis -- such as the operation underway assisting those stranded and dying on Mount Sinjar -- and we should also turn our eyes to the humanitarian crisis in Syria, where the U.S. can also make difference. If the U.S. can support the local population and help to bolster local governments, ISIS will have a much more difficult time recruiting and controlling territory. Jabhat al-Nusra is an example of how successfully terrorist organizations can galvanize support and generate influence among local populations through charitable efforts. Third, we must prevent terrorist groups operating in Iraq and Syria from acquiring biological or chemical weapons that they would be able to use in a mass casualty attack. From a national security perspective, it's important to remember Syria's al-Assad has not relinquished all of his chemical and biological weapons. The last thing we want is for these to fall in the hands of ISIS. Why does the U.S. intervene militarily in Iraq but not in Syria? Fourth, ISIS has attracted young fighters who understand how to talk to prospective recruits through all forms of media. Some of those recruits are Western passport holders and they are possibly the largest number of Western citizens identified fighting alongside a terrorist organization. Not only do they pose a threat in the region, individuals can also be difficult to track from the war theater when returning home. Lastly, the United States should work to maintain the security of its embassies and consulates. The recent evacuations and relocations of staff are a troublesome trend (albeit for the safety and security of diplomatic personnel). Ensuring that our diplomats are able to safely operate and function in foreign countries, especially Iraq, is critical. Any type of serious attack on an embassy or U.S. personnel working in the country would make it increasingly difficult for the United States to address the issues we discuss above. In addition, maintaining a functioning embassy is important for information collection, assessing progress and being able to work with Iraqis -- particularly on the political side of the equation. A foreign policy strategy speech predicated on containing catastrophe might not be a speech that inspires the American public, but it is an honest strategy that would be based on a realistic approach to our foreign policy in Iraq. Such an approach is good for America's national security and for addressing the humanitarian concerns of those suffering during crisis.

"This week, we mark the tenth anniversary of the day the U.S. launched the Iraq War. But when we think of how differently that war might have been fought, the most important date to remember is February 25, 2003. That's when Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""several hundred thousand soldiers"" would be needed in Iraq when post-hostilities control was taken into consideration. Shinseki's estimate was more than double that of the George W. Bush administration, which in March 2003 sent a ground invasion force of 145,000 troops into Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld's Defense Department wasted no time in answering Shinseki. Two days after Shinseki's Senate testimony, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz used his appearance before the House Budget Committee to present an entirely different view of America's prospects in Iraq. ""Some of the higher-end predictions that we have been hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam (Hussein) Iraq, are wildly off the mark,"" Wolfowitz declared. ""It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in a post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself."" The Department of Defense's anger with Shinseki was understandable. His troop estimate made it seem as if the Bush administration was lowballing Congress and the American public. But there was nothing out of the ordinary in Shinseki's thinking. In Bosnia, where Shinseki had served with the United States peacekeeping mission after the ethnic warfare there was stopped, the Pentagon had used a formula of one soldier for every 50 Bosnians. In Iraq that calculation added up to 300,000 troops. The Defense Department countered Shinseki by saying that Iraq was very different from Bosnia when it came to troop needs. ""There has been none of the record in Iraq of ethnic militias fighting one another that produced so much bloodshed and permanent scars in Bosnia, along with a continuing requirement for large peacekeeping forces to separate those militias,"" Wolfowitz insisted. By April 2003, one month after the Iraq invasion began, it became clear that Shinseki's troop estimate was correct. When mobs began looting government buildings and hospitals, there were not enough American soldiers to stop them. ""Stuff happens!"" was Rumsfeld's explanation of the chaos. A more publicity conscious Army chief of staff than Shinseki might have used the looting to make his case before the media. Long before their disagreement over Iraq, he and Rumsfeld had clashed over Rumsfeld's belief that high-tech warfare gave the Pentagon leeway to reduce overall American troop strength. In 2002 Rumsfeld, irritated by Shinseki's insistence that American troops were stretched too thin around the world, had made Shinseki a lame-duck Army chief of staff by announcing his successor while Shinseki had more than a year left to serve. In the spring of 2003 Shinseki chose, however, not to engage in a protracted war of words with Rumsfeld. Instead, he stuck to his position on what was needed in Iraq and waited until his Pentagon retirement ceremony in June 2003 to make his case that in the wake of 9/11, America needed more boots on the ground to meet its global responsibilities. ""Beware the 12-division strategy for a 10-division Army,"" Shinseki told his Pentagon audience and then went on to compare America's war in Iraq with the war he knew as a junior officer in Vietnam.  ""The lessons I learned in Vietnam are always with me,"" Shinseki stressed, ""lessons about loyalty, about taking care of the people who sacrifice the most."" Both President Bush and Rumsfeld made a point of not attending Shinseki's retirement ceremony, and the New York Times buried its account of Shinseki's retirement speech on page 32 of the news section. By contrast, those who came to Shinseki's retirement ceremony did so as an act of support, and they included not only Army brass who appreciated the stance he had taken on Iraq but a contingent of his West Point classmates, who, like Shinseki, had served in Vietnam during the 1960s. In the eyes of many of his classmates, Shinseki, who lost nearly half his right foot after stepping on a Vietnam land mine, was doing for the troops in Iraq what President Lyndon Johnson and his  secretary of defense, Robert  McNamara, had failed to do for America's troops in Vietnam: he was looking out for them regardless of the political consequences. To these classmates Shinseki's candor about Iraq made him as much a hero as his Vietnam combat record, and today, as we look back on Iraq and try to decide who the best and brightest generals of that war were, Shinseki's 2003 judgment shines through. Small wonder that, like another admired Army chief of staff, World War II hero Omar Bradley, Shinseki has had a second career as the head of the Veterans Administration.","Nicolaus Mills: An American general took issue with Bush administration views on Iraq .

"The first week of a lawsuit seeking to reform New York's stop-and-frisk policy featured emotional accounts from men who say police stopped them for no reason and NYPD officers who say mandated quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops. The federal class-action lawsuit, Floyd v. City of New York, claims police routinely stop minority men without a legal reason. It was filed in 2008. Officer Adhyl Polanco, an eight-year veteran of the NYPD who works in the Bronx, testified Tuesday that he was told at a daily roll call that he had to log at least five stop-and-frisks, make one arrest and write 20 tickets each month, according to CNN affiliate NY1. ""They said, 'You do it or you are going to become a Pizza Hut deliveryman,'"" Polanco said. ""I started recording it because I could not believe what I was hearing."" NYPD report: Most of those 'stopped and frisked' are minorities . The practice in which police stop, question and frisk people they consider suspicious has been widely criticized, but the police department says it is used to deter crime.  According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, the NYPD logged its 5 millionth stop-and-frisk under Mayor Michael Bloomberg last week. Bronx Police Officer Pedro Serrano also taped discussions with supervisors during the daily roll call starting in 2010.  Both officers said it was during these roll calls that their supervisors would urge them and their fellow officers to write more summonses, make stop-and-frisk stops and make arrests. In the recordings, which were played in court by the plaintiffs' lawyers, supervising officers can be heard saying  they want ""more 250s,"" referring to the form that officers fill out when they conduct a stop, question and frisk. ""If you don't want to be on a foot post, get a collar (an arrest),"" supervisors also said in a recording played on Thursday. Lawyers for the city dismissed the talk of quotas. During cross-examination they pointed to the fact that police supervisors suggested Polanco and other officers might be slacking off on the job. In a recording Serrano made in February 2013, an inspector can be heard talking about stop-and-frisks, saying that officers need to stop ""the right people at the right time in the right location."" Later in the recording, Serrano and his superior have a conversation about Mott Haven, a notoriously high-crime area in the south Bronx that the inspector says has had many problems with robberies and grand larcenies.  He continues to say, ""The problem was what? Male blacks. And I told you that at roll call, and I have no problem telling you this: male blacks 14 to 20."" City attorneys say that officers operate within the law, going where the crime is, and that crime happens to be higher in minority neighborhoods. Department Deputy Chief Michael Marino testified Friday that when he was overseeing the 75th precinct in Brooklyn, he had to set a goal of 10 summonses and one arrest per month because the officers were performing poorly. ""Department managers can and must set performance goals,"" Marino said. While performance goals are legal, under a state law that was revised in 2010, quotas are not. Serrano, a nine-year police veteran, got choked up when asked why he came forward with the allegations of stop-and-frisk quotas in the NYPD. ""As a Hispanic walking in the Bronx, I've been stopped many times, and it's not a good feeling,"" he said. ""As an officer, I said I would respect everyone to the best of my abilities. I just want to do the right thing."" Serrano said he faced retaliation from his superiors for refusing to meet the quotas. ""I would have a day off and they'd give me forced (overtime),"" he said to the court. ""I would get yelled at, get low evaluations, they would deny days off."" And after he complained about this alleged treatment to internal affairs, he said fellow officers plastered his locker with stickers of rats. Earlier in the week, teen witness Devin Almonor testified that when he was 13 he was illegally stopped, questioned and frisked, according to NY1. ""I want to be a voice to fight against the injustices of some of the NYPD,"" Almonor said. Nicholas Peart, 24, testified that he has been stopped multiple times, once in 2011 while walking to the store to get some milk.  He said he feared for the safety of his siblings after the officers took his keys and went into his apartment building. According to plaintiffs' attorneys, the lawsuit is not about putting an end to stop-and-frisk, but examines how the police department conducts those stops and whether it stops blacks and Hispanics in violation of the Constitution. The Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit civil rights law practice, is arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs. The lawsuit seeks to reform stop-and-frisk under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor. The lead plaintiff in the case is David Floyd, a medical student who was stopped twice, once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the Bronx, according to the suit. ""We need somebody to look over the shoulder of the police department, not in an overly aggressive way, but in a limited way to make sure that this practice is being done in a constitutional fashion,"" said plaintiff attorney Jonathan Moore. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said this week that council members have reached a ""broad agreement"" on a bill to have an office within the city's Department of Investigation that would be allowed to subpoena police officials and documents. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday. The outcome will be decided by U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin.","Police testify they were ordered to intercept 5 people a month .

"(CNN)Photographers often go to bizarre lengths to earn the confidence of their subjects. Just ask Thomas Roma, who got on his knees and howled his way into the heart of a pit bull mix named Violet at a dog park in Brooklyn, New York. Something had to be done. Each time Roma showed up, Violet charged at him, barking and occasionally nipping at his legs. One day, Roma knelt down next to her and started to howl ""like a wolf,"" he said. She stopped ""dead in her tracks"" and joined him, starting a ritual that persists today. ""She matched me howl for howl, and immediately after that she just loved me,"" Roma said. Violet was one of many canine friends Roma made at Dyker Beach Park, where he spent three years shooting what he calls the most unexpected work of his career. The 64-year-old says he has spent most of his life looking through the viewfinder, ""hoping to be surprised"" by what he saw. ""Mondo Cane"" (""A Dog's Life"") stands out in his oeuvre thanks to its perspective. To take the photos of the dogs and their shadows, he would mount a camera to the end of a pole, raising it up to 7 feet. ""The pleasure of it was learning new skills after all these years being a photographer,"" he said. ""And the dogs are just running around like maniacs. That's what's so great about it."" Response to ""Mondo Cane"" also has been unusual, he said. The photos are being exhibited and sold in galleries in New York, Rome and Tokyo before he has had a chance to edit them into a book. That's a first in a career that began in the 1970s, when Roma left his job as a Wall Street trader to focus full-time on a hobby. Not that he's been struggling for recognition. He is a two-time Guggenheim fellow, and his work has been exhibited around the world and published in 13 books. As Columbia University's director of photography since 1996, he has also earned the admiration of many students, including one who started a Tumblr, ""S***t My Photography Professor Says,"" dedicated to his ""legitimately insane"" and ""legitimately brilliant"" classroom rants. Roma and his wife, Anna, started bringing their standard poodle to Dyker Beach Park about nine years ago, when Tino was just a puppy. Prospect Park was closer, but dogs have to be kept on leashes there, Roma said. At Dyker Beach, located in the southwest corner of Brooklyn near the Verrazano Bridge, Tino could roam free. Roma didn't start photographing the dogs until 2011, when he was nearly finished with another project and started fretting over what was next. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. One day, as the sun streamed unimpeded across the park, casting long canine shadows, he had a revelation. ""There was something about the primal nature of the shadows of these little lovable pets of ours. Their shadows, I felt, revealed a wilder side of their nature,"" he said. ""They immediately struck me as something like cave drawings."" The powdery layer of dust on the ground made for a fresh canvas each day, Roma said. When he arrived in the morning, the wind had blown it smooth. As the hours went by, tracks from dogs and people brought to life new texture and form. ""What was interesting to me is I was essentially photographing the ground,"" he said. ""I would find interesting patches of ground and call the dogs over or follow them and get picture of what was actually there."" He stopped photographing there last year when the city renovated the park, tearing up the ground and putting down a new surface. It's actually better for the dogs and their owners. It's less dusty, and Tino still gets to hang out with Violet and the rest of their friends. But it effectively ended Roma's project. ""It's a beautiful pebbled surface,"" he said. ""I could see taking a few pictures but I think I would get bored pretty quickly."" Thomas Roma is an American photographer and professor at Columbia University.

"Anne Smedinghoff lived inside a heavily secured compound. But the public diplomacy officer for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was always pushing to get out. ""We thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound, but as it turned out, Anne really wanted to do a lot more,"" her father, Tom Smedinghoff, told CNN. ""She was always finding projects and assignments that took her outside to the various provinces within and around Afghanistan, and that was what she wanted to do,"" he said. ""That was what really drove her."" This past weekend, the 25-year-old was trying to do just that -- delivering books to a school in southern Afghanistan -- when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy Saturday, killing Smedinghoff and four others. She is believed to be the first U.S. diplomat killed since the September attack in Benghazi, Libya. Her death was a grim reminder of the risks and importance of pushing for change in ""one of the toughest places on earth,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday. It was an ""extraordinary, harsh contradiction,"" Kerry said, to see an attacker kill ""a young, 25-year-old woman with all of the future ahead of her, believing in the possibilities of diplomacy, of changing people's lives, of making a difference, having an impact, who was taking knowledge in books to deliver them to a school."" Officials did not say who they believe was behind the blast. But Kerry offered a sharp condemnation of the violence as he spoke to U.S. diplomats stationed in Istanbul. ""The folks who want to kill people, and that's all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. And they want to shut the doors and they don't want people to make their choices about the future. For them, it's 'You do things my way and if you don't, we'll throw acid in your face. We'll put a bullet in your face,' to a young girl trying to learn,"" Kerry said. ""So this is a huge challenge for us. It is a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities, and everything that our country stands for, everything we stand for, is embodied in what Anne Smedinghoff stood for."" Friend: 'She pushed you to be better' Smedinghoff graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2009 with a degree in international relations and joined the Foreign Service soon afterward. ""I remember how excited she was when she got in and started her training. She would always talk about it, because she was one of those natural leaders,"" said Christopher Louie, 26, a close friend who first met Smedinghoff in college. ""When she was passionate about something, she would let everyone know. ... You could just tell when she got in the Foreign Service, she saw that this was her opportunity to make a big impact on the world."" And her enthusiasm was infectious, said Louie, a medical filmmaker in Washington who recently vacationed with Smedinghoff in Jordan. ""She always got people interested in what she was involved in. ... Whenever I knew I was going to see her, I'd always make sure I was brushed up on foreign affairs. She was one of those people, you didn't want to let her down,"" he said. ""She pushed you to be better."" Kerry laments death of U.S. civilian in Afghanistan . It was clear that ""there was no better place for her"" than the Foreign Service, her parents said in a written statement. After a tour of duty in Caracas, Venezuela, Smedinghoff volunteered for an assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and had been working there since July, her parents said. ""We are consoled knowing that she was doing what she loved, and that she was serving her country by helping to make a positive difference in the world,"" they said. Before she joined the State Department, Smedinghoff served on the board of directors for the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults' 4K for Cancer program, spending a summer cycling across the United States to raise money and awareness. ""Anne was an incredibly optimistic, fearless, and giving person,"" said Ryan Hanley, the program's founder. ""We mourn a life cut short,"" he said Sunday, ""but are blessed to have shared in it."" Mother: 'She was just so exuberant about everything' Smedinghoff's Facebook profile gives a glimpse of her life in Afghanistan. One photo shows a group skiing in the Afghan mountains. Another shows her standing behind a lectern at the embassy, surrounded by American flags. Another, titled ""Helicoptering around Helmand,"" shows a smiling Smedinghoff sitting beside men in camouflage, wearing a helmet and a flak jacket. The prospect of her working in Afghanistan worried her parents at first, but her passion for the job and the good work she hoped to do won them over. ""She really thought there was a lot to be done there, and she could be part of it. ... As parents you always want to make sure no harm comes to your children, but I knew that she wanted to embrace this opportunity,"" her mother, Mary Beth Smedinghoff, said Monday, ""so she had our full-hearted support and blessing to apply for that position."" Public outreach projects like delivering textbooks to schools, organizing educational efforts and working with women's groups to promote equality were parts of her job she particularly loved, her parents said. They spoke to CNN Monday morning from Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where they were awaiting the arrival of their daughter's remains just over a week after their last conversation with her. In that Easter chat, she excitedly told her parents about Kerry's recent visit to Afghanistan. She sent them photos and a congratulatory e-mail she received from the ambassador for her work during the trip. ""She was just so exuberant about everything that had transpired during that trip and what she had done,"" Mary Beth Smedinghoff said. ""Obviously, we were very proud of her."" Kerry was emotional Sunday as he spoke of Smedinghoff's death and described his experience meeting her during the recent Afghanistan trip. ""I remember her -- vivacious, smart, capable, chosen often by the ambassador there to be the lead person because of her capabilities,"" he said. This weekend, Smedinghoff ""was just trying to deliver books, bring knowledge to people -- books in their own language -- in order to help them know about the possibilities of life,"" Kerry said on Monday. ""And some wanton terrorist, out of the blue, nameless and faceless and now lifeless, attacked this group of people and took five lives."" Neighbor: 'She had candle power' Residents in the River Forest, Illinois, neighborhood where the Smedinghoff family lives said they were devastated by the news. ""Anne Smedinghoff was one of those rare people who, you were lucky if you were near her. She had candle power,"" one neighbor told CNN affiliate WGN. ""She brightened everyone's life."" Katie Whiting, whose sister was Smedinghoff's best friend, told the CNN affiliate that the ""beautiful and brave"" diplomat was doing her dream job. ""The world has really lost somebody who was going to do a lot of good things. ... Every dangerous place she wanted to go there, because that's where the hard work was,"" Whiting said. In Smedinghoff's memory, CNN affiliate WBBM reported, American flags lined the road near her family's home on Sunday. A large photograph she posted on her Facebook profile less than three weeks ago shows another road on the other side of the world, lined with Afghan flags.","Kerry: Anne Smedinghoff was killed by a ""wanton terrorist""

"James Brady, a former White House press secretary who was severely wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan and later became a prominent gun-control advocate, has died. Brady died at 73 after a series of health issues, his family said in a statement on Monday. ""Over the years, Jim inspired so many people as he turned adversity into accomplishment,"" the statement said. Brady was one of four people hurt in Reagan's shooting by John Hinckley outside a Washington hotel. Suffering a head wound, it was erroneously reported at one point that Brady had died. He was, however, left partially paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Reagan, severely wounded as well, also survived the attack and served two terms as President. Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting and has spent the ensuing years in a psychiatric hospital. After leaving the White House, Brady launched the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which pushes for stricter firearms laws. He inspired the Brady Bill, which was fiercely fought over for years before Congress approved it and President Bill Clinton signed it into law in 1993. It requires background checks for gun purchases. Opinion: The man who made people talk about guns . President Barack Obama praised Brady's legacy. ""Jim is a legend at the White House for his warmth and professionalism as press secretary for President Reagan; for the strength he brought to bear in recovering from the shooting that nearly killed him 33 years ago; and for turning the events of that terrible afternoon into a remarkable legacy of service,"" Obama said in a statement. The Brady Campaign also acknowledged his death in a tweet: ""We are heartbroken over James Brady's passing. We offer our deepest condolences to his wife, Sarah, and their family."" Opinion: Congress, finish the job on Brady background checks . Brady was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award. The White House press briefing room also was named in his honor. Marlin Fitzwater, Reagan's longest-serving press secretary, remembered Brady as an enormous talent. ""He knew how information flowed in the city of Washington and he had a great sense of humor that the press liked and respected,"" Fitzwater told CNN. ""He is a remarkable guy who will be remembered well by everyone who knew him."" Brady's gun activism included lending a hand to other organizations with similar goals. He and his wife, Sarah, appeared in a 2011 ad for the group Americans for Responsible Solutions, an organization formed by former congresswoman Gabrielle Gifford's and her husband, Mark Kelly, after she was shot and severely wounded at a campaign event in Arizona. Former first lady Nancy Reagan said Brady was a wise counselor whose judgment her husband trusted. ""Jim was the personification of courage and perseverance.  He and Sarah never gave up, and never stopped caring about the causes in which they believed,"" she said in a statement. James Brady on gun control and mental illness .

How about with some favorite haunts, where alcohol wouldn't be caught dead without a chaser of intoxicating kitsch. The Bigfoot Lodge . Theme: Cabin in the woods . Neighborhood: Atwater Village . Signature drink: Toasted Marshmallow (1921 Tequila Cream, rum, honey, fernet, toasty marshmallows) The great outdoors concept runs sufficiently wild at this treasured bar full of stuffed rodents and a local crowd of Angelenos drinking 'round the fire like they're actually coming in from the cold. Smokey the Bear stands guard at the front entrance. A Sasquatch statue looms by the bar, along with an animatronic squirrel with an ax. Wait staff hustle around in flannel serving drinks called Girl Scout Cookie and Backwoods Banana Hammock. Are you in the Sierras or just some tame bedroom community wedged between L.A. and the Valley? After enough $5 Moscow Mules at happy hour (5-9 p.m.) this may actually turn into a debate. The Bigfoot Lodge, 3172 Los Feliz, Los Angeles; + 323 662 9227 . Good Times at Davey Wayne's . Theme: '70s . Neighborhood: Hollywood . Signature drink: ""Some People Call Me Maurice"" (Cinnamon-infused Vida mezcal, Crème de Cacao, Crème de Menthe, coffee, cream) In hipster Hollywood, theme bars come and go about as fast as the latest cocktail craze. One of the latest hit drinking scenes looks like it's been here since Marcia Brady threw that crazy, naughty house party when Mike and Carol were away for the weekend. While that may be an episode we all sadly missed, fans of the grooviest bygone decade can play it out themselves in this fake '70s-style house and patio -- cleverly hiding behind a fridge door in the back of a faux garage. Inside it's a swirl of green couches, homey lamps, family photos and hockey trophies on the mantle. DJs spin T. Rex and old Rod Stewart atop a wood-encased TV set. Bartenders pour Old Fashioneds on tap. Out back, crowds veg in hammocks and gather 'round a converted Airstream trailer where sno-cone cocktails are served by a guy sporting a pre-""Dance Fever"" moustache. Best of all, Mom and Dad never seem to come home here. Good Times at Davey Wayne's, 1611 N. El Centro Ave., Los Angeles; + 323 962 3804 . Tiki-Ti . Theme: Polynesian . Neighborhood: Silver Lake . Signature drink: Ray's Mistake (Botanic liqueurs, passion fruit, dark corub rum, ""secret"" flavors) Never judge a bar by its size. The yardstick of L.A. tiki bars, Tiki-Ti (which can barely fit a yardstick inside of it) has been confirming this wise adage since 1961 when patrons began squeezing into this family-run, overly adorned, shack-like landmark on outer Sunset Boulevard -- home to some of the strongest fruity cocktails between here and Vanuatu. Crammed with an ever-accruing inventory of tiki masks and other South Pacific bric-a-brac (regulars keep bringing in stuff for the walls), the bar's dozen stools and handful of tables draw a mishmash of east side hipsters and Jimmy Buffet types. And a line on weekends. Nearly 100 tropical libations are on the drink menu, which includes an Uga Booga (but no wine or beer) and a cocktail wheel for indecisive types to spin. Other crowd pleasers include a smoke-like-it's-the-'70s policy inside and enough atmosphere to fill a hundred Trader Vic's. Cash only. Tiki-Ti, 4427 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood; +1 323 669 9381 . Saddle Ranch Chop House . Theme: Urban cowboy . Neighborhood: West Hollywood . Signature drink: Ranch AMF (vodka, gin, rum, tequila, sweet and sour, Blue Curaçao) A big ol' wooden lair done up with hay bales, aged farming equipment, driftwood signs reading ""Rustlers will be shot"" and mannequins in racy Western regalia peaking out of second story windows, this steak and taters place with about 100 TVs serves massive enough drinks and ambiance to qualify as an honorary theme bar. Even on the flashy Sunset Strip, Saddle Ranch Chop House stands out a mite. It's a knee-slappingly welcome relief from the usual velvet-rope attitude doled out on this street. Cocktails are served in 1 ½-liter carafes. Out on the patio, there are campfire pits for do-it-yourself s'more roasting. And, yes, there's a mechanical bull. It's the only one (we know of) in Los Angeles -- aside from the three you'll find in a larger Saddle Ranch location just over the hill at Universal CityWalk. Saddle Ranch Chop House, 8371 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood; +1 323 656 2007 . El Carmen . Theme: Mexican cantina . Neighborhood: Mid-City West . Signature drink: La Seductora (Herradura Reposado tequila, agave nectar, watermelon juice, lime juice, cucumbers, mint) Are fiery walls aglow with Mexican wrestling posters, 'round-the-calendar Christmas lights and a bull's head enough to transport you from the actual location of this compact drinking hive (seven blocks from the Beverly Center) into Lucha Libre land? Por que no? Especially when factoring in the bar's huge selection of tequilas (more than 400 at last count) and tasty antojitos menu. On any given weekend night the place is filled with a mezcal-conversant crowd still young enough to count Thursdays as the weekend. And most Wednesdays. El Carmen, 8138 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles: +1 323 852 1551 . Good Luck Bar . Theme: Far East . Neighborhood: Los Feliz . Signature drink: Yee Mee Loo (vodka, white rum, pineapple juice, coconut cream, Blue Curaçao) It should come as no surprise in L.A. that the city's most alluringly overdone Old Orient lounge has been hiding for years on a drab corner of outer Hollywood Boulevard across from an Auto Zone and next door to a vacuum and janitorial supplies store. Don't be put off by the misleading exteriors. It's what's inside that counts. Namely, every opium den decor cliche on the list. Paper lanterns. Bamboo stools. Dragons on the ceiling. Cozy rooms with walls as red as Mao's Little Book. And don't forget the last-call gong. All very authentic feeling after enough Singapore Slings. Good Luck Bar, 1514 Hillhurst Ave., Los Angeles; +1 323 666 3524 . Jordan Rane writes regularly for CNN Travel and The Los Angeles Times.

"NATO has grappled with many perilous issues in its more than six decades of existence. But it's had few times quite like this. That was obvious Thursday, as leaders of the trans-Atlantic alliance's member countries met in Wales. They discussed everything from Afghanistan to the Middle East to Ukraine, each of which has its own special significance and presents its own unique military and diplomatic challenges. ""We meet at a crucial time in the history of our alliance,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said at the outset of the two-day summit. ""The world faces many dangerous and evolving threats, and it is absolutely clear that NATO is as vital to our future as it has been in our past."" There was no indication given that NATO, as a group, will be deploying more ground troops anytime soon to any new conflict -- as it has done before most recently following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Still, the alliance is looking at a range of options to combat a range of diverse threats. Here's a look at a few developments on those front, broken down by region: . Iraq and Syria . NATO has only invoked Article 5 -- which mandates all countries come to the aid of another member of the alliance -- one time, in response to the al Qaeda threat following 9/11. Now, its member states are intensely focused on ISIS, a relatively new terrorist group that has rampaged through the Middle East, executing American journalists and threatening more Westerners' lives. No one is saying that NATO is about to repeat what it did over 12 years ago, including sending legions of ground troops into a country as it did Afghanistan. But its leaders are certainly talking tough about ISIS and the prospect of NATO playing a role in attacking it. Any request by Iraq to NATO for aid in fighting ISIS would be ""considered seriously,"" according to NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who noted the Iraqi government hasn't reached out yet to the alliance. The United States, however, has coordinated with the Baghdad government to launch airstrikes on ISIS fighters in Iraq and opened the door for similar attacks in Syria. Cameron told CNN that his country supports these American strikes and could take part in further military action. ""We don't rule anything out,"" said Cameron, adding that he wants ISIS ""squeezed out of existence."" ""We will act with partners in our national interest,"" Cameron said. Yet he, like U.S. officials, stressed that military might alone won't end the threat posed by the Islamist militant group. Cameron said it's imperative local and national authorities in the Middle East take control and offer their citizens a government they can rely on. ""We must recognize,"" Cameron said, ""that what's required is helping those on the ground, rather than some Western intervention (that is) completely over their heads and (leaves) them to pick up the pieces."" Ukraine . NATO countries' work with the governments of Iraq and Syria have been mixed, at best. For Iraq, they criticized Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki until he was forced out of office, then worked closely with his successor to go after ISIS. For Syria, they've refused to cooperate at all with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- even if he and NATO share a common enemy in ISIS. Ukraine, though, is a different story. Western leaders have made a point of supporting the Kiev-based government as it combats a rebel movement that, its officials say, has been supported in most every which way by the Kremlin. And even as Moscow denies any direct involvement, Western officials have demanded the Russia withdraw thousands of troops they say have crossed the border and shelled Ukrainian forces, not to mention pull its troops back from the border. ""This is the first time since the end of World War II that one European country has tried to grab another's territory by force,"" said Rasmussen on Thursday. ""Europe must not turn away from the rule of law to the rule of strongest."" But what can NATO countries do about it? U.S. President Barack Obama, for one, promised this week that ""we will defend our NATO allies."" But Ukraine isn't part of that alliance, and Obama hasn't suggested he'll send American troops to faceoff with Russian forces in the country. Ukraine, however, is working more and more closely with NATO, as evidenced by the Wales summit. Rasmussen said NATO will give nearly $20 million for Ukraine's military and focus on bolstering its cyber-defense, logistics and command and control capabilities. ""It is definitely a landmark event,"" President Petro Poroshenko said of the ""strong, enormous support"" that NATO government leaders have afforded Ukraine at the Wales summit. ""(Cooperation is) at the highest level during the 20-year history of the partnership between Ukraine and NATO."" Opinion: NATO's moment of truth on Ukraine . Afghanistan . Afghanistan is where NATO has had its biggest, and most long-lasting, footprint outside of Europe. But that is changing -- or at least NATO's mission in the south Asian nation is changing. Exactly how is up in the air, in part to a crisis related to Afghanistan's recent presidential election. Despite efforts by the Taliban to disrupt the election, about 8 million votes were cast on June 14, with provisional results showing Ashraf Ghani ahead with roughly 56% support to 43% for Abdullah Abdullah, according to the country's Independent Elections Commission. Yet both candidates have alleged large-scale voter fraud and manipulation, and Abdullah hasn't conceded. That's left the nation in limbo -- to this point, the inauguration of the new president was pushed back indefinitely from the first week of August, as an audit of the vote is conducted -- and NATO's International Security Assistance Force in limbo as well. That's because current Afghan President Hamid Karzai had refused to sign what's known as a Status of Forces Agreement that would set the terms of keeping international forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of this year. Both Ghani and Abduallah have said they'd sign it, but -- since neither is in office -- they can't. There is also the threat that the election crisis could lead to internal fighting in Afghanistan, further destabilizing an already turbulent nation dealing with a Taliban insurgency. Rasmussen said Thursday that his alliance hopes to continue its efforts in Afghanistan through ""a new, non-combat mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan forces starting next year."" But ""without a signature"" on the Status of Forces Agreement, ""there can be no mission,"" he added. ""Although our military commanders have shown great flexibility in their planning, time is short,"" Rasmussen added. ""The sooner the legal framework is in place, the better.""","NATO chief: ""Time is short"" for a deal on international forces in Afghanistan .

"(CNN)Ask any mom or dad to name one of the biggest challenges about parenting today, and you will probably get an earful about the constant judgment they face about their decisions. Breast vs. bottle, stay-at-home vs. work outside the home, natural birth vs. drug-assisted delivery, baby carrier vs. stroller. It's not just what you decide but the disapproval you face from the opposing camp. Trust me, I've been there. It is truly ridiculous when you think about it, which is exactly the point of a hilarious and moving new ad by formula maker Similac. The commercial, which has now been seen more than 4 million times on YouTube, pits the rival camps against each other on (where else?) the playground. There are the stroller moms, the moms with baby carriers, the working moms, the stay-at-home moms, the stay-at-home dads and of course the ""breast is best"" crowd pitted against the bottle-feeders. ""Oh, look. The breast police have arrived,"" says one of the moms holding a bottle. ""100% breastfed. Straight from the source,"" a breastfeeder fires back. If only these kinds of exchanges were simply the creation of comedy writers, but sadly, they're not. Moms, stop all the judgment! Neither is a verbal volley like this one in the ad: ""I wonder what it's like being a part-time mom,"" says a stay-at-home mom. A working mom tartly responds, ""I wonder what they do all day."" Another mom in a suit answers, ""Mani-pedis."" And, just when all these moms and dads get ready to literally rumble in the sandbox, moving closer and closer to each other, a stroller with a baby inside goes flying downhill after her mom lets go of the handle. As the moms and dads start realizing what happened, they all chase after the stroller until finally the stroller is caught and the delicious baby inside is saved. That leads to smiles, hugs and handshakes all around, and this line on the screen: ""No matter what our beliefs, we are parents first."" Love. That. Line. Misha Pardubicka-Jenkins, director of marketing for Abbott, the maker of Similac, said the ad is a direct response to what she and her colleagues have heard from parents. ""They feel judged. It's not about (bottle)-feeding vs. breastfeeding. It's bigger than that. It is from the type of diapers you choose, whether it's disposable or cloth, to sleep training to when do you start potty training to feeding,"" Pardubicka-Jenkins said. ""We want parents to feel supported however they parent, and that's that."" Brutally Honest: Is it OK to let a child fail? I posted the ad on my Facebook page, and the parents who responded loved it. ""I think the messaging is brilliant,"" said Sue Scheff, an author, parent advocate and family Internet safety advocate. ""Parents are so busy judging each other, they forget the big picture, the little ones, the exact ones we are supposed to be role models for."" Tish Howard, a retired elementary school principal, wholeheartedly agreed. ""When we wonder why the art of professional debate is gone, just look at how we reply on Facebook to differing opinions. We could learn so very much from each other. Our children live what they learn."" But, there are some critics: namely fathers' groups who say the ad missed a key opportunity to showcase how much today's dads are involved in modern parenting. Brent Almond, founder of the blog Designer Daddy, wrote that he appreciated that dads were represented as one of the ""gangs"" and how the commercial touched on how, too often, fathers are made to feel less capable than mothers. But his beef has to do with the final tagline, ""Welcome to the Sisterhood of Motherhood"" and the hashtag #SisterhoodUnite. ""Why go to the trouble to include fathers at all, if you're just going to erase them with the final shot,"" wrote Almond. ""Don't throw dads a bone only to snatch it away at the last minute. It's irresponsible, disingenuous, and just plain inconsistent. ... The omission of fathers from the final frames of the ad is completely contrary to the message of the campaign -- that we're all in this together."" Do modern dads get enough credit? In response, the company says that ""Sisterhood of Motherhood"" is a mindset and a campaign that is designed to be universal. ""Our campaign includes everybody. Moms, dads, grandparents, passerbys, people who don't have children. Let's all support the parents who are out there trying their best,"" Pardubicka-Jenkins said. Of course, since Similac is one of the leading formulas for babies, you have to wonder how much of the ad is a way to buttress the bottle-feeding moms and increase interest in formula, especially with breastfeeding on the rise in America. In the United States, 77% of infants start out breastfeeding, according to a 2013 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (PDF). The report states that 49% of infants were breastfeeding at 6 months in 2010; that's up from 35% in 2000. During the same time period, the breastfeeding rate at 12 months jumped from 16% to 27%. Pardubicka-Jenkins said the ad, produced by the Publicis Kaplan Thaler agency, is about more than bottle-feeding vs. breastfeeding. The product, she notes, isn't even showcased in the ad. Why are we still so squeamish about breastfeeding? The company hopes it's starting a conversation about modern parenting, which parents will keep having on playgrounds, and in workplaces and parking lots. ""As a mom of three, one of the most difficult things I've experienced personally is when people questioned the decisions that I made about raising my children in my family,"" said Pardubicka-Jenkins, a mom of twins about to turn 8 and a 5-year-old. ""So I'll bet there isn't a mom or dad that's reading your site that's not shaking their heads saying, 'I'm in agreement. I've experienced this. You're talking to me. Finally.'

"(CNN)Forget about the Super Bowl, the blizzard and the woes of the world. This time of year, everything's better with puppies. Seems like you can't throw a stick without running into a shaggy (or short-haired) dog story -- and advertisers, in particular, know that puppies demand attention. Take GoDaddy.com. In recent years, the website registration and hosting company has earned the ire of many with its cheeky Super Bowl ads featuring voluptuous women and suggestive copy. Not that it's stopped them from doing the same thing again the next year. But an ad about a puppy that's put up for sale? That's going too far. A Change.org petition garnered more than 40,000 signatures before word came that the ad wouldn't air during the big game. Budweiser, of course, would never provoke the anger of puppy lovers. The beer company has become a master of pulling America's heartstrings with its Super Bowl commercials, which have included, in recent years, some friendly canines. This year, of course, is no different. Get out your tissues. ""Budweiser unveils the commercial that will make you cry on Super Bowl Sunday,"" headlined USA Today. Take that, GoDaddy! (And yes, that's a version of the Proclaimers' ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" as the soundtrack. No doubt even the brothers Reid are weeping.) Finally, Uber, the ride-sharing app that has picked up quite a bit of bad press in recent months, has come up with a surefire way of earning public approval. If you guessed that it involves puppies, you're right. The company announced Wednesday that it's teaming up with Animal Planet, which broadcasts the annual Puppy Bowl, to deliver puppies to offices in several U.S. cities. It's not free -- the price is $30 for 15 minutes of doggone fun -- but all proceeds go to participating local animal organizations. All together now: Awwwww. What's that? You're not a dog person? Well, there's always the second-annual Kitten Bowl, to be shown Sunday on the Hallmark Channel. And cats can be heartwarming, too, as shown by a widely shared story out of Tampa, Florida. As originally reported by Tampa's WTVT, Bart the cat was hit by a car and pronounced dead. The cat's grief-stricken owner, Ellis Hutson, had the cat buried. Five days later, Bart showed up at a neighbor's door. His jaw was broken, and he was dirty and bloody -- but he was alive. ""It was unbelievable,"" Hutson said. ""The cat was smelly; the cat was dirty. The cat had a big hole in the side of his head."" 'Zombie cat' presumed dead found alive five days after burial . A veterinarian at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay performed surgery, and Bart, though he'll probably lose an eye, is recovering nicely. ""I truly think Bart has nine lives and has eight lives left, because it is miraculous what he's done,"" Humane Society of Tampa Bay Executive Director Sherry Silk told the TV station. So to heck with that football game and us crazy humans. We'll say it again: Awwwwwww.","The Super Bowl and puppies! What more is there to say?
GoDaddy, Budweiser and Uber find value in puppy marketing .
GoDaddy has already pulled a puppy-themed ad after a backlash ."
"(CNN)Are you tired of seeing the bumbling, clueless, buffoon-like dads in commercials -- the ones whose biggest contribution to child rearing is uttering ""Yes dear"" as their partners do all the work? I am and so are countless other men and women. And now, it seems, Madison Avenue is getting the message. In Sunday's Super Bowl -- which will be seen by more than 100 million people if last year's telecast is any indication -- a handful of ads will showcase dads as they really are (what a concept!) -- as loving, caring, supportive, helpful and major figures in their children's lives. ""It's about time,"" said Buzz Bishop, a father of two in Calgary, Alberta, and founder of the blog Dad Camp. One of the brands is Dove Men+Care, which is re-releasing its widely popular ad that debuted last year for Father's Day. The ad celebrates fathers with vignettes of children of all ages saluting their individual dad by calling him ""Daddy,"" ""Da-Da"" or ""Dad."" It will be showcased in a 60-second spot during the big game. (NBC is charging around $4.5 million for 30-second commercials, according to CNN Money.) I tear up every time I watch it. ""This provides a counter-narrative to all the action hero, buffoon images that we see,"" said Michael Kimmel, professor of sociology and gender studies at Stony Brook University on Long Island. He also heads up the school's Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities. Kimmel was hired by Dove Men+Care as an adviser to help analyze and build on research that the brand conducted last year on how men view masculinity. No more dumb old Dad: Changing the bumbling Dad stereotype . The study, which involved online surveys with more than 1,000 men in the United States and 2,000 men in the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil and China, found that only 7% of men can relate to the way the media depicts masculinity. Men today are spending far more time doing housework, helping with childcare and enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in American history, and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well, said Kimmel, who is also the author of more than 20 books including ""Manhood in America: A Cultural History."" Think about it: Seattle Seahawks star Richard Sherman said there is a chance he could miss the Super Bowl if his girlfriend goes into labor on Game Day. Would that have happened years ago? Kimmel said his father grew up at a time that very much matched the experiences of the character Don Draper in ""Mad Men."" ""I grew up thinking my world would look like Don Draper's but it looked nothing like that,"" said Kimmel. ""And my son (age 16) ... absolutely knows that his world will not look like that."" Other brands getting high marks from fathers craving a realistic portrayal of dads today include Nissan, which released a preview clip of its ad -- its first Super Bowl commercial in 18 years. The ad appears to showcase a race car driver balancing his high-stakes work with the birth of a child. As CNN Money reports, the soundtrack of the ad is Harry Chapin's immensely popular song ""Cat's Cradle,"" which is about a father who is too busy at work and can't spend much time with his son. Nissan back in Super Bowl after 18 years . In advance of the airing of the commercial on Sunday, Nissan also has launched a social media campaign at WithDad.Com, inviting people on YouTube to submit videos about what fatherhood means to them. Doug French, co-founder of the Dad 2.0 Summit, one of the largest gatherings of parenting writers, dad bloggers and online personalities and now in its fourth year, says brands are increasingly realizing that dads are consumers and caregivers too. ""It's no longer a viable thing to try and hook in the moms by sending a collective eye roll at the dads,"" said French. He remembered how Huggies, just a few years ago, released an ad showing how fathers were pretty much incapable of staying with their kids for a week while their wives were gone. Petitions followed, and Huggies took action, releasing new ads showing dads caring for their children and attending conferences like the Dad 2.0 Summit, said French. ""We've seen the needle move from flawlessness in the '50s to absolute helplessness in the '90s and now we kind of want the needle to come back down the center where it should be,"" he said. ""We're not Superman, but we're not idiots either,"" said French. In conversations with dads, mainly through email, about the new ads, including Toyota's campaign showcasing former football players talking about the role their fathers played in their lives, they applauded the move by brands and talked about the larger impact especially on boys and young men. ""While football displays one form of entertaining masculinity, it is important for boys to see that masculinity or being 'like a boy' also includes caregiving, compassion and sacrifice for family,"" said Vincent O'Keefe, a former professor, writer and stay-at-home father of two girls, who is currently working on a memoir about gender and parenting. Bishop, the father of two in Calgary, said ""good positive portrayals"" of modern fathers are needed because they are ""a legitimate driver of public opinion and attitudes."" ""When commercials say gay couples are 'OK' or interracial marriage is 'OK' or involved fathers are 'OK,' then people come out of their shell and buy in,"" said Bishop. ""Advertising doesn't just sell products, it very much shapes public opinion."" How to Super Bowl #LikeAGirl . Jim Higley, a father of three and a radio host, writer and founder of Bobblehead Dad and spokesman for the Dove Men+Care brand, said there remains a ""big gap"" between what men see on the screen and how they feel in real life. ""Caring for my family is the most important thing in my life. It defines me as a man,"" said Higley, who said it is ""refreshing"" to see ""a little bit of reality"" in Super Bowl commercials. ""Our self-worth is wrapped up in the people we love and our ability to care for them. It's the new definition of strength for a men,"" he added. Of course, brands are ultimately driven by profits, and so those that reflect men as they are today stand to earn more than just a feeling of goodwill. ""People who get it right are going to reap major benefits,"" said French of the Dad 2.0 Summit. John Furjanic, a single father of a 7-year-old in Chicago, summed it up this way. He's received some attention from single women who are taken with his involvement in his daughter's life. ""It makes sense that advertisers would follow the trend.""

"(CNN)A team piloting a helium-filled balloon across the Pacific has set two major ballooning records. On Friday, the Two Eagles balloon, piloted by American Troy Bradley and Russian Leonid Tiukhtyaev, surpassed a gas balloon world record for duration aloft. The record of 137 hours, 5 minutes, 50 seconds was set by Double Eagle II on a 1978 transatlantic flight. According to rules set by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, the record must be surpassed by 1% in order to qualify as a new record. The Two Eagles reached that point Friday at 10:51 a.m. ET. Officially, the record hasn't been broken. It may be weeks or months before the U.S. National Aeronautic Association reviews and documents it. Friday's duration achievement follows another milestone Thursday, when the balloonists surpassed a 1981 distance record for gas balloons, set by Double Eagle V. Under the same rule, the balloonists had to best the 1981 record of 5,208 miles or 8,382.54 kilometers by 1%. With that distance margin safely surpassed, the balloon is expected to land Saturday on the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, completing its 6,000-mile journey. The Two Eagles balloon launched from Saga, Japan, on January 24. The pilots and the support team on the ground have been tweeting about the journey.","Balloon expedition across the Pacific sets two gas ballooning records .

That's the $5 million message from jurors in California regarding the soul-funk music icon, known for classic Sly and the Family Stone hits such as ""Everyday People, "" ""If You Want Me to Stay,"" ""Dance to the Music"" and ""Family Affair."" On Tuesday, a Los Angeles Superior Court civil jury found for Stone in his breach-of-contract lawsuit against Even St. Productions, manager Jerry Goldstein and attorney Glenn Stone, awarding him $5 million in royalties and damages. ""This is one for the good guys,"" Los Angles trial lawyer Nicholas Hornberger said. ""These people cheated him and took all his money."" In his lawsuit, Stone (whose legal name is Sylvester Stewart) alleged that Goldstein and Glenn Stone ""without the permission of Sly Stone, have received, borrowed, and continue to receive millions of dollars in royalties or derived from royalties,"" according to the Los Angeles Times. ""They would give him a little money so he would sign stuff,"" Hornberger said. ""They had him sign all sorts of complicated contracts he would never understand, and he just wanted to make music. They just wanted his royalties."" By 2011, Stone was reportedly homeless, living out of a van. He had sued Goldstein in 2010, accusing him of stealing his royalties. Attorney Gregory Bodell, who represents Goldstein and Glenn Stone, said his clients plan to appeal. ""We are disappointed with the verdict, and we believe the jury didn't understand"" all of the evidence, Bodell said. ""It's plain to me from the jury award, evidence and other information I've received subsequently"" that the jury miscalculated the verdict, he said. It's not clear how long it would take the singer to collect the entire jury award, given the other side's plans to appeal. However, Hornberger says the court has control of $2 million or $3 million in royalties paid out during the lawsuit because they were deposited with the court. He said he expects the court to rule on future royalties and other matters within a month or two.","Music icon Sly Stone wins a $5 million jury verdict .

Heck, it's now probably stuck in your own head right now, even if you have never seen the film. So why has the 2013 movie stuck around for so long for the under-5 set? Experts say it is not just because you can find images of movie's sisters on everything. Elsa and Anna are on dresses, on scooters and, just in time for the Easter season, even on jelly beans. To understand the psychology behind ""Frozen"" Mania, CNN reached out to psychologists who are sisters themselves: Yalda Uhls is regional director for Common Sense Media. Maryam Kia-Keating is an associate professor of clinical psychology at University of California, Santa Barbara. Here is our edited conversation. CNN: Princess movies have been around since the beginning of time, but this has really resonated. What has made this one so unique? Yalda Uhls: One of the things that really struck me, and I think struck little children, is that there is a really strong intergenerational, family-themed message here. Despite the sisters Anna and Elsa being separated for so long, the story is ultimately about the bond between the two of them. When you're little, that is your zone; that's your group; they define your world. Highlighting that and making it feel important -- your sister, your brother, your mom and dad -- is something little kids can really identify with. Maryam Kia-Keating: Kids can really understand the idea of their sister wanting to play with them, and sometimes not, but still having a strong family bond. Ultimately, it's about the love between the sisters. That's a message that many little children understand. There are also good lessons about overcoming struggles and facing life challenges. But, what's interesting about preschoolers, in particular, is there's this loyalty and unrelenting interest to watch this movie over and over again. Part of it is because it was so well done, but there are some themes that younger kids can really identify with. My 4-year-old daughter told me that she also liked that it didn't have a witch. I wouldn't have thought that until she said it, but it made me more thoughtful about all the other movies -- great movies -- that have scary witches and themes in them. This was something that little kids under 5 aren't going to have nightmares about. CNN: Why is not having a witch important to a preschooler? Kia-Keating: When you're an adult, you've heard a lot of these stories, like ""Snow White"" or ""Cinderella,"" and you forget the power they can have. It's helpful to have a child's point of view on this. Kids are living in this world where the line between what's real and what's not really is blurry, and because they have such vivid imaginations, witches and monsters can feel very real. As adults, we may see these villains or monsters as a way to tell a story or a lesson, but when children are in the moment of being scared, they are caught up in the fear and not in finding the larger lesson. Uhls: I used to work in the film industry, and as adults, we're told that we need conflict to drive drama. Take Grimm's Fairy Tales; there are always dire stakes. Or movies like ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King,"" where the mother or father die. These are serious issues and themes, and sometimes little kids aren't ready to process and understand these ideas. CNN: What about the characters seem so easy for kids to empathize with? Uhls: Preschooler imaginations are really strong, and so they respond really well to stories with magical realism. In ""Frozen,"" Princess Elsa has these powers to control ice and snow -- and that really captures kids' imaginations. When you're small, you don't feel powerful. Everyone is always dictating what you can and cannot do. Having a character they can empathize with that has these powers can make them feel more empowered, as well. Kia-Keating: That magical piece is exciting and is one of the things that really sets this movie apart from others. Another aspect that kids see themselves in Elsa and Anna is the impulsiveness. Parents are constantly trying to teach their little ones how to self-regulate their emotions, how to behave, how to sit down. Elsa is constantly trying to tame or control her emotions -- and while this is something that is salient to everyone throughout their lifetimes, this is something preschoolers deal with all the time. CNN: The song ""Let It Go"": It's everywhere, and kids can't stop singing it. What is it about this anthem? Kia-Keating:  My 4-year-old came home and learned the song before we had even seen the movie. One of the lines she and all her friends connected to was ""Be the good girl that you always have to be."" And when they sing it, they wag their fingers like they do in the movie. I think it looks a lot like something they see and hear from parents -- be a good girl or boy, don't do this or that -- so part of it is copying what they frequently hear. But when I asked my daughter what she thought the song was about, she said it was about ""Elsa being happy and free, and nobody bothering her."" That's a message that everyone wants: to be happy and free. Here's when you'll get to see that 'Frozen' short film .","Disney's ""Frozen"" is the top-grossing animated film of all time .
Psychologists say the success of ""Frozen"" involves universal themes about family and being good .
""Let It Go"" appeals to children who seek happiness, freedom and struggle to control their impulses ."
"(CNN)A little more than a decade ago, Idaho high school running back Tyler Wright was scoring touchdowns for the Boise High Braves. On Sunday, he'll pilot an Army helicopter over the NFL world championship. ""I can't believe my son is flying over the Super Bowl,"" RaeAnn ""Annie"" Smith told CNN on the phone from her home. You can understand why she's so excited. Around kickoff time, when opera star soprano Renée Fleming sings ""...And the home of the brave...""  80,000 fans in the stands — and millions more on TV — will watch Wright and his eight fellow pilots soar high over East Rutherford, New Jersey's, MetLife Stadium. Does anyone you know ever get a chance to do that? Probably not.  ""It's a once in a lifetime career opportunity that you get to do this,"" Wright said in a phone call Friday with CNN. A bit of advice: Don't blink on Sunday, or you might miss them and their amazing military hardware. You'll see a V-shaped wedge formation of three workhorse Black Hawks, three Apache attack helicopters and three Chinook heavy-lifters — those are the big choppers with the double rotors whirling on top.   Total cost, the Pentagon tells CNN: about $100,000. Military flyovers at the Super Bowl have been around a while. The first was at 1968's Super Bowl II, when Air Force jets thrilled spectators at Miami's Orange Bowl. Related: Unpublished photos of Super Bowl I . Wright, like his eight comrades, has paid some dues to get here, ending up with a tour in Afghanistan. His journey started as a boy, dreaming of piloting aircraft. But at first Wright chose a more conventional path, considering a career as a veterinarian and then a pharmacist. He did stints at two universities, but it was no use.  As his mom put it, ""The flying thing just bit him."" Wright first soloed in a small plane in 2008 and then enrolled in commercial flight school. That meant packing up a car with his wife and young daughter and driving 2,500 miles to Florida. After graduation Wright chose military service over an airline job. ""He loves his country, and he wanted to serve,"" his mom said. In 2012, Wright left his then-pregnant wife and 7-year-old daughter behind to join the war in Afghanistan. Turns out, Wright was really good at flying Black Hawks, his mom said. ""I love helicopters,"" Wright said. ""And I like the versatility of the Black Hawk,"" especially hauling supplies and soldiers in and out of combat zones with the 101st Airborne Combat Aviation Brigade. As he put it, moving the ""bullets and beans ... and troops."" Flying a chopper in a war zone got a little hairy at times for some of the pilots in the unit, Wright said, but, ""we knew what to do and how to react."" When Wright's tour ended last May, he returned to his base at Fort Campbell, Kentucky — and a newborn son. One night recently, Wright's mother was working her part-time second job at a department store, when her cell phone rang. ""Tyler said, 'Mom, I'm calling to give you some good news ... I'm going to fly my Black Hawk over the Super Bowl.' I thought he was kind of teasing. I said, 'Seriously, Tyler?' Yep."" The band of brothers who'll be flying Sunday are all friends — a really tight-knit group, said Wright, part of Bravo Company 5-101, ""The Lancers."" Last year at this time, some of them were watching the Super Bowl on TV half a world away. Now they're among the stars of the show. So, how does a military flyover at a football stadium work, exactly? Well, it's tricky, especially in the New York metro area, which is the busiest aviation corridor in the nation. Normally pilots flying in the region have to be aware of traffic from multiple airports, including Newark Liberty airport south of the stadium and Teterboro airport, which is north. Let's not forget the traffic from JFK and LaGuardia. But hey, this is the SUPER BOWL. Special privileges apply. Basically the Federal Aviation Administration has cleared the airspace on Sunday. Traffic: not a problem. Check. Next, good pilots always keep an eye on the weather. Wright's no different. The game-time forecast calls for west to northwesterly winds at 10 mph with temperatures in the upper 30s or low 40s. Although there's a slight chance of light rain, Wright is confident conditions should be good enough to get the job done. Check. Then the hardest part: Wright and his fellow pilots have to time their flyover to the second. The mission: Soar across the stadium during the final note of the ""Star Spangled Banner."" Beginning at a holding area, Wright and his fellow pilots coordinate via radio with controllers on the ground. They know exactly how long it will take for them to reach their destination. In the military the procedure is called ""time on target"" — aka T.O.T. It's all part of the job of being a military pilot. That's just what we do, Wright said, ""be at a specific place at a specific time."" Come flyover time — back in Boise — Wright's friends and family plan to be watching. And cheering.

"Washington (CNN)They are the care-givers who help nurse our nation's wounded warriors back to health, and some level of self-reliance. And until CNN got involved, the Department of Defense was about to significantly cut their reimbursements for lodging, meals, and incidentals, which allow them to do their important work. ""My job (was) to be with my son pretty much 24/7,"" Morgen Hummel, the mother of Sgt. Adam Hartswick, told CNN. Hartswick, an Army senior combat medic, lost both his legs after an improvised explosive device detonated under him in Zhari Province, Afghanistan, in 2013. ""Not only did my son lose his legs ... but then financially if you got to worry about -- is my house going to be here when I get back from tending to my son, that's a double whammy,"" Hummel said. The Department of Defense reimbursement allowed Hummel to leave her job to care for her son, ""and not worry that I couldn't pay my mortgage when I came back."" The Pentagon classifies caregivers such as Hummel as NMAs, or ""non-medical attendants."" They are sometimes family, or friends, or others, who work with troops who have been severely wounded, often with missing limbs or debilitating brain injuries. They treat their wounds, help them re-learn how to stand, or walk, or speak, and nurse them to as much independence as they can achieve. All this was at risk when a Pentagon rule went into effect on Nov. 1, 2014, that sought to eliminate $22 million from the budget by discouraging excessive travel for both uniformed and civilian employees of the Department of Defense. That rule would have cut the per diem to 55% reimbursement for lodging, meals and incidental expenses for those whose work extended beyond six months, or 181 days. Obviously, the work done by these NMAs can last far beyond half a year. One wounded warrior, worried that the rule change would cost him his caregiver and thus risk his recovery, reached out to CNN. We in turn contacted the Pentagon, demanding to know why these crucial funds were being cut. To its tremendous credit, the Pentagon acknowledged the problem and fixed it immediately. The original rule was an attempt to discourage unnecessary travel, a spokesperson for Pentagon told CNN, but NMAs got swept up in the rule inadvertently. ""We want to thank you Jake and CNN for bringing it to our attention because we had not seen this unintended consequence of what was, in every other respect a very sound an judicious financial policy. But you brought it to our attention,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told us. ""And we were able to get it changed within a week."" NMAs will continue to be reimbursed as long as they need to be, and those NMAs affected by the November 2014 budget rule will be able to claim back money spent during that time. What would have happened to attendants, and the wounded warriors for whom NMAs care without that funding? ""I would have had to leave Adam and I think his dad would have, too,"" Hummel speculates. ""We wouldn't have been able to stay with Adam and I'm sure he wouldn't be as far along in his recovery and I would say that for anybody. They need that help, they really do."" NMAs take up temporary residence wherever wounded warriors, still in the military, are cared for: at Walter Reed Medical Center, at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), at Madigan Army Medical Center, Navy Medical Center San Diego, at the Air Force 59th Medical Wing, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. When the troops transition out of the military, so too do their caregivers. Because numbers are kept on an installation level, it is difficult to pull together a full number of NMAs. There are currently 69 at Walter Reed, many of whom are there for more than 30 days. BAMC, Madigan, and Balboa have 22 NMAs, including 17 long-term. After Staff Sgt. John Faulkenberry had his right leg shot off during the Battle of Saret Koleh in Nuristan Province, Afghanistan, in July 2007, his wife Sarah had to quit her job as an event planner in Midland, Texas, and move to a modest hotel on the grounds of Walter Reed for 10 months. The per diem reimbursements as an NMA ""gave me the freedom to solely focus on him and his recovery,"" she tells CNN. ""You want to help them become independent,"" she says of her mission. But it was a long haul. Faulkenberry had dozens of surgeries on his leg as doctors constantly had to clean the wound, trying to save as much of it as they could. She helped him with daily living activities, getting food, using the rest room, and making appointments. She became trained in wound care and changing his bandages; she learned how to administer shots to deal with his blood clots; she was taught how to administer IV antibiotics to help him with his infections so he didn't have to stay in the hospital. She says she can't imagine going through that with added financial stresses. ""You don't need to be worrying about that sitting next to your husband who saw two guys killed and is bleeding everywhere,"" she says. It's even more difficult, Sarah says, for parents of wounded warriors who become NMAs, who don't get the military salaries that couples get. Such as Morgen Hummel who continues to care for her son Sgt. Adam Hartswick. ""At first we pretty much marathoned it with Adam. We would stay there from sunrise to sunset, and beyond,"" Hummel said. ""Having your mom there is important,"" Hartswick said. ""And having my dad there to, you know, wake me up in the middle of the night and keep me calm, that was vital to my recovery."" Hartswick has made great strides in regaining his independence. He is now out of the hospital, and even dating. Now, with these funds restored, families like Hartswick's will be able to continue the journey back from battle, together.","NMAs, or ""non-medical attendants"" work with troops who have been severely wounded .

"(CNN)As a non-sports aficionado, my attraction to game day festivities has been solely food focused. So naturally, I noticed how potato chips have taken less and less space on the snack table to make room for tortilla chips and guacamole. Although potato chips continue to be the top-selling salted snack in terms of pounds sold, tortilla chips have been increasing in sales at a faster pace than potato chips, especially during this time of year, according to Tom Dempsey, CEO of the Snack Food Association. And, it's not just tortilla chips selling at such high rates either. Make homemade tortilla chips . Tortillas -- not the chips but the round flat breads used to wrap burritos - have been outselling hamburger and hot dog buns at supermarkets and retail food stores since 2010. And salsa has been the new ketchup since 2008, according Jim Kabbani, CEO of the Tortilla Industry Association. One of the factors that contributes to that growth is immigration. As the Latino population grows, so will the variety of foods that cater to them. Especially since the Mexican-American population makes up the largest Hispanic group in the United States. Another factor that plays into the growth is that non-Hispanics have become more adventurous eaters, and companies want to cater to that, Kabbani said. While Mexican food in the United States has become ubiquitously American as apple pie, the backstory of how the crispy golden corn chip became the go-to snack chip hasn't really been told. In an effort to tell that story, nationally syndicated columnist of ¡Ask a Mexican! Gustavo Arellano wrote the book ""Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America."" In the early 1900s, tortilla chips were already being manufactured and distributed to local restaurants in southern California but were never really a big deal.  In fact, their creation was even an afterthought. These tostadas, as they are called in Mexico, were made from leftover tortilla dough. Go figure. It wasn't long before Frito-Lay executives noticed how everyone in those southern California restaurants was gobbling up tostadas, so they decided to make the chips, too.  They called their product ""Doritos,"" Spanish for ""little golden things."" Although few consider Doritos a tortilla chip, under all that cheesy seasoning is an oppressed golden tortilla chip - the first to be launched nationally in the United States. Shortly thereafter, tortilla chips made by other companies started to gain popularity - mostly driven by the rise of salsa, refried beans, and guacamole. But when nachos made their debut, it took tortillas chips to the next level. Side note: Nachos were a delicious accident. When two American customers walked into his restaurant in Mexico, head waiter Ignacio ""Nacho"" Ayala couldn't find the chef so he threw together some random ingredients and called them ""Nacho's Special,"" Arellano said. And the rest is history. Today, every NFL stadium and Major League Baseball offers nachos.  They're the third-largest concession seller overall, after popcorn and soda, outselling even hot dogs, Arellano notes. The rapid rise of nachos and guacamole persuaded Frito-Lay to make their own light, airy, slightly unseasoned tortilla chips.  The American company named them ""Tostitos"" and marketed them as ""authentic."" Frito-Lay then hired Mexican-born, U.S.- raised actor Fernando Escandon - who had a slight Spanish accent - to do a series of commercials and it worked. It didn't hurt that Escandon also owned two Mexican restaurants either. ""Tostitos remains the biggest brand ... and it all started in the mid-1970s as a way to offer a more authentic alternative than Doritos,"" Arellano told CNN. ""Through clever marketing, they took over the tortilla chip business."" Doritos still continue to be the best-selling tortilla chips and Tostitos and Tostitos Scoops follow - all under the Frito-Lay empire. Who invented the tortilla chip? The origin of the tortilla chip gets a bit complicated because like every tale in history, there are two sides to every story. While many have credited Rebecca Webb Carranza as the inventor and innovator of the tortilla chip, the Tamalina Milling Company claims its family's tortilla company made the famous corn chips long before that, Arellano wrote in Taco USA. Jose Bartolome Martinez, owner of the Tamalina Milling Company, claims he was the first to produce masolina to make tortillas, where you would only have to add water and masa emerged. All that production meant excess masa so Martinez decided to make tortilla chips as to not be wasteful. The Martinez family only recently donated materials to trademark the Tamalina brand of tortilla chip. While the tortilla chip's history is still a bit blurry, Frito-Lay's heavy marketing and branding has been so influential that many people refer to tortilla chips as ""Tostitos,"" even if they aren't buying the Frito-Lay brand. Potato chips keep things interesting . Not only does Frito-Lay have the corner on the tortilla chip market, but it owns the leading potato chip brands: Fritos, Baked!, Ruffles and, their most popular brand, Lay's. And they aren't taking the rise of the tortilla chip lightly. ""Potato chip companies have become creative in their advertising, even going as far as changing the shape of their chips to triangles or mixing ingredients to make a hybrid chip,"" Kabbani said. In 2014, consumers could even name their flavor as part of Lay's ""Do Us a Flavor"" contest, which got a lot of bizarre entries. Kettle Brand is one of the few companies that isn't owned by Frito-Lay, and even though potato chip sales fell below tortilla chips recently, the company has focused its energy on two vital chip components: structure and flavor. ""The thick-cut and crunch of our chips also means they stand up really well against popular dips that have a tendency to make other chips crumble,"" Kettle Brand's brand manager Marc McCullagh told CNN. Kettle Brand has also built up a reputation for bold flavors - Maple Bacon, Sweet & Salty, Sriracha and Sweet Chili Garlic - and McCullagh said they'll keep doing that to keep up with the competition. While they're known for their kettle-style potato chips, Kettle Brand also sells tortilla chips, which they market as the ""healthier alternative."" ""Unlike other plain tortilla chips brands, we focus on all-natural, organic and carry non-GMO ingredients,"" McCullagh said. After all, who wouldn't want to get a piece of the tortilla chip's multibillion-dollar industry that is exponentially expanding year after year? To each their own, I say. Granted, I'm not complaining. I love tortillas chips and potato chips, in every shape, size and flavor. But I'm keeping an eye on the snack table in case these tostadas make a full-blown culinary takeover during game day.

"(CNN)NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged Friday that ""it's been a tough year"" for him and his league after months' worth of news about everything from allegedly abusive players to ongoing concerns about concussions to deflated footballs. But it was also one, he insisted, marked by significant progress on several fronts. ""We've all done a lot of soul-searching, starting with yours truly,"" Goodell said. ""And we have taken action."" The commissioner made these remarks during his ""state of the league,"" given each season on the eve of the Super Bowl. This Sunday's matchup is between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. The NFL is the most popular professional sport in the United States, which makes the spotlight on it that much brighter. On Friday, Goodell touched on a number of subjects, from instant replay to extra points to a possible franchise in Los Angeles. But he couldn't get away from issues that have dogged his office -- chief among them how the NFL handles allegations of domestic violence by players. Goodell said the NFL wasn't where it needed to be in August, when then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice became the center of controversy after video surfaced showing him hitting his then-fiancée. This case came on top of several others -- from child abuse accusations against Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson to an assault case against Carolina Panthers defensive star Greg Hardy -- that had some demanding that the commissioner resign. He gave no indication Friday he would do any such thing, even after what he called ""a year of ... humility and learning."" ""We obviously as an organization have gone through adversity, but more importantly it's been adversity for me,"" Goodell said. ""And that is something where we take that seriously. It's an opportunity for us to get better. It's an opportunity for us, for our organization, to get better."" For the first time, the commissioner also addressed what's been dubbed Deflategate, which relates to the use of underinflated footballs in the first half of the New England Patriots' AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. As information leaked out about the situation, some suggested strict punishments for New England -- from large fines to suspensions to kicking the team out of the Super Bowl. But the Patriots have fired back, with coach Bill Belichick denying wrongdoing and suggesting science could explain the air pressure issue and owner Bob Kraft suggesting the NFL may owe Belichick and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady an apology if its investigation finds no wrongdoing. What the heck is Deflategate anyway? The commissioner made no apologies Friday for the league's handling of the case, saying, ""This is my responsibility to protect the integrity of the game."" He's tapped Ted Wells to lead an external investigation into the issue. ""I represent 32 teams,"" he added. ""... And if we have any information where the potential is that those rules were violated, I have to pursue that, and I have to pursue that aggressively."" That investigation is focusing on two main questions, according to Goodell: ""Why were some footballs used in the game that were not in compliance with the rules, and was this result of deliberate action?"" He added, ""I want to emphasize -- we have made no judgments on these points. And we will not compromise the investigation by engaging in speculation.""","The NFL's Roger Goodell: ""We've done a lot of soul-searching, starting with yours truly""

"(CNN)The moment he stepped aboard the North Korean airliner, Bernie Leighton felt like he'd entered a Cold War time machine. For an aviation enthusiast like Leighton, it was nothing short of thrilling. After years of anticipation, Leighton, a real estate investor, finally snagged a seat on a rare 1980s Soviet-built Ilyushin IL-62 airliner. Patriotic military music filled the cabin. Flight attendants handed out communist propaganda magazines. As Leighton put it, that 2012 flight on Air Koryo airlines from Beijing to Pyongyang was an experience ""beyond belief."" That's high praise. Leighton may rank among the most accomplished ""avgeeks"" in the world. He said he's flown on at least 50 kinds of aircraft and racked up an estimated 2 million air miles. ""The IL-62, by Western standards, was quite old, but it was actually one of the newer planes I flew on while I was there,"" Leighton said. Only a handful still fly in commercial service worldwide, he said. Its interior decor might have been inspired by a waiting room inside a 1970s Soviet doctor's office, Leighton joked. Upholstery: saggy and blue. Walls: a kind of speckled linoleum. Odd, yes. But also spectacular and well-kept. The 28-year-old Canadian native who lives in Redmond, Washington, has Rain-Man-like avgeek skills, which he'll show you -- if you prompt him. ""When I get on a plane, I can not only tell you where it was manufactured, I can also tell you when it was produced,"" Leighton said. His expertise has earned him appearances as an aviation analyst on Canada's CTV, the BBC and the Fox News Channel. Leighton also shares his avgeek adventures as a correspondent for airlinereporter.com. How to travel to North Korea . A police state that's largely cut off from the world may run its national airline a bit ... differently from the West. Crew members appeared to be ""thoroughly inspected before they get on the plane,"" Leighton said. Neither a hair nor a button out of place. Leighton was surprised when the flight attendants began speaking to him in English. ""You got the feeling that -- in North Korean society -- aviation ranks among the most prestigious career paths,"" he said. ""It allows them the extremely rare experience to explore their own country and to experience a bit of the world outside their borders."" Flight attendant says 'nut rage' ex-airline exec cursed and shoved . After barreling down the Beijing runway, the powerful IL-62 rocketed into the sky like a fighter jet, Leighton said. When it leveled off, it was time for meal service -- North Korean style. Entree: cold chicken, warm potato curry, cold ham and a bun . Dessert: fruit salad . ""It wasn't terrible,"" Leighton said. At other times during Leighton's North Korean tour, in-flight meals may have been served with a side of paranoia. He and other passengers said they saw ""metallic glints a couple hundred feet above or below"" their plane. They suspected these ""glints"" were reflections from unseen military aircraft shadowing them nearby. ""You can't really be too scared,"" Leighton said. ""But you realize that if the pilot ever went crazy enough to make a run for the South with you on board, the aircraft wouldn't be airborne for very long. That's only mildly disconcerting."" Fear is relative, he reminds himself. ""I mean, remember, you're on a 30-year-old Russian aircraft in North Korea,"" Leighton joked. ""You kind of get weirdness fatigue after a certain point."" Opinions about Air Koryo have been mixed. A 2014 review by UK-based Skytrax gave it only one star out of five, for poor service. But flying enthusiast Sam Chui, who said he's traveled on Air Koryo a dozen times, disagrees. ""They provide decent service,"" Chui said. ""They're just using some different equipment, which, as a flight enthusiast, you totally enjoy."" Just like its airplanes, North Korea's airline roots are planted in Soviet Russia. In 1950, authorities formed an airline called Sokao, which linked Pyongyang and Moscow, according to Flight Global. In 1955, North Korea's national carrier Chosonminhang formed, according to Air Koryo's website. The government renamed it Air Koryo in 1992. Efforts to modernize Air Koryo's fleet have been stymied by longstanding international economic sanctions against North Korea. Among jet-setting avgeeks, Chui reigns as the ""arch-Duke of aviation photography,"" Leighton said. Chui said he has flown 111 types of aircraft and logged more than 2.4 million miles. He fell in love with aviation while growing up in Hong Kong, watching spectacular takeoffs and landings at the now-defunct airport known as Kai Tak. Years later, Chui had turned into a full-fledged avgeek, flying on the world's rarest aircraft and scoring seats on new types of planes. This hobby is expensive. To pay the bills, Chui, 34, works as a financial markets investor from his home base in the United Arab Emirates. He figures the money he's spent over the years would have bought him ""a couple more houses."" Chui's bragging list includes: . • farewell commercial flights on a DC-8 and a Boeing 707 . • one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde . • first test flight of the world's biggest airliner, the Airbus A380 . • inaugural flight of the sleek new Airbus A350 . Bragging rights create ""a healthy element of friendly rivalry"" among his fellow avgeeks, Chui admits. ""But aviation is big enough for everyone to enjoy."" Enthusiasts gather at conventions like a Seattle-area event co-sponsored by airlinereporter.com called AvgeekFest, which has quickly gained popularity since it launched in 2009. A self-described ""Super Bowl"" for enthusiasts is Airliners International, hosted this June in Atlanta. These are the places where avgeeks will be writing their bucket lists of planes they most want to fly on. For Leighton, there seems to be no shortage of determination. His holy grail is a four-engined Russian bomber nicknamed ""The Bear,"" many of which are still in service at Russian and Indian military bases. ""There has to be some sort of quasi-legal way to get on one,"" Leighton said. ""So I'm gonna keep working at it.""","Aviation enthusiasts love North Korea's Cold War-era airliners .

"Washington (CNN)The 2016 calculations of three potential candidates -- two Republicans and a very senior Democrat -- plus big tests for President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell filled our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida skipped the big weekend GOP gathering in Iowa, and some believe Jeb Bush's presumed candidacy makes it hard for Rubio to find his 2016 footing. But Jonathan Martin of The New York Times shared reporting on how Rubio is still very interested in running, and hopeful that perhaps the interest from Mitt Romney offers him a new place in the growing GOP field. ""One of the things that is really keeping him intrigued by this race is the possibility that Mitt Romney will run,"" said Martin. ""If you have a Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney scenario, that could open up a door for Rubio because it divides the center right and also it makes Rubio look more conservative, less establishment."" No offense to TV anchors, but what a politician says during a morning show interview may not tell you as much as what he or she says -- or doesn't say -- once the camera stops rolling. A case in point just might be Vice President Joe Biden, who told ABC News the other day he is still thinking about another run for president in 2016, notwithstanding polls showing Hillary Clinton with an overwhelming advantage among Democrats. The Atlantic's Molly Ball, however, says she went looking for evidence the VP is doing the work necessary to actually run and, well, she's still looking. ""So I talked to some well-placed Democrats in Iowa who would be hearing from him if he were serious about this, because that's what he would be doing,"" said Ball. ""They haven't got the call saying, 'Hey, do me a favor, keep your powder dry.' So all the signs out there -- this is the time when he would need to be reaching out to those people that he's known for a long time, and they're not hearing from Joe Biden."" The emails started midafternoon and kept coming into the evening. ""Palin?"" was all one said. ""Do your people there think she is serious?"" was part of another. When Donald Trump told Iowa Republicans he is seriously thinking about a 2016 run, serious Republican operatives just laughed. Again. The way they did when Trump said the same early in the 2012 cycle. Or the 2008 cycle. Most also think Palin, like The Donald, just likes the attention and wants to keep her name in the mix but isn't really serious about running. But, unlike their reaction to Trump, many GOP operatives take a minute, or three, to consider the impact Palin could have if she actually did run. Again, that's highly unlikely -- but it would be wrong to ""misunderestimate"" her potential in Iowa. Imagine a field of Palin, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and others competing for tea party and evangelical voters. Iowa doesn't pick nominees, but it does winnow the field -- and the competition on the right in the GOP Class of 2016 is already intense. New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised he would run things differently -- and it's true that in the first big debate of his tenure, there has been a more free-flowing debate and more amendments. But McConnell apparently didn't mean limitless free debate, and his moves late last week to shut down debate on some Keystone XL amendments annoyed some Democrats -- including some the GOP leader needs on his side to pass his bill. So Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post took us inside the Senate as we wait to see whether McConnell can get his first legislative priority to the finish line. ""Expect to see Republicans allow for a few more (debates on amendments), at least this week, partly because the moderate Democrats, that Republicans are going to need to pass this bill, expressed some displeasure about it over the weekend,"" said O'Keefe. ""There's some concern that if they get upset, either they part ways on this bill or they won't be there in the future."" One ask in President Obama's State of the Union address was for Congress to authorize the military campaign under way against ISIS targets in the Middle East. It was a jarring moment if you recall how Barack Obama broke out in 2008 by being the candidate who opposed the Iraq war and wanted to get the U.S. out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Just watching him ask for authorization of military force was a reminder the world has not unfolded as Obama had hoped. Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times shared reporting about whether the President's request was an important shift in administration thinking. ""Some people think he goofed a little when he said we need that authority. That's actually a change in position for him,"" said Hirschfeld Davis. ""But now he really wants Congress to give him some legislation that would authorize that fight. Internally in the White House, the discussions are really heating up about what that should look like. They're anticipating quite a fight on Capitol Hill both with Republicans and Democrats.""","Why Rubio is excited about a potential Romney run .

"Bobby Brown walked out of a Los Angeles County jail after serving just nine hours of a 55-day sentence imposed for his second drunken driving conviction in a year. A Los Angeles County probation officer determined that Brown, the ex-husband of Whitney Houston, was eligible to serve his time at home if he wore an electronic monitor bracelet, Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The singer is technically still in custody and under the control of the probation department, he said. ""He is presently home with family,"" his lawyer, Christopher Brown, said Thursday. ""Mr. Brown has accepted responsibility for what occurred last October 2012. Mr. Brown is pleased that the matter has been resolved and to be home with this wife and young son."" Brown can take the bracelet, which he is paying for, off his leg after eight days, the same amount of time he would have otherwise spent behind bars, Whitmore said. Good behavior rules and jail overcrowding guidelines add up to a sharp reduction in actual time served for county inmates, Whitmore said. Brown, 44, was taken into custody at the Van Nuys, California, courthouse Wednesday, but was free about 10 hours later, Whitmore said. The singer pleaded no contest to a drunken driving offense, driving with a suspended license and violating his probation from another drunken driving conviction last year. He spent time in a ""confidential rehabilitation center"" last August as part of his plea deal for the April 2012 arrest. He was arrested again in October after a police officer smelled ""a strong scent of alcohol"" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop, a police spokesman said. Brown and Houston divorced in 2007. He has one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, from his relationship with Houston, as well as three other children. Houston died a little more than a year ago. Brown, who has been touring with his R&B group, New Edition, released ""Masterpiece,"" his first solo album in 14 years, last June.","Bobby Brown must wear a monitor for eight days instead of spending time in jail .

"U.S. regulators shut down a New Mexico nut-processing facility Monday after the plant was linked to an outbreak of salmonella earlier this year. The Food and Drug Administration's decision to suspend the registration of the Sunland Inc. plant in Portales, New Mexico, comes after health officials traced the June outbreak to nut butter produced at the facility. In a statement announcing the move, the agency said it would reinstate the company's food facility registration ""only when FDA determines that the company has implemented procedures to produce safe products."" The outbreak sickened at least 41 people in 20 states, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sunland recalled all products from the Portales plant in September and says it has cooperated with federal inspectors, who reported numerous health violations at the facility earlier this month. Monday's action marks the first time the FDA has exercised new power granted under a 2011 law modernizing food safety laws. Sunland spokeswoman Katalin Coburn told CNN the company believed it would soon be cleared to resume operations. ""The FDA has never issued a suspension, and because it's the first time ever, we've got a lot of questions,"" Coburn said. ""So we are at this point trying to understand what exactly FDA wishes us to do."" In a letter to the company released Monday, the FDA said Sunland has outlined ""a number of corrective actions"" but left out ""significant details"" that keep inspectors from approving the plans. ""Based upon the current condition of the facility and past management policies and actions, FDA concludes that unless and until Sunland has completed and implemented certain corrective actions, food manufactured, processed, packed, received, or held by Sunland has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals,"" the agency wrote. In a report issued in mid-November, the FDA found that conditions at the Portales processing plant may have contributed to the contamination of peanut butter and almond butter products with salmonella bredeney, a strain of the bacteria. Investigators determined that Sunland employees did not properly handle equipment, utensils and containers used to hold and store food. They say there were no sinks to wash hands in the production or packaging area. They also noted that employees handled ready-to-package peanuts with their bare hands. According to the FDA, there were no records providing proof that production equipment was cleaned, and the same bags were used to store both raw and roasted peanuts. Raw peanuts were also found outside the facility in open trailers exposed to birds and rain. Report: Unsafe food puts lives at risk .","""We've got a lot of questions,"" a company spokeswoman says .

"San Diego (CNN)Marco is having a moment. As in Marco Rubio, the 43-year-old senator from Florida, who seems to be experiencing a resurgence in popularity among fellow Republicans. It's something that just six months ago, few political observers could have predicted. And if Rubio is interested in applying for a job on Pennsylvania Avenue, as seems to be the case, the timing of this warm embrace couldn't be better. On Friday, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney bowed out of the 2016 presidential campaign, telling supporters on a call that he believes it's ""best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity"" to become the nominee. ""I feel that it is critical that America elect a conservative leader to become our next president,"" Romney said on the call. ""You know that I have wanted to be that president. But I do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president."" Could Rubio be that someone? If so, a lot of people who know a lot about politics didn't see it coming. In fact, last summer, a Republican strategist who knows Rubio fairly well told me that not only was it not a foregone conclusion that the one-time GOP golden boy would seek the presidency in 2016, but he might even hang it up altogether and not even run for re-election to the Senate. What's unbelievable is that, at the time, I found this far-fetched assessment completely believable. Back then, Rubio seemed to be a man without a constituency. After landing on the cover of Time in February 2013 under the headline: ""The Republican Savior,"" Rubio spent the next several months getting hammered by conservatives -- on cable television and talk radio -- for joining the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" and proposing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Some of the attacks were comical; a top Rubio aide told me that the Cuban-American, who was born in the United States, was getting nativist hate mail telling him to ""go back to Mexico."" Eventually, Rubio caved in to the pressure and backed away from his own legislation. As a result, he spent most of 2014 getting hammered by the left as a flip-flopper, while being distrusted by the right, which saw him as soft on illegal immigration. Making matters worse, by then, there was another player in this game: Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who arrived in Washington in January 2013 and proceeded to do to the GOP establishment in the Senate what a candy-starved kid does to a piñata. The fire-breathing Cruz wasted no time in railing against ""amnesty"" and quickly became the anti-Rubio, someone who conservatives could trust to keep the border secure (and the immigration debate safe from honesty and common sense). With Cruz's arrival, Rubio's stock with the right dropped further. The self-described son of exiles was himself an exile from his own party. But that was then. Last month, Rubio got a Christmas present he could really use: a second chance. It came courtesy of the White House and President Barack Obama's proposed policy change to open up relations with Cuba. Rubio's parents left the island in 1956, and so they are more accurately described as immigrants than refugees. But, once Fidel Castro took power in 1959, they were never able to return. So, as Rubio has noted, they lived much of their lives in the United States feeling like exiles. Rubio opposes the Obama administration's policy change, and he has won accolades from conservatives for offering a forceful counter view. Which brings us back to this moment. Think of it as the Rubio renaissance. The senator has done himself a lot of good by getting out of Washington and meeting with Republicans around the country. He is selling a new book, ""American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone."" He is also holding fundraisers, and, from the looks of it, gearing up to run for the GOP nomination for president. A CBS News poll earlier this month showed Rubio trailing Romney and Bush, but besting several other serious potential primary rivals, including Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. With Romney out of the race, Rubio could soak up much of his support. One could assume that many of those who were ""for Romney"" took that position because they didn't want to be ""for Bush."" Maybe now they'll be ""for Rubio."" Rubio is already making a pitch to those voters. After the news broke that Romney was stepping aside, the senator said this: . ""Over the past two years, there hasn't been a day when I didn't think that Mitt Romney would have been a better president than Barack Obama. Over the years, I've enjoyed getting to know Mitt and campaigning for him, was grateful for his support in my Senate race, and I know what a difficult decision this must be given his love of our country. He certainly earned the right to consider running, so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead."" And guess who, at 43, is part of the next generation? Given that Bush and Rubio both hail from Florida, you have to wonder if both will actually end up running for president next year; things could get a little crowded in the primary. At 61, Bush has seniority. But don't count on Rubio bowing out just to be polite. Much has been made about the fact that Bush is supposedly Rubio's political mentor, but folks close to both men claim this narrative is overblown. They are two Florida Republicans, they have similar politics, and they draw from the same pool of supporters and donors. That's it. Don't expect any deference. All is fair in love, war and politics. It's still very early in the 2016 saga. And yet the poll that really matters is the enthusiasm meter. These days, every time Rubio steps into a room, he takes control of it. He's there on television, arguing against opening up Cuba and praising dissidents in Havana. He's out talking about ISIS and other foreign policy issues, dueling with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who preaches a repackaged but still dangerous form of isolationism. And he appeared with Paul and Cruz at a recent forum in Palm Springs, California, and impressed attendees as someone who comes armed with substance, not just sound bites. A California Republican who saw Rubio speak during this week's swing through the Golden State says she was reminded why she was once so enamored of him. She said he has good instincts, and that he is charming, smart, serious, and that he understands America's unique role in the world. I would add that Rubio is also a fresh face and a master communicator who knows how to navigate the media. He is Latino, and the GOP needs to mend fences with that group. He is also bilingual, so he can bring the party's message to immigrant audiences that Republicans usually avoid. All these tools will come in handy as Rubio enters the arena and begins the long journey to what his suddenly replenished ranks of supporters hope will be the securing of the Republican nomination. Pull up a chair. This is one moment that could last a while.","Mitt Romney tells supporters Friday he does not intend to run for president in 2016 .

"(CNN)The tragic news that Kayla Mueller, an American woman being held hostage by ISIS, has been confirmed dead has once again raised the question of how the United States and others should respond to hostage taking. That the United States has negotiated in the past with groups and states that have condoned and sponsored terror is beyond contention. But should it do so in the future? And, equally important, should it try to impose or try to influence others who are considering negotiating, specifically the families of those taken? These are tough questions, so let's get the easy stuff out of the way first. There's no question that negotiating with terror groups, paying ransoms, incentivizes these activities, undermines America's credibility, sets terrible precedents and encourages copycats and more terror. How could it not? Nothing in life succeeds like success. And whether it's a legitimate business or criminal enterprise, if something is working, the tendency is to do more of it. As a consequence, and given the stakes, the official position of the U.S. government is that it does not negotiate with terrorist groups (even though as the nuclear negotiations with Iran attest and the recent opening to Cuba, too, the United States does engage with countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism). The most obvious exception to the U.S. government's rule on negotiating was the Reagan administration's efforts during the 1980s to seek the return of hostages held by Lebanese Shia groups, famously revealed in the Iran Contra affair. And there was the green light given to Israel to release hundreds of Shia prisoners in 1985 in what amounted to a quid pro quo to win the freedom for U.S. citizens on hijacked TWA Flight 847. But there have been other, more recent, examples. These include facilitating the exchange of Peter Moore, a British national kidnapped by Shia militiamen in Baghdad in 2007, for Qais al-Khazali, former spokesman for Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who was implicated in the killing of U.S. soldiers in Karbala. And then, of course, there was the Bowe Bergdahl exchange in 2013 for five Taliban officials, a deal that the Obama administration insists wasn't negotiating with terrorists, in part because the Taliban is an insurgent rather than a terrorist group. (But as Peter Bergen has pointed out, the Haqqani network has been designated a foreign terrorist organization). Direct or indirect, insurgent or terrorist, these are for the most part distinctions that don't really amount to real differences. And if you push the argument too far, they make the United States look inconsistent and hypocritical. But these are in the past, you might say. What about now, particularly in the wake of the threat from ISIS and the beheading of American citizens? Well, the French government, despite denials, was reported by The New York Times to have succeeded in buying back kidnapped nationals from ISIS. In addition, four employees of a French nuclear firm were also freed after having been held by an al Qaeda affliliate in northern Niger, reportedly in return for money, although the French government denied this. That said, the buying back of Americans from ISIS may present even greater challenges, especially when ISIS sets price tags like the $132 million it demanded for James Foley, or as it proved in the case of the two Japanese nationals and Jordanian pilot, that the group was never serious about negotiating. Still, even given these enormous demands, should the United States change its policy and try to secure the release of its citizens, most likely for money,  when they're in mortal peril, particularly if escape or rescue aren't options? It is interesting that in response to ISIS' hostage taking, President Obama ordered a review of U.S. policy on this issue. Even though other countries, particularly Israel, negotiate and trade with terrorist groups, it is virtually certain that Washington won't change its official policy. But it should -- in the event there are real opportunities to redeem hostages -- look the other way, if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members? Sure nobody wants to give in to terror and enable more hostage taking. But on the other hand, do we just write these Americans off as simply unlucky souls in the wrong place at the wrong time? After all, if this was your son, father, husband, wife, daughter or sister, would that be an acceptable response from your government? These matters raise serious moral and ethical questions that are excruciatingly painful to answer. The war against this kind of terrorism is likely going to be a long and painful one. And we may well have to wrestle again with some very tough choices. Do we maintain a principled position against negotiations, discourage private citizens from their own efforts -- even threaten to prosecute them if they try to pay ransom? Or do we approach each terror-filled hostage-taking situationally and maintain some flexibility to see whether lives can be redeemed? I'd be in favor of the latter. Giving into murderous terrorists  is horrible. Giving up on the lives of innocent human beings in the name of a principle  when there might be real and serious possibilities of saving them is worse.","Kayla Mueller, held hostage by ISIS, was confirmed dead Tuesday .

"(CNN)A convicted drug dealer who's already behind bars has been charged in the May 2012 slaying of a Fox executive. John Lenzie Creech, 42, is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday, the Los Angeles County District's Attorney's Office said. He's accused of killing Gavin Smith, a Fox entertainment executive whose remains were found in a shallow grave last year -- more than two years after he vanished. The Fox executive's black Mercedes-Benz 420E was found in 2013 in a storage facility that was connected to Creech, prosecutors said. Creech is serving an eight-year jail sentence after pleading no contest to selling a controlled substance. He told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times that he'd never met Smith. Smith was an 18-year veteran of 20th Century Fox's distribution department, serving as a liaison between the studio and movie theaters, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Smith, a former UCLA basketball player, was last seen alive in May 2012, when he left a friend's house. After he went missing, his family offered a $20,000 reward for information to help find him. It took nearly two and a half years before hikers walking a dog stumbled upon his remains in a remote area north of Los Angeles. Authorities have said they believe they know how and why Smith was killed, but they haven't revealed details. ""We have witnesses that are paramount to the case,""  Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said last year. ""There was evidence in the car that indicated he was killed in the car.""

"(CNN) -- Rain lashed parts of the Philippines on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit barreled toward the coast, bringing roaring winds and the threat of massive storm surges. Satellite images show the eye of the storm, which lost its super typhoon status again Saturday, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) off the eastern coast of the island nation. The storm, the strongest so far this year, is expected to make landfall Saturday evening or Sunday morning, local time, over the Eastern Samar to Northern Samar area, according to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). It's packing sustained winds of 175 kilometers an hour (109 mph) near the storm's center, with gusts of up to 230 kph (143 mph). Millions of people have been scrambling to get out of the typhoon's way, or battening down in hotels on higher ground, away from the coast. Public storm warning signals have been applied in a number of provinces amid predictions winds could rip off roofs, cut power and damage buildings. Residents in low-lying areas have been warned about possible flash floods and landslides. Preparing for the worst . While current forecasts show the storm skirting north of Tacloban, the people there aren't taking any chances. They suffered enormously when Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the coast last November, killing more than 6,000 people and creating apocalyptic scenes of splintered houses, ships on streets and and debris piles for as far as the eye could see. Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez said they're better prepared this year after learning the lessons of Haiyan a year ago. Residents are taking the storm warnings seriously and most people have fled the city, he said. This time, Hagupit, known locally as Typhoon Ruby, is expected to cross the coast farther north, toward Legazpi. Officials there expected to evacuate an estimated 75,000 people ahead of the typhoon's arrival, Mayor Noel Rosal said Friday. ""There's a danger that there will be heavy rains for about four hours and I am very, very worried at this moment,"" Rosal said.

With the storm fast approaching, authorities are not only worried about the typhoon itself, but the effects of the fierce winds, possible flooding and storm surge. PAGASA warned of intense rainfall between 7.5 millimeters and 20 millimeters per hour and rough seas. It also warned of storm surge that could reach up to 5 meters (16 feet) high. More than 80 domestic flights were canceled, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Schools, businesses and government offices closed at the end of the week to give people time to prepare. Government agencies stockpiled tens of thousands of canned food packages in case of shortages. Shop owners nailed boards on windows to protect them from wind, while fishermen moved boats onto dry land.

"(CNN) -- It's a revolutionary decree. In the midst of the fight against Islamist rebels seeking to turn the clock back to the 7th century, a Kurdish region in Syria has just approved a new law ordering equality for women. Take that, ISIS! The status of women has become one of the ideological battlegrounds in the fierce war between the self-described Islamic State and the Kurdish defenders, who have received air support from the United States. With the defiant decree by the small canton, the Kurds are doubling down, staking out a position as the stalwarts of modernity, not intimidated by opponents whose brutality has caused other armies to flee. The change is not just symbolic. It is a real transformation in the legal status of women. The timing of the decree is not accidental, and it is certainly brazen. It is a shot across the ideological bow of Islamists who have made a concerted push to spread their so-called caliphate's views throughout the Muslim world. And it is also a message to the West. The Kurds are tacitly saying ""Look at us. We are the ones who share your ideas about human rights and equality. We are the ones in this many-sided conflict that deserves your support."" The decree was issued by the Jazira district of Syria's Hasakeh province, about 100 miles from the now-legendary town of Kobani, where armed Kurdish men and women are holding their positions, battling to prevent the ultra-radical Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from overrunning their territory. Kurdish-majority provinces in northern Syria declared self-rule in 2013 as the rest of Syria exploded into civil war. The Kurds, an ethnic Muslim minority spread mostly across Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran, have faced repression and have fought for independence. Although women have been a part of Kurdish fighting forces since long before ISIS swept across Syria and Iraq, women have fought for full equality. In remote, rural areas, conservative practices have remained the norm. But the new rules in the Jazira district call for equal pay and equal inheritance rights. Until now, women were not allowed to inherit. They also declare the testimony of a woman in court equally valuable as that of a man. In addition, the rule establishes maternity leave for women and, importantly, it mandates that no woman be married without her own consent, and never under the age of 18. The contrast could not be sharper. ISIS has engaged in the systematic rape of women, and even young girls have been handed off as ""wives"" as a reward for militants. The Islamic State has published online articles declares that capturing and selling women as slaves is an acceptable, even beneficial practice. And while ISIS labels anyone who doesn't share its radical religious interpretation as an infidel or an apostate, subject to execution, the Kurds of Jazira says their rules on full equality will apply to everyone in their ethnically-mixed district. ISIS already occupies about one-third of Hasakeh, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In areas under ISIS rule, women are required to cover completely and may not leave their homes without a male relative. Still, ISIS, too, claims it empowers women. Like the Kurds, ISIS has also established all-women brigades, complete with weapons. But their role is diametrically different from that of Kurdish women. The ISIS female brigades serve many purposes. They help undercut the notion that women are less free under their Islamist rule and they help encourage new recruits. They also serve important practical functions. The women's battalions also help in body searches, preventing men dressed as women from moving through checkpoints. Then there is the more disturbing aspect of the ISIS all-women brigades. They act as the enforcers of the rules that oppress women. They check adherence to the dress code, for example. They are the morality police, and their principal job is to implement the day to day oppression of women. There are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street, quizzing them on their knowledge of Islam and of ISIS rules. It's a long way from the role of female Kurds fighters, who are an integral part of the military force. In Kobani, about a third of the warriors are women. One of the top commanders is a woman. Their job is to do battle, to defend the city. To be sure, the Kurds don't have a perfect record on the treatment of women. Honor killings, female genital mutilation and domestic violence have plagued their communities. In the autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq, the government has outlawed the practices, but they have proven difficult to eradicate. Still, the Kurds are comparatively more modern than many of their neighbors. And the pressure from ISIS may just be moving them even farther along the road to equality. For women defending their territory, it is a delightful irony.","Frida Ghitis: Kurdish region in Syria approved new law ordering equality for women .

"Egyptian prosecutors say they will appeal after former ruler Hosni Mubarak was cleared of charges linking him to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the country's 2011 uprising. The ruling was a stunning reversal for the ex-president who had been convicted of ordering the killings of peaceful protesters and was sentenced to life in prison for the same charges two years ago. On Saturday, a Cairo judge dismissed charges linking Mubarak to the deaths of protesters during the 2011 revolt that led to the end of his 29-year rule. The judge also found him not guilty of corruption. The 86-year-old was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months-long retrial. Reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants' cage, he nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head. Later, he told the country's Sada ElBalad TV station in a brief phone interview that he ""didn't commit anything."" ""I laughed when I heard the first verdict,"" he said of the first trial, which he appealed. ""When it came to the second verdict, I said I was waiting. It would go either way. It wouldn't have made a difference to me either way."" Prosecutor-General Hisham Barakat will appeal the verdict, Egypt's government-controlled Al-Ahram newspaper website reported Sunday. Also acquitted Saturday were Mubarak's former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly and six of el-Adly's aides, who'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of 239 protesters as security forces cracked down on them in 2011. Mubarak's two sons also were acquitted Saturday of corruption. Mubarak is still serving a three-year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement handed down in May, but it's not clear when he will be released because he is expected to be credited for time already served. CNN's efforts to reach Mubarak's lawyer Farid El-Deeb for comment weren't immediately successful. Both sides have alleged that Mubarak's trials have been politicized, with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded. His legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate -- just last year, Mohamed Morsy, the Islamist who became Egypt's first democratically elected president, supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters, who argued Mubarak should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity. But Morsy himself was deposed by the military in July 2013, as opponents accused him of pursuing an Islamist agenda at the exclusion of other factions. And now the Arab Spring revolt that ousted Mubarak has come nearly full circle -- Mubarak appears close to freedom; Morsy is jailed, his Muslim Brotherhood banned; and Morsy supporters allege the current government has returned to Mubarak's authoritarian practices. Mubarak cleared, but drama isn't over yet . Explaining the verdict . Judge Mahmoud el-Rashidy said he dropped charges against Mubarak because Cairo Criminal Court didn't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters' deaths. The judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only el-Adly and his aides as defendants -- not Mubarak himself. But after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question Mubarak, a second referral was made to the court, and the two cases were merged into one. Lawyer Hoda Nasralla, who represents the families of 65 slain and injured protesters, said the inclusion of Mubarak in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first. ""The judge shied away from directly acquitting Mubarak even though he was accused of conspiring with Adly, and Adly was acquitted,"" she said. ""The judge resorted to formalities instead."" 'I want only God's retribution' Salway El-Sayed, mother of one of the slain 2011 protesters, sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard Saturday's verdicts, praying to God to deliver justice. She broke down in tears, her hands shaking, as she recalled her son Tamer Hanafy, who was killed in January 2011 at Cairo's Tahrir Square -- the epicenter of the uprising. ""I'm worried my son's blood would go in vain,"" she said. ""Our children's blood isn't cheap. Their blood is precious, like any other blood."" ""I don't want execution,"" she continued. ""This won't bring back my son ... I want only God's retribution. Nothing more."" Tahrir Square was closed to traffic following Saturday's verdicts. One man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with Egyptian security forces, Egyptian Ministry of Health spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar told CNN. Police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters. The Ministry of Interior said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated. The human rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, whose lawyers represented more than 60 civil plaintiffs in the case, said that Saturday's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy. ""Justice was dealt another severe blow,"" the group said in a news release. How it started . In January 2011, throngs of Egyptians filled the streets of Cairo to decry the country's poverty, unemployment and repression. Protesters called for Mubarak to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown. Mubarak eventually stepped down in February 2011. That freed up long-supressed Islamist movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, to run for office. Morsy, backed by the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, became president in June 2012. But Morsy was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule. Since then, Cairo's military-installed government has banned the Brotherhood, calling it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military. Many Islamist and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences. A restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who led Morsy's ouster, was elected president in May after leaving the military to run for the office. Since Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges, often wheeled in on a gurney. His lawyers say he suffered health problems after his 2011 arrest, including a stroke, and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility. In May, when a Cairo court sentenced Mubarak to three years in prison for embezzlement, his sons Gamal and Alaa were sentenced to four years each on the same charge. All three were convicted of embezzling $18 million that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces. The Mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty.","A judge dropped charges against Mubarak in the deaths of hundreds of protesters .

"(CNN)A deal has been reached for 200 Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces to pass through Turkey to help Syrian Kurdish fighters in the besieged town of Kobani, just over the border in Syria, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday. The Syrian Kurdish fighters had originally declined the deployment of Peshmerga troops, but Erdogan told reporters in Riga, Latvia, that he'd learned Wednesday that an agreement for the reinforcement force had been reached. However, an aide to the minister for Peshmerga in Iraq's Kurdish Regional Government told CNN that talks are ongoing. The technical discussions involve four parties -- the United States, Turkey, the Syrian Kurds and the KRG in Iraq -- and decisions on numbers and timing are still a ways off, he said. The reports on the Peshmerga forces came on the same day that Erdogan accused the United States of arming a group linked with terrorists, according to Anadolu, Turkey's semiofficial news agency. Kurdish fighters have been battling alongside Free Syrian Army forces to repel ISIS forces from the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, said Thursday that ISIS militants have taken control of the western outskirts of the border town. This means they now surround Kobani from three sides: the east, west and south, it said. Meanwhile, heavy clashes continue between Kurdish militia groups and ISIS militants in the northern part of Kobani, the group said. Strong accusation . As the clashes raged in Kobani, Erdogan said the border city, which is under the control of the armed wing of the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, is more important to Turkey than the U.S. because Turkey houses the roughly 200,000 refugees who have fled the fighting there, Anadolu reported. He asked the U.S. to recognize the ""dilemmas"" there while accusing the country of arming terrorist elements among the Kurdish forces. ""Kobani is not strategic for the U.S.,"" he said. ""It could be strategic for us only. And also, Turkey is currently accommodating all the civilians fleeing from the town. There are no civilians there."" Erdogan went on to say the U.S. was pushing arms to the PYD, which he accused of affiliation with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S., Turkey, NATO and others. ""We had said that there are commanders from the PKK in the ranks of PYD fighting in Syria,"" Erdogan said. ""We had said that any U.S. aid to this group is going to a terrorist organization."" Airdropped supplies . There had been hopes that foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help Kurdish fighters turn the tide against the ISIS militants. But the onslaught has continued. ISIS has said that at least some of the airdropped supplies made it into its fighters' hands. One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone, a U.S. official said. The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it. But a video posted on social media shows what appears to be an ISIS fighter next to a parachute bundle. He goes on to show what appears to be the contents of the bundle, including crates of hand grenades and mortar rounds. CNN cannot independently confirm whether the items in the video are from a U.S. airdrop, but according to Anadolu, Erdogan said ISIS had seized some of the weapons. ""The rest, they also were seized by another terrorist organization, the PYD. Turkey did never lean toward such military aid and the U.S. did that despite Turkey,"" the news agency quoted him as saying. Erdogan further said the Syrian groups that deserve help are the Free Syrian Army and the Peshmerga fighters, the news agency reported. Fight for strategic hill . A Kurdish fighter and a media activist in Kobani also told CNN that ISIS militants are pushing toward the western outskirts of Kobani after attacking checkpoints manned by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the Free Syrian Army. The attacks forced them to withdraw from the strategic Tall Shair Hill area, they said. But, they said, neither ISIS nor the YPG is able to control the western outskirts of Kobani as fighting for control of the hill rages. Clashes also continue between ISIS and YPG fighters on the eastern outskirts of Kobani, leaving at least five Kurdish fighters dead. ISIS militants were also killed in the clashes, but it was not immediately clear how many. Earlier this week, U.S. airplanes dropped medical supplies and weapons into Kobani to help the city's defenders. Rights group: Syria airstrikes killed 553 . Meanwhile, a month of airstrikes in Syria by the U.S.-led coalition -- many targeting ISIS positions around Kobani --  has killed 553 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A large majority of those killed were ISIS militants, including foreigners, the group said. However, at least 32 civilians were also among those killed between the start of the airstrikes on September 23 and October 22. They included six children and five women, the group said in a statement Wednesday. In total, 464 ISIS militants were killed, the Observatory said. The airstrikes also claimed the lives of 57 fighters from al Nusra Front, a rival Islamist group fighting in Syria. The figures do not include any casualties in neighboring Iraq, where the coalition has also been targeting ISIS forces. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","U.S. is accused of arming terrorists as ISIS boasts of intercepting weapons .

"(CNN)Pope Francis cut his trip to Tacloban short Saturday as an approaching typhoon with blistering winds threatened the city in the Philippines. The Pope donned a slicker to conduct an outdoor Mass for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite stormy weather. The Mass in Tacloban was shortened after sustained winds of 80 mph and higher gusts howled toward the city. Tacloban is still recovering from the 2013 disaster of Super Typhoon Haiyan, described as one of the strongest storms ever recorded with 195 mph sustained winds. It killed 6,300 people nationwide. Typhoon Mekkhala was upgraded from a tropical storm and made landfall in the Philippines in the afternoon just northeast of Tacloban. The Mass began about a half-hour after he landed. Wind rustled the hood on the pontiff's slicker as he spoke to a crowd clad in raincoats. Typhoon Mekkhala, which is called Typhoon Amang in the Philippines, was arriving on the island of eastern Samar --  about 50 miles from where the Pope was in Tacloban. Just two weeks ago, a tropical storm struck Tacloban and surrounding areas, causing a commercial passenger plane to slide off the runway while landing. Tropical Storm Jiangmi, renamed Seniang in the Philippines, killed 54 people in landslides and flash floods in that region, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. During the Pope's visit to Tacloban, he will have lunch with survivors of the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan, renamed Typhoon Yolanda in that country. That typhoon displaced 918,000 families nationwide, the government says. He is also to bless the Pope Francis Center for the Poor and will meet with clergy and more typhoon survivors in the cathedral in Palo. The pontiff is also scheduled to perform an outdoor Mass in Manila on Sunday before millions of Filipinos. By then, the storm should weaken to a tropical depression. Still, Manila could face gusty winds and significant rain during the Mass. The Pope's trip to Asian isles began Tuesday in Sri Lanka, and he landed in the Philippines on Friday. On Friday, Francis met with President Benigno Aquino, and the pontiff urged the political leader to reject corruption and promote ""honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good,"" the Vatican said. He also spoke of ""the moral imperative of ensuring social justice and respect for human dignity,"" according to a copy of his remarks provided by the Vatican. ""Here in the Philippines, countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters. The economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment, and financial problems strain many households. While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of Christian morality,"" the Pope said in other remarks. The Pope leaves Manila for Rome on Monday.","Pope Francis celebrates outdoor Mass in stormy weather .

"Delayed for months by chaos and conflict, the recovery of wreckage from downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has finally begun in war-torn eastern Ukraine, Dutch officials said Sunday. The passenger jet carrying 298 people was shot down in July over a rural area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The vast crash site was left unsecured, and international investigators struggled to reach the area amid fighting between the rebels and Ukrainian government forces. Everyone aboard the flight was killed. Around two-thirds of the victims were from the Netherlands. All Malaysian remains from Flight MH17 ID'd . Dutch officials have commissioned the recovery and transport of the wreckage back to the Netherlands as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash. The recovery operation is expected to take several days, the Dutch Safety Board said in a statement Sunday, and security and other factors will be assessed daily. The wreckage will be transported to the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv before being sent to the Netherlands. The investigators intend to reconstruct a section of the aircraft, the safety board said. Several western nations and the Ukrainian government have accused the pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of shooting down the plane with a missile. Rebel leaders and the Russian government have disputed the claims. In its preliminary report in September on the disaster, the Dutch agency said Flight 17 broke apart in the air after it was hit by a burst of ""high-energy objects"" from outside. That report set out a list of areas that still need further investigation, including forensic examination of wreckage and any foreign objects found. It noted at the time that Dutch investigators still hadn't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine. In the aftermath of the crash, the rebels were widely accused of looting the site, tampering with the evidence and stopping investigators from combing through the wreckage. After an initial delay, most of the bodies of the victims have been removed from the area and transported out of Ukraine. But as recently as September, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said it was likely that there were still remains strewn across the fields. Australia had 38 of its citizens and residents on the plane. Passenger found wearing oxygen mask .","Dutch officials have commissioned the transport of the wreckage back to the Netherlands .

"Hong Kong (CNN)With an unrestricted, panoramic night view of the city's twinkling skyline and the breezy air right outside the front door, a 15th floor penthouse apartment ticks all the boxes for a million-dollar property in the heart of Hong Kong. But there's a catch. Fung, 59, who prefers not to divulge his full name, lives in an illegal rooftop slum -- a 75-square-feet shack just big enough to host a bed, a cupboard, and everyday knick-knacks thrown pell-mell in the dusty room. The rent costs  $1,700 Hong Kong dollars (US$220) a month. Local authorities have been taping eviction notices on his front door for the past month, saying that he has to move out. But with high property prices and hundreds of thousands waiting for public housing in Hong Kong, Fung, has no other places to go. ""I won't accept the relocation settlement scheme -- it's only a few thousand Hong Kong dollars. Where am I going to live? The rent is a lot cheaper here,"" he says as he crumples the latest notice. The authorities offer a relocation settlement for rooftop residents, to Fung -- it is too meager. Most people in his position don't have a stable income to start again elsewhere. The rooftop slums in Hong Kong expose one of the most bewildering facets of Asia's self-described ""world city."" Majestic skyscrapers loom over peeling, overcrowded apartment blocks with their unofficial rooftop extensions. Clearing out . Constructed on top of buildings since the 1950s and 60s without government approval, these makeshift communities clutter the rooftops in old working-class neighborhoods such as Kowloon. Corrugated metal sheets roughly cover concrete-walled shacks.  And they've provided vital accommodations for low-income people such as migrants from mainland China and Southeast Asia for more than half a century. According to the latest figures from Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department, there were 3,747 rooftop dwellers in 1,588 households in 2011. This is a dramatic drop from 2001 when more than 16,000 people lived illegally in these sky slums. The decrease marks a trend where tenement buildings -- under constant pressure due to the shortage of land in Hong Kong -- are torn down to pave way for brand new shopping and residential developments. READ MORE: Life inside the densest place on earth: Remembering Kowloon Walled City . Limited space . Fung lives in one of Hong Kong's poorest and most densely populated districts, Kwun Tong, where 57,120 people live per square kilometer, according to the Census and Statistics Department. Atop an industrial building that houses textile and publishing companies, Fung and around 40 other residents navigate their way through dark and haphazardly boarded walkways, occasionally lit up by an overhanging light bulb, or the glowing screen of a smartphone. Tangled electric wires that also double as laundry lines, criss-cross from one end of the roof to the other. An open square lies in the middle, scattered with pieces of unwanted furniture, flower boxes and kids' toys, which strangely bring color and cheer to the crowded space. Fung works mostly in the construction sector and earns around $8,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$1,000) a month, barely enough to take care of his 10-year-old daughter and to cover the rent. ""I used to own property in Shenzhen, but I moved back to Hong Kong four years ago so my daughter can have a better education here,"" Fung said, as his neighbors trickled out to join the conversation. They have all received the same warning from the government. Some have lived on this rooftop for more than 10 years and see no alternative but to stay. The rooftop dwellers are willing to open the doors to their humble homes but will only talk off the record -- in fear of being resettled to remote satellite towns, where there may be few opportunities and limited social networks. A few buildings away from where Fung lives, Joyce Ngan Chau Yee, who is a student at the University of Hong Kong School of Professional and Continuing Education, says she prefers to live in the rooftop huts. She lives with her single mother and brother in a 236-square-feet flat. ""The space here is a lot bigger than the subdivided flats. It was a little bit uncomfortable at first with all the rats and the cockroaches, but we learn to adapt,"" the 21-year-old says. ""The only thing is that it gets really hot during the summer."" The rooftop slums in the neighborhood are unofficially rented out by the building's top floor owners who want to earn some cash on the side, according to Fung. For Ngan's mother, she says she has no idea who she's been paying her rent to for the past three years. ""I just put the money in an envelope that comes every month on time and that is it,"" says Sze Suk Pui. Widening wealth gap . The housing crunch highlights the widening economic divide for the city of seven million residents. ""The reality is that a part of Hong Kong society's income is not increasing, while the rich are getting richer,"" says economist Richard Wong Yue Chim. Forbes magazine last year registered 45 billionaires in Hong Kong with a combined wealth of US$214 billion -- almost 80% of Hong Kong's GDP in 2013. In contrast, there are 400,000 households living under the poverty line, which is set at $14,300 Hong Kong dollars (US$1,800) for a house of four. A survey published in early 2014 by Demographia International Housing Affordability revealed that Hong Kong's property market has become the world's most expensive, with the median housing price reaching $4,024,000 Hong Kong dollars, or US$519,216. The hike in property prices signifies a thriving economy in Hong Kong, and construction jobs have been on the rise to meet the housing demand. They provide increasing job opportunities for people like Fung who work in the sector, but their financial struggles suggest that little of the money generated from the construction boom trickles down into their pockets. READ MORE: Hong Kong's housing at its worst . With inflating property prices, and an ever widening income gap, what future lies in store for these rooftop dwellers? ""Of course I don't want to live here forever,"" says Ngan, pausing to speak during her homework. ""I hope we can move into public housing after living here for seven years, but the wait will be long."" When construction worker Fung was asked about his future plans after his imminent eviction, he just chuckled. ""I'll think about that when they really come and tear this down. If I can live here for one more day, I'll continue to stay here."" he says.

"(CNN)Just outside of a white and yellow tent in Germany, an elephant heaves a heavy sigh. His ears are lowered, his skin relaxed -- his trunk arched into a final pose. ""That's my favorite part of the circus,"" Dutch photographer Wiesje Peels said. ""When there's a moment, five minutes before (performers) get on and five minutes after they get off."" Peels' fascination with the circus began as a child. Her father traveled Europe as a one-man show, ""Theatro Picollini,"" performing at hospitals and amusement parks. At 6 years old, Peels began helping her father as the magician's assistant. For five years, she watched her father walk a tightrope between being her dad and performing as a magician. It's what the majority of Peels' work focuses on, something she calls ""in between worlds."" In 2001, Peels traveled to India to follow and photograph a large ship. But instead, she felt a calling to run away with the Great Bombay Circus. Starkly different from her father's small production, the circus boasted multiple tents and more than 100 performers. She photographed the show for two weeks. At first, she shot the expected -- the splendor of the circus act. But it wasn't the whimsy on stage that truly appealed to Peels' artistry. She became interested in the evolution that occurred behind the curtain. Her book ""Mimus"" binds together roughly 100 photographs taken at several traveling circuses in Europe. The images capture a ""glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The performers carry a certain melancholy when transitioning in and out of character. This is illustrated clearly in Peels' photo of a clown. He's still in costume, his makeup still intact, yet he's off-stage, no longer part of an act. He emanates an ""unavoidable authenticity,"" Peels says. Peels' work is heavily influenced by other artwork, specifically 19th-century paintings. Before photographing every circus, she visits local museums to derive inspiration. But the true genius lies in her ability to relate to the performer. She finds herself ""in between worlds,"" too. ""There's the home life and the artist life,"" Peels says. As a wife and a mother of two, Peels says she struggles to find time to create, and she often seeks solace at artist residencies to focus solely on her work. Now she's in Zundert, Netherlands, the birthplace of Vincent van Gogh, in an effort to draw space to become a character of her own. ""I live in two worlds,"" she said. ""So do you.""

"(CNN)When the USS Kauffman steamed out of Norfolk Naval Station earlier this month, it marked the beginning of the end for an entire class of vessels in the U.S. Navy. The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate will be the last of more than four dozen such ships to put itself in harm's way. ""I am honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead such a capable and proud group of sailors on this, the final deployment of an FFG-7 class ship, and to be the last in a great line of frigate commanding officers,"" the Kauffman's skipper, Cmdr. Michael Concannon, said in a Navy statement. The final mission for the Kauffman and its crew of 250 will be to combat drug trafficking in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, the waters of the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. ""What a fitting mission for this great ship and crew to leave as its final legacy, keeping drugs off the streets of America by stopping them at the source,"" Concannon said. After it returns from the drug trafficking mission, the Kauffman will have spent more than 28 years in the U.S. Navy. It will be decommissioned in September and possibly put up for sale to an allied navy. The first of the Perry class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry, was launched in 1976. The Navy once had 51 of the Perry-class ships, which were up to 453 feet long and displaced as much as 4,300 tons. They enjoyed a reputation for toughness, especially after two suffered battle damage in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. Perhaps the most famous of the Perry-class ships was the USS Stark, which survived a deadly attack in the Persian Gulf. Thirty-seven U.S. sailors were killed on May 17, 1987, when an Iraqi jet fired two Exocet missiles into the ship while it was on patrol during the Iran-Iraq war. Less than a year later, another Perry-class frigate, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, was struck by an Iranian mine, wounding 10 of its crew, blowing a 15-foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate's keel, damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom. The crew of the Roberts, however, was able to save the vessel, in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship's superstructure together. The Roberts was then loaded onto another ship, the Mighty Servant 2, in Dubai and transported back to the U.S., ship on ship. Both the Stark and the Roberts were eventually fully repaired and returned to the fleet. The Stark was scrapped in 2006. The Roberts completed what is expected to be its final mission in December, with its decommissioning planned for this year. The Navy defines the primary missions of frigates as protecting shipping and anti-submarine warfare. Those duties will be taken up by the service's new littoral combat ships, 20 of which are either in the fleet, under construction or under contract. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced last week that the LCS will succeed the Perry-class frigates in more than mission. ""Somehow, in the 21st century, we started naming ships with strange acronyms ... instead of from our naval traditions ... so we are going to change the hull designation of the ‪#‎LCS‬‬ class ships to FF (frigate) ... appropriate and traditional name,"" Mabus said in a speech to the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. Those newly designated frigates will join the world's oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy's frigate fleet, the USS Constitution. Nicknamed ""Old Ironsides,"" the Navy's historic tall-masted showpiece was commissioned in 1797 and sails from Boston Harbor to promote the service.","The USS Kauffman's deployment is the last for Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates .

"(CNN)He has intercepted passes from both of the Super Bowl quarterbacks, but Tom Brady and Russell Wilson have nothing on Mr. Silva. The NFL just wasn't adding up for Ricardo Silva, so he decided to hang up his shoulder pads and head back to school -- to teach high school geometry. Silva, 26, played two seasons in the NFL, earning more than $500,000 a year as safety for the Detroit Lions and then briefly with the Carolina Panthers.  Now, he earns about $50,000 a year as recruit for Teach for America. Silva made a two year commitment to Washington's Ballou High school starting back in September. It doesn't seem like a fiscally responsible career move, but for Silva, leaving the NFL was just part of a bigger vision for his life. ""My mission was to be able to play football as long as I can and then eventually I wanted to go into teaching which would be either math or social studies,"" says Silva who was a political science major at Virginia's Hampton University. Despite having a break out senior season and being named an HBCU All-American, Silva was undrafted in 2011.  He signed to the Detroit Lions practice squad and then became a starting safety a few months later. ""I wanted to get to college and start in the NFL.  Play in the NFL, start in the NFL.  It was not an easy road for me and this is how I can relate to students.  I didn't grow up being the fastest person or the strongest person, I had to work every way,"" says Silva. The Carolina Panthers picked Silva up off waivers in 2013. When he was cut by the Panthers, he turned down offers to play football in Canada and a college coaching job to teach. He says it's all about making an impact for young people. ""Anyone can be an NFL player and coach football. How many NFL players are going back into the classroom to get (kids) to college?"" says Silva.  ""It's more than football to me, it's life."" Silva wants to motivate students to go to college.  It's a big challenge in a school where he says only about a 30% of students attend university. His efforts have seemed to have already made a difference for his students, including 10th grader Eric Cary who credits Silva with helping him raise his grade from a D+ to a B in Geometry. ""He's a really good teacher and a really cool dude,"" says Cary. ""He's like my role model."" Silva says teaching is more challenging than football ever was. ""So football all you have to do is wake up every day, work out and do what the coaches tell you to do. In school you got to motivate the young teenagers who are more interested in their social media outlets than math,"" says Silva. Silva is married and says his goal in the next five years is to become a father.  And he says he wants to stay working in education, first as a teacher and eventually a school principal. As for football, Silva says that's all behind him now. ""I barely even watch football now.  That may sound strange to you but I feel like I've been there, I've done that, mission accomplished now let's move on to something more meaningful to me which is education.""","Former NFL safety Ricardo Silva is now a high school teacher in Washington, D.C.

"Plasencia, Spain (CNN)Has Pope Francis taken another step to push for tolerance in the Catholic Church? Yes, says Diego Neria Lejarraga, a transgender man who says he had a private audience with the Pope in late January, reportedly a first for the pontiff. Neria was born as a girl in Spain and raised as a devout Catholic. But after his sex change operation eight years ago, many people scorned him in church in his hometown of Plasencia in western Spain. Neria recalls heated discussions with a parish priest and some others in town. Afterward, he started staying away from Mass. ""I've never lost faith, ever,"" Neria says. ""But the other thing is the rejection."" He wrote to Pope Francis last year, saying his local bishop helped get the letter noticed. Next, according to Neria, came two phone calls from Francis. And then, a discreet audience on a Saturday evening, January 24, at the papal residence, Casa Santa Marta. Vatican spokesmen and the local Spanish bishop's office declined to comment on the meeting, insisting the Pope's private meetings are just that. Neria, a civil servant, told CNN that he's not an activist for transgender people and doesn't expect changes overnight. ""This man loves the whole world,"" Neria says of Pope Francis. ""I think there's not -- in his head, in his way of thinking, discrimination against anyone. I'm speaking about him, not the institution."" Catholic doctrine holds that sex change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the church. ""But if this Pope has a long life, which all of his followers hope,"" Neria says, ""I think things will change."" And he's already seen changes at home. The downside: Neria says he's unaccustomed to the sudden media interest in him since the story broke in the local paper, Hoy, of Extremadura. He says he's gotten queries from journalists as far afield as India and Colombia. But he also sees a positive side. ""Just the fact that you've met the holy father, without knowing what was said,"" Neria says, ""people now seem to look at you in a different way.""","Diego Neria Lejarraga says he had a private audience with the Pope in January .

"(CNN)It's January, the busiest month of the year for most gyms. Typically, by February or March, many people lose focus and stop hitting the gym. This year is going to be different -- at least for the six lucky CNN viewers selected to be part of the 2015 Fit Nation Triathlon team. Each participant will be getting a road bike (with all the necessary accessories), a wet suit and a gym membership to prepare them to race alongside Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the Nautica Malibu Triathlon on September 20. As they train for their first triathlon with support from fitness and nutrition coaches, they'll blog, tweet and share their workouts online. You'll watch and get to cheer them on as they get ready to swim a half-mile in the ocean, bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the Pacific coast. And we hope this year's Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge team will inspire you to make your health a priority. If our past Fit Nation team members are any indication, you'll be happy you did. Meet this year's team: . Having a training partner is critical to the success of any life-changing program. Many past Fit Nation team members have trained along with their spouses, partners, friends and family, all with great results. This year, we decided to pick a husband and wife duo -- Julia and Eugene Smookler -- to be part of the challenge. Julia is a midwife. She spends much of her day talking to women about maintaining healthy lifestyles, eating well and staying healthy throughout pregnancy. But Julia admits she has a long way to go toward practicing what she preaches. ""As a busy mom and working full time, it's just impossible to lose this weight,"" she says. ""But I feel like it's really important to set the standard and to be a good role model for those patients."" When she and Eugene met, they were both in much better shape, but life got in the way. Julia's father passed away from cancer. Then they had a child, which  torpedoed several of their healthy habits. Eugene says he wants them both to get in better shape, so they can be good role models for their 3-year-old daughter, Mara. ""We're ready to hit the reset button and start over, get our lives back, be more productive and have more energy,"" he says. ""And be a happier couple,"" Julia chimes in. ""I think it's really strained our relationship."" Eugene's also looking forward to being able to do ""the worm"" with the same finesse he had back in college. At 67, Linda Garrett is the oldest person to have ever joined our team, but looking at her, you'd never believe she was a day over 50. The semiretired psychiatric nurse says having a busy career and raising two children caused her to overlook her own health and fitness. It wasn't until last year  when someone at her local gym talked her into doing a mud run that her ""inner athlete"" came out. ""I completed it, and I had a ball,"" Garrett says. ""I want to bring that enthusiasm to the Fit Nation Triathlon."" Working out at a gym several days a week has already helped her keep those ""pesky senior citizen aches"" at bay. Training for a triathlon, she says she hopes to be in the best shape of her life. ""I'm a triathlete in my mind. ... I want to make it a reality,"" she says. Robert Lara, 34, says he is ready to shed the weight he's carried around his whole life and help change attitudes in the Mexican-American community where he grew up. At 300 pounds and suffering from Type 2 diabetes, this attorney says, ""Enough is enough."" He's hoping the CNN program will help give him a shot at making changes that stick. But his reasons also go deeper. ""I'm not going to make it past 40 if I don't really focus on losing weight and taking care of myself,"" Lara says. ""My culture has a very ingrained commitment to taking care of our elders, and if I can't take care of myself, how can I take care of them?"" Erica Moore, 35, says there's no secret to how she ballooned to more than 250 pounds, but she did have a lot of fun doing it. ""I don't have a down-on-my-luck story,"" Moore says. ""I got fat the old-fashioned way -- a lot of eating, a lot of drinking and no exercise."" Last year, she decided that she had had more than enough fun getting out of shape -- now it was time to put in some hard work to get back into shape. At 34, she took her first swim lessons -- the initial step toward her goal of becoming an ironman. She began rowing and running as well, and this year, she says she will prove to friends, family and her community that anything is possible with hard work and determination. At 44, Chip Greenidge has been in school a lot of years -- first in college, then grad school and now working on his doctorate at Georgia State University. Through it all, his weight has been up and down; now, at more than 300 pounds, he's ready to make a change. ""I have spent my life in service to others -- encouraging urban high school students to apply, attend and graduate college, and convening a number of activities helping minorities and people of color get involved in civic life,"" Greenidge says. ""However, over the years, I have not been able to really work on my own health and nutrition goals."" He says he's looking toward the CNN Fit Nation challenge to help him set and achieve those goals, and overcome a family history of high blood pressure. ""I look to learn so many things about myself in the process -- my strengths and challenges and how I can approach them going forward in life.""","Six CNN viewers have been selected to be part of the 2015 Fit Nation triathlon team .

"Sandino, Cuba (CNN)A neglected, weed-strewn field in a small Cuban town where there are more horses than cars seems an unlikely setting for a major shift in government policy. But in the isolated town of Sandino, Cuba's first Catholic church since the 1959 revolution took power is set to be built. ""There is money to start, there is the construction material to start, there are the permissions to start, so everything is ready,"" said Bishop Jorge Enrique Serpa Pérez,  who oversees the diocese where the new church will be built. The Sandino church has been 56 years in the making, ever since Fidel Castro took power and Cuba became an officially atheist state. Religious people fell under suspicion by the new revolutionary government, but none more so than those who belonged to the Catholic Church, which was seen as being overly sympathetic to the Batista regime that Castro had driven from power. In the first years of the revolution, thousands of Catholic priests were jailed or forced into exile, and church property, including the Jesuit school that Castro attended, was seized by the Cuban government. Only with the visit in 1998 of Pope John Paul II to the island did relations between the Cuban government and Catholic Church begin to thaw. Christmas again became a national holiday, and Cubans faced less official discrimination for practicing their faiths. In December, Cuban President Raul Castro thanked Pope Francis for his role in the secret talks that led to a prisoner swap between Cuba and the United States and the start of negotiations to restore full diplomatic relations. In 2015, church officials said requests to build new churches that had long been ensnared in red tape began to receive government approval. While church officials said several new Catholic houses of worship are in the works, the first will be built in Sandino, a remote town at the end of a pothole-cratered road in Cuba's westernmost province. The Rev. Cirilo Castro drives that road to Sandino once a week to officiate Mass in a converted garage in the back of a house the church rents. He has lost count of the miles he has put on his green Russian Lada as part of his ministry to towns throughout the province. When the new Catholic church is built -- the first in Sandino's history -- Castro said he would move to minster there full time. ""I hope the church doesn't stay within the four walls,"" he said ""That it will go farther than that. That with the building of the new church, there will be more people of faith,"" Castro said. The Cuban Catholic Church desperately needs more followers in Cuba, where in recent years the syncretic religion Santeria, that mixes African religions with Catholicism, has exploded in popularity. The church in Sandino will take about two years to build and when completed will hold 200 people, Castro said. Most of the $50,000 collected so far for the new church comes from fund-raisers held by the St. Lawrence Catholic Church in Tampa, Florida. ""Much of Tampa's history and culture comes from Cuba,"" said the Rev. Tom Morgan, St. Lawrence's vicar. ""It's absolutely fantastic they are building a new church, and I hope to be able to visit one day."" Morgan said he was optimistic that recent changes in U..S Treasury Department regulations would make it possible for his church to send supplies and building materials to Cuba to help with the construction of the new church. As she makes her way down a path to attend Mass in Cirilo Castro's converted garage, Digna Martinez said she has waited more than five decades for a church to be built in Sandino. Martinez said she, her husband and two children were those relocated to the town during early 1960s when a triumphant Fidel Castro was still battling what he called ""bandits,"" holdouts against his revolution waging guerrilla warfare in the countryside. While there is no official tally, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people suspected of plotting against the revolution were shipped to Sandino to live in a form of internal exile. ""It was a process to make a community for political prisoners,"" Martinez said. ""They took our farm away and brought us here."" A lifelong Catholic, Martinez said one of the most devastating things about being forced to move 500 miles away from her home to a town she had never heard of was that there was no church. ""Having a church is very important,"" she said. ""Many of the people here were brought up Catholic and need a church. We were baptized and prayed when we went to bed and woke up, just like our parents and grandparents taught us.""","Cuban Catholics start building their first churches since 1959 .

"New York (CNN)It's the ""crippling and potentially historic"" blizzard that turned out to be neither. ""They were trying to out-drama each other,"" architect Rebecca Uss in New York City said Tuesday, speaking of officials in the region who had warned of the coming snowstorm. ""In hindsight, it was overkill,"" said Brian Beirne, who was sledding with his son Micah on New York's Upper West Side. ""It's much ado about nothing."" Roberto Gonzalez slept in the lobby of a building, curling up near a radiator, since the restaurant he worked at closed too late Monday for him to get on the subway to go home. ""When I woke up, I expected the end of the world. I went outside and nothing (had) happened. What storm?"" Some people in the Northeast are concerned the government cried wolf. ""They decided to close,"" a woman named Anesah, who works with international students in Philadelphia, tweeted about her workplace.  There ""isn't a flurry to be found. I don't think they'll ever give us off again. #crywolf."" ""This #snowFail does not bode well for civilian cooperation with the terms of the next snow emergency in NYC,"" Lisa B. in New York said on Twitter. Government officials say the measures taken, including travel bans, are helpful for the quick cleanup of streets and, most importantly, are signs of erring on the side of caution. ""Better safe than sorry,"" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had warned Monday that the storm could be one of the largest ""in the history of this city.""  Instead, ""It's going to be a fast return to normalcy,"" de Blasio said. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was asked at a news conference Tuesday about suggestions that the predictions were ""overblown.""  ""That would be an oversimplification,"" he said, laughing. The eastern part of the state was heaviest hit and is still receiving ""significant and continued snowfall,"" he said. Still, despite previous warnings that people might be without power for days, ""By and large we'll be back to normal for most of our state tomorrow,"" Malloy said. Many people had stocked up on days' worth of necessities and prepared to hunker down for what the National Weather Service said could be a ""raging blizzard."" Some are now calling it all ""snowperbole."" But Liz Childs, who works at a hospital in New York, said she doesn't believe authorities overreacted. ""I feel we were lucky this time,"" she said. ""I think we dodged a bullet."" Sights and sounds of the blizzard . Some who forecast the weather professionally felt the need to apologize, including Gary Szatkowski, with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. ""My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public,"" he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ""You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn't.  Once again, I'm sorry."" He wasn't alone. An online collection showed several similar tweets from meteorologists, including one from News 12 New Jersey's Dave Curren saying the forecast ""deflated as much as New England Patriots footballs."" Many of the responses to these posts were supportive. ""You are making a prediction about the future. Closing roads at 11 p.m. when it snows saves lives,"" Jennifer Smith in New York wrote to Szatkowski.  ""No apology necessary."" Government officials face a tough dilemma. They don't want to shut everything down, keeping children home from school and people home from work, but they also do not want to risk a disaster. ""Look at what happened in Atlanta when the city wasn't prepared,"" Frank Flores said in a Facebook discussion. He was referring to an incident a year ago this week in which people were stranded along miles and miles of icy interstates, paralyzing the metro area for more than 24 hours. Many ultimately abandoned their cars and walked home. There's some hand-wringing over the forecasting models used.  Here's the basic idea, from CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller: . ""Meteorologists largely depend on three major forecast models:  the NAM (North American Mesoscale), the GFS (Global Forecast System), and the ECMWF (European Center for Medium Range Forecasting).  Meteorologists will look at all of these and, using their own expertise, local knowledge, etc., formulate a forecast.  In this case, the NAM and the ECMWF both showed 2 feet of snow or more for New York City, while the GFS (which has just been upgraded this winter) showed a more conservative 6 to 12 inches. ""The National Weather Service forecasters in New York certainly went all in with the NAM and ECMWF forecasts, and all but ignored the GFS, without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the GFS showing a vastly different solution.""  (In 2012, the ECMWF ""was the media-darling model for properly forecasting Superstorm Sandy to a 't' while the GFS did not,"" Miller says.  ""Now it is the opposite."") Still, ""the forecast wasn't too far off if you look at it as a whole,"" Miller says. ""The heaviest snow fell across much of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Long Island and Massachusetts.  Winds have gusted up to hurricane strength, which was also in the forecast."" Predicted storm surge flooding also came to fruition, he said. ""But of course the headlines are going to come from New York City and New Jersey, where a forecast of more than 2 feet turned out to only be about half that,"" Miller said. There were 2 feet of snow elsewhere, and ""a miss of only 30 to 40 miles in a forecast that was first given 48 hours in advance is not that bad from a strictly forecasting perspective."" But from a ""practical perspective,"" it's a ""big miss, and has major ramifications with business disruption, wasted resources and tax dollars, etc.,"" Miller said. CNN did note the discrepancy among forecasts Monday, even as government officials were announcing closures. ""I just got the brand new models in just a minute ago. And one model says for New York City 2 inches -- not 2 feet, 2 inches. The other model I looked at said 27 inches,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers noted. ""I hate it when models don't agree to that extent."" It's not an exact science, and it's important for people to know that, Miller says. ""As meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts."" Opinion: Weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain . CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report from New York; Josh Levs reported from Atlanta.","Some Americans fear a ""crying wolf"" effect .

"(CNN)Here we won't go again. No Mitt Romney 3.0. No ""third time's a charm."" No invoking Ronald Reagan's two failed presidential campaigns. No 47%, car elevators or dog on the roof. No Bain Capital. No Olympics. The media can say goodbye to a plethora of story lines as it prepares to cover the 2016 presidential race. But other than mourning the (substantial) loss of some well-tread fodder, the announcement that Mitt Romney will not be running for president a third time does little to change the 2016 outlook for Republicans. There's still an establishment candidate in Jeb Bush, if he runs. And the rest of the very deep Republican bench -- with the possible exceptions of Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Chris Christie -- would have run whether Romney was in it or not. But the absence of Romney in the field is a big loss for Democrats, who were not-so-secretly hoping he'd throw his hat in one more time. Proof that they were salivating over the opportunity was President Obama's open mockery of Romney at Thursday night's speech to House Democrats: . ""We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty. That's great! Let's go! Come on! Let's do something about it!"" It's pretty rich that the sitting president who has presided over a widening of the income gap and a worsening of poverty would take a shot at anyone else who tried to offer solutions. And he wasn't alone. Obama's former campaign advisers, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and plenty others in the media piled on the criticism of Romney's anti-poverty message. Again, Democrats can't brag that their policies have helped. And, they could very well nominate another multimillionaire who has had just as much difficulty explaining her wealth to ordinary Americans in Hillary Clinton. So on its face, it would seem a dangerous gamble to attack Romney for trying to address poverty. But that's how confident Democrats are that their 2012 narratives successfully and decisively defined Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat. Yes, they are living in glass houses -- and they are stockpiling stones. I've heard from dozens, if not hundreds of people who watched the Netflix documentary ""Mitt"" and said, if only we'd seen that Romney in 2012. But that's just it -- the Mitt that actually exists, the one we see in the film and know off the campaign trail, is no match for the Mitt that the left has created. It is written. It is fact. It is history. It's also a shame, because the Mitt that actually exists would have been a formidable candidate and might have been a great president. But it's a lesson to the rest of the 2016 Republican field : Don't get defined early, and don't save your best material for the after-party.","S.E. Cupp: Democrats were very eager for Romney to run .

"Denver, Colorado (CNN)The Englewood, Colorado, school system is urging parents to talk with their children after a sexual assault case involving several students. Five teenage males have been arrested, four of them juveniles who attend public schools in the Denver suburb of about 30,000 people, police said. The girl who said she was assaulted is an Englewood High School freshman, school district spokeswoman Julie McGinley said. Police said they're looking for a sixth juvenile who also goes to Englewood schools. The teenage girl reported being sexually assaulted January 25 at a house party involving alcohol and marijuana that was attended by 10-12 people, Englewood police said. ""If your student was at this party, knows someone who was there, or knows of students who have been affected by this event, we have counselors and other trusted adults should they need support or need to share their feelings,"" Superintendent Brian Ewert said in a letter sent to parents. ""We also ask that you be available to listen to your student and talk to him or her about his or her feelings regarding this event."" Police identified only one suspect, Daylon Benjamin Hill, 19, of Englewood. He was charged with five counts, including sexual assault and sex assault on a child. He is being held on $50,000 bond. Police didn't identify the others because they are juveniles. Of those, two are 16 years old and two are 15 years old. Officers started looking for the girl late Sunday night after taking a missing juvenile report, police said. About the same time, other officers contacted the girl after she called relatives to say she had been sexually assaulted, police said. A medical examination revealed ""significant trauma consistent with sexual assault,"" according to a statement attached to Hill's arrest warrant .","5 teens charged in sexual assault, including four Englewood, Colorado, students .

"(CNN)The logistics of putting James Holmes on trial are as staggering as the carnage he allegedly committed in a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, in July 2012 when 12 people were killed and 58 others injured in gunfire. Consider this: Some 9,000 potential jurors are being summoned, and the jury selection that began Tuesday could last until May or June when the trial would finally start. Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. told the first pool of potential jurors Tuesday that if chosen for the jury, they cannot read, watch or hear anything about the case. ""This will require great effort on your part,"" the judge said three times. Also in the courtroom was Holmes, whose face remained expressionless. He faced forward toward the judge's bench the entire time without looking around or at the potential jurors in the room. Holmes, who colored his hair red and told police he was ""The Joker"" upon arrest after the mass killing, is now a different picture. In court Tuesday, he had a clean haircut, trimmed beard, eyeglasses, gray sport coat, tan slacks and blue-and-white-striped dress shirt. Here are five questions and answers about the approaching trial: . How big and long will the trial be? In all, Arapahoe County residents stand a 1-in-50 chance of receiving a summons, court spokesman Rob McCallum said. The enormous pool of potential jurors, designed to ensure a fair trial for Holmes, is being called one of the largest in U.S. history, legal analysts say. ""I've never heard of that many people,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""It just shows how these high-profile cases impose such tremendous costs on the community."" Cornell law professor Valerie Hans said those who support the death penalty are also more hostile to the insanity defense. ""The public overestimates the frequency and success of the insanity plea, and misunderstands the consequences. So this hostility toward the defendant's insanity plea will be a major challenge during voir dire,"" which is the questioning of potential jurors, Hans said. Holmes, a one-time neuroscience doctoral student, faces 166 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Now 27, he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. The trial could last four months. If there's a conviction, the death penalty phase could last an additional month. In sum, court proceedings could last until November -- near Thanksgiving, according to McCallum. What is the impact of such a potential pool? The court is casting such a wide net for jurors that it has unwittingly summoned 12 potential witnesses in the case. Even one employee in the prosecutor's office received a summons. Judge Samour has already excused those individuals from the jury summonses. With the removal of 12 possible witnesses from the jury pool, the number of potential witnesses receiving a summons could now be as high as 43, though prosecutors acknowledged in court papers ""that it is likely two individuals could have the same names and not be the same person as the endorsed prosecution witnesses in this case."" The judge said ""the court appreciates this information"" but added that prosecutors should file another notice if such a conflict arises during jury selection. The potential conflicts don't end there. Additionally, four potential jurors are related to the prosecutor's staff: two husbands, a father and an uncle. Another potential juror is a best friend of a prosecution staff member. A wife and a former colleague of prosecution witnesses are also potential jurors, prosecutors say.. But the judge declined immediately to excuse those seven potential jurors. ""Because neither party asks the court to take any action with respect to these individuals, the court refrains from doing so at this time,"" the judge said. What do the victims' families say about all this? District Attorney George Brauchler spoke with relatives of 60 victims who died or were injured. After consulting the families, he announced the prosecution will seek the death penalty for Holmes. ""In this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death,"" Brauchler said in court. Prosecutors have charged in court that Holmes ""intended to kill them all,"" referring to patrons in the crowded movie theater watching the midnight release of the Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Holmes was heavily armed and ""dressed head-to-toe in protective gear,"" authorities said. He wore black contact lenses to conceal his eyes. His AR-15 jammed during the massacre, and police arrested him in the parking lot. Meanwhile, Tom and Caren Teves, parents of son Alex who was among those killed, continue a campaign exhorting news outlets to focus on victims and not even mention suspects' names in mass shootings. Alex Teves died while protecting his girlfriend from bullets. Their plea to media is now called the #NoNotoriety Challenge: ""Stop rewarding mass murderers with the media attention they crave,"" their Facebook page says. What does Holmes' family say? Parents Robert and Arlene Holmes haven't given any interviews about their son, but in December, they issued a public letter stating that ""we have spent every moment for more than two years thinking about"" the victims and their families. Before the mass killing, their son ""never harmed anyone and he had no criminal history,"" the parents said. ""We have read postings on the Internet that have likened him to a monster. He is not a monster. He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,"" they wrote. The parents want life imprisonment without parole for their son in exchange for a guilty plea, but the prosecutor has rejected such an offer from Holmes' attorneys. Holmes' family decried the need for a trial, saying it would cause additional trauma and ""force everyone to relive those horrible moments in time."" ""We believe that the death penalty is morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill,"" the parents said. ""The focus should be on the injured and their healing,"" they added, referring to the theater victims. Read the statement (PDF) What happened to the movie theater? Aurora's Century 16 cinema complex reopened in January 2013. Elected officials and community members joined victims and their relatives at a remembrance ceremony timed with the theater's reopening, which featured a screening of ""The Hobbit."" But relatives of nine people killed in the gunfire criticized the remembrance ceremony as a publicity stunt by Cinemark, which runs the cinema. Those families called the event ""disgusting"" and ""wholly offensive to the memory of our loved ones."" But Tim Warner, Cinemark's chief executive officer, which is facing lawsuits from several victims' families and survivors, noted how ""recovery is an ongoing process.""

"(CNN)Yes, New York City got a lot less snow than forecast. Yes, if we had known there would be this little snow, things probably wouldn't have needed to get shut down as much as they were. But most of the complaining -- about either the forecast or the decisions by local and state governments -- is misguided. First of all, taking a look at the big picture, this storm was forecast pretty well. The forecast was that a big storm would develop rapidly and cause heavy snow across much of the coastal northeast, from New Jersey up through New England, as well as high winds and coastal flooding. All that happened. The peak snow accumulations are coming in as high as advertised, just not in New York City. There were very sharp gradients in the snow accumulations. That is, big differences over short distances. So a small eastward shift in the track of the storm was enough to take away most of our snow. Just 10 or 20 miles east of the city, in Long Island, snow totals are much higher. The reality is that weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain. Forecasters are looking at a range of possibilities, as spelled out in different model simulations. They have to choose among them, or split the difference in some way. But there is no perfect way to know which is right, and there never will be. The science tells us that that is the nature of weather prediction: The information is inherently uncertain. That's just how it is. Some meteorologists apologize . The right way to communicate uncertain information, really, is through probabilities. The models showed a sharp gradient in snowfall, but showed New York City on the snowy side. However, it was also clear that if the track were wrong, the city might avoid the worst of the snow. That uncertainty wasn't fully communicated. That suggests that if this storm points to a failure, it's really a failure not of the specific forecast, but of the format and language that is used to communicate all forecasts, an approach that fails to clearly spell out uncertainties and the difficulty of picking one of a number of potential storm tracks. Of course, that has nothing to do with the complaints about the transit shutdowns, because those decisions could -- and perhaps should -- have been made regardless. But it's important to remember that despite the uncertainties, decision makers have to make decisions, and being under-prepared for a storm that turns out to be worse than the forecast can lead to serious loss of life and property. Being over-prepared, in contrast, merely leads to lots of griping on the Internet. In the face of uncertainty, the right thing to do is almost always going to be to assume the worst-case scenarios. Maybe some decisions could have been different given what was known at the time (in particular, the subway shutdown might have been unnecessary even if the snow totals had come in as high as forecast). But it's still way too easy for those of us with no responsibility to play Monday morning quarterback. And overall, given the uncertainty of the different models -- and the fine line between the correct call and an inaccurate one -- the authorities look to have taken the right approach in being proactive. Good weather forecasts and well-informed, proactive emergency preparation and management save lives and property. Those are great benefits to society, and if people take them for granted most of the time, that's OK. But it's also important to understand that the unavoidable cost of enjoying these benefits is that sometimes, the problem won't be as bad as forecast, and so some decisions might seem unnecessary after the fact. So next time there is a forecast of a big storm, don't be tempted to disbelieve it just because you think this one was overblown. After all, there are many people in parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island right now who will be very glad indeed about the weather forecasters' -- and their elected officials' -- caution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Sobel.","New York City spared worst of winter storm .

"The late-night TV talk war grows more competitive in January when ABC moves ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" to an 11:35 p.m. start, pushing the long-running ""Nightline"" back an hour. ABC cited ""increased revenue potential for entertainment programming"" as a motive for moving Kimmel from the midnight timeslot he's occupied since January 2003. The decision is ""a strategic shift in its late-night strategy to better position the network for increased ratings and financial performance over the long term,"" according to an ABC statement released Tuesday. Kimmel, 44, will go head-to-head with the older and more established hosts of NBC's ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" and CBS's ""Late Show with David Letterman"" starting January 9. ""Given the passionate fan base 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' has built over the past decade and the show's ratings and creative momentum this season, the time is right to make this move,"" said Disney/ABC Television President Anne Sweeney. ""There is the potential for far greater upside over the long term with this shift, given increased advertiser demand for competitive entertainment programming in the time slot."" Although ""Nightline"" is moved back to 12:35 a.m., the show will get a Friday night primetime hour at 9 p.m. starting March 1 to ""ensure that the program has even more opportunities to continue its incredible, award-winning reporting,"" Sweeney said. ABC boasted that ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" was the only late-night broadcast talk show to see growth in overall audience in the past year. Kimmel will host the Primetime Emmy Awards next month.","ABC cites ""increased revenue potential"" as a motive for airing ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" earlier .

"A passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was found wearing an oxygen mask when the victim's body was recovered in eastern Ukraine, the Dutch foreign minister and public prosecutor's office said. ""They did not see the missile coming; but you know that someone was found with an oxygen mask over (his or her) mouth? So (he or she) had time to do that,"" Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans told the Dutch talk show ""Pauw"" on Wednesday. The Dutch public prosecutor confirmed the minister's account, saying that ""during the identification process an oxygen mask was indeed found on a victim."" ""The mask was attached around the victim's neck with an elastic strap. The Netherlands Forensic Institute examined the mask for fingerprints, saliva and DNA, but the results were inconclusive,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement Thursday.""It is not known how and at what point the mask came to be around the victim's neck. The passenger's relatives were informed at the time. None of the other victims recovered were found to be wearing oxygen masks."" New information raises questions . The statements raise questions about what happened in the moments after the Boeing 777 was allegedly hit by a missile over eastern Ukraine July 17, in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The fact that a passenger was able to put on an oxygen mask seems to dispel the idea that all 298 people on board were killed instantly in the air. The United States and Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile, a charge the rebels denied. A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board last month supported that theory, saying the plane was hit by ""high-energy objects,"" but it did not cast blame.  About two-thirds of those who died in the incident were Dutch.  The plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 'I should not have said it' Timmerman's remarks appear to have been off-the-cuff. On Thursday, he said that he regretted revealing the information about the oxygen mask, because not all the victims' relatives had yet been informed. ""I should not have said it,"" he said in a statement released by the foreign ministry. ""I feel enormously for the next of kin. The last thing I want is to in any way worsen their suffering."" The foreign ministry said the government had previously informed the family of the victim who was wearing the mask, but had not distributed the information further because ""no conclusion"" could be drawn from the fact that the victim was wearing a mask, and ""more research is needed."" The victim was not of Dutch nationality, the foreign ministry said, but it did not specify where the victim was from. All next of kin have now been informed.","The plane crashed July 17 in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board .

"The modest clinic on Milpas Street in laid-back Santa Barbara, California, was well known to patients seeking powerful pain medication. They went there to find the ""Candy Man."" Dr. Julio Diaz earned that nickname because, according to court records, he was writing prescriptions for massive numbers of pills -- hundreds, even thousands, at a time. He prescribed medications like oxycodone, a powerful opioid pain killer that is highly addictive. At the nearby Cottage Hospital, emergency room doctors noticed a pattern and sensed a problem. ""We communicate first with our patients and then with the primary care providers. We then began to see that there was a pattern and that clearly by far Dr. Diaz's prescribing stood out above any of the other physicians in the computer,"" Dr. Chris Lambert said. Lambert found that Cottage Health documented more than 400 emergency room visits from Diaz's patients, according to court documents. Some were clearly dependent on opiates, he said, and others were seeking more pain medication. ""And of course we saw the complications, too,"" Lambert noted. Those complications included symptoms of severe drug withdrawal and overdoses. The Medical Board of California, and eventually the Drug Enforcement Administration, were called to investigate. That investigation resulted in a laundry list of charges against Diaz including the over-prescription of narcotics, prescribing narcotics when there was no medical need, and illegal distribution of a narcotic to a person under the age of 21. According to the DEA, there were a dozen overdose deaths associated with Diaz. Twenty-seven-year-old Adam Montgomery was one of them. Montgomery started seeing Diaz after he injured his back on a construction job. He was seeking pain medication. He got it, and soon he was hooked. As the months went by, Montgomery's parents noticed a change. ""Well, at some point, he started spending a lot of time in bed. And just watching TV, never doing anything,"" Adam's father, Robert Montgomery said. ""And that seemed to get worse and worse. And then I noticed the color change in his face, his attitude, his love toward his family ...That all went away."" Montgomery slowly became aware that his son was addicted to oxycodone, and he called Diaz. ""I was seeing paperwork with hundreds of oxycodone pills,"" Montgomery told CNN. ""I wanted to know why he was giving him so many."" He says he never got an answer. In an affidavit, the DEA alleges that in the six weeks before Adam Montgomery's death, Diaz prescribed him a total of 2,087 pills, an average of 63 pills a day. On the day after Thanksgiving in 2011, Montgomery received the news that his son had died of a drug overdose. In Adam Montgomery's bedroom and car, investigators found bottles of multiple drugs, and some were empty. All were prescribed by Diaz. The autopsy concluded that a cocktail of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and methadone was the cause of death. ""Right now we have more people that are dying from prescription opioids than cocaine and heroin combined,"" said Robert Hill, a DEA special agent with years of experience on the front lines of the war on drugs. Hill says that in 2011, the most recent year for which there are statistics, more than 22,000 people died from prescription drugs. Late last year, Diaz signed a plea agreement, admitting to a reduced number of charges. Those charges include the illegal distribution of oxycodone, hydromorphone, alprazolam and fentanyl. The original charges against him carried a maximum sentence of 200 years in prison and up to $10 million in fines, but the plea bargain will likely reduce that sentence. CNN contacted Diaz's attorney, but received no comment.  Diaz awaits sentencing. To this day, Montgomery's parents struggle with the what-ifs. Had he known then what he knows now, ""I might have been able to save him, but I was more disappointed in him -- in making these bad decisions,"" Robert Montgomery said. ""But it wasn't him, it was the drugs that changed him. So I just turned my back on him, and I wouldn't do that today."" How safe are your prescription drugs?

"(CNN) -- The marching orders from Congress and the White House to NASA were pretty straightforward. Go out and build a new big rocket to replace the retiring space shuttle fleet. Unlike the shuttle, the new rocket has to be powerful enough to get out of low Earth orbit and carry humans to an asteroid and eventually Mars, perhaps even the moon. There must also be a test flight by 2016. But at this point, NASA officials are warning of a potentially devastating setback to future space exploration. Its first new rocket in 40 years may not happen because the agency doesn't think the $8 billion budgeted over the next three years is enough. ""We have done calculations with current models and approaches to doing this type of development and it doesn't work with funding constraints combined with schedules that were laid out in the Authorization Act,"" Doug Cooke, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems, told CNN. Congress has already responded that unless NASA can prove there's not enough money, the rocket must -- by law -- be built. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, a key space agency supporter, was adamant when he spoke to CNN: ""NASA must stop making excuses and follow this law. I believe the best and brightest at the space agency can build upon the $9 billion we've already invested in advanced technology to design a new heavy-lift rocket, while taking a stepping-stone, pay-as-you-go approach."" ""We're doing everything we can to get there,"" Cooke said. The $9 billion was for the now-defunct Constellation program, planned to take astronauts to the moon and on to Mars. It was cut from the federal budget last year after being called behind schedule and over budget. After the last shuttle flight later this year, NASA will be out of the space taxi business. Commercial companies are expected to take over ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. NASA, no longer burdened with an aging vehicle and costly flights, has again been told to focus on building a new rocket. Citizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz is not confident: ""NASA is unfortunately becoming a black hole for the taxpayers and something needs to be done to turn things around,"" he said. ""The Constellation program has taught us the things that work, the things that we could have done better."" The vehicle most likely to be presented to Congress would have solid rocket boosters like the shuttle, only larger; would use shuttle main engines and would also, like the shuttle, have a liquid fuel stage, Cooke told CNN. Early test flights would use a lot of existing hardware. ""We have engines that will be freed up when shuttle retires. We do have solid rocket casings that are from the shuttle program that we can use,"" he said. NASA says it will tell Congress by the spring or early summer whether the rocket can be built with the money available and meet the 2016 deadline.","Space agency has $8 billion and 2016 deadline .

"(CNN)If there were an obvious takeaway for the 2016 hopefuls this year, it might as well have been the motto for the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton: ""It's the economy, stupid."" So it is no wonder that many of Hillary Clinton's touchstones on the campaign trail this year have come straight from her husband's 1992 playbook — at times almost verbatim — a focus on rebuilding the middle class, addressing income inequality, and reviving the American promise that each generation should fare better than the last. The echoes of the early 1990s in Clinton's speeches as she weighs a run for the presidency are no accident. In what amounted to her first major foray on the campaign trail in September at retiring Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's steak fry, she spoke of restoring ""the basic bargain of America"" -- one her husband had proposed in the 1992 campaign -- that ""no matter who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and you play by the rules, you deserve the opportunity, the same opportunity as anyone else, to build a good life for yourself and your family."" Flash back to Bill Clinton's speech in struggling Johnstown, Pa., in April of 1992. The American dream that he grew up with, Clinton said in a typical line from his stump speech, had been shattered for millions of Americans. ""The idea,"" he said, ""that if you worked hard and played by the rules you'd be rewarded, you'd do a little better next year than you do last year, and your kids will do better than you — that idea has been devastated."" If she runs for president, pundits will invariably argue for the next two years over whether a Hillary Clinton White House would look more like a third term of Barack Obama or Bill Clinton — and Democrats face a difficult challenge holding on to the White House given that it often flips to the opposing party after eight years of one-party control. But when it comes to voter frustration and unease, Hillary Clinton may be on strikingly similar terrain to what she and her husband navigated in 1991 and 1992. ""You just look at the statistics now and they really do match up with 1992,"" said Chris Lehane, a White House adviser to Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Given that the Clintons left the White House in the midst of an economic boom with unemployment at about 4%, Lehane argues that there are only upsides for the former Secretary of State in associating herself with her husband's tenure. ""She benefits enormously from connecting herself to that time period, but it also requires putting out a vision that matches with today's challenges,"" Lehane said. ""It really gets down to the basic idea of what needs to be in place in this day and age so that if you're a middle class family, your kids are actually going to have the opportunity to do better than you."" Heading into 2016, the economy has been steadily recovering with unemployment dropping below 6%; as Bill Clinton campaigned in 1991, the economy was in a backward slide (unemployment rose from 6.8% in 1991 to 7.5%). But the pessimism many Americans feel is eerily comparable to when Hillary Clinton first stepped out on the national stage. Only about 23% of Americans said they were satisfied with the direction of the country in the 2014 Gallup survey, just a shade higher than what the polling firm measured in 1991 and 1992. In an August NBC News/WSJ poll, 60% of voters said they believed America was in a state of decline, compared with 63% who said that in December of 1991. There has been even greater erosion in the sense of hopefulness about the prospects of the younger generation. In December of 1991 and 1992, the number of Americans who said they were confident that life for the next generation would be better than their own was between 41% and 44%. This August that number sank to 21%. Aligning with Bill Clinton's early '90s riff on the fading American dream, the December 2014 New York Times/CBS poll found that only 64% of Americans believe it is possible to start poor in this country, work hard and become rich -- an even lower percentage than in the mid-1990s (70%). Republican Pollster Whit Ayres noted that Bill Clinton won in 1992 by wrapping his middle-class focused message around a policy agenda with conservative elements that appealed to a broader audience. ""Bill Clinton in 1992 was running as a center-left Democrat who wanted to end welfare as we know it, he was for the death penalty, he ripped into Sister Souljah for saying we ought to have a week where we kill white people,"" Ayres said. By contrast, Hillary Clinton ""is for all the touchstones of the left today,"" he said, and has yet to show how she would win over more moderate voters. While Clinton ran as the candidate of strength and experience in 2008, Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised former President George W. Bush and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, said Clinton has yet to clearly outline a justification for her candidacy in 2016. ""I don't think it's readily apparent to anybody, including most every Democrat, what Hillary Clinton is running for president to do or to be, which was not ever the issue with Bill Clinton,"" Schmidt said. ""There are change elections and there are 'more of the same' elections, and there was a lot of economic anxiety in the 1992 election and (Bill Clinton) was able to drive a change narrative."" ""After eight years of Barack Obama, it's very difficult to understand what kind of change it is that Hillary Clinton's candidacy could represent,"" he said. To the extent that Hillary Clinton has hinted at her policy agenda, she has not been shy about suggesting that she would build on her husband's legacy, which she took part in shaping as his informal strategist, sounding board and speech editor. The central thread through many of Clinton's political speeches in recent months has once again been the idea of championing the middle class — the ""invisible Americans"" as she called them in 2008 — or ""fighting for the forgotten middle class"" as her husband's 1992 campaign brochure framed his version of that message. When talking about expanding paid family leave, for example, she often notes that the Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill her husband signed in the White House. She has also reminded audiences that he signed legislation that raised the minimum wage in 1996, as she makes the case for another increase. When addressing economic angst while campaigning for Democratic hopeful Bruce Braley in Iowa in late October, she alluded to the Clinton White House years as a kind of golden era: ""Millions of new jobs were created, more families made it into the middle class, and more families got lifted out of poverty,"" she said. Moving beyond nostalgia, she has also tried out variations of the 1992 campaign lines. In seeking to connect, she has echoed the motto that her husband used in his 1992 convention speech: ""I am a product of the middle class and when I am president, you will be forgotten no more."" ""I am a product of the American middle class,"" she said at the Women in the World Conference in April, adding that she wanted other American children to have the opportunities she had. At the Harkin Steak Fry, she lamented that American families ""are working harder than ever"" but finding that maintaining a middle class lifestyle is like ""rolling a boulder uphill."" Cue the tape again to Bill Clinton's 1992 convention speech: ""People are working harder than ever,"" he said, ""and their incomes are still going down."" When she was by his side during a 1992 bus tour from New York to St. Louis, Bill Clinton sought to strengthen his connection with working class voters by saying he was ""tired of the dignity being stripped from blue collar work in America."" When Hillary Clinton went to Pennsylvania in October, she carried that theme forward while campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. ""There is nothing but dignity in hard work,"" she said in that speech, calling for greater respect for the jobs held by her own generation and that of her parents. If the winning strategy for any candidate in 2016 is to show an understanding of the economic angst that voters are feeling — and policies to address it — Republican strategists point out that Clinton's other hurdle will be that her husband was far more natural in showing his empathy for others as he delivered that message. In anticipation of her run, Republicans have pounced on every opportunity to argue that it has been a long time since the Clintons were a struggling young couple in Arkansas — focusing on their wealth and her hefty speech fees. ""She has lived a pretty gilded life for the last couple of decades,"" said Republican strategist Katie Packer Gage, referring to the trappings of Clinton's various roles as First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State like her security detail. ""When's the last time that she got into a cold car?"" Clinton's most notable stumble in that arena was when she told ABC's Diane Sawyer during her book tour that she and her husband were ""not only dead broke, but in debt"" when they left the White House, as they struggled to pay mortgages on several homes and their daughter's private school education.  She quickly sought to clarify her remarks on ""Good Morning America."" ""I fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today,"" she said. ""It's an issue that I've worked on and cared about my entire life."" In 2016, Republicans will be looking for every opportunity to make her prove it.","Clinton's economic rhetoric is straight from husband's 1992 playbook .

"(CNN)ABC's ""Fresh Off The Boat,"" the first sitcom to feature an Asian American family in two decades, has run into renewed controversy a week before its debut. While the show has been praised for its potential to rebut stereotypes, its social media team flubbed when it tweeted a graphic featuring caricatures of different races underneath the phrase ""We're all a little #FreshOffTheBoat."" If anything, the ad reinforced tired imagery: One Asian figure wore a pointy bamboo hat; another Latino figure wore a sombrero with a curly mustache. Story creator Eddie Huang, whose memoirs the sitcom is based on, was furious. ""This is plain offensive and ridiculous,"" he tweeted. ""Someone please reverse this... at least they didn't do the Native American with chicken pox blankie lol"" ""Point isn't whether we in fact wear kufis and rice hats but it's reductive,"" he added. Wall Street Journal columnist Jeff Yang, whose son Hudson stars in the series, tweeted that the ad was ""awful."" The controversy came just weeks after Huang publicly slammed the show's producers in a lengthy New York Magazine piece, accusing the network of distorting his memoir into a ""cornstarch story about Asian-Americans resembling moo goo gai pan"" in order to make it more appealing to white audiences. But he later backed off the comments in a panel discussion on the issue, saying he didn't have a problem with the show's executive producer and felt his memoir, published in 2013, was portrayed ""fairly."" There was also an awkward moment at the discussion when a journalist asked the show's cast whether the sitcom would involve ""chopsticks."" The ad also restarted online debate over another contentious part of the sitcom: its name. The phrase ""fresh off the boat,"" typically shortened to the acronym ""fob,"" is a loaded phrase many young American immigrants will recognize. Depending on who you ask, it's either a slang term or a slur used to label minorities, often Asian American, who haven't fully assimilated with the mainstream. Huang deals with the term in his memoir -- also named ""Fresh Off The Boat"" -- recalling a moment he heard it being used to insult his father. ""He never forgot it,"" he writes. ""We weren't Americans like everyone else. We'd always be the other in this bullshit country."" Arissa Oh, a history professor at Boston College, says the term is painful because ""it aligns with Asian Americans always having to negotiate the fear of being perceived as a perpetual foreigner. Because the consequences can be anything from bullying and ostracism, to violence or internment."" But Huang and Yang have argued that naming the show ""Fresh Off The Boat"" is an expression of immigrant pride, and can help to ""reclaim"" the term as something positive. ""It's a term whose claws should and can be removed,"" Yang tells CNN. ""But only if we have an honest and open discussion about what it means to be American, and why a nation of immigrants remains so hostile toward those who are newly arrived."" Concerns over the phrase aren't new. When the show was announced last May, some Asian Americans worried openly -- what if the show inadvertently encourages people to toss the phrase around in an offensive way? What if, instead of deepening America's understanding of the immigrants' difficulties, the show simply gives people another opportunity to mock them? Perhaps, some argue, these thorny issues only get harder to untangle when they're thrust into the mainstream. As Oh explains, ""I sort of feel like 'fob' is a family issue, you know -- like internal to Asian Americans? We need to reclaim it or something first before we put it out there in front of other people."" But the show is stepping into the spotlight next week. And even its strongest supporters are nervous. ""We're all hoping that this works,"" says Yang. ""Because 20 years of wandering in the wilderness is damn well enough.""","Upcoming ABC sitcom 'Fresh Off The Boat' draws fire after tweet depicting racist stereotypes .

"It's been dubbed by some as the ""auto intifada"" -- the spate of attacks on Jewish civilians in Jerusalem by Palestinians driving vehicles. In two such incidents in recent weeks, four people, including a 3-month-old, have been killed and many more injured. In both instances, the drivers were Palestinians from East Jerusalem, and their targets were lines at light rail stops. The incidents were quickly seized upon by Hamas, the radical Palestinian group that controls Gaza, which said: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" They were also celebrated in social media with a variety of cartoons depicting car pedals in the form of guns and road signs showing pedestrians being run over. One cartoon depicted a car as the barrel of a gun with the caption: ""Revolt and resist, even with your car."" Another showed a car in the colors of Palestine hitting two men with Jewish stars on their black hats. A third showed cars with sharks' teeth prowling the streets. There also was a play on words in some of the cartoons -- with ""daes,"" meaning ""run over"" in Arabic, similar to ""Daesh,"" the Arabic shorthand for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Facebook pages were inundated with messages such as: ""From Palestine we brought to the world the intifada of stones. Now we bring the intifada of running over."" Palestinians living in East Jerusalem who have licenses and an Israeli ID card can drive anywhere in the city and elsewhere in Israel. 'There is no Iron Dome against drivers' In some quarters, there has been a visceral reaction to the attacks. A former Jerusalem police chief, Aryeh Amit, told the newspaper Arutz Sheva: ""We are now paying the price for a lack of policy and decision-making. ... The Jewish residents of Jerusalem are scared to death. This is reminiscent of the days of the suicide bombings."" Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, who is leader of the Jewish Home party, warned: ""There is no Iron Dome against drivers, and Israeli citizens cannot live without deterrence and sovereignty in their capital city."" He criticized the installation of concrete barriers at light rail stops as too defensive. ""The solution is deterrence, not defensive measures. The solution is not the Iron Dome concept, but an iron fist,"" Bennett said on his Facebook page. In reality, two random attacks hardly amount to an intifada, even if they derive from (and fuel) an already tense atmosphere in Jerusalem over worship at the Temple Mount, or, as it's known to Muslims, Haram al-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary. A weapon of despair . Far from being the weapon of choice, these crude vehicle attacks seem to be a weapon of despair, and they only serve to underline the absence of both political solutions and organized forms of resistance. The previous intifada, a word that means ""shaking off"" in Arabic, had leadership, some measure of organization and mass support. The first, which began in 1987, was soon harnessed by ""The Unified Leadership of the Uprising."" The second, which began after then-Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in September 2000, was embraced and directed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and Yasser Arafat. Around the turn of the century, Israelis were terrorized by bus bombings, suicide attacks in shopping malls and restaurants. Since then, the Israeli construction of the West Bank barrier has cut off access to Jerusalem for most Palestinians living there; and Israeli security services have built up a formidable intelligence-gathering apparatus. Nowadays, protests involve mainly teenage Palestinians connected by WhatsApp and other social messaging who take to the streets -- usually in their dozens rather than hundreds -- to hurl rocks and firecrackers at Israeli police. They respond to events, such as the kidnapping and killing of a Palestinian teenager in Jerusalem last summer by three Israelis. There is no evidence these protesters have either leadership or structure -- rather, they're driven by an anger born of being penned into cramped neighborhoods with few services and fewer prospects. Israeli security forces contain that anger and make a few dozen arrests with relative ease. 'A weary approach to violence' The Palestinian Authority rails against Israeli policy in Jerusalem, the expansion of Jewish settlements and more, but it has shown no appetite for leading or coordinating such protests. ""West Bank elites are generally less vitriolic in their views, more Palestinians have vested economic interests to protect, and there is a weary approach to violence,"" says Riccardo Fabiani of Eurasia Group. And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas ""would prefer to contain any risks of protests spreading to the West Bank as he fears that Hamas could take advantage of instability in this territory and further expand its foothold there,"" Fabiani said. Even so, the fate of the Temple Mount or Noble Sanctuary is a highly emotive issue for both sides. Last week, a Palestinian from East Jerusalem shot and critically wounded a rabbi, Yehuda Glick, who campaigns for the right of Jews to pray at the Temple Mount. After an Israeli counterterrorism unit shot and killed the assailant hours later, Abbas wrote to his family saying he would ""go to heaven as a martyr defending the rights of our people and its holy places."" On Wednesday, Ibrahim al Akari, a father of five from the Shuafat refugee camp, drove his van into a crowd of people at a light rail stop in East Jerusalem, authorities said. His widow told reporters he had been following media coverage of events at the holy site's al-Aqsa Mosque ""and saw the blood, the wounded, the desecration of the Holy Book (the Quran) and all that happened."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to preserve the status quo at the Temple Mount, whereby Jews can visit the site but under no circumstances pray there. But Palestinians see visits by Glick -- as well as deputy speaker of the Knesset Moshe Feiglin and other Israeli politicians -- as provocative and part of a campaign to establish a Jewish place of worship in the complex. Several Palestinians have been injured amid clashes with Israeli police around the compound, mainly by rubber bullets and the effects of tear gas, but there have been no fatalities. Israel and the Palestinian Authority wants to keep it that way, for fear that more serious clashes at such a sensitive site could spark a conflict much broader than the ""auto intifada.""","Palestinian motorists have targeted civilians in Jerusalem .

"(CNN) -- ""Opie & Anthony"" has been cut in half. Anthony Cumia, the ""Anthony"" portion of the shock-jock radio team, was fired by employer Sirius XM after Cumia made a series of racially charged tweets Wednesday night. ""SiriusXM has terminated its relationship with Anthony Cumia of the 'Opie & Anthony' channel,"" Patrick Reilly, the satellite radio broadcaster's media relations manager, said in a statement. ""The decision was made, and Cumia informed, late Thursday, July 3, after careful consideration of his racially-charged and hate-filled remarks on social media. Those remarks and postings are abhorrent to SiriusXM, and his behavior is wholly inconsistent with what SiriusXM represents."" According to Cumia, on Wednesday night he was taking pictures in Times Square when an African-American woman objected to being photographed. Cumia claims he was assaulted by the woman. He let loose with a series of tweets, many with profane and inflammatory language. One called the woman an ""animal pig face worthless meat sack"" and worse. He did not report the alleged assault to the police. When asked why by one person on Twitter, he responded, ""Because I can take some punches w/out wasting the cops time."" Cumia appeared to be caught by surprise by the firing. ""Sirius decided to cave and fire me. Welcome to bizarro world. Fired for s**t that wasn't even on the air & wasn't illegal.

"(CNN)NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, who has been accused by his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll of domestic assault, testified in a court hearing Tuesday that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood. While testifying in court in Dover, Delaware, over Driscoll's request for a no-contact order, Busch said that Driscoll is an assassin for the U.S. government who would go on covert missions around the world. He also said that Driscoll had claimed a character in the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty"" was based on her and other women. In his testimony, Busch said that once when he and Driscoll were in El Paso, Texas, Driscoll went out in camouflage gear, only to return later wearing an evening gown covered with blood and a trench coat. When asked by his attorney, Rusty Hardin, why he believed Driscoll is a hired killer, Busch said, ""Everybody on the outside can tell me I'm crazy, but I lived on the inside and saw it firsthand."" Driscoll and her attorney, Carolyn McNeice, did not challenge Busch's testimony while in court Tuesday. Driscoll is a defense contractor and is authorized to carry weapons. ""Police officers, correction officers and military personnel are trained to use weapons,"" McNeice told CNN on Wednesday. ""They're not assassins."" When asked about Busch's allegations, McNeice told CNN, ""We deny that entirely."" The family court battle stems from a November incident where Driscoll says that Busch assaulted her. Driscoll has accused Busch of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway. The state attorney general is still investigating the case. Hardin said that his client did not assault Driscoll. ""We know one thing. (Busch) never, ever physically abused her, and we're real comfortable that that was made clear today -- the last two days in particular,"" Hardin said Tuesday. Hardin said in a statement in November that Busch would fully cooperate in the investigation, saying the allegation ""is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship.""

"Debris flew into the stands, injuring a number of spectators -- at least two of them critically -- during a jaw-dropping crash Saturday in the final turn of a NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway. The multicar crash occurred near the end of the Nationwide Series Drive4COPD 300 race at the same Florida track where Sunday's Daytona 500 will be held. The race had recently restarted after another wreck, after which driver Michael Annett was hospitalized for bruising to his chest, according to Richard Petty Motorsports. Several closely-packed cars were jostling for position at top speed when they got tangled up, setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared a number of vehicles. Reigning Sprint Cup champ Brad Keselowski -- who later told CNN he and others were simply ""going for the win"" -- was among those involved, while Tony Stewart somehow emerged unscathed and finished by winning the race. Driver Kyle Larson's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators. It broke into pieces -- including tires and a fiery engine. Larson walked away from the crash, even after the front part of his No. 32 car was completely gone. He and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the Daytona infield and released. Some of the shredded debris flew into the barrier, while others got into the stands -- some of it reaching the second level about 20 feet up. A video posted on YouTube shows a cloud of debris flying into stands and one man gasping, ""Oh, my God."" A tire rests on one seat, as a man frantically waves and yells to get the attention of paramedics. Afterward, several spectators could be seen lying down after apparently suffering injuries. A line of about 10 ambulances lined up on the track, with some first responders carrying stretchers. Fourteen fans were treated at an on-site medical facility, while 14 others were transported to area hospitals, speedway president Joie Chitwood  told reporters. ""I'm just hoping everyone is OK,"" said Keselowski. ""As drivers, we assume the risk. But fans do not."" NASCAR president Mike Helton earlier told ESPN, which was broadcasting the race, some people were taken to Halifax Health Medical Center. He said the protective fence did its job in preventing potentially more injuries and possibly deaths. Byron Cogdell, a spokesman for the hospital, told CNN that his facility was treating 12 patients. Two of those -- one of them a child -- are in critical but stable condition. ""Everybody appears to be in stable condition,"" Cogdell said. Staff at Florida Hospital Memorial Medical Center were treating one person and expecting three more, spokeswoman Lindsay Rew said Saturday evening. The injured include Eddie Huckaby, a 53-year-old Krum, Texas, resident who suffered a leg gash when a large piece of metal hit him as he was watching the race, his brother Terry Huckaby told CNN affiliate WKMG. He described the motor landing in the stands, as well as a wheel ""and everything flying over your head and debris everywhere."" ""He's doing fine,"" Terry Huckaby said of his brother, who underwent surgery at Halifax Health Medical Center. ""The first thing he said, 'I don't want to miss that (Daytona 500) race, but I have to watch on TV.'"" Accidents are nothing new to NASCAR, where cars often cruise at speeds topping 190 mph, nor to the Daytona track. One of the sport's most horrific, and well-known, wrecks happened in the 2001 Daytona 500, when famed driver Dale Earnhardt Sr. was killed -- also, on that race's final lap. Still, injuries and fatalities to spectators are much rarer. With the stands having been quickly evacuated, crews worked to repair the damaged fence. Chitwood expressed confidence the 55th edition of the Daytona 500 would go on as planned, with spectators even sitting in the same seats struck by debris Saturday. ""With the fence being prepared tonight to our safety protocols, we expect to go racing tomorrow with no changes,"" Chitwood said.","Texas man had surgery after suffering leg gash but is ""doing fine,"" brother says .

"(CNN)Wearing a sparkling engagement ring, Shayanna Jenkins regularly attended pretrial hearings for her fiancé, Aaron Hernandez. He was often seen mouthing ""I love you,"" to her. But as testimony gets underway, will Jenkins' words help or hurt her fiancé if she takes the stand? Jenkins is on the prosecution's witness list. ""Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love,"" said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, a former New York City homicide prosecutor. But there is no privilege in Massachusetts allowing engaged couples to avoid testifying against one another. Hernandez, the ex-New England Patriot tight end who once had a $40 million contract, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Odin Lloyd. He has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What could be at stake for Jenkins? Prosecutors say Hernandez's high school sweetheart lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Jenkins' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot seven times, according to a medical examiner. Who's who in Aaron Hernandez case . In early January, Shayanna Jenkins met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret even from the Hernandez defense team. What could Jenkins say that might implicate her fiancé in Lloyd's death? For one thing, on the day after Lloyd's killing, prosecutors say she got a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants say Hernandez asked his fiancée to get something out of their basement. ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" TTYL is shorthand for ""talk to you later."" The evidence against Hernandez: What's in, what's out . A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later carrying something ""rigid"" she described as a box, court documents state. She placed it inside a garbage bag, covered it with children's clothing, and carried the bag to a car and drove away, prosecutors say. Jenkins borrowed her sister's car, something her sister told investigators she had never done before. When Jenkins returned home, she is seen on the same security system but without the ""rigid"" item. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the murder weapon was inside. It has not been found. Hernandez's lawyers have argued there's no way of knowing what was in the box. ""I mean, who knows?"" Hernandez co-counsel Jamie Sultan told the court in 2014. ""It could be drugs, it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact. There are all kinds of possibilities."" Hernandez's defense team has filed a motion demanding to know what promises prosecutors may have made to Jenkins in the so-called immunity meeting. If she made a deal for a lesser charge or immunity, the jury will have to take it into account. ""The jury is going to look at that and say, 'You know something? He must be guilty if even his fiancée would say that,'"" said Callan. ""Or the defense would convince them that she's made such a sweet deal with the prosecution that she's decided to lie to implicate her lover,"" he added. Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy. That's because, Callan said, prosecutors could later contend at a perjury trial that she repeated an alleged lie under oath. ""It's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges,"" Callan said. On the other hand, if Jenkins decides to testify without immunity, takes the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination and gives no substantive  testimony, Callan said the defense may argue ahead of time that her testimony would be prejudicial to Hernandez and not be allowed. While some jurors may think prosecutors should not ""force"" a loved one to testify, Callan said it may be unavoidable if prosecutors are convinced it's necessary to help prove their case. ""This is not just harassing a loved one, this is putting somebody on the witness stand who has information for the jury,"" Callan added. Jenkins' lawyer has declined comment. Her client may be in a tough spot either way, if she is in a struggle over family loyalty versus the chance of losing her freedom.","Aaron Hernandez is on trial in the death of Odin Lloyd .

"Responding to allegations, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said Monday that officials did not restrict airspace over Ferguson, Missouri, to block media coverage of protests. Rather, he said, the temporary restriction was about protecting both those in the air and on the ground. ""It's always all about safety,"" Belmar told reporters. ""We don't have the ability to preclude people out of there for any other reason other than that. Had we just wanted to move the media away from this arena we would have started that on the ground, and that's not what happened,"" he said. The chief spoke one day after the Associated Press reported that the no-fly zone was aimed at the media -- a story a St. Louis alderman described as ""disturbing."" The report only further hurt the already damaged trust between residents and authorities, St. Louis alderman Antonio French told CNN. The AP's story, he said, ""shows that there seemed to be an active campaign to keep what was happening out of the spotlight, to suppress media coverage"" of demonstrations and riots in Ferguson following the police shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager who witnesses say had his arms up and was surrendering when a white police officer shot him August 9. Authorities contend that Brown attacked the officer in his car and tried to take his gun. The White House also commented on the AP story, noting that the flight restrictions were temporary. ""In this case, what the FAA says is that they took the prudent step of implementing this temporary flight restriction in the immediate aftermath of reports of shots fired at a police helicopter,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ""but within 12 to 14 hours, that flight restriction was updated in a way to remove restrictions for reporters who were seeking to operate in the area."" Belmar stressed that the temporary flight restriction did not prohibit all flights at all altitudes. Police, for example, continued to fly, even though doing so was not 100% safe, the chief said. He also underscored that there were threats from credible sources suggesting certain groups were targeting helicopters with rifles and lasers. ""At no time ... did we request that only media be kept out of the airspace and, again, I would like to reiterate that the FAA contacted us regarding the amount of air traffic that was in that location,"" Belmar said. Keeping the media out? Brown's shooting sparked a federal civil rights inquiry and a grand jury investigation. In the immediate days after Brown's killing, an intense national spotlight shone on the St. Louis suburb. A rush of media went to Ferguson. Several journalists were arrested, and law enforcement officers were seen and heard on video harassing members of the media. An Al Jazeera America correspondent told CNN's Brian Stelter that he felt rubber bullets and tear gas were shot at his crew intentionally. Journalists arrested in Ferguson . At the time, police requested a restriction of airspace surrounding Ferguson, and the Federal Aviation Administration agreed to it for safety reasons. But according to recorded telephone conversations that AP obtained, the ban was aimed at keeping news helicopters from flying over Ferguson. On August 12, the morning after the FAA imposed the first flight ban, FAA air traffic managers tried to redefine the flight ban so that police helicopters and commercial flights running at nearby Lambert-St. Louis International Airports could fly, according to AP. They were struggling to explain how those flights were cleared to fly, but others were not, the news agency said. ""They finally admitted it really was to keep the media out,"" said one FAA manager about the St. Louis County Police in a series of recorded telephone conversations that AP has. AP reported that a manager at the FAA's Kansas City center said police ""did not care if you ran commercial traffic through this TFR (temporary flight restriction) all day long. They didn't want media in there."" ""There is really ... no option for a TFR that says, you know, 'OK, everybody but the media is OK,'"" the manager said, the AP reported. The managers then crafted wording they felt would keep news helicopters out of the controlled zone but not interfere with other air traffic, according to AP. FAA's response to CNN . CNN asked the FAA about the Associated Press story and received a written statement that read, in part: ""FAA cannot and will never exclusively ban media from covering an event of national significance and media was never banned from covering the ongoing events in Ferguson in this case."" On Monday, French, the St. Louis alderman, told CNN: ""When you take these new facts and add them to what we saw -- the targeting of journalists including violence perpetuated toward journalists -- this (the new allegation involving the FAA and police) is not the kind of thing that you'd think would happen in our country."" The alderman said he hoped the AP story will ignite a conversation or some kind of probe. ""We really need to find out what was behind this, who was behind this, who authorized this, is this kind of thing done regularly?"" French said. ""When things like this happen it's about how we (local leaders) respond to it."" French noted that he can urge an investigation -- but he's a city representative, not a county one, and doesn't have the authority to demand a probe, he said. The flight restrictions were lifted on August 22, the AP report said, citing records. In its statement to CNN, the FAA said: ""There is nothing more important to the FAA than the safety of the National Airspace System and people on the ground.  When local law enforcement reports a danger to aircraft, including guns fired into the air that could impact low flying aircraft, the FAA will always err on the side of safety."" It continues, ""When requested and no safety or security issues exist, the FAA actively facilitates media access to airspace, making provisions that allow properly accredited media representatives to operate inside the boundaries of temporarily restricted airspace through proper coordination with air traffic controllers or other appropriate officials. To the best of our knowledge, during the 11 day period flight restrictions of varying levels were in place, no media outlets objected to any of the restrictions."" A violation of the Constitution? The American Civil Liberties Union weighed in on the AP story Monday. ""Just as the ACLU and ACLU of Missouri are working to protect the rights of protesters on the ground, we will protect them in the air as well,"" said Lee Rowland, a staff attorney at the ACLU's New York headquarters. She serves as lead counsel in federal First Amendment cases. ""It's very troubling to the ACLU and it should be extremely troubling to anyone in the public who wants to get news about what their government is up to,"" she said. ""This was a no-fly zone targeted at the media and it appears it was not for safety purposes. If indeed the air restrictions were only to keep the media out, it is a constitutional violation of the freedom of the press.""

"(CNN) -- Growing up, Alli Webb always loved having her hair done, and after having children of her own she decided to bring that happy feeling to millions of women worldwide in an instant with her booming business, Drybar. CNN: How did you start out? W: I've been doing hair for 17 years off and on since I was in my early 20s. Then I got married and became a stay at home mom, but after five years of that I got the itch to get back out there. I was basically running around town blow drying all my mommy friends and I had this little thriving mobile blow out business. That's when it kind of hit me that there was no place for women to go for a great blowout in a great space. I was only charging $40 to go to a woman's house which is pretty cheap, but for me is was more about getting out of the house versus the money. CNN: You have 38 stores now, are you still doing blowouts? W: Not as much as I used to but I do love to come in the shop and do an occasional blowout. With over 2,000 stylists I can't do it myself anymore but I train a team that does it so I'll do a lot of demos for them too, which I love, to get my hands back in hair because I have such a strong passion for hair. CNN: Have you been able to balance your work and personal life? W: I get asked that question a lot and the honest answer is just it's hard. I have two little boys, they're 9 and 7 and they are my whole life. I always say that I don't think I could be as good as a mom if I wasn't happy in the other side of my life and I think that's really important to keep in mind as a working woman. CNN: Tell us about the core values? W: We have so many, like ""life is too short to be somewhere lame,"" ""pretty is as pretty does,"" I heard that my whole life growing up. My parents were very big on; it doesn't matter how pretty you are on the outside, if you're not pretty on the inside, it doesn't matter. Being yourself is one of them, we want our stylists to feel really empowered to be who they are. I've had stylists ask me if they should cover up their tattoos, and I was like noooo, we want to see them! I think it's important for businesses to really establish what makes them different and unique. CNN: Tell us about a typical day for you. W: I get my kids off to school that's first and foremost, I'm usually at my office for a little while and I'm usually based in LA so I try to hit as many LA stores as I can. I like to pop in unannounced and make sure everything is running smoothly but it just kind of depends on the day. CNN: So most days you pop into stores? W: I try to. I do work in the office a lot too because we have so much going on there but I really try to get out in the field and make surprise visits just so I can see what's going on, stay connected, get a blowout, whatever. CNN: What happens when you pop in? W: Sometimes people get a little like uh-oh. I don't like to announce it because I like to really see what's happening and typically everyone's usually in pretty good shape and excited to see me and to show me stuff that's happening in their store. CNN: Tell us about the services you offer? W: That was something I felt really strongly about when we started. I've always had long thick curly hair and people when you typically walk into salons they say well for you it's gonna be $60 but for your friend it's $50 and it felt so discriminatory towards me and I wanted women to feel like there's no bait and switch, it was $40 no matter how long your hair is, if we curl it, flat iron it it's always gonna be $40. CNN: And the menu? W: It's funny when we were coming up with the bar menu, it was so fun naming all the hairstyles after drinks and I thought how fun would it be to be sitting here and say I'll have the Manhattan or I'll have the Cosmo. Women really get into it, a lot of chatter on Instagram about you know, what style did you get? You hear it all the time in our shops, I'm having the southern comfort or I'm having a mai tai. It's all a part of making it an experience and a fun place to hang out. Watch: Pharmacist's rise to chief exec .

"I was about halfway through the marathon when I saw the man with the plastic pink flamingo. Like me, he was jogging down a highway in coastal North Carolina. Unlike me, he had a beanie -- yes, with propeller -- perched on his head. I was running my first marathon, inspired by the terrorists-be-dammed attitude emanating from the #runforboston hashtag after the Boston Marathon bombing. I'd pledged to run the race shortly after two blasts at that race in April of last year killed three people and injured hundreds. And I'd asked people from CNN's iReport community to join me, documenting our yearlong journeys together online. More than 300 people joined the project. We don't share geography or ideology, but we do share the run -- a willingness to try to do something in response to tragedy. The man with the flamingo was Scot Barco, a marathon mini-celebrity of sorts who was running his 100th 26.2 mile race -- a feat that seemed like the most insane running-related thing (maybe anything-related thing) I'd heard up to that point. That was before Barco told me two more facts: He got engaged on a marathon; and got married on mile six of a subsequent marathon. Kept running till the end. I jogged alongside him for a few minutes on that Sunday in November at the Outer Banks Marathon, both because I was curious and because I hoped to learn something. I wanted to finish the race, but wasn't entirely sure I could. The farthest I'd run before I started training, seven months before then, was six miles. I had to do a training program in order to start a for-real marathon-training program. Plus, I've been told that when I jog I look something like a constipated Velociraptor. I don't seem like the person who's cut out for this. I needed help. But I didn't anticipate what Flamingo Man would teach me. It's been about a year since April 15, 2013, when the bombs went off in Boston. I can't claim to understand what it's been like for the victims of that tragedy or for their families. But I can tell you that people around the world, including myself, were inspired to do something personal and positive in response to that dark day. By running in response to the tragedy, we weren't attempting to negate the irreparable harm done to the people of Boston last year. We felt helpless in that moment, and we wanted to do something, anything, to try to process it. We laced up some sneakers and took to the streets. Are you at the Boston Marathon? Share your photos . Becca Obergefell seemed like the movement's online leader. The young woman from Ohio started a Google Doc where people all over the world could log the miles they'd run in honor of the victims and survivors, and in solidarity with the city. She encouraged people to use apps like Charity Miles that donate to nonprofits as you go. More than 35,000 miles were logged on a Google Doc she created shortly after the blasts. ""The day I identified myself as a runner was the day I heard about the bombings at the Boston Marathon,"" wrote on iReporter Theresa Kutsch, 55, a typist in Iowa City, Iowa. ""I vowed to keep up my own training to honor the runners and fans whose races and lives were interrupted in Boston,"" she wrote. ""I pledged to run for those who no longer can."" What I realized after joining running's enthusiastic cohort is just how much this community of individuals matters -- and how it takes care of its own. Many runners have needed that community a little more this year. Take Mark Giannetti, a 24-year-old market analyst who lives and works within blocks of the bombing site in Boston. He was evacuated from his office with only a gym bag the day of the bombing, and was holed up for days at his mom's house, unable to return to the area. Partly because of those logistics -- no clothes other than those for a run -- and partly because he just felt like he needed to do something, Giannetti, who never had run competitively, started running through his city. He wanted to figure out, in a literal sense: ""Where's the edge of where I'm allowed to be?"" How close could he get to his home, which was acting as a staging post? But he also would stretch his personal limits. Soon he found a large group of like-minded people, out there on the streets just trying to relieve the stress of being evacuated from home and work. They started running meet-ups, donated to the One Fund Boston charity to help the bombing victims -- and eventually formed a community that still exists. Giannetti is currently training for a half-marathon and hopes eventually to qualify to run a full one in Boston. His dad died in February, and the last time he saw his father was at a 5K race outside Boston, which his dad had flown in from Colorado to watch. He uploaded a finish photo with his dad and mom to CNN iReport. Giannetti took first place in the race for his age group. It was only after his dad died that Giannetti realized, while digging through his father's things, that he had medals from track and cross-country races in high school, and that he had new and apparently unused triathlete jerseys. Running became a bridge to his dad. And a way to cope with the bombing. ""Starting running in a really stressful time showed me how much potential running has for being a stress reliever,"" he said. ""It's kind of a lifestyle. Once you get into it you get pretty addicted to it. You feel so much better."" ""It became a lifestyle and it became a community as well."" I've encountered and read about so many incredible people over the past year. In April, two weeks after the Boston bombing, I went to Oklahoma City to watch Sara Hunt finish the marathon she started in Boston, but wasn't allowed to complete. I thought of her and her teary-eyed finish when I was running my own race. How she met strangers along the route who helped her push through a difficult run. And I thought of heroes like Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost her left foot in the second blast in Boston and vowed to dance again. You can see her doing just that in a CNN documentary, ""Survivor Diaries."" My journey isn't as meaningful as those. But since I'd made the pledge, and since I'd spent so many months training to get to that super-flat course in the coast of North Carolina, I did want to finish. Nike+ tells me I logged more than 400 miles in my seven months of training (I didn't use the app for every single run, and it's a little glitch-prone, so that's an estimate). I'd run 20 miles before the race, but never the extra 6.2 you need for a marathon. I ran up behind Barco, the man with the pink flamingo, hoping for tips. What I found was a person in crisis. He hid it at first, but I soon realized Barco was in immense pain. His ankle was shot, probably from the wear and tear of so many races in such a short time, he said. He started tearing up as he told me how dozens of his friends had come to the race, holding signs with his name and face on them, to support his 100th marathon. What if he didn't finish? What if he let them down? I know nothing about marathon running, really, and I'd never met Barco before. But I walked beside him for a several minutes and offered any consolation and encouragement I could. I told him he absolutely would make it. He'd already run 99 marathons. What's half a marathon more? I know from the online register that he did finish the race. And I want him to know he was part of the reason I did, too. I had to -- not just for myself but for him. And for all the other people who I'd met and who helped me over the course of the year. Even at his weakest point, he still offered me encouragement. It's why he carries the flamingo, which has its own Facebook page: Magenta the Road Trip Flamingo. He hopes it might lighten someone else's load. ""You've gotta try to get out there and be a positive force on the marathon course as well as in the world,"" he told me. Running a marathon is something no person can do alone. All runners know that. So you help each other. You run towards the blast to help the victims. You raise money to heal the wounded. You offer kind words to a stranger. It's a given, just what you do.

"The future of transport is self-driving cars, says GPS inventor Bradford Parkinson. The famed inventor, military hero and former boy scout, told CNN that advances in the use of GPS mean that the technology could not only emerge in the next few years, but is already being road tested by companies such as Google. ""I think (the future) leads to robotic cars. I think there will come a time when you go down the highway and you don't have to have your hand on the steering wheel at all. It'll be a combination of GPS, radar and other sensors."" If there is anyone who should know about the future of GPS, it is Brad Parkinson. The former air force colonel was an integral member of the team that invented GPS technology. While he is now a professor emeritus at Stanford University in California, in the 1980s Parkinson headed up the GPS program run by the U.S. military. ""When I invented the system I was a United States colonel,"" says Parkinson. ""I was in the air force and had a PhD in aeronautics from Stanford, and a master's degree from MIT. I'd been testing inertial navigation systems for three years in my past and I had taken digital controls at MIT."" The development of GPS was the product of a military program called 621B. Parkinson had the idea that satellites could be used to help find and track targets to make weapon deployment more accurate. ""I had flown combat, I understood the value of precision weapon delivery, I understood that it would be a humane use of a bomb if you could hit what you want to hit and not hit a mosque, hospital or school."" Initially, the military was resistant to the idea, says Parkinson. ""The air force didn't want it because first of all they thought we couldn't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways. And their old ways were, in essence, carpet bombing, it was very sad."" Fortunately Parkinson found some powerful allies who helped drive the program forward. At a critical moment in the fledgling technology's development, Malcolm Currie, a physicist and U.S. Navy officer, introduced Parkinson to General Kenneth Shultz, whose personal interest in the program kept the research of GPS alive. Today, as well as being used by the military, geolocation is an indispensable civilian technology -- it can be found in car navigation systems and almost all smart phones. According to Parkinson, there are myriad possible uses for GPS that are yet to be explored, but one of the most immediate applications will be the integration of GPS technology into self-driving cars, which he believes will help bring down the incidence of road accidents. ""The most dangerous thing in an automobile is the driver. Usually because of distractions or because he doesn't understand how slippery the road is. I'm saying GPS can absolutely be the key and cornerstone ... This is really exciting. ""In the United States we kill 40,000 people a year on the roads ... What can we do to help them? I contend that automatically guided cars are going to help. It will include cooperation between cars; I will know where the next car is going and will be able to sense how good the friction is on the road, I can sense whether my tires are slipping. I can do all that in an integrated single package, so I think where this is going is robotic automobiles."" Self-driving cars are currently being trialled by companies such as Google, whose driverless car is reputed to have already competed 400,000 miles of testing -- further than most motorists will travel in a lifetime. ""As Google has already demonstrated, robotic cars are already here,"" says Parkinson, ""but the version that they are using is far too expensive and cumbersome to be a practical product for general use."" As with most new technologies, Parkinson anticipates a 'trickle down' effect whereby cutting-edge experiments being done at the top level will gradually be incorporated into everyday vehicles. ""Many of the elements of robotic driving are already being installed by leading manufacturers. For example, radar systems that measure the distance to the car that is ahead and begin slowing if the condition is hazardous. There is already a product that truck drivers can install in order to sense adjacent vehicles."" In September 2012, California legalized self-driving vehicles. The new law obliges the California Department of Motor Vehicles to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by the beginning 2015, meaning robot cars are unlikely to become available before that point. Experts predict that the first self-driving cars may be on the roads by 2016.","GPS is being integrated into the new technology of self-driving cars .

"(CNN)As the Ebola epidemic crept into Liberia in March 2014, a dramatic shift began to take place. In a matter of months, the widespread belief that Ebola didn't even exist gave way to a gripping fear across Monrovia, the capital city. When the decision was made to evacuate Peace Corps volunteers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone at the end of July, the agency worked quickly to ensure each volunteer returned safely to the United States. This was not an easy operation as logistics and already-challenged roads had deteriorated with the full force of the rainy season. Once we, as American and Liberian Peace Corps staff members, achieved our goal of seeing all volunteers safely back home, we began educating ourselves on the potential impact the Ebola virus could have in Liberia. Our primary concern was keeping each other and the communities where we lived safe. Monrovia's usual vibrancy became taut with fear as the epidemic spread. Through an interagency partnership, Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet made the agency's resources available to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as they fought the Ebola epidemic at the grassroots level. Peace Corps staff who remained in Liberia after the volunteers' departure could help CDC experts build local support in the affected areas, bridge gaps in logistics and facilitate community entry in culturally appropriate ways. Many of the CDC experts arriving to combat the epidemic had never set foot in Africa, so those of us in the Peace Corps used our good standing in Liberian communities to assist the CDC in getting prevention and treatment messages to the most effective stakeholders in each community. Making a difference is a central tenant of Peace Corps' culture, so we felt this opportunity to support the CDC's effort was a perfect fit. The ability to pitch in and contribute not only empowered us, but we noticed it also helped dissolve the barriers of fear and revived the passion of the Peace Corps staff. Enthusiasm for the partnership was overwhelming. When staff members were given the option to use their time supporting the CDC, nearly all Peace Corps Liberian staff volunteered to help. Starting in September, four-person teams -- composed of two CDC staff and two Peace Corps staffers -- traveled across Liberia to track the virus and teach people in rural and urban areas how to prevent transmission. It was a courageous decision and a serious commitment for each member of the Peace Corps team. They put themselves closer to possible exposure, and they were going to live away from their families in Monrovia, where more than half of the new cases of Ebola were reported. In the field, the teams faced many distressing moments. They witnessed a multitude of tragedies, such as when Ebola-infected infants were set aside because protective materials were scarce. They mourned with those who suffered unspeakable losses. They stood by families who endured unimaginable heartbreak, but the Peace Corps staff also had a significant positive impact. Along with CDC experts, Peace Corps staff went out to encouraged the sick to seek treatment rather than stay home to protect their families. These efforts kept people who had been in contact with Ebola from infecting their families. It helped contain some of the contamination. Liberia has made remarkable strides in the fight against Ebola, and there are Liberian heroes in every corner of the country. I happen to work with many in the Peace Corps Liberia office. As everyday citizens, they stood up to fight this disease that had descended on their country. One Peace Corps staff member convinced a mother to take her sick child to seek medical attention rather than caring for him at home. That one action potentially saved a household of 10 from Ebola. Others made valiant efforts directing local health care workers toward the sick. Peace Corps staff consoled the bereaved in the communities where they live. As they fight this epidemic, most Liberians are incredibly grateful for the assistance of the global community, especially the United States. It is now common here for the sounds of American Apache helicopters and Ospreys buzzing overhead to be greeted as a sign of relief and support. The unfortunate reality is that after many years of hardship because of civil war, poverty and limited health care, Liberians have developed an extraordinary ability to adapt to ""the new normal,"" and many have found a way to cope with Ebola and move forward with their daily lives. The power of science and information from experts about how the virus can spread has allayed much of the fear and concern we saw many months ago. At this writing, all but two of Liberia's 15 counties have been Ebola free for the past 21 days. This is a huge accomplishment, but our mission is not over. There remains an intensive to-do list: concentrating resources in contact tracing, educating communities on safe burial practices and amplifying tactics to keep our health care professionals safe. Peace Corps staff members have made -- and will continue to make -- an incredible impact in the fight against Ebola in Liberia. Stopping just one infection can deny the virus the ability to spread to 30 or more additional Ebola exposures and potential deaths, and that means every conversation, every meeting, every hand washing station counts. Our journey since March has, at different moments, been harrowing, exhausting and overwhelming, but every minute of it has been worth it. This effort has deepened our partnership with our colleagues at the CDC, but also with the Liberian people and the communities Peace Corps serves. It has strengthened our resolve and our commitment to bring Peace Corps volunteers back to Liberia and the other Ebola-affected countries when it is safe to do so, and to continue to support the CDC and the Liberian people, one community at a time. I could not have been more privileged and fortunate to work side by side with the Peace Corps team in Liberia. I can only hope that I have made some small impact on their lives, as they have made a huge impact on mine.","Even after Peace Corps volunteers were evacuated from Liberia, staff remained there .
They've been working to get prevention and treatment messages out to communities ."
"Remember the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups? IRS targeting: Scandal or snafu? It was the scandal du jour in Washington last month, now relegated to back-burner status after recent revelations of a vast government electronic surveillance apparatus created in the name of national security following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder: Leaks damaged U.S. security . The announcement Thursday by the Obama administration that it would boost aid to Syria rebels because government forces there used chemical weapons further shifted attention away from the IRS controversy involving extra scrutiny given conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Republicans continue trying to raise the issue, grilling FBI Director Robert Mueller about it at a congressional hearing on Thursday. They argue that the Obama administration used the tax agency to intimidate and harass political opponents. Democrats respond that the independent inspector general who revealed the targeting blamed poor management, rather than political bias. Congressional sources on both sides say that interviews with IRS workers so far have found no political conspiracy. Read IRS watchdog's report . What happens next depends on any further information from ongoing investigations. The IRS,  the agency's inspector general at the Treasury Department, J. Russell George, the Department of Justice and GOP-led congressional committees are all looking into the matter. Acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel, appointed by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess, said last week that he would release more information on the targeting once privacy issues had been worked out. New IRS chief asks for patience over targeting probe . If the investigations fail to find a political effort to suppress activities by conservatives, the scandal will likely die a slow bureaucratic death of piecemeal reports in coming months. However, if the multiple inquiries find evidence of guidance from Washington and even the White House, as claimed by Republicans, the scandal would instantly generate new headlines, more hearings and possible criminal proceedings. Rand Paul claims revealing memo exists in IRS scandal . Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday's the FBI was investigating IRS targeting, and assured legislators that ""to the extent there's any indication of criminal misconduct, we will follow the leads and the evidence wherever it takes us."" However, he declined to discuss the matter further because of the ongoing probe, prompting frustration from Republicans on the panel. Conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, a fierce critic of the Obama administration, hammered Mueller with questions such as who was leading the investigation, how many investigators were assigned and whether they had interviewed groups victimized by the targeting. When Mueller said he hadn't been briefed on those details, the Ohio Republican blew up. ""You can't even tell me who the lead investigator is?"" he asked Mueller, who will step down soon after almost 12 years leading the FBI. ""You can't tell me how many agents are assigned to the most important story in the country?"" Seven committee hearings so far on the matter revealed the partisan divide that permeates Washington. Republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of Nixonian dimensions, while Democrats condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance. At the House Oversight Committee, GOP Chairman Darrell Issa of California and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland have engaged in a public dispute over interviews that panel investigators conducted with IRS workers involved in the targeting. Earlier this month, Issa released excerpts of transcripts that he said showed IRS officials in Washington played a role in the targeting. ""This was a problem coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we're getting to proving it,"" he told CNN on June 2. Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington . ""My gut tells me that too many people knew this wrongdoing was going on before the election, and at least by some sort of convenient, benign neglect, allowed it to go on through the election,"" Issa said. ""I'm not making any allegations as to motive, that they set out to do it, but certainly people knew it was happening."" In response, the Oversight Committee's Democratic staff released further interview excerpts that Cummings said disproved any White House role. He challenged Issa to release the full transcript, which has yet to occur. ""Based upon everything I've seen, the case is solved,"" Cummings told CNN last Sunday. ""And if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on."" Cummings: 'Conservative' refutes IRS-White House story . Meanwhile, the White House has tried to shift attention to other issues with events on student loan rates, health care reform and immigration legislation. Second term mostly drama for Obama . GOP resists White House effort to control message . Top White House officials say they knew nothing of the targeting when it occurred. General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned of a pending inspector general's report on April 24, 2013, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. When asked Wednesday if the full transcripts of interviews with IRS workers should be released, Carney said Issa had promised to do so. He added that Cummings ""has demonstrated that we have seen yet again some cherry-picking when it comes to the release of testimony, release of information,"" Carney added, referring to past instances when Republicans on the Oversight panel made public details on other issues that turned out to be incomplete or misleading. The inspector general report last month found that an IRS unit in Cincinnati had used criteria that included conservative labels such as ""tea party"" to target groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra questioning. IRS rules prevent groups engaging in political activity from becoming tax exempt. According to the report, the targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior IRS officials learned of it. It blamed a misguided effort to streamline handling of increased applications for tax-exempt status, exacerbated by unclear regulations regarding what constitutes political activity. Republicans contend the targeting was political discrimination in the run-up to the 2012 election, and one of the GOP-led House committees heard from groups who detailed delayed handling of their requests, excessive questioning by the IRS for inappropriate information, and other problems. Some conservatives also contend they faced IRS tax audits due to political targeting, but no evidence of such activity has turned up in investigations so far. George told an earlier congressional hearing that his unit was investigating the possible use of other lists of criteria to trigger additional scrutiny of tax-exempt applications. He provided no details. Meanwhile, the partisan bickering goes on. The Republican National Committee released a video this week that accused the Obama administration of dodging responsibility. It included footage of IRS officials testifying before congressional committees, edited to highlight when they said they didn't know or were unable to remember details. GOP video keeps up pressure over IRS targeting . ""Americans deserve answers to why their First Amendment rights were so egregiously violated,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said. ""Turning a blind eye and claiming not to know, or remember, what actions were carried out is no excuse for targeting individuals based on their beliefs. These are simple questions, and if they can't answer it raises another: what are they hiding?""","Multiple investigations of the IRS targeting continue .
Disclosure of U.S. surveillance programs has diminished focus on IRS issue .
Republicans continue raising the IRS targeting in criticizing the Obama administration .

"(CNN)Ghana earned a semifinal clash with hosts Equatorial Guinea after dispatching a disappointing Guinea 3-0 in the Africa Cup of Nations Sunday. The comfortable victory lifted the Black Stars into the last four of the competition for the fifth straight time and the result was scarcely in doubt once Christian Atsu had scored the first of his two goals after just four minutes. Atsu connected with Andre Ayew's neat backheel to beat Naby-Moussa Yattara in the Guinea goal. Guinea, who only made the last eight at the expense of Mali after lots were drawn, fell further behind when defender Baissama Sankoh made a horrible hash of a clearance. To the dismay of his teammates and Guinea supporters, he sliced it into the path of Kwesi Appiah, who added the second just before halftime. Atsu, on loan at English Premier League Everton from Chelsea, sealed the victory with a stunning long range effort into the top corner on the hour mark. There was still time for Yattara to complete a miserable evening for his team after recklessly hacking down Asamoah Gyan in stoppage time and earning a deserved red card. Avram Grant's men face the home nation Thursday, Equatorial Guinea earning its passage after a controversial 2-1 win over Tunisia. Bony at the double . Sunday's other quarterfinal saw two goals from new Manchester City signing Wilfried Bony lift the Ivory Coast to a 3-1 victory over Algeria. Bony struck for the first time in the competition as he headed home in the 26th minute to put the Elephants on the front foot. But sloppy defending allowed Hilal Soudani to equalize for Algeria early in the second half. Boney then used his aerial power to connect with a free kick from new club teammate Yaya Toure to restore the lead for the Ivorians.

"The investigation into Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is now classified as a criminal investigation, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing the Malaysian police chief. Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said authorities have already recorded more than 170 statements and will interview more people for the Flight 370 probe, the Journal said. But Bakar cautioned that what happened with Flight 370 might still be unknown after the investigation. He added that the investigation into the flight simulator in the pilot's house is still inconclusive. Authorities are awaiting an expert's report on the simulator, he said. After three and a half weeks, the search for the missing plane has come down to this: a lot of floating rubbish, hundreds of heartbroken relatives and, now, quibbling over words all acknowledge offer no clues into what happened to the doomed plane. Malaysian authorities on Tuesday released the transcript of radio chatter between air traffic controllers and the plane in the hour or so before it vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8 with 239 people on board. The transcript shows the last voice transmission from the doomed plane was ""Good night Malaysian three-seven-zero"" -- not the ""All right, good night"" transmission authorities had previously used. The comments are ""exactly what you'd expect"" in a cockpit, airline safety expert John Gadzinski told CNN's ""The Lead."" Still, even if this new transcript offers no clues about the plane's mysterious disappearance, the discrepancy has provided fresh fodder for critics of Malaysia's handling of the investigation. Read the cockpit transcript . That authorities gave one version and let it stand uncorrected for weeks undermines confidence in the investigation, air accident investigation experts told CNN. ""High criticism is in order at this point,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. And Michael Goldfarb, a former chief of staff at the Federal Aviation Administration, added that people following the investigation ""haven't had a straight, clear word that we can have a lot of fidelity in."" ""We have the tragedy of the crash, we have the tragedy of an investigation gone awry and then we have questions about where we go from here,"" he said. Malaysian officials have defended their work, with acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein recently saying, ""History will judge us well."" Regardless of one's assessment of Malaysia's response, that doesn't change the immense challenge it faces -- especially given the few apparent details on altitude, speed and, of course, location. ""They are looking in a vast area in very deep waters, ... and we really have no idea where it went in,"" Bill Schofield, an Australian scientist who helped create flight data recorders that could be key in determining what happened, told CNN. ""... A needle in a haystack would be much easier to find."" Inside the flight simulator . Search 'could drag on' After refocusing their search Friday to a new patch of Indian Ocean hundreds of miles from where they had been looking, authorities still haven't found anything definitively linked to Flight 370. Ten aircraft and nine ships crisscrossed a 46,000-square-mile (120,000-square-kilometer) search zone on Tuesday. With so many planes in the skies over the search zone, Australia sent an airborne air traffic control plane to guard against accidents. The search zone for Wednesday shifted eastward toward the Australian coast from what it had the day before, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. While this means new territory will be covered, officials caution against expecting an imminent breakthrough. ""It will take time,"" retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the head of the Australia's new Joint Agency Coordination Centre, said Tuesday. ""It's not something that's necessarily going to be resolved in the next two weeks."" The plane disappeared over the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, after signing off with Malaysian controllers, but before checking in with their counterparts in Vietnam. Authorities don't know what happened on board after that, but radar and satellite data show the plane turned off course and flew back across Malaysia before turning south over the Indian Ocean. Based on sophisticated analysis of satellite data, investigators believe it went down in the southern Indian Ocean, but they can't pinpoint a location. A Malaysian government source told CNN on Monday that the airliner's turn off course is being considered a ""criminal act,"" either by one of the pilots or someone else. In a background briefing given to CNN, Malaysian investigators said they believed the plane was ""flown by someone with good flying knowledge of the aircraft."" A senior Malaysian government official last week told CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes that authorities have found nothing in days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive, be it political, suicidal or extremist. ""It's one of the great mysteries of our time,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a radio interview Wednesday from Perth, where he'll host his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak later in the day. ""...We owe it to the world, we owe it to those families to do whatever we reasonably can do get to the bottom of this."" More help on the way . Chinese relatives of passengers got a chance Wednesday to learn how the search is unfolding and how it's been concluded that the flight ended in the Indian Ocean. Malaysia Airlines and Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation led a closed-door briefing with the Chinese kin in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian government said. Technical experts from Malaysia, China and Australia were also expected to participate, as was the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia. Meanwhile, even more assets are contributing to the search. Hishammuddin tweeted the HMS Tireless, a British nuclear submarine, will take part. It'll be joined by an Australian ship with a pinger locator designed to listen for locator beacons attached to the plane's flight data recorder plus a submersible capable of canvassing the ocean floor for wreckage. Both pieces of technology come from the U.S. Navy. The equipment won't be of any use, however, until searchers are able to find wreckage from the plane to help narrow the search zone. That's because neither the pinger locator nor the submersible can quickly scan the enormous area being searched. Under the best of sea conditions, the pingers can be heard 2 nautical miles away. But high seas, background noise, wreckage or silt can all make pingers harder to detect. It will take the ship, the Ocean Shield, two more days just to get to the search zone, leaving precious little time to locate the flight data recorders before the batteries on its locator beacon run out. Time is running out: The batteries are designed to last 30 days. Wednesday is the 26th day that authorities have been looking for the plane. There's no guarantee it will be found anytime soon. For all the expertise and technology, there's still more unknown about Flight 370 than is known about it -- including its altitude, precise speed and, especially, its final resting place. As CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said: ""We're seeing what amounts to a big guess."" Families of newlyweds still waiting . Ocean Shield: A mission of hope in search for Flight 370 .

"It's a glaring number in a national poll that's making headlines. President Barack Obama's approval rating dropped 8 percentage points over the past month to 45%, the president's lowest rating in more than 18 months, according to a CNN/ORC International survey released on Monday. And Obama's disapproval rating soared 9 points to 54% since mid-May. CNN Poll: Obama approval falls as controversies pile up . Even more surprising: The overall decline in his approval rating was partially fueled by a plunge in support from younger Americans, a huge base of Obama's support. Last month, nearly two-thirds of those in the 18-29 age group gave the president a thumbs up. His approval rating among that bracket fell 17 points in Monday's poll and now stands at 48%. The CNN/ORC International survey was conducted last Tuesday through Thursday. It comes as the White House has been dealing with controversies over a government surveillance program; IRS targeting of tea party and other conservative groups; continuing fallout over the deadly terror attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya; and the Justice Department's secret collection of journalists phone records as part of a government investigation into classified leaks. Lawmaker says details on NSA-thwarted plots coming . So what's behind the dramatic shift of younger Americans, who along with nonwhite voters had been the most loyal part of the Obama coalition? ""One explanation may be that younger Americans are more likely to feel they are personally affected by the surveillance programs,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""More than half of all senior citizens, for example, think that the government has not collected their personal information, and since older Americans are less likely to use the Internet, they may be right. Among younger Americans, two-thirds believe that the federal government has gathered their personal data."" Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University professor and CNN contributor, said the shift isn't all about scandals but goes deeper. GOP tries to keep focus on IRS targeting scandal . ""Part of it is probably that for younger people, the surveillance story is not a scandal but a sign the promise of 2008 was not fulfilled -- they see this and say he didn't do what he said he was going to do,"" Zelizer said. ""Part of this is a frustration in the gridlock in Washington. It's not just the scandals but the sense that nothing is going to get done. (Obama) hasn't been able to change Washington in that way. Instead of dealing with immigration or jobs, we're dealing with IRS and surveillance,"" he said. ""People in that age group are also struggling with jobs,"" Zelizer added. ""That's a constituency is easy to disappoint."" See more of the poll . Holland said that shows up in the ""honest and trustworthy"" category. ""Today, there are only minor differences between older and younger Americans on that measure, but a month ago, two-thirds of younger Americans considered Obama honest -- at least 10 points higher than any other age category. So maybe one reason why Obama fell so far with younger Americans is that he had farther to fall,"" he said. So has Obama lost the under-30 crowd? John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department, said probably not, but he could. ""I suspect the things that favor the Democrats will trump this in the long run,"" Geer said. ""The youth wants to see more tolerance and more inclusion. While the youth has been favoring the Democrats in the past few years, neither (party) should see the partisan leanings of this group as set."" Zelizer agreed that it's too soon to look at the plunge for bigger implications. ""Democrats should see this as their warning -- they don't have to read this as a long-range trend,"" he said. ""This immigration bill is still there, that's his chance. Get that bill through. It's not just about rhetoric and ideas but actual policy and change.""

"With a signature on a piece of paper, convicted quadruple murderer Nathan Dunlap's life was spared. For now. Because Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed a ""temporary reprieve"" in 2013, Dunlap's 1996 death sentence still has not been carried out. That's painful for many of the loved ones of the four restaurant workers Dunlap shot to death. It also upsets the sole survivor of the shooting, Bobby Stephens. ""It's not fair,"" Stephens told KRDO TV. Precedent on temporary reprieves is murky. No one knows for sure when the reprieve may be lifted, and Colorado hasn't executed anyone since 1997.  Hickenlooper, a Democrat, won a re-election bid in November, likely delaying Dunlap's execution for at least another four years. Dunlap's 1993 attack inside a Chuck E. Cheese pizza restaurant sparked a wave of anger reflected on local news broadcasts. Prosecutors said Dunlap was seeking revenge after being fired from his job there as a cook. He entered the restaurant, hid in a restroom, and emerged after closing, prosecutors said. He then shot Sylvia Crowell, 19; Colleen O'Connor, 17; Ben Grant, 17; and Marge Kohlberg, 50, who was the mother of two children. Stephens, 20, who also worked there, survived. After Dunlap shot him in the face, he played dead until the killer fled the building. Unanimous death sentence . A high-profile trial provoked a raging debate about how society should best deal with those who commit heinous crimes. Dunlap's jury convicted him on four counts of murder and unanimously sentenced him to death. During years of appeals that followed, prison doctors officially diagnosed Dunlap with bipolar disorder, CNN's ""Death Row Stories"" reported. Dunlap's attorneys appealed, claiming his mental health wasn't properly taken into account during his trial. Dunlap apologized to Stephens in a letter, saying ""he was sorry for what he'd done to me,"" Stephens told KRDO TV. But Stephens said he doubted his would-be killer's goodwill. When the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Dunlap's final appeal, he and his attorneys took their plea for a stay to Hickenlooper. ""Because of that and the horrible things I did, I don't feel I have the right to ask for clemency,"" Dunlap wrote in a letter to the governor, reportedly saying,""I'd like to spare my family and friends from the same pain that I caused the victims' families and Bobby Stephens and his family and friends."" Rather than give Dunlap clemency, the governor issued a ""temporary reprieve,"" explaining that his decision was made ""not out of compassion or sympathy,"" but because there ""is a legitimate question whether we as a state should be taking lives."" ""Colorado's system for capital punishment is not flawless,"" Hickenlooper wrote in his executive order. Read the governor's executive order . 'Mob justice' The governor's decision reignited the years-old Dunlap debate. The mother of victim Colleen O'Connor, Jodie McNally-Damore, told ""Death Row Stories"" she's hoping Dunlap will avoid execution. ""I think that he deserves to stay exactly in the hole that he's in, and let him suffer and think about what he did. Let him rot."" Bob Crowell, father of victim Sylvia Crowell, told KCNC TV that the governor's decision resulted in backdoor clemency. Hickenlooper's Republican challenger in last November's election, former Rep. Bob Beauprez, told The Associated Press that the governor's reprieve for Dunlap showed ""an unwillingness to even make the tough call."" The governor's temporary reprieve has no time limit, so theoretically, as long as Hickenlooper remains in office, he can continue to block Dunlap's execution. But a new governor could end the reprieve, clearing the way for Dunlap to die by lethal injection. In a way, Dunlap's fate rested in the hands of Colorado voters last month, in a close race that Hickenlooper called the toughest fight of his career. Critics said that amounted to mob justice. Before the election, Dunlap's prosecutor, District Attorney George Brauchler, told ""Death Row Stories,"" ""There's one person in the state of Colorado who is more interested than the governor being re-elected than even the governor -- and that's Nathan Dunlap."" This isn't Aurora's only high profile death penalty case involving mental health and a gunman. James Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to 166 charges surrounding a movie theater shooting in 2012 that left 12 people dead. His trial is set to begin December 8. Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty. A complicated system . Dunlap's case is one of several ""Death Row Stories"" that illustrate America's complicated capital punishment system. Some of them involve inmates who faced possible execution until higher courts stepped in. Convicted of murder, Edward Lee Elmore spent 30 years behind bars in South Carolina despite seemingly overwhelming evidence that he was innocent. More on Elmore's case . In another case, Gloria Killian's lawyers found a previously unknown letter written by a key witness to a prosecutor in her murder trial. Federal appellate Judge Michael Daly Hawkins said the letter made the witness's testimony worthless and ordered Killian freed. Killian had lost 17 years of her life during her prison ordeal. More on Killian's case . Ohio prisoner Joe D'Ambrosio spent more than 20 years on death row until a judge dismissed all charges against him because D'Ambrosio's lawyers were not allowed access to evidence that could have proved him innocent. More on D'Ambrosio's case . In Louisiana, John Thompson, convicted of murder, was freed after lawyers uncovered previously unknown evidence that a witness had wrongly identified him as the killer. In 2008, Thompson made legal history when he won a $14 million award from a civil lawsuit against the New Orleans district attorney's office, alleging Thomas' wrongful conviction had resulted from prosecutorial misconduct. But the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the award was denied in a 5-4 decision. More on Thompson's case . Other ""Death Row Stories"" focus on prisoners who remain on death row for crimes that still have many unanswered questions. One such case involves former Florida police officer James Duckett, who faces execution for the rape and strangling death of an 11-year-old girl. His lawyers are hoping for a new evidence hearing that they feel could result in his freedom. More on Duckett's case . Another Florida prisoner, Kris Maharaj, spent 15 years on death row for the murders of two business partners. Maharaj has claimed innocence -- and an alibi -- since the beginning. In November, at a Miami evidence hearing, defense attorneys blamed the killings on hit men directed by notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. A judge eventually is expected to rule on the new evidence. More on Maharaj's case . In perhaps the most bizarre case of the series, former Army Master Sgt. Tim Hennis awaits execution on the U.S. military's death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for a triple murder in which he was convicted, then acquitted and then convicted again. ""Tim Hennis is the only person in United States history who's been tried for his life three times after guilty and not guilty verdicts,"" said Scott Whisnant, whose book ""Innocent Victims"" was made into a 1996 TV movie. Despite Hennis' ultimate conviction, crime scene evidence still sheds doubt on the verdict, including still unidentified DNA which was found under a victim's fingernails.

"(CNN) -- After 20 years, over 300 goals and a host of major honors, Thierry Henry has called time on his football career. The Frenchman, who won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000 with his country, is hanging up his boots to pursue a broadcasting career. Although he made his breakthrough with French team Monaco, and spent time with Juventus, Barcelona and latterly New York Red Bulls, Henry is best remembered for a glittering eight-year spell with Arsenal in the English Premier League. Henry became the London club's all-time leading goalscorer and helped the Gunners win two league titles and the FA Cup on three occasions. ""It has been an incredible journey and I would like to thank all the fans, team mates and individuals involved with AS Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal FC, FC Barcelona, the New York Red Bulls and of course the French National Team that have made my time in the game so special,"" he said on his official Facebook page. ""I have had some amazing memories (mostly good!) and a wonderful experience. I hope you have enjoyed watching as much as I have enjoyed taking part. See you on the other side..."" Henry's move to Arsenal in 1999, after a troubled year in Turin with Juventus, saw him reunited with former Monaco coach Arsene Wenger. The pair led Arsenal through a golden era, including an unbeaten Premier League campaign during the 2003-04 season. That team that won 26 and drew 12 of its 38 league matches during that campaign became known as the ""Invincibles."" Henry left Arsenal in 2007 and headed to Barcelona, where more titles lay in wait. During three seasons in Catalonia, Henry won the Spanish championship on two occasions and helped the club lift the European Champions League in 2009. The 37-year-old brought the curtain down on his player career with a four-year stint in the ""Big Apple,"" helping New York Red Bulls win Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference in 2010 and 2013. Although his immediate focus will be punditry work with British broadcaster Sky TV, Henry has not ruled out a coaching career. ""I don't know if I can be a good coach or not, but the desire is there,"" he told Sky.","Thierry Henry retires from football after 20-year career .

"In a closely watched ruling among those who criticize the captivity of marine mammals, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Friday denied SeaWorld's appeal of safety citations issued by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration after the death of a trainer. A 12,000-pound killer whale named Tilikum four years ago dragged veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau into the water and killed her in front of a horrified audience at SeaWorld's flagship park in Orlando. After her death, OSHA cited SeaWorld and restricted how humans interact with killer whales during performances. Those restrictions include a mandate that humans stay out of the water with killer whales unless there are physical barriers to reduce the risk of injury or death. SeaWorld appealed but the judges, in a 2-1 decision, agreed with OSHA's measures. ""The administrative record establishes that SeaWorld did not lack fair notice because the hazard arising from trainers' close contact with killer whales in performance is preventable,"" judges wrote. One judge dissented, saying OSHA is overstepping its bounds and has no more of a right to impose restrictions on a specialized industry like SeaWorld than it does to regulate tackling in the NFL. SeaWorld said it was disappointed by the decision and has not yet determined whether it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. ""Following the tragic death of Dawn Brancheau in 2010, we voluntarily deployed several new safety measures, including removing trainers from the water during shows. In so noting in its opinion, the court acknowledged that there will still be human interactions and performances with killer whales and, according to the court, the decision simply requires that we continue with increased safety measures during our shows,"" it said. The Labor Department, which includes OSHA, said it was pleased by the judges' findings. ""The D.C. Circuit Court found that SeaWorld knew about the hazards associated with killer whale performances, and that the company did not adequately address those hazards,"" the agency said. Months after 'Blackfish' airs, debate continues .","Killer whale dragged a trainer into water and killed her four years ago .

"A passenger announced Friday ""that there was a bomb on board"" his plane and wanted it diverted to Sochi -- the Russian city hosting the Winter Olympics amid terrorism fears -- Turkish officials said. Rather than abide by the request, the Pegasus Airlines' crew sent a hijacking alert that Turkey's Air Force Control Center received at 5:20 p.m. (10:20 a.m. ET), Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. About 20 minutes later, the same report claimed two F-16 fighter jets scrambled to intercept the Boeing 737-800 and escort it over the Black Sea. Eventually, the airliner landed safely at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport, where video shot soon thereafter showed police and security officials converging on it. Istanbul's governor tweeted around 10 p.m. that ""the air pirate has been neutralized"" and all other passengers ""disembarked from the plane without any problems."" Special forces who boarded the plane took him into custody ""in a swift operation"" without finding a ""bomb on him,"" Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu later told reporters. ""The operation is complete,"" the governor said. Mutlu said that the suspect -- who never made it into the cockpit and at one point apparently thought the aircraft was destined for Sochi -- ""didn't seem to have consumed alcohol, (but) he may have used some other substances."" He'd brought a carry-on bag with personal electronics and other items onto the Pegasus plane, according to the governor. The incident came at a tense time given the various threats surrounding the Winter Games, which kicked off in earnest Friday night with its opening ceremony. Russian security forces have cracked down in recent weeks on suspected militants in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan -- which is located on the other side of the Caucasus Mountains from Sochi -- and elsewhere in recent weeks after twin suicide bombings in the city of Volgograd in December. There have also been concerns specifically about explosives-laden airlines. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul said Wednesday night that the his nation's Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin to airlines flying into Russia warning that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes. Airlines warned of possible toothpaste tube bombs . Official: Suspect is Ukrainian . The flight started in Kharkov in Ukraine, and was headed to Istanbul, according to the Transportation Ministry. While it was in air, ""one of the passengers said that there was a bomb on board and asked the plane to not land in Sabiha Gokcen but rather to land in Sochi,"" Transportation Ministry official Habip Soluk said on CNNTurk. The man said the bomb was in the baggage hold, a Transportation Ministry official said. The aircraft ended up touching down at the Turkish airport at at 6:04 p.m., according to Anadolu, at which point it was moved to a safe zone on the tarmac. Cihan News Agency of Turkey published a photograph it claimed came from inside the plane showing a man standing in a number 11 sports jersey with empty seats around him and two people in uniform. Turkish officials have not confirmed that this photograph is from inside the Pegasus airliner or that the man at the center of it is the alleged hijacker. The Ukrainian foreign ministry issued a statement identifying the suspect as one of its citizens, something that Soluk also said was the case. The Ukrainian ministry said no explosives or guns were found aboard the plane and that the suspect ""voluntarily turned himself into police."" Mutlu, Istanbul's governor, offered a different take on how the alleged hijacker was detained. ""We had to use force because we were trying to persuade him and he wasn't persuaded,"" said Mutlu, adding Turkish authorities did not use guns and that the suspect suffered ""a light injury."" The suspect never said anything about Circassians -- the residents in the volatile region around the North Caucasus mountains -- or having lived in the region, according to the governor.","Ukraine says the suspect turned himself in; a Turkish governor says otherwise .

"Say goodbye to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In a few weeks, he will hand over the mantle of presidency to Hassan Rouhani, who stood victorious Saturday after Iran tallied all its votes in the national election. Rouhani, 65, a cleric and moderate politician, who enjoyed reformist backing, took more than 50% of the vote, according to the interior ministry. His nearest rival, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, garnered about 15% of the vote. Three of the six candidates were much more conservative, and the Iranian public viewed Rouhani as a mild alternative going into the vote. Hassan Rouhani is Iran's next president . Hawk or dove? Rouhani has a reputation for avoiding extreme positions and bridging differences, but he is no pushover. He has a long history of service in the country's defense establishment. He is a former commander of the Iranian air defenses, a leader on three war and defense councils, and was national security adviser to the president for 13 years before Ahmadinejad took office. Rouhani is also a diplomatic and legal intellectual. He has three law degrees, including a doctorate from a university in Scotland, and as president of Iran's strategic research center, he regularly publishes essays. He serves as managing editor for three quarterlies on scientific and strategic research, and foreign policy. He was also Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 -- during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami , who later became one of the leading figures in Iran's rebellious ""Green Movement,"" which erupted into street protests after the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. Ahmadinejad's government violently quashed the protests with the help of elements of a unit of the Revolutionary Guard, which answers to the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader. Rouhani has expressed support for the Green Movement.  ""These were protests that were natural and popular,"" he has said. ""They should have been addressed."" After Green supporters chanted for him at a rally, security forces arrested members of his campaign. Relationship with Khamenei . Rouhani's relationship with Khamenei has the potential to be complex. He has represented the supreme leader on Iran's security council since 1989. But he has purportedly also scrutinized him for being too rigid toward the international community, said Abbas Milani, who runs a research program on Iran at Stanford University. In a book about his experience as Iran's nuclear negotiator during Khatami's presidency, Rouhani criticizes Ayatollah Khamenei, according to Milani. ""If you read in between the lines, he places a lot of blame on Khamenei. He says in is his book, that if it was up to him, he and his team would have come up with a solution that would not lead up to Iran's case being deferred to the U.N.-- saying 'we could have done this, and some people in Iran and some in the West torpedoed it,"" Milani said. A televised presidential debate turned into an animated political clash, which touched on Iran's nuclear program. Exchanges grew so heated that the candidates were later accused of having revealed national secrets during the debate. Rouhani was warned that he may be barred from running in the elections because of confidential material he revealed about Iran's nuclear program during the two-hour-long debate. It wasn't his first testy moment with Iran's state-run media.  He has openly accused it of censorship and publishing lies. Many believe Rouhani was not Khamenei's favorite candidate. Saeed Jalili, Iran's current chief nuclear negotiator, stands more in line with the supreme leader's ultraconservative Islamist views than the moderate president-elect. But Khamenei has said he is not playing favorites and would not let on whom he voted for. And Khamenei and his Guardian Council had to approve all candidates before the race began.  Out of 680 who applied to run, only eight were allowed to do so. Two later dropped out. Ultimately, the supreme leader approved Rouhani's candidacy after rejecting the candidacy of a former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Rafsanjani endorsed Rouhani during his campaign. Rouhani is a senior cleric and also a member of the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for appointing or removing the supreme leader.  As Khamenei ages and the appointment of a successor becomes necessary, Rouhani will likely have influence on the choice. Ahmadinejad contrast . Though Ahmadinejad was touted as a hardliner when he entered office, since his re-election, conservative politicians close to the supreme leader have assailed him for being too liberal, and he has often been at odds with Khamenei. His domestic opponents have been subject to similar caustic accusations his Western foreign opponents have become accustomed to. Some of Ahmadinejad's associates have faced heavy repression, and hardliners attempted to link the president to the largest embezzlement case in the country's history.  Ahmadinejad has hurled allegations of corruption back at them. Rouhani is more likely to at least speak more diplomatically to internal and external challengers. And unlike Ahmadinejad, when addressing United States politicians and citizens, he may not need a translator.","Hassan Rouhani holds a doctorate from a UK university .

"There's now one more Kardashian to keep up with. On Saturday -- according to E!, the network behind her family's hit reality show-- Kim Kardashian gave birth to a baby girl. The report did not give a name for the newborn, but did say she came into the world at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She's the first child for the 32-year-old Kardashian, who has modeled, acted and launched business ventures but is best known as a reality TV star with a huge international following, having amassed some 18 million Twitter followers . The father is rapper Kanye West, who was by his girlfriend's side during the delivery, E! reported, citing a source. The couple started dating last year, shortly after Kardashian filed for divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries after 72 days of marriage. Kardashian's divorce is finally final . While the baby's arrival was somewhat unexpected -- coming a few weeks earlier than the July due date -- her gender is not. Like many aspects of the Kardashian family's existence, it was revealed on an episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" -- the eighth season premiere, in fact, that aired in June -- documenting her 19-week checkup at her obstetrician's office. ""I'm so excited we're having a girl. Who doesn't want a girl? I think they are the best,"" Kardashian said then. ""I know that's really what Kanye has always wanted. He wanted a little girl."" Kardashian's newborn daughter is the third grandchild of Kris Jenner -- the former wife of the late Robert Kardashian, best known as a lawyer for O.J. Simpson. Jenner is currently married to Olympic legend Bruce Jenner. Kardashian's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, has two children -- Mason and Penelope -- with her longtime boyfriend, Scott Disick.

"The sickening smell of burnt flesh still lingers in the air at the women's university. All that remains of the bus students had boarded to travel home is a dark, twisted structure. The bomb ripped off the roof, the ensuing fire so fierce it melted everything in its path. These buses were provided by the vice chancellor to encourage families to send their daughters to the university -- a safe means to get to and from home for young girls in a troubled province. But the attackers showed no mercy. Books that were the path to a brighter future reduced to ashes strewn across the floor. Pencils and satchels -- the accoutrements of education --  destroyed like so many lives that were lost. Militants, including a female suicide bomber, attacked the university bus on Saturday and then struck a hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment. The dead included students on the bus, four nurses, four Frontier Corps paramilitary troops and four militants, police said. I came across a page in which one young woman had written an essay on Heraclitus, known as the ""weeping philospher."" Her words on the burnt page so poignant after the tragedy. She wrote about ""the reality of change, the impermanence of being, the inconsistency of everything but change itself."" Twelve young women are confirmed to have been killed in this ruthless bus bombing, all of them students at the university. Some of them were the first women in their family's history to be sent to school and university. Yasmin Baloch is one of them. Despite her severe injuries, doctors think she was in a second bus following behind the one that was attacked. In the hospital ward where some of the most seriously injured girls are being treated, she told me how she and her family were so proud she made it to university. Many of the friends she traveled with have been killed. She describes them as ""good girls who studied hard."" Beside her, one young woman stares blindly into space, too shocked to talk. Yasmin described the horror of the bombing. ""I was sitting by window when the bomb went off. I had no idea what happened. Everything went dark. Then I realized I'd injured my legs. I cried for help, hoping someone would save me."" Her leg is broken, she has burns all over her body, shrapnel has cut her face. But like any young woman would, she whispers that she is worried if her hair will ever grow back. She lifts up the surgical cap and shows me. As she holds my hand she boldly says: ""The people who did this are very cruel."" And asks: ""We are just students - what did we do to them, to deserve this?"" Walking across the hospital ground a lone woman approaches me. Tears in her eyes, Farzana Pervez tells me her 20-year-old daughter is in intensive care. Part of her skull is missing, but she thanks God surgeons managed to save her life. Farzana explains how much sending her daughter to university means to the family. ""We are really poor people. My husband has worked hard to send our daughter to school and university. So she could have a better future than us.  She was supposed to have an exam today."" Her voice breaks. She asks us to pray for her daughter. Investigators are now going through the wreckage piece by piece to identify the exact nature of this blast. A senior intelligence official, who didn't want to be named, told CNN it was a female suicide bomber that targeted fellow young women at the Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University. The bombing was just the beginning. A group of militants was waiting at the hospital down the road. The Bolan Medical Complex is the largest government-run hospital in Balochistan. Militants attacked the hospital as the young women injured in the bus bombing were rushed there. Hundreds of people were held hostage -- patients, doctors, nurses and survivors -- until police and paramilitary forces took control after a five-hour shootout. Now the hospital is sealed off and shut down -- guarded by paramilitary forces. Quetta, Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan is still struggling to understand the attacks, shattering innocent young lives and those of their friends and family. Across the city there is a sense of shock, pain, confusion and helplessness. In a restaurant a man tentatively asks me ""who did this?"" He seems scared to even ask. In a culture where women have long been oppressed, the university was a shining light -- a symbol of hope and women's rights -- where 3,000 women studied. Families have made groundbreaking decisions to be the first to send their daughters to study for a degree with the hope of a career and brighter future. Vicious attacks like the bus bombing are doing their best to set those groundbreaking decisions back -- to ensure regret, to scare people and in particular young women back into their homes. Yasmin had been studying to be a teacher and says she won't give up. She looks me straight in the eye and says with confidence: ""We won't stop learning because of the people who attacked us. Education is everything. As soon as I get better, I'll go back to university with even more drive and hope."" And for the first time in this hospital ward, I see a young woman smile.","Victims of bus bomb, hospital attack in Pakistan defiant and shocked .

"Eleven-year-old Hajer Sami says she remembers her father. It's flashes of memory, really -- a smile, a laugh. She was only 4 when he was killed, but she can't recall vivid memories of him and their family when it was whole. Her family was torn apart when her father, a policeman, was gunned down seven years ago on the streets of Baghdad. She struggles to comprehend why anyone would have wanted to kill her father or why some people detonate explosives in the middle of a crowd. ""Why do these people kill other people? Do they get paid money to do it?"" she asks. Why? It's a question likely asked by many at the Al Noor Children's Center in Baghdad's Sadr City, a Shiite enclave home to more than two million people. Here, inside a rundown, two-story building, Hajer is one of the more than 300 children who have been orphaned -- most in the Islamic sense when a family loses its breadwinner. It's almost always the father. Most have a place to stay, with a mother or a distant relative. The center serves as day care center with a twist, a place where the children can go for food, clothing and education. In a city known for its violence, the center is full of children with tales of a parent lost to a bomb blast or a gunfight. In some cases, it's a child whose parent was a suicide bomber. ""We don't differentiate,"" says Liqaa Al Aboudi, the center's director. Nobody is sure just how many Iraqi children have lost a parent to the sectarian violence that gripped the country after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The Iraqi Orphanage Foundation puts the number in the millions, while the United Nations says it is hundreds of thousands. Now with the death toll rising as Iraq battles extremist fighters who have taken over large swaths of the country and vowed to overthrow the government, more and more children are being brought to Al Noor. Al Aboudi started the children's center in 2009 on the outskirts of Sadr City. Then there 10 children, she says. ""I feel like I am falling short of what I need to do for the children. I always hope they have more. I try to make them happy with clothes,"" says Al Aboudi. ""I feel bad for their mothers as salaries are really low and not enough to live on here in Iraq."" Hajer and her best friend, 11-year-old Baneen, sit on a brown couch at the center giggling. They couldn't be more different. Hajer wears her hair pulled back in a green band with a pink bow, while Baneen covers her hair with a traditional Muslim headscarf known as a hijab. Theirs is a friendship born from grief. Baneen, too, lost her father. He was killed when a bomb exploded 10 months ago in Sadr City, she says. Baneen and her four siblings now live with her paternal grandparents, who don't have enough money to take care of all their needs. Her 6-year-old brother, Ali, never strays far from his sister. During a conversation about what happened to their family, he hangs on her every word. Asked want he wants at the children's center, he says better food. Hamburgers? Pizza? ""Shawarma,"" he says. Across the room, a woman bounces baby Zahra on her lap. Zahra, 1, and her brother, 4-year-old Mustafa, were found playing among the bodies of their parents. It was mid-afternoon on a cold January day when militants burst into the family's home on the northern outskirts of Baghdad, a neighborhood known as Husseiniya. Was it a revenge killing? Was it sectarian? ""We don't know why it happened,"" says Um Sajjad, the children's aunt. She doesn't like talking about what happened that day as she worries it will remind the children of what they have lost. Women train with AK-47s to defend the streets of Baghdad .

"A border agent every 1,000 feet, every hour of every day, supported by 700 miles of fencing along the Mexican frontier. No green cards for the 11 million immigrants living illegally in America until those steps and others to enhance border controls are taken. And none of it increases the federal deficit or debt. A bipartisan group of senators unveiled a compromise on Thursday intended to ensure Senate passage of a major immigration reform bill with enough Republican support to persuade the GOP-controlled House to also take up the measure that is a priority of President Barack Obama. The bipartisan amendment would require 20,000 more border agents, completing 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploying $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposal, negotiated by a group of senators from both parties known as the ""Gang of Eight,"" also insists on stronger worker verification and border entry-exit controls. Only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security can undocumented immigrants get permanent residency, supporters said. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system. Hoeven noted the bill would allow immigrants now living illegally in the country to get temporary legal status as ""registered provisional immigrants,"" but the increased security measures must be in place before they can get green cards to make them permanent residents. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a member of the ""Gang of Eight,"" noted it would take ""a couple of years"" to train and deploy the new agents in an expansion that would almost double the current force. The Department of Homeland Security would verify when the triggers for improved border security had been met to begin issuing green cards, Graham added. He also said the measure  would include increased fees and other mechanisms to pay for the cost expected to exceed $30 billion, citing a Congressional Budget Office report that showed the broader immigration measure would bring in $197 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. ""I am very pleased to support what I think is the most dramatic amendment in the history of our country to get our borders secured,"" Graham said. However, some conservative GOP senators remained skeptical that the proposal would address their concerns. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said the compromise means ""amnesty will occur,"" and he complained that despite all the promises made by its sponsors and supporters, no written version had been produced so far. Sessions also noted that the compromise only came about in reaction to revelations about shortcomings in the original bill uncovered by critics including himself. Roy Beck, president of a group that opposes the immigration reform measure, called the compromise ""a desperate political move by pro-amnesty forces to provide cover to pass a bill that would otherwise not pass."" The amendment ""allows the massive increase in foreign workers that the CBO says will lower American wages and increase unemployment,"" said Beck, president of NumbersUSA. In contrast, GOP members of the ""Gang of Eight"" said they supported the plan. Veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Congress must resolve the issue of 11 million undocumented immigrants ""living in the shadows"" under the current broken system. Citing the nation's ""Judeo-Christian"" tradition, McCain asked if it was ""in our nation to come together and pass this legislation and not come up with reasons for not doing it."" Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake noted that he expected the compromise amendment would persuade a dozen or so Republicans to support the overall bill. ""This border security package will bring on a number of Republicans,"" Flake said. ""We've always said the bill would be improved through the process and this is part of that improvement."" Supporters want to win at least 70 votes in the 100-member Senate, hoping such a solid majority would give the measure much-needed momentum in the GOP-controlled House. Earlier this week, House Speaker John Boehner rejected having the GOP-controlled chamber vote on an immigration measure if it needed Democratic votes to pass. ""I don't see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn't have majority support of Republicans,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. Castro: GOP border security demands on immigration bill are 'not realistic' Conservative Republicans oppose the plan as written because it provides a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. They call such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers, and they fear the influx of likely Democratic voters in future elections. In addition, they reject the measure as a ""big government"" approach that will increase pressure on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. More moderate GOP leaders and legislators believe Republicans risk worse electoral damage if the party is blamed for blocking immigration reform. In last year's election, Obama won a strong majority of the Hispanic vote in defeating GOP nominee Mitt Romney, and Republican strategists warn of similar results if the party is considered hostile to immigrants. Conservative Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican in the ""Gang of Eight,"" said the alternative to immigration reform was keeping in place a broken system that has led to problems cited by opponents of the legislation. The first-term senator, who's widely considered a potential 2016 contender for the GOP presidential nomination, told CNN that he's not concerned about the political risk of tying his name so closely to such controversial legislation. ""The easiest thing to do politically is just not deal with the issue -- you know, give a couple speeches, and not play and get involved and try to solve it,"" Rubio said. ""I'm dealing with this because this is hurting our country badly.""

"North Carolina's House of Representatives passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday with a 74-41 vote. The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval. The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The bill allows North Carolina's health department to make temporary new rules for the state's 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit. It also prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life. House committee members refashioned a bill on motorcycle safety into one principally about abortion after the state's governor threatened on Wednesday to veto the abortion measures. That led the bill to be dubbed the ""Motorcycle Abortion Bill."" When legislators attached the abortion measures to the motorcycle safety bill, they placed them at the top of the bill and renamed it ""Health and Safety Law Changes."" motorcycle safety measures dropped to the bottom of the bill. Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, vowed to veto the abortion legislation the first time it came up. In his campaign, he had promised not to restrict abortion in North Carolina, and abortion-rights advocates lobbied to hold him to his word. McCrory warned in a statement that the legislation was unacceptable without significant changes, but he noted in his objections ""that major portions of the bill are of sound (principle) and value."" The language of the bill was reworded somewhat the second time around. It now says the health department should make rules without ""unduly restricting access."" McCrory could still veto, though there are enough conservative votes in the House and Senate to override it. A similar but stricter law passed in Mississippi is coming close to shutting down that state's last abortion clinic. Another such law passed in Alabama earlier this year. These new state laws represent a broader, nationwide assault on a woman's right to choose, said Staci Fox, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman. ""Bills like these have been introduced in 42 states. This is a whole new level of attack on women's health."" Some of the states that have already passed new laws did so in anticipation of legal challenges and have shored up war chests to fund the battles, she said. They are prepared to go to court, even to challenge the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade that provides the basic legal framework for abortion in the United States. Abortion opponents confirm the judicial strategy behind the laws. Americans United for Life states: ""Using our model legislation and our hard-won expertise with abortion clinic regulations, we also intend to provoke future, strategic 'test cases' -- federal and state legal challenges to carefully crafted and selected state laws -- that will serve as vehicles to severely undermine Roe v. Wade and, ultimately, eradicate it from American law."" Texas abortion bill a step closer to law .

"The United Kingdom took a step Friday toward being the first country in the world to allow a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using DNA from three people that could prevent mitochondrial diseases but that also raises significant ethical issues. One in 6,500 babies in the United Kingdom is born with mitochondrial disorder, which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease, respiratory problems and muscular dystrophy. Problems with mitochondria, the ""powerhouse"" cells of the body, are inherited from the mother, so the proposed IVF treatment would mean an affected woman could have a baby without passing on mitochondrial disease. But the cutting-edge IVF technique, which involves transferring nuclear genetic material from a mother's egg or embryo into a donor egg or embryo that's had its nuclear DNA removed, raises ethical questions. The new embryo will contain nuclear DNA from the intended father and mother, as well as healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a ""three-parent"" baby. The amount of donor DNA in the mitochondria will, however, be much less than the parental DNA in the nucleus, which determines the baby's characteristics. IVF-related birth defects may originate with moms, not treatment . The UK government plans to consult on draft regulations on the fertility treatment later this year, with the intention of putting the measure before parliament next year. At the moment, only unaltered eggs and embryos can be used for in vitro fertilization. ""Mitochondrial disease, including heart disease, liver disease, loss of muscle coordination and other serious conditions like muscular dystrophy, can have a devastating impact on the people who inherit it,"" said the UK's chief medical officer, professor Dame Sally Davies. Since scientists have developed ""ground-breaking new procedures"" that could prevent these diseases being passed on, Davies said, ""it's only right that we look to introduce this life-saving treatment as soon as we can."" The government says public consultation shows there is ""overall support"" for the treatment. But Dr. David King, director of Human Genetic Alert, a London-based watchdog group, opposed use of the technique Friday -- saying it opened the door to the creation of ""designer babies"" -- and disputed the results of the public consultation, saying not enough weight has been given to online polling. ""These techniques are unnecessary and unsafe and were in fact rejected by the majority of consultation responses,"" he said in a statement. ""It is a disaster that the decision to cross the line that will eventually lead to a eugenic designer baby market should be taken on the basis of an utterly biased and inadequate consultation."" King told CNN that conventional egg donation already allows a mother to bear a child without passing on a mitochondrial disorder, so the benefit of the new technique would only be to allow the baby to be genetically related to her. ""While I can understand that, that's not a medical benefit to anybody -- and you have to weigh it against the risks of invasive techniques that will clearly carry a risk to the child,"" he said. Could 'personhood' bills outlaw IVF? There's also a ""risk to society at large,"" he said, because once the ethical line over modification of human DNA has been crossed, the door will be opened to ""the next step and the next step after that."" ""That's why governments around the world over the last 20 years have said 'we won't allow you to genetically engineer human beings,' "" he said. Even if approved by lawmakers, more research is needed to ensure that the procedure actually works in humans and can be carried out safely, King said. The government's announcement Friday prompted a slew of UK media headlines -- and will probably continue to divide the scientific community. The UK-based Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which carried out a six-month inquiry into the ethical issues around the technique, concluded that the health and social benefits of living free from mitochondrial disorders meant that ""on balance ... if these novel techniques are adequately proven to be acceptably safe and effective as treatments, it would be ethical for families to use them."" Its working group also concluded that ""mitochondrial donation does not indicate, either biologically or legally, any notion of the child having either a 'third parent,' or 'second mother.' "" But University of Notre Dame law professor O. Carter Snead, a bioethicist who specializes in the governance of science, medicine and biotechnology, urged the United Kingdom to ""proceed slowly and cautiously"" given the ""unresolved safety and ethical questions"" around the new technique. ""Little is known about the short- and long-term genetic effects of this procedure on children born with its aid,"" he said. ""It would be an ironic tragedy if this procedure were rushed from bench to bedside, only to harm the very children it was meant to help. ""Moreover, there remain serious questions about the ethics of conceiving children with three genetic progenitors or 'parents.' "" IVF 'co-pioneer' Robert Edwards dead at 87 .","""Little is known about the short- and long-term genetic effects,"" says a U.S. bioethicist .

"When I was growing up, I had everything I needed. My wonderful parents, Dorothy and Lloyd, made sure we had nutritious food and they taught us where food came from. I have been blessed in many ways, and my wife, Sue, and I have been fortunate enough to pass that on to our own four daughters. We've never had to worry about how we'd feed our family. Other families in America are not as fortunate as I have been. Few Americans realize that the majority of low-income children in this country get most of their nutrition at school.  Whether it's the free breakfast, reduced-priced lunch or after-school snacks, these federally funded meal programs provide a critical safety net for families struggling to put food on the table. However, there is a huge gap in the number of children who could be getting these meals and the number actually accessing them. For instance, many children are not getting the food they need in the summer.  When school is out, many children lose their primary source of nutrition. Of the 20 million children who get lunch at school during the regular school year, only 1 in 7 are getting free meals in the summertime. The breakfast statistics are sobering as well. Of the same 20 million children who get lunch at school, only 10.5 million kids are eating school breakfast.  That kind of gap is unacceptable. Kids who come to school hungry get sick more frequently. They have more trouble concentrating on their schoolwork and struggle with their studies. This has a huge effect on their potential for success later in life, and that's not good for our country. As my good friend (and founder of Share Our Strength) Bill Shore always says, we can't have a strong America with weak kids. That's where the No Kid Hungry campaign works so beautifully. It connects kids to the healthy food they need every day, where they live, learn and play.  This happens through partnerships with schools, mayors, state governors, political leaders, nonprofit organizations, corporations, chefs, celebrities such as me and with people like you. The campaign works to come up with innovative ways to bridge this gap. For example, moving school breakfast out of the cafeteria and into the classroom -- where everyone eats together -- means more kids start the day with a healthy meal. Breakfast after the bell programs have already been championed in cities such as Baltimore and Los Angeles, and they're working really well. There is good news for kids who need meals this summer, too. The Summer Food Service Program -- a federally funded program -- provides free meals for people 18 and younger in cities all across America. This year, a national texting program has been put in place to help connect even more kids to meals. And No Kid Hungry's Cooking Matters program ensures kids are getting healthy meals at home by empowering low-income families with the skills to shop smarter, use nutrition information and cook delicious, affordable meals. Our children are our future, and it's up to me -- and to all of us -- to make sure we prepare them to be productive citizens and thrive in our communities. Ensuring our kids have the nutritious food they need is the very first step to getting them there. Join me in making No Kid Hungry a reality.","Jeff Bridges is the national spokesperson for the ""No Kid Hungry"" Campaign .

"In a victory for same-sex marriage supporters, the United States Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in a 5-to-4 decision. The law had denied federal recognition to same-sex couples. On the other side of the world, in China, the fight for gay rights is making progress. It is a common cliché to say that China is changing. News of breakneck economic growth, however, has often overshadowed the country's ""soft"" development. In the social arena, gays and lesbians, a once shunned minority, have become increasingly more assertive. When the Beijing LGBT center opened on Valentine's Day 2008, it didn't make the cover of The People's Daily, however, it was a major milestone for the Chinese gay and lesbian community. ""We wanted to create an LGBT friendly space,"" said Iron, the center's program director. ""There were not so many LGBT organizations in Beijing."" Iron is one of the many nicknames the 27 year old employs for her protection. ""In China advocacy is dangerous,"" she said. UK's House of Commons approves same-sex marriage . Since coming to Beijing from her native Hubei, Iron has thrown herself into the world of professional advocacy. Earlier this year, she and another female colleague staged a dramatic wedding protest by demanding a legal marriage certificate at Beijing's Dongcheng District Civil Affairs Bureau. It was the latest in a string of similar protests which have occurred in China since 2010. While the same-sex marriage debate is still too exotic for most Chinese, there have been successes on other fronts. In 1997, China abolished the crime of ""hooliganism,"" largely used as a pretext for criminalizing homosexual and other undesirable behaviors. It came a full six years before the United States Supreme Court struck down similar state anti-sodomy laws. In 2001, the Chinese Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders and most recently, an update to China's ""Exit-Entry Administration Law,"" will allow foreign same-sex couples in Beijing to apply for dependent residence permits as of July 1, 2013. For the next generation of Chinese urbanites, the wealthiest, worldliest and best educated in history, the laws are of little concern. It's no big deal for William Wu, a gay 21-year-old software student at Tsinghua University. ""I knew when I was in 8th grade,"" he said. ""All of my close friends know."" Wu, a regular patron of Beijing's thriving gay nightlife, is still not out to his parents and in many ways his primary concerns are strikingly similar to his American counterparts. ""I won't let [my parents] know before I graduate,"" he said. ""When I have the ability to live on my own, I will probably let them know."" French president signs same-sex marriage bill into law . While his university offers no formal resources for LGBT students, the growth of social media has allowed young people throughout China to supersede official channels. Catering to a mostly gay clientele, websites like Feizan.com and smartphone applications like Jack'd serve as virtual meeting spaces for China's emerging gay demographic. These sites operate openly and without restriction. Nothing better sums up the transformation than how the Chinese language itself has adapted. Today the most common term for gay in China is ""tongzhi,"" an ironic rebranding of the old revolutionary word for ""comrade."" This has largely supplanted the more clinical and negative ""tongxinglian."" Much work remains however. A 2013 Pew poll found that 57% of China's population was against the acceptance of homosexuality and only 21% in favor. ""Most Chinese still don't have consciousness about LGBT issues,"" said Iron, who added that older people ""think it is something from the Internet, or something brought over from Western countries."" The LGBT center itself has often been an unwelcome presence in its upscale neighborhood. Twice their landlord has tried to evict them which Iron speculated was likely the result of community pressure. Outside of the major cities too, China's gay and lesbian citizens still face many challenges. AJ Song, a 26-year-old Beijing entrepreneur is out to everyone he knows in the capital, but back home in his native Guizhou, one of China's poorest provinces, it is a very different story. Gay marriage around the world . ""I would not say it is bad. I would say it is hard,"" said Song, adding that rural Chinese ""don't have any knowledge about gays."" Song, who like most of his generation is an only child, knows his parents want him to marry and have children. The pressure to wed and continue the family line is deeply rooted in Chinese history. One of China's most influential ancient thinkers, Mencius (Mengzi), once opined that ""of all the ways a son can be disrespectful to his parents, the worst is to have no offspring."" Family pressure combined with the lingering social stigma has resulted in the phenomenon of ""tongqi"" or women who unknowingly marry gay men. Li Yinhe, one of China's most eminent sexologists and sociologists has estimated that there are as many as 16 million such women in China today. ""Divorce is difficult for women,"" said Iron, alluding to its cultural taboo. She added that stories of depression and even suicide were not uncommon among tongqi once they discovered the truth. Still, the future for gay and lesbian Chinese looks promising. The Pew study found that wealthy countries where religion did not play a central role in society tended to be among the most accepting. China, with little organized religion and a surging GDP, increasingly fits the mold. But does that make full gay and lesbian acceptance inevitable? The answer is still anyone's guess. Who will legalize same-sex marriage next?","China's gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community is becoming more assertive .

"All that glitters is not gold, they say. But all the gold in the world may come from astronomical events that send a lot of high-energy light out in space. Researchers have new evidence that gold comes from the collision of neutron stars. ""We can account for all the gold in the universe from these collisions,"" said Edo Berger, astronomer at the Harvard-Smithson Center for Astrophysics. Berger spoke about these results, submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, at a press conference Wednesday. Neutron stars are the dead cores of stars; in the past, they had exploded as supernovae. The neutron stars responsible for the event that Berger and colleagues studied are each thought to be about the size of Boston, but with about 1.5 times the mass of the sun. When these two neutron stars orbiting each other collided, at high speed, they gave birth to a black hole. Because the combination of the neutron stars is too heavy, the merged object collapses into the black hole. Neutron stars collide because gravitational radiation steals the energy from their orbit, said Stan Woosley, astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study. Each of these star cores is like gigantic atomic nucleus, he said in an e-mail. ""Smash two of them together at close to the speed of light and you can expect fireworks,"" Woosley said. Berger and colleagues observed a short-duration gamma-ray burst, which they believe came from such a neutron star collision. The burst is a flash of high-energy light, and this particular one lasted for less than two-tenths of a second, which is why it's considered ""short duration."" The burst was 3.9 billion light-years away from Earth -- that's pretty far, but it's still one of the closest gamma-ray bursts that scientists have spotted. The gamma-ray burst left behind a glow that included a significant amount of infrared light. According to the scientists, the radioactive elements, produced when merging neutron stars spat out material, emitted this light when they underwent radioactive decay. That's because decay heats the matter that was ejected, Woosley said. This infrared glow was a golden opportunity for scientists. It gave them evidence that short-duration gamma-ray bursts can come from neutron star collisions. ""This is our smoking gun connecting a short gamma-ray burst with the collision of two neutron stars,"" Berger said. There is still the possibility that the particular infrared light that the scientists spotted was not the result of radioactive decay, but a different light that was produced along with the gamma-ray burst, Woosley said. But the story of how gold formed from the neutron star collisions, he says, ""is almost certainly true."" Although the idea has been floated that gold comes from explosions of supernovae, simulations suggest that it's hard to produce gold that way, Berger said. Supernovae may contribute some fraction of gold to the universe, he said, but it appears that neutron star collisions are the dominant mechanism of producing gold in our universe. Scientists believe that the material that the merging neutron stars flung out included gold -- a lot of gold. Berger estimates that the equivalent of 10 moon masses of gold are created and ejected when two neutron stars merge. At today's market rate, that would go for about 10 octillion dollars, he said. That's a 1 followed by 28 zeros. Platinum and uranium also come from this collision process, Woosley said. All of these elements swirl around between stars, as gases, and eventually become part of subsequent generations of stars, like our sun. ""The gold and platinum in our rings as well as the uranium in our bombs and reactors are little pieces of neutron stars that merged in our galaxy long before the sun was born,"" Woosley said. This same gold from space became part of the formation of Earth and the rest of the solar system, including the sun. Gold that was present in the Earth's formation sank to its core. But we have gold that can be mined closer to the planet's surface because meteorites brought it later, according to a 2011 study in the journal Nature. More than 200 million years after the planet was formed, a shower of meteorites hit and brought with them gold, which stayed in the planet's mantle. Think about that the next time you wear a gold wedding band or other piece of jewelry. Now there's a fascinating thing about your bling.

"Modern contraceptives have radically changed women's lives, but they are not risk free. A new study out of the journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology finds the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) or progesterone-releasing IUD, may be associated with a higher than expected incidence of breast cancer. This form of IUD was originally developed as a contraceptive, but later was also used as a treatment for women who suffer from heavy periods (menorrhagia) as well as endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progesterone, which is a hormone that's naturally produced in a woman's body. It regulates ovulation. The hormone causes changes to the uterine lining and mucus in the cervix which makes it harder for sperm to reach the uterus, therefore making it more difficult to conceive. Because it strengthens the uterine lining, it helps cut down on heavy bleeding. Levonorgestrel is also the hormone used in the Plan B contraceptive, better known as the morning after pill. In this study, Finnish researchers from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Hyvinkää Hospital in Hyvinkää, Finland, wanted to examine the association between premenopausal use of the LNG-IUS and cancer rates, especially when it came to endometrial adenocarcinoma (cancer of the uterine wall). The study followed more than 93,000 Finnish women between the ages of 30 and 49.  All of the subjects were using the hormone-releasing IUD to treat their heavy periods from 1994 to 2007. At that time, up to 60% of all LNG-IUSs sold in Finland were used for heavy periods and not for contraception. Investigators found that over time, the device did not significantly raise the risk of uterine cancer or ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancers. But researchers did see a spike in the number of breast cancer cases, especially in women between the ages of 45-49, compared to women in the general population who were not using this particular IUD. ""The number of diagnosed new breast cancer cases among Finnish women who used LNG-IUS for menorrhagia was 19% higher than in Finnish general population,"" said Dr. Tuuli Soini, the lead author of the study. However, the research does not say that this type of IUD causes breast cancer. Soini also adds ""one limitation of our study was that women suffering from heavy menstruation may in fact represent a selected group of women who may have other risk factors for cancer, such as factors related to lifestyle, genetic factors, just to name a few."" According to Soini, this study is the first linking premenopausal LNG-IUS use and breast cancer. Two earlier studies did not reveal an increased cancer risk, according to the study. For physicians, this research is a new piece of information they can pass on to those patients. ""It's a great reminder that we need to weigh the benefits of some of these methods against the risks,"" said Dr. Angela Marshall, director of Comprehensive Women's Health in Silver Spring, Maryland. ""We need to educate our patients, because many of these therapies may work, but some could have serious side effects. Women need to be told. Then it's up to the patient, along with a doctor's guidance, to make the decision."" The study authors agree. ""LNG-IUS use seemed to protect against endometrial cancer, which is a common cancer type steadily increasing in the population,"" said Soini. ""We are still convinced LNG-IUS is the best treatment modality for heavy menstrual bleeding, a common health problem affecting the quality of life of a large proportion of female population overall. We certainly hesitate to recommend any change of the clinical menorrhagia management guidelines."" Soini also stressed, ""However, health benefits and health risks should be carefully taken into account while counseling menorrhagia patients, in relation to any hormonal or surgical therapy.""","Study of Finnish women using progesterone-releasing IUD found higher instance of breast cancer .

In Afghanistan, two rounds of ""indirect fire"" hit the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, but no one was hurt. The incidents highlight the security challenges with which both Iraq and Afghanistan are grappling. Both countries have had a heavy U.S. military presence until recently. The departure of U.S. forces from Iraq has done little to curb the near-daily cycle of violence. In Afghanistan, U.S. and Afghan officials are working on an important security pact to outline the future of American troops in Afghanistan. 18 dead in Christmas Day attacks near Iraq churches . Iraq attacks . In Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside a church in southern Baghdad just as worshipers were leaving a Christmas Day service, killing many. In another attack Wednesday, a car bomb went off at an outdoor market where many Christians shop, police said. Altogether, at least 38 people were killed and some 70 others were wounded, the Interior Ministry said. The bomb outside the church killed 27 and wounded 56. The market attack left 11 dead and 14 wounded. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks -- in the Dora area of Baghdad -- targeting ""Christians celebrating Christmas."" ""The Christian community in Iraq has suffered deliberate and senseless targeting by terrorists for many years, as have many other innocent Iraqis.  The United States abhors all such attacks and is committed to its partnership with the Government of Iraq to combat the scourge of terrorism,"" according to a statement released by the embassy. Iraq has experienced an uptick in sectarian violence this year as tensions simmer between the disaffected minority Sunni community and the Shiites, who dominate the government. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom notes that many people in small religious minority communities in Iraq, including Christians, have fled the country over the last decade and those that remain are ""particularly vulnerable,"" facing ""discrimination, marginalization, and neglect."" Sectarian warfare, especially between Sunnis and Shiites, raged during the Iraq War. Half or more of the pre-2003 Iraqi Christian community is thought to have left Iraq, the commission said in its 2013 annual report. In 2003, there were thought to be 800,000 to 1.4 million Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East members, Syriac Catholics and Orthodox, Armenian Catholics and Orthodox, Protestants and evangelicals in the country, the group said. Now, according to community leaders, the estimated number of Christians stands at around 500,000, the report said. Afghanistan attack .

The incident comes at a pivotal time in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The deal will lay out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014 when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.

"Authorities charged former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez with first-degree murder on Wednesday, hours after police arrested him and the NFL team that once gave him a $40 million contract dropped him from its roster. Hernandez is accused in last week's shooting death of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found in an industrial park area less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Hernandez ""drove the victim to the remote spot, and then he orchestrated his execution,"" First Assistant District Attorney Bill McCauley said in court Wednesday. ""He orchestrated the crime from the beginning, he took steps to conceal and destroy evidence, and he took steps to prevent the police from speaking to ... an important witness,"" the prosecutor said. Hernandez pleaded not guilty. A judge ordered him held without bail. Defense attorney Michael Fee had said that the evidence is circumstantial and that bail should be granted so that Hernandez can return home to spend time with his fiancee and 8-month-old child. ""It is a circumstantial case. It is not a strong case,"" Fee said, arguing that Hernandez was not a flight risk and had cooperated with authorities. Lloyd's family tearfully watched during Wednesday's hearing. They did not speak to reporters after leaving the courthouse. Hernandez, 23, wore a white T-shirt when he appeared in court. He stood beside his attorney, his hands cuffed. After the court hearing, Fee said Hernandez is ""doing fine."" A gag order issued during the hearing stopped attorneys from providing additional details afterward. The Patriots released Hernandez Wednesday after he was arrested and booked at a police station in North Attleborough. Hernandez's next court date, for a probable cause hearing, is scheduled for July 24. That's when the state would have to prove it has enough evidence to move forward. But it's possible that Hernandez will be indicted before then, in which case a probable cause hearing would be unnecessary. The rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez . Prosecutor: Surveillance footage shows Hernandez with gun . After days of secrecy in the closely watched investigation, the prosecutor's comments in court provided the first detailed account of Lloyd's killing and the evidence detectives have uncovered. A jogger found Lloyd's body, riddled with gunshot wounds, in a secluded area of an industrial park near Hernandez's house June 17, McCauley said. Investigators later found five shell casings at the scene. Inside Lloyd's pocket, McCauley said, they found a wallet and keys to a car that Hernandez had rented. Earlier that same day, around 2:30 a.m., the prosecutor said, the 27-year-old Lloyd was seen leaving his Boston home with Hernandez in a silver Nissan Altima. Twitter reacts as Hernandez charged, released from Patriots . Less than an hour later, surveillance cameras at the North Attleborough industrial park showed the vehicle heading toward the remote area where Lloyd's body was later found, McCauley said. ""The car goes down there at 3:22,"" McCauley said. ""Four minutes later, the car is visible again. During the interval between 3:23 and 3:27, people who were working the overnight shift hear gunshots."" Minutes later, surveillance video from Hernandez's home security system shows the former NFL player arriving back at his house with two other people, according to the district attorney. Hernandez appears to be holding a firearm, McCauley said. ""The defendant goes walking through the house with the gun in his hand. That is captured in the video. ... And they all go down to the basement,"" McCauley said. ""Once in the basement, the surveillance gets shut off."" McCauley said the gun Hernandez was carrying in the surveillance video has not been found. Hernandez's American dream turns into nightmare scenario . Investigation continues . For several days, investigators searched the area near Hernandez's home as they investigated Lloyd's death. Authorities said Wednesday the investigation was ongoing. In addition to the first-degree murder charge, Hernandez faces five weapons-related charges, including carrying a firearm without a license. It was unclear whether there had been any additional arrests in the case. ""One critical part of this case that we don't know anything about at this point is the two other men (Hernandez is) accused of being with,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""Were they shooters? Were they involved? Will they flip against Hernandez? They are obviously key figures in this, and we'll watch how that unfolds."" In court on Wednesday, the prosecutor described what he alleged was a tense conversation between Hernandez and Lloyd inside the Nissan Altima and described what Hernandez and his associates had done at the scene of the shooting. He did not reveal how investigators had learned that information. Inside the car, according to McCauley, Hernandez told Lloyd he was angry because of Lloyd's behavior at a Boston club they had gone to together several days earlier. ""There were certain things that had happened during the night that he was upset about and now didn't trust the victim,"" McCauley said. ""He told him one of the things he was mad about. ... At the club the victim had spoken to a couple of people, and the defendant told him that he was upset about that because he had some troubles with those people."" Hernandez reportedly will be sued for shooting man in face . Victim's family reacts . Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, told CNN last week that her brother and Hernandez went to a Boston nightclub together a few days before Lloyd's death. Her brother was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, she said. She said she didn't know of any problems between Hernandez and her brother, who worked for a landscaping company. Before Wednesday's hearing, Thibou said she was glad to hear about Hernandez's arrest. ""God is great,"" she said. ""It's the best news I've had since my brother was killed last week."" House searched again . Patriots drop Hernandez . The Patriots -- who gave Hernandez a five-year, $40 million contract last year -- released him from the team after his arrest, but before the charges against him were made public Wednesday. ""Words cannot express the disappointment we feel knowing that one of our players was arrested as a result of this investigation,"" the team said in a statement. The NFL released its own statement, calling the involvement of a player in the case ""deeply troubling."" What does his release mean for the Patriots? Both the NFL and Patriots expressed sympathy for the victim's family. On Wednesday, about a half-dozen plainclothes police officers went to Hernandez's house and then led him out in handcuffs. He was wearing a white T-shirt and shorts. Death inquiry, silence from player and cops . Sheriff: Gang unit will investigate Hernandez's tattoos . Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said he expects living behind bars will be a major adjustment for the former NFL star. Wednesday night's dinner at the Dartmouth House of Correction was chop suey, green beans and a slice of bread, the sheriff said. Hernandez will only be allowed out of his one-person cell for showers and phone calls. Authorities will perform background checks on any visitors. Hodgson said he met with Hernandez ""as soon as he came in"" to the facility and told him he'd receive no special treatment. Hernandez took selfie with a gun . Asked how Hernandez responded, Hodgson said, ""He did not seem nervous,"" adding he was ""polite and respectful."" Hernandez is currently being held in the jail's medical unit while he undergoes further screening, including mental health, physical and security tests. As part of the security screening, authorities will determine whether he has any gang affiliations. ""He had tattoos that our gang unit would be looking at ... to see if he's involved in any kind of gang,"" Hodgson said. ""Doesn't mean he is."" The tattoos raise suspicion, the sheriff said, and investigators will follow up with interviews to further determine the significance of what they saw. ""He'll be treated no better and no worse than any other inmate,"" the sheriff said.","Sheriff: A gang unit will investigate Hernandez's tattoos .

"In Zambia, bicycles are grown from the ground. Making the most of the southern African country's bamboo plants, two Americans and two Zambians have set up a company that is crafting high-end, lightweight bicycles with frames made out of the locally-grown wooden weed. Dubbed Zambikes, the company is putting its custom-built Zambian bikes on roads around the world, offering pedal enthusiasts a unique ride while helping to empower local communities back home. ""It's a plus to have a product that is grown in Africa, made in Africa and exported to everywhere else in the world,"" says Zambikes co-founder Mwewa Chikamba. ""It's rare that we have such incentives coming through -- mostly we are importing stuff from the rest of the world."" Eye-catching, super light and extremely durable, bamboo bicycles have gained traction in recent years, becoming a popular alternative to traditional steel or aluminium bikes. The material, one of nature's fastest growing resources, has great shock absorbing abilities that contribute to a smooth and eco-friendly ride. ""It's a green project and we are encouraging other entities and industries to look at ways and means of bringing down the levels of pollution,"" says Lusaka-born Chikamba, 43. ""We produce it in a manner that is pollution-free and isn't by any chance devastating to the global warming issues."" Read more: Rise of the 'repats' The idea for Zambikes first surfaced in 2004 when two young Americans, Vaughn Spethmann and Dustin McBride, visited Zambia on a six-week university field trip. The two college friends were impressed by the hospitality of Zambians but also witnessed first-hand the economic hardship that many of the country's people were suffering. ""We noticed that unemployment was well over 60%,"" says 27-year-old Spethmann. ""Everybody we talked to didn't have jobs or couldn't find jobs and when we looked around nobody had decent bicycles."" Spethmann and McBride decided to return to Zambia straight after their graduation. They teamed up with Chikamba and fellow Zambian Gershom Sikaala and together they set the Zambikes operation in motion in July 2007. So far, the company, which employs some 40 people, has produced about 500 hand-made bamboo frames, but this year alone it expects to crank out another 450. With a price tag of around $900, the company's bamboo bikes are primarily aimed at the international market, with countries such as Japan, Singapore, Germany, Brazil, Finland and the United States driving demand. But from planting the bamboo in the Zambian forests to shipping the bicycles to the concrete urban jungles across the world, the process of manufacturing the bikes is far from an easy task. Spethmann says the bamboo is chosen carefully for its quality and thickness. It is then cut and treated before being dried and placed in a jig. The frame is then joined with glue and wrapped in natural fibers and affixed to its conventional metal components. ""It is quite labor intensive -- each frame takes between 40 and 60 man hours to make,"" says Spethmann. ""Every piece of bamboo is having different colors, different bend, so every frame is unique."" Read more: Africa's daily commuting grind . As well as their bamboo bikes, Zambikes is also making steel bicycles to cater to the local market's needs for cheap transport, having so far produced about 10,000 of them. It is also producing spare parts and cargo carts as well as bicycle ambulances that are designed to easily transport patients or pregnant women from their homes to a health center. ""In rural areas where there's no roads, no fuel, nothing, these bicycle ambulances that are very low maintenance allow these people to be ferried to the clinic,"" says Spethmann, noting that the company has so far, distributed over 900 ""zambulances."" Running such a business in Zambia, however, is not without challenges. Notwithstanding difficulties such as huge transportation costs, high import rates, currency fluctuations and bureaucracy, Zambikes' founders say that attracting capable staff has been hard at times. ""Finding good workforce has been challenging,"" admits Spethmann, ""but that's one of the reasons that we came in Zambia,"" he adds. ""We saw a need and we saw people that needed opportunities, so on one hand this is a challenge but on the other hand we are happy to help."" More than just a business, the company says its mission is to save lives and develop efficient and affordable transport solutions in a country where most people live on $2 a day  -- Zambia ranks a gloomy 164 out of 187 on the 2011 Human Development Index by the United Nations Development Program. Viewing social business growth as a sustainable answer to the country's economic woes, Zambikes founders say the want to benefit local communities by providing employment and skills training to the ""uneducated and underprivileged."" ""The main goal we have is firstly to make the most vulnerable Zambians realize that they have an equal opportunity in life to excel, to move from where they are to the next point and begin to grow into what they are meant to be,"" says Chikamba. The company is also offering additional business training and interest-free loans to its staff as part of its commitment on community development. ""Much more than just a project, the incentive we get is seeing someone on a Zambike and enabling him to do or acquire whatever he is purposed to -- that is a great reward,""  says Chikamba.","Zambikes is a Zambia-based company producing bamboo bicycles .

"At least 29 people were killed and 126 wounded Tuesday in eight car bombings in Iraq. In the first string of attacks, at least four people were killed and 41 others wounded when three car bombs exploded in the northern city of Kirkuk on Tuesday morning, Kirkuk police officials told CNN. The first car bomb exploded near the al-Shorja outdoor market, the second exploded near a fuel station, and the third near the local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, or KDP. All three occurred in the northern part of Kirkuk, which is a mainly Kurdish area. In Anbar province, two car bombs exploded in two areas, killing six people and wounding 13 others Tuesday afternoon, officials said. The first bomb exploded at an Iraqi police patrol in central Ramadi, about 68 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad, killing six people and wounding 10 others. The second exploded at a security convoy in southern Falluja, wounding three people. Falluja is about 37 miles (60 kilometers) west of Baghdad. In another string of car bombings, at least 19 people were killed and 72 others wounded in three separate explosions Tuesday evening outside three Shiite mosques in the capital of Baghdad, city police officials told CNN. The first exploded outside the Zahraa Shiite mosque in the Shulla neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, killing eight people and wounding 21 others. The second exploded outside the Ali-Basha Shiite mosque in  the Sbaa-Abkar district in northeastern Baghdad, killing six and wounding 32. And the third exploded outside the Sodani Shiite mosque in the Hurriya neighborhood in northwestern Baghdad, killing five and wounding 19. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the three Baghdad attacks, but police told CNN the explosions bear the hallmark of al Qaeda in Iraq. Read more: Iraq free of sectarian violence during Ashura . The attacks came a day after senior Iraqi security officials from the federal government and Kurdistan regional government agreed to form committees to find a solution to one of Iraq's most complicated issues: the disputed areas, including Kirkuk. The oil-rich Kirkuk province is one of the areas most disputed by the Kurdistan regional government and the federal government in Baghdad. The city of Kirkuk is an ethnically mixed area, made up of Sunni and Shiite Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. Read more: September is deadliest month in Iraq in more than 2 years . A clash between the regional and federal governments started nearly 10 days ago when Tigris Operations Command carried out military operations in Kirkuk and disputed areas around the city. The federal government formed the command a few months ago for military operations, including house searches, to maintain security, especially in disputed areas across the country. The government of Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdistan Region did not welcome the move. As a result, Kurdish Peshmerga forces sent reinforcements, including more troops and more military equipment to Kirkuk province and nearby disputed areas, and a standoff began between Kurdish forces and the Iraqi army. Special: Coalition casualties in Iraq . The office of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced Monday that an agreement had been reached between the central government and the Kurdistan regional government to pull Peshmerga and Iraqi army troops from Kirkuk and other disputed areas back their previous positions. Senior security officials from both sides are still meeting to find a solution to the crisis, and they agreed to form the committees to deal with the issue. An official with Iraq's Defense Ministry told CNN on Monday, on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, that over the past three days, Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces have sent reinforcements, including more troops and more military equipment around Kirkuk province and nearby disputed areas. The official said the situation is still tense. Last week, all Kurdish political parties met in Irbil and expressed a united position to defend the Kurdistan region. They also expressed their support for the Kurdistan Peshmerga forces and their readiness. In a statement released by his office last week, al-Maliki said the Kurdistan regional government should avoid language that threatens war, ""Because it is ugly."" He also stressed the need to return to a 2009 agreement to preserve security in the disputed areas by forming checkpoints between Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi army forces. He said these security centers and checkpoints should be under the supervision of the central government in Baghdad.","Bombers strike in Kirkuk, Anbar province, Baghdad .

"Two Subway employees have been fired after getting fresh -- not in the way the restaurant chain intended -- including one who put his genitals on a loaf of bread, took a picture, then shared the image online. The incident came to light over the past few days at a Subway franchise abutting a gas station in Dublin, Ohio. Specifically, the uproar centers around two images that were posted to a social networking site and eventually picked up by other sites, including Gawker. One shows a male putting his genitals on what appears to be a loaf of Subway bread. In the other, a hand is shown holding what used to be a water bottle that's half-filled with a cream-colored substance. Under it is the caption: ""Today at work I froze my pee."" Using the slogan ""Eat Fresh,"" Subway boasts being the world's largest restaurant chain, with about 38,000 locations in 100 countries. The company released a statement Tuesday about what it called an ""isolated incident (that) is not representative of Subway sandwich artists,"" the latter term being what Subway calls those who make sandwiches at its restaurants. ""These actions are not tolerated and the franchisee took immediate action to terminate the two employees involved,"" Subway said. Gilligan Oil, the company that owns and operates the Subway franchise in question, did not respond immediately Tuesday to CNN's request for comment. But its director of operations, Bob Gierhart, did tell CNN affiliate WBNS that the restaurant was closed Monday so all its bread could be thrown out and all its surfaces could be sanitized. ""We do our best to hire properly,"" Gierhart said. ""We had a couple of kids who don't understand the ramifications of what they do and what they post."" According to Columbus Public Health, whose inspectors routinely check on restaurants in the area, the Subway franchise did not have any critical violations in its last two inspections that took place this past March and in October 2012. The restaurant did have violations before then, according to information posted online, though all of these were corrected at the time of the inspections. The violations included things like problems with temperatures at which foods were being held, unsafe food not being properly discarded and employees failing to properly wash their hands. Prospective customers, meanwhile, expressed disgust after hearing of the employees' behavior. ""I think I want to go home and consider puking,"" Jason South told WBNS. ""... Sometimes these things kind of go on in fast-food restaurants, and most of us just really don't want to know about it."" Patrick Gibson told the same station that he used to go to that Subway franchise because his co-workers told him it was ""the cleanest one around."" But that's hard for him to swallow now, nor does he understand why the offending employees did what they did. ""I don't get what the joke is,"" Gibson said. ""I don't get that it's funny.""

"New light has been shed on one of the most famous serial killer cases in history. A lab test confirms DNA evidence taken from the body of a murder victim matches Albert DeSalvo, who at one point confessed to being the Boston Strangler, Massachusetts authorities said Friday. The evidence was taken after Mary Sullivan, 19, was sexually assaulted and strangled to death on January 4, 1964, in her Charles Street apartment in Boston. DeSalvo had confessed to that crime and about a dozen other murders police attributed to the Boston Strangler. However, he recanted his admissions and was never convicted of any of them before his death. Although many continued to believe DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler despite his retraction, others expressed doubts. Now, however, there is an ""unprecedented level of certainty"" that DeSalvo raped and killed Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said in a news release Friday. Officials announced the results after notifying Sullivan's family of the findings, the release said. See more: City of fear, photos from the Boston Strangler era . ""Questions that Mary's family asked for almost 50 years have finally been answered. They, and the families of all homicide victims, should know that we will never stop working to find justice, accountability, and closure on their behalf,"" Conley said. Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis credited ""a relentless cold case squad"" who ""refused to give up, waiting until science met good police work to solve this case."" DeSalvo was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes. Solving a murder with DNA . Conley said earlier this month that scientists had tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate DNA evidence from semen found in Sullivan's body and on a blanket. They resumed their efforts last year, after scientific advances had led to a laboratory successfully salvaging DNA from decades-old material. Boston Police Crime Laboratory technicians were able to extract DNA profiles from both sets of samples, and those DNA profiles matched one another, the news release says. The DNA profile was uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System. Known as CODIS, it stores the DNA profiles of millions of known offenders, the release says. But there was no match. That ruled out at least one man who earlier been an unofficial suspect in Sullivan's slaying, it says. Investigators then went on a search for any other evidence that might contain DeSalvo's DNA. But each place that might have had suitable samples -- like the Department of Correction, the Massachusetts State Police and others -- did not. Knowing Y chromosomes are passed down ""almost unchanged"" from father to son, Boston Police retrieved a water bottle that one of DeSalvo's nephews drank from and threw away. Police revealed this action earlier in July. Although the DNA recovered from the bottle was a ""familial match"" with the genetic material preserved from Sullivan's murder, Conley said at that time that it wasn't enough to close the case with certainty. It did, however, lead to a judge approving DeSalvo's exhumation so a DNA sample could be taken directly from him. On July 12, DeSalvo's grave was excavated and his remains were transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Comparisons were made, officials said, and the match was confirmed.","Officials: Anthony DeSalvo's DNA matches evidence from a Boston Strangler killing .

"On Long Island Sound (CNN) -- On Friday morning, I boarded a leaky oyster boat in Connecticut with a captain who can't swim. Our destination: Manhattan, 84 miles down the coast. Mission: don't drown get world leaders to act on climate change. If anyone can accomplish that herculean task it should be Bren Smith, a 42-year-old oysterman off the coast of Branford, Connecticut, who has become a sort of reluctant poster boy for doing something about the crisis instead of just talking about it. Bren's oyster beds were wiped out twice by hurricanes, once by Irene and then, a year later, by Sandy. Warming waters and ocean acidification aren't helping his business model, either. But instead of giving up, he's currently helping to pioneer new techniques for ""ocean farming,"" growing, among other things, kelp seaweed for use in pasta, martinis and biofuel. That he can't swim hasn't stopped him from spending his life on the ocean, which he loves. (""The world disappears; it doesn't exist when you're out here,"" he said, bouncing over 3- and 4-foot waves). And that he, single-handedly, can't stop climate change didn't stop him from driving his boat down the coast to attend the People's Climate March in New York on Sunday, which is being billed as the largest public demonstration for climate action to date. ""This isn't a shtick. I actually believe in this,"" he said of the reason he's boating from Connecticut to New York for the rally. ""I love the ocean. I want to protect it."" Bren -- who described himself as being ""on the front lines of the this crisis"" -- will be one of the most important people to attend Sunday's People's Climate March, which is expected to draw more than 100,000 protestors ahead of United Nations climate summit on Tuesday. He's essential to the international climate conversation for two reasons. One, he's a witness to the reality of climate change today -- here and now and in America. Too often we think of this as an Arctic-only problem, or a 100-years-in-the-future problem. It's actually both urgent and local, as Bren and so many others can attest. And two: Instead of just griping about the changes, he's actually doing something to help. ""This isn't a story of giving up,"" he said. ""This is a story of hope."" Preach, brother. We all have a lot to learn from Bren. Opinion: Why climate change is an 'everybody issue' now . I was lucky enough to get to join him and his co-conspirator, Ron Gautreau, 52, on the 7Â½-hour journey from the Thimble Island Oyster Co., near Branford, Connecticut, to Pier 59 in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. We took Bren's 1983 workboat, which he calls ""Mookie II,"" named for the Mets' legendary Mookie Wilson. It chugged along, past the mansions of Greenwich, Connecticut, and the industrial decay of Bridgeport, at a steady and slightly sea-sickening pace of about 17 mph. He told me he took the boat instead of a car because traffic on Interstate 95 headed into New York is ""f---ing hell"" and because it's a fun bit of ""political theater,"" inspired in part by 1970s protests in which farmers drove their tractors across the country to Washington to demand better farm policy. Between bouts of losing our footing and hollering over the wind, I got to learn some of Bren's inspirational story. He grew up in in Petty Harbour, Newfoundland, a fishing village with 14 houses, as he tells it, at ""the edge of the world."" His parents were from New York and Connecticut, but moved there during the Vietnam War to dodge the draft. Their son took to the tiny village well, and started fishing at a young age. Because it was so remote, he said, it was a place where people were ""fascinated with everything new."" It was a place of doers and makers, not complainers. Bren's parents later moved him to the Boston area. People sat around too much, and he missed being out on the ocean -- subject to its moods, humbled by its strength. So, at 14, he dropped out and went to work as a commercial fishermen -- first in Massachusetts, then on the Bering Sea, where he saw 60-foot waves. He dreamed about the work even when he wasn't doing it -- fell in love with a life lived out on the water. It was so cold, he said, he never bothered to learn to swim. That's not uncommon among fishermen, he told me. The prevailing view: Swimming prolongs drowning. He's no stranger to ecological catastrophe. He witnessed the collapse of cod populations in the Atlantic, which he said put many of his friends out of work. And then, when he'd established himself as an oysterman on Long Island Sound, the hurricanes came. While scientists say it's impossible to attribute any single storm to human-induced climate change, the warming atmosphere is expected to make hurricanes larger and more dangerous. And just as Bren rebuilt from one storm, the second hit. He lost 80% of his oysters and about half of his equipment, he told me. ""That just blanketed the farm and killed everything,"" he said. Three days after Sandy hit, he told me, he got online and started researching alternative methods of oyster cultivation -- and new crops to ""farm"" in the ocean. He came upon the work of Charles Yarish, a professor at the University of Connecticut who studies seaweed cultivation. Yarish helped Bren devise a system, Bren told me, to grow kelp underwater in vertical columns, attached to buoys on the surface. He calls the result a ""3-D ocean farm"" -- almost invisible from the surface, but capable of producing 10 tons of seaweed per acre per year, along with oysters, clams and mussels, some of which attach themselves to the towers of kelp. This vertical farming method might help prevent his entire operation from being wiped out if another storm swept through, pushing mud across the floor of Long Island Sound. As part of a nonprofit called GreenWave, he's trying to help spread this idea to other ""ocean farmers"" by open-sourcing the model and teaching what he knows. It's a success story, at least for now. Bren now says the hurricanes were among the best things to happen to him -- because they forced him to innovate, to come up with a new, better way of doing things. The kelp helps sink carbon from the atmosphere, and it processes nitrogen pollution from land-based farms. It doesn't require fresh water, which gives it an environmental leg up on traditional crops. Plus, he expects it to be more resilient in storms and warmer waters. But the future is still uncertain. ""Unless the fossil fuels industry reduces their emissions, my farm won't last,"" he said. He sees oysters and other ocean creatures as the canaries in the coal mine for climate change. Most of us are so distant from the oceans we don't see the change. When we were pulling into New York, I asked Bren what he would do if the United Nations and world leaders continued to fail to act on curbing global carbon emissions. The meetings next week are largely seen as gathering political will ahead of more-formal talks in 2015. But what if no one cares? ""I don't know,"" he said, calmly. ""I'll just keep doing my part."" It's just the kind of guy he is. It would help if elected officials operated with similar resolve.","Hundreds of thousands are expected at the People's Climate March on Sunday .

"Lawmakers in Bahrain have passed tough new laws for ""terrorism acts"" ahead of massive protests planned by the opposition next month. The National Assembly, in a session Sunday, approved new penalties for those who commit or incite ""terrorism,"" including stripping Bahrainis of citizenship. Legislators also banned any demonstrations in the tiny kingdom's capital, Manama. The anti-government opposition bloc has called for mass protests on August 14. According to BNA, Bahrain's National Institution for Human Rights praised the efforts ""to protect the Kingdom's gains and future generations and (face) the recent dangerous escalation that aim at pushing the country to unrest and political tension, which is contrary to the Islamic values and international norms, conventions and treaties."" But global human rights activists have denounced what they call appalling human rights abuses by Bahraini authorities, particularly in the past few years. In April, Human Rights Watch said Bahraini security forces had raided homes and arbitrarily detained a number of prominent anti-government protest leaders. Bahrain is an ally of the United States and home to the 5th Fleet, a large U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf. Tensions in the kingdom remain high following the 2011 uprising, in which the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority. The protests were spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the demonstrations failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council.","Legislators ban demonstrations .

"Most, if not all, super heroes wear cloaks and masks to hide their identity. But how about a burqa? A new cartoon series in Pakistan is turning stereotypes on their head. It's centered around a woman who doesn't wear a burqa in the daytime but puts one on to transform into the ""Burka Avenger"" - and what's more, she's fighting for female education. The cartoon is already the talk of the country and it hasn't even launched yet. ""Burka Avenger"" is a passion project of Pakistani pop star, Haroon. ""It was in 2010 and I was reading a lot of articles about girls' schools being shut down by extremists so that was in my mind,"" he told CNN after I met him at his studio. ""Living in Pakistan, all theses issues are staring you in the face constantly. So when you're creating art, whether it be music or anything else like a cartoon TV series -- you want to incorporate social messages.  I feel it's my duty to try and make a positive difference."" School teacher by day, by night the Burka Avenger (spelled with a 'k') dons a special burqa to protect girls' schools, fighting the bad guys trying to shut them down.. ""The Burka Avenger is a character called Jiya, orphaned as a child, adopted by a Kabbadi master, who is a master of this mystic martial art that I created, called Takht Kabbadi -- the art of fighting with books and pens. It gives the message of the importance of education and that the pen is mightier than the sword,"" Haroon says. The burqa can be a controversial item of clothing. For some, the burqa is a symbol of oppression. For others, it's a symbol of freedom from sexism and being viewed as merely a sexual object -- ie. the burqa hides a woman's body so that a person addresses her as a human being not an object of desire. I ask Haroon why he decided to dress her in one and he has an emphatic explanation. ""She doesn't use the burqa because she's oppressed. She uses it, she chooses to wear it to hide her identity the way superheroes wear their costumes to hide an identity. Like Batman or Catwoman,"" he says. The Taliban have hijacked religion, Haroon tells me, and use it for their own agenda. When they rode into Swat in 2007 they burned down and bombed girls' and boys' schools, he continues. Their brutal campaign was stopped through a military operation in 2008 and 2009 but years later in 2012 they carried out an attack that shocked the world. They shot Malala Yousafzai. Haroon says he also chose the burqa as a way of addressing any argument of the fight for girls' education in the cartoon being anti-Islamic. ""By wearing a burqa she is showing she is a Muslim woman and superhero. And that she stands for all the good things of Islam and the real Islamic values -- which are equality, woman's rights, education and peace -- rather than the way Islam has been hijacked by radical elements,"" he says. Haroon's also teamed up with his celebrity friends to be the voices of the characters. Some of South Asia's most famous musical talent also sing tracks to go with the cartoon. Rapper Adil Omar has written ""Lady in Black."" Rock star Ali Azmat sings a head-banging ""Baba Bandook,"" translated as 'Old Man Gun,' about one of the main characters who is trying to shut down girls' schools. There are 13 episodes and aside from the ongoing battle for girls' education, each covers a different issue affecting Pakistan, including discrimination, child labor, sectarian violence, electricity shortages and protecting the environment. ""These are really hard hitting issues and you think how can you talk about these issues in a kids' show? But it's being presented in a very entertaining manner, full of adventure, comedy and fun,"" Haroon says. Haroon says he hopes the cartoon will have an impact on Pakistani children who are unable to read or write either themselves or whose parents can't read them bedtime stories. And just like in fairytales, each episode has a moral at the end of the story. ""I remember when I was a child, my mother used to read me stories and at the end it would say, 'Ok, the moral of the story is this.' I used to also read those stories as I learned to read as well. That really resonated with me and helped me figure out what my own morals and ethics are."" ""Unfortunately, with the literacy rate so low in Pakistan, a lot of children don't have that opportunity with parents reading to them or reading themselves. In this show, I brought that in as well. At the end of each show. The Burka Avenger comes up and says 'Ok kids, the moral of this story or this episode was such and such.'"" The cartoon launches in mid-August, shortly after the Muslim festival of Eid ul Fitr.","New Pakistan cartoon features burka-clad heroine who champions female education .

"At a college reunion, it's common for alumni to share post-collegiate achievements with each other. But a report compiled for this year's 50th reunion class at Harvard University contained an unusual entry. Ted Kaczynski, the so-called ""Unabomber"" and Harvard alumnus, listed his eight life sentences for a string of bombings that killed three people and wounded 23 others as an ""award"" in the class of 1962 report. The Harvard Alumni Association said in a statement Thursday that they ""regret publishing Kaczynski's references to his convictions and apologize for any distress that it may have caused others."" The Boston Globe published an apparent photo of the entry, which lists Kaczynski's occupation as ""prisoner"" and his address as ""No 04475-046, US Penitentiary-Max, P.O. Box 8500, Florence, CO 8126-8500."" In the section where alumni list their awards, Kaczynski's entry reads: ""eight life sentences, issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, 1998."" Kaczynski's entry was published in a class reunion report, which was distributed in advance of the 1962 reunion. All members of the class who submit their own entries are included in each year's report, according to the alumni association. Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and pleaded guilty in 1998 for sending bombs through the mail from 1978 to 1995.","Ted Kaczynski, the so-called ""Unabomber,"" listed his eight life sentences as an ""award""
