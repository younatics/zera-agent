"Smartwatches are coming in many shapes and sizes but only a few - such as Samsung's Gear S and the forthcoming Apple Watch - allow people to make calls. Now musician and technology entrepreneur  will.i.am is set to reveal a rival which will let people to use the gadget like a phone, by making calls, using apps and playing music. The watch was due to launch in July, but is now set to make its debut tomorrow in San Francisco, during Salesforce.com's Dreamforce event. Scroll down for video . A rival for Apple Watch? will.i.am is set to reveal  his own smartwatch, which will allow people to use the gadget like a phone, by making calls, using apps and listen to music . Will.i.am was recently seen wearing his creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that,’ before seemingly using it to control the music playing. In April, he claimed in an interview with Alan Carr, that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, all of which will.i.am uses frequently. The device has a reflective dark grey finish and rectangular design, which is ‘a product living at the intersection of fashion, science, technology and pop culture,’ according to Salesforce. It ‘allows for a sixth sense mentality and represents a new way of being connected,’ it said. will.i.am was seen using his watch at a DJ set (pictured) three weeks ago . In April, will.i.am claimed that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in an interview with Alan Carr (pictured) Will.i.am’s watch appears to have a curved display. He hasn't revealed what operating system his device runs on, but the fact it features established apps including Instagram and Twitter,suggests it could run on Android. The presence of Instagram also hints that the device will have a camera. As the watch doesn’t link with a phone, but stores music, it suggests the watch will have a substantial amount of storage - which will need to be a minimum of 4GB to be useful. If the watch has Bluetooth connectivity, it’s likely to also have Wi-Fi capabilities and may even add NFC. Due to the fact it can make calls, the watch is also likely to have a SIM card and may additionally support 3G, or even 4G. If it does come with a data plan, the storage may be reduced if music can be streamed from the cloud. The device, which is expected to run Android, has a curved screen and can store music locally, as well as coming with a digital music service from a British company called 7digital,The Telegraph reported. Will.i.am and 7digital are thought to have struck deals with large and small record labels to cover most musical tastes, which could give the wearable an edge over those with other music services. Will.i.am, the director of creative innovation at Intel showed off his smartwatch for the first time on Channel 4's Alan Carr: Chatty Man, as well as using it during The Voice. During the show, will.i.am told Alan Carr: 'I don’t carry my phone anymore, this is my phone. ‘A lot of these smartwatches need phones - mine doesn’t need a phone. 'I started the company myself, I funded it, I used my own money to develop it. 'So, it’s a phone. It has all my music in it so I can work out with it, without wires using Bluetooth headphones. It’s got Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.’ The following night, will.i.am used the watch to call Cheryl Cole during the final of talent show The Voice - although the call quality was poor and cut out shortly afterwards. The presence of Instagram hints that the device will have a camera. As the watch doesn’t link with a phone, but stores music, it will probably come with a substantial amount of storage, perhaps at least 4GB. Music to consumers' ears? The device, which is expected to run on Android, has a curved screen and can store music locally, as well as coming with a digital music service from a British company called 7digital . The wrapper and entrepreneur was recently seen wearing his creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that.

Due to the fact it can make calls, the watch will probably feature a SIM card and may additionally support 3G, or even 4G. It has not yet been revealed how much will.i.am’s smartwatch will cost, or when it will launch. But it will be going head-to-head with Apple’s highly-anticipated wearable, which will probably not be launched until February and will cost from $349 (£216). While it is among the few wearables that will be able to be used to make phone calls, the battery is thought to be the Apple Watch’s Achilles heel, with reports that it will have to be charged daily. There is no news about will.i.am’s device’s battery life as yet. Here, will.i.am showcases his watch for the first time in April on Alan Carr's talk show . will.i.am's device will go head-to head with the Apple Watch (pictured left and right). It is not known whether the two products will be similarly priced, with an Apple Watch costing  $349 (£216). There is no launch date for either of the watches, with rumours suggesting the Apple Watch will not be released until February . Aside from music, Will.i.am has a strong background in science and technology. In 2011, Intel named will.i.am as director of creative innovation and his role was to help develop the firm’s range of phones, tablets and laptops. A year later he made history by streaming a song from the surface of Mars in conjunction with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The song was called Reaching for the Stars. The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.","will.i.am's smartwatch will be launched tomorrow in San Francisco .

"It is the most expensive film ever to come out of China and was conceived as a spectacular epic to rival Avatar. But instead of the £130million masterpiece its makers intended, it seems that Empires Of The Deep is destined to be filed alongside other big-budget turkeys such as Battlefield Earth and John Carter. The 3D mermaid movie's U.S. trailer premiered this week and has received a scathing response from critics, who poured scorn on its 'woefully' amateur special effects. Scroll down to watch the trailer . 'Woeful': The U.S. trailer of Empires Of The Deep has received a scathing response from critics . Bond girl Olga Kurylenko stars in the film after she replaced Monica Bellucci, who quit early in the production . Amateur: The film's U.S. trailer premiered this week and was immediately set upon by critics, who poured scorn on its 'woeful' special effects . Kristy Puchko, writing on CinemaBlend.com, commented that its 'live action scenes seem as low-budget as TV's Xena: Warrior Princess, and computer graphics that look like a video game from the early 2000s.' Jack Cunliffe at TheFilmStage.com wrote: 'After some quick banter with actual humans (or possibly mermaids), we get a minute onslaught of some of the worst, potentially insanely entertaining footage of this disaster.' Lead role: Kurylenko at the London premiere of her Bond movie Quantum Of Solace in 2008 . Empires Of The Deep, which its makers describe as 'an unlikely love story between a young human and a mermaid... set in a mythical world', has had a troubled production history. Work on the film, a Chinese-American co-production, began three years ago after the project was bankrolled by Chinese billionaire Jon Jiang, who also wrote the script. The lead role originally went to Italian actress Monica Bellucci, only for her to pull out and be replaced by Bond girl Olga Kurylenko. Similar problems dogged finding a suitable director. The Empire Strikes Back's Irvin Kershner, who died in 2010, was at one point linked to the project as was Catwoman director Pitof. But even Pitof, who has only made one TV movie since his infamous 2004 feline flop, couldn't be persuaded to stick around. Instead, Michael French, who directed 2008's low budget Heart Of The Dragon, saw the film through to competition. Referring to this difficult gestation period, website Twitch headlined its scathing article: 'Three years and $130million later, all we get is Olga Kurylenko with a shell on her head'. Film blog Indiewire even goes as far as to suggest the film will never see a U.S. release, at least not in cinemas. It said: 'With all the money spent, this looks cheap and woefully put together, with the talented Kurylenko left to flounder in cast of nobodies in a silly underseas adventure, with truly shoddy special effects. 'We'll bet money this never sees a proper Stateside release because we can't imagine anyone is going to pay to distribute this thing.' IMDB observed that it is 'a movie that looks like crappy underwater Avatar or a gritty live-action remake of The Little Mermaid'.

"Six-month-old twin girls who were born joined at the abdomen will undergo tissue expansion this month as doctors begin the lengthy process of separating them. Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston at 31 weeks on April 11. The adorable sisters, who remain in the hospital's Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, share a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and heart lining. Now, they are preparing to undergo six-to-eight weeks of tissue expansion to stretch skin that will be used to cover patches of their bodies when they are separated in December. Adorable: Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, pictured with their mother Elysse, weighed just 3lbs 7oz each when they were delivered by Cesarean section at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston on April 11 . Conjoined twins: The adorable sisters, who remain in the hospital's Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, are joined at the abdomen. They share a liver, diaphragm, pelvis, intestines and the lining of the heart . Today, Knatalye and Adeline's mother, Elysse, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous procedure. 'When I think about December I get that sick feeling in my stomach. I want to know how much pain they are going to feel after. What is it going to be like for them?' she told Reuters. 'They are where they should be developmentally. They reach up for toys, they reach out for us when we get close and talk to them.' During the surgery in December, two shifts of teams of pediatric, urological, plastic, orthopedic, cardiac and gynecological surgeons will work to separate the girls. Cared for: The girls (pictured in hospital with their mother) will now undergo six-to-eight weeks of tissue expansion to stretch skin that will be used to cover patches of their bodies when they are separated . Twins: Today, Knatalye and Adeline's mother, Elysse, who spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day, said she felt 'sick' with worry about the long and arduous separation procedure in December . Dr Darrel Cass, pediatric surgeon and co-director of the hospital's Fetal Center, said the separation team will start and the reconstruction team will complete the process. He added: 'The [girls'] intestines appear to be intermingled but there appears to be enough intestines for both children.' After the separation, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk. In 1992, surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital successfully separated one-year-old twins Tiesha and Iesha Turner, who  shared a sternum, liver, entwined intestines and fused organs. Hospital: Dr Darrel Cass, pediatric surgeon and co-director of Texas Children's Hospital's (pictured) Fetal Center, said there 'appears to be enough intestines for both children' to have following the separation . Together: After the procedure, the girls will undergo rehabilitation to learn how to balance, crawl and walk . Conjoined twins occur once every 200,000 births. Around 40 to 60 per cent  arrive stillborn, while 35 per cent live only one day, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Mortality rates for twins who do live and then undergo separation vary, depending on their type of connection and the organs they share, it said. The Mata family's life was turned upside down in January when a routine ultrasound revealed that Mrs Mata was carrying conjoined twins. The family was referred to the hospital's Fetal Center. The expectant mother, her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah relocated from Lubbock to Houston, where the girls were born. Loving family: Mrs Mata, pictured with her husband John and their five-year-old son Azariah, spends at least seven hours at the hospital every day leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school . On a YouCaring page, Mrs Mata said the twin's 20 per cent chance of survival at birth inspired their middle names, Faith and Hope. While the mother spends most of her daily life at the hospital, leaving only when it is time to pick up her son from school, full-time worker Mr Mata spends every weekend with his daughters. Mr Cass said he expects both Knatalye and Adelie to be able to experience independent, happy lives following the surgery. But he added: 'It is likely further reconstructive surgeries may be needed in the future. Perhaps the biggest challenges may be orthopedic and in helping them walk and have normal gait.'","Knatalye Hope and Adeline Faith Mata, aged six months, born April 11 .

"More than 200 schoolgirls seized by jihadi fighters in Nigeria over six months ago could be freed. The country’s military said it has agreed a ceasefire with their captors, terror group Boko Haram, and claimed the girls’ release forms part of the truce. The 276 girls, aged 11 to 18, were abducted from their school in the remote town of Chibok in April, sparking an international effort to track them down. Scroll down for videos . Some of the 200 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram are seen in a video released by the terror group earlier this year. A deal has reportedly been reached to secure the release in a ceasefire agreement . Terrified: Some 276 girls were seized from their dormitories at the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town of Chibok in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria, in April, but dozens managed to escaped . Eight Cameroon soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants have been killed in fighting in the far north of Cameroon, the defence ministry said in a statement read on state radio on Friday. Boko Haram has stepped up cross-border attacks into Cameroon this year as part of its campaign for a de facto Islamist state in northeastern Nigeria. Boko Haram negotiators 'assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well,' Mike Omeri, the government spokesman on the insurgency, told a news conference. Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. There was no immediate word from Boko Haram, which limits its announcements almost exclusively to videos of its leader Abubakar Shekau. It could take days for word to get to its fighters, who are broken into several groups. They include foreigners from neighboring countries Chad, Cameroon and Niger, where the insurgents also have camps. There have been unconfirmed reports that at least some of the girls have been carried across borders, and some forced to marry their captors. A Boko Haram video in May showed two of the girls explaining why they had converted from Christianity to Islam. The chief of defense staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, announced the truce and ordered his troops to immediately comply with the agreement. The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls since they were captured from a boarding school in May . 'Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. 'In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a cease-fire,' Omeri said. He confirmed there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the abducted girls. Another official said the talks took place in neighbouring Chad. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to reporters. Boko Haram was founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf – but it didn’t gain worldwide notoriety until it began a violent insurgency in earnest in 2009. Ultimately, the group wants Nigeria to become an Islamic state. Since mid-2009, it has killed thousands and has destabilised swathes of the northeast of Nigeria, as well as neighbours Cameroon and Niger. Its name means ‘Western education is forbidden’ – and it’s the country’s school system that in the main fuels its anger. But the group has murdered people – including Muslims - for merely speaking out against it. Firefighters and rescuers extinguish a fire at the scene of a bomb blast at Terminus market in the central city of Jos, Nigeria, in May, in one of two explosions blamed on terror group Boko Haram . Yusuf established an Islamic school and mosque, which proved popular with many poor Muslim families. He was killed by Nigerian security forces in 2009, but rather than weaken the group, it re-emerged with increased ferocity under the leadership of Abubakar Shekau. It has bombed churches, barracks and even the UN headquarters and often uses gunmen on the back of motorbikes to ruthless cut down those who criticise it. President Goodluck Jonathan became so alarmed at the chaos the group was spreading that in 2013 he declared a state of emergency in the areas where it was most active – Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. The Nigerian military has been fairly ineffective against the heavily armed group. A lack of investment in training, failure to maintain equipment and dwindling cooperation with Western forces has damaged Nigeria's armed services, while in Boko Haram they face an increasingly well-armed, determined foe. Men look at the wreckage of a car following a bomb blast at St Theresa Catholic Church outside the Nigerian capital Abuja on December 25, 2011 amid spiralling violence blamed on Islamist group Boko Haram . The militants know the military's limitations. A police source said a fighter jet flew over the market town of Gamburu last Monday as a group of gunmen killed at least 125, but the killers didn't flinch, knowing they could not be targeted while scattered in a densely populated area. ‘In a typical unit, Boko Haram has between 300 and 500 fighters. It's not a guerrilla force that you can fight half heartedly,’ said Jacob Zenn, a Boko Haram expert at U.S. counter-terrorism institution CTC Sentinel said in May. ‘It's snowballing. It's getting more weapons, more recruits, their power is increasing every day.’ On February 12 dozens of fighters loyal to Boko Haram attacked a remote military outpost in the Gwoza hills. A security source with knowledge of the assault said they came in Hilux tracks with mounted machine guns and showered the camp with gunfire. Boko Haram's fighters had little cover and were easily picked off - 50 of them died against nine Nigerian troops - but they still managed to make off with the base's entire armoury stockpile of 200 mortar bombs, 50 rocket-propelled grenades and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, the source said. Their ability to dart over the border into Cameroon, whose own security forces have shown little appetite for taking them on, gives the militants an added advantage. Ethnic and religious divisions within the military have also bred some collusion with Boko Haram, sources say. Women protest against the release of the girls kidnapped by Boko Haram fighters. The case of the abducted school girls drew global attention, magnified by a #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign . More than three weeks after the Islamic extremists abducted the girls, the world outrage galvanised Twitter and other social-media networks. The case was not widely followed until #BringBackOurGirls and other hashtags attracted a torrent of attention. More than 2.1million tweets using #BringBackOurGirls were posted within weeks of their abduction, according to Topsy, a site that offers Twitter analytics. Their plight was then magnified when celebrities including Michelle Obama (above) and Angelina Jolie joined up, placing pressure on world leaders to secure their release. Some 276 girls were seized from their dormitories at the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town of Chibok in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria, on the night of April 14. Fifty-seven escaped and Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau later vowed to sell the rest as sex slaves. In the weeks after the kidnapping, Mr Brown, a UN envoy, had led calls for an 'international and domestic response'. Jonathan was criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and for his inability to quell the violence by the terror group, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden.' The Nigerian military has twice claimed its leader Abubakr Shekau had been killed, but Boko Haram later issued video denials. The latest one came earlier this month when he was apparently seen in a video that shows the beheading of a man who identifies himself the pilot of a missing Nigerian Air Force jet . Their plight drew global attention, magnified by a #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign that drew in celebrities including Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie. Earlier this week, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to helping Nigeria find the group while former British prime minister Gordon Brown said the world should not forget the girls' struggle. Their plight drew protests around the world with demands that the military and government get them free.

"The hospital on Ellis Island where thousands of immigrants had their hopes of reaching the United States cut short by tuberculosis and scarlet fever will open in October for tours and an art installation. 1.2million immigrants entered the hospital between 1901 and 1954, heading into the United States if they were healthy enough, dying in the complex if they weren't. 'If you found yourself in this room, you were either too sick to survive or too sick to stay,' tour guide Jessica Cameron-Bush told the Associated Press. 'And this was your last view — the Statue of Liberty.' Unrestored: Organizers decided to test the facility for safety - but not restore it - after Hurricane Sandy hit in order to draw attention to the need to perform upkeep on historic buildings . Aerial: Ellis Island, where millions of immigrants passed on the way into the United States - or were sent back to their home countries - as seen by above. The memorial has been open for years but the hospital is just opening now . The facility is still the biggest ever endeavor of the U.S. Public Health Service, designed to screen out immigrants that were deemed too sick to enter the country and treat those that could be helped. The 29-building complex housed rooms to treat contagious diseases, assess mental conditions and provide obstetric care for pregnant women. It also includes a morgue. Not every person that entered the facility made it out, and 3,500 people died on Ellis Island and a little less than half of them were children. Immigrants were sometimes treated to the injustice of racism, as the mental health examination at the time included eugenics testing, which tested mental capacity through physical measurements. Still, only 1 percent of the immigrants at Ellis were sent back due to health reasons, according to the New York Times, though the threat of deportation terrified many. The hospital was previously home to an exhibit for schoolchildren, but the buildings were partially destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. Frozen: The hospital remains in mostly the same condition it was in back in 1954 before it was closed along with the other immigration facilities on Ellis Island . Abandoned: A volunteer with Save Ellis Island takes a peek at a contagious disease ward (right) where patients hoped to survive and enter the U.S. The nonprofit Save Ellis Island decided to open the facility and give guided tours, which will be offered beginning October 1. Visitors will also see an experimental photo exhibit entitled 'Unframed - Ellis Island,' designed by the French artist JR. Indefinite wait: The morgue in the Ellis Island hospital features stadium-style seating for visiting doctors to come and watch as autopsies were conducted on patients that had died while in the hospital . Attention: A file photo shows an immigrant receive medical attention from a medical official while passing through Ellis Island . Screening: This file photo shows Jewish immigrants being screened after arriving at Ellis Island, with a test in Hebrew hung on the wall . Haunting: The faces of immigrant children look back at visitors to the facility, which will open with the photo exhibit October 1 . Ghostly: A volunteer from Save Ellis Island wanders the halls of the hospital, checking in doorways. The institution was abandoned in 1954 as Ellis Island closed to immigration . Grounds: National Parks Service employee Dennis Mulligan pauses in front of one of French artist JR's wheat-pasted archive photographs, which are designed to fade away with time . Rooms in the hospital have pictures wheat-pasted on walls, doors and windows, archival photos of the institution that show the immigrants who awaited care and the doctors in surgical dress prepared to operate on them. In one room, an immigrant family clinging to a broken glass window looks out onto the Statue of Liberty, just as those receiving care in the facility did a century ago. Screening: Lines of immigrants coming in through Ellis Island await a preliminary health screening, which was administered to decide who needed to be quarantined and treated and who was healthy enough to pass into the United States .

"A dentist is suing a man and a woman for posting a negative review of his business on Yelp. Elise Golbert and her then-husband Jeff Cullen branded Dr Parsa Zedah a 'butcher' and a 'crook' in a 357-word review of the Beverly Hills surgery. Golbert, a professional model, was told she needed $30,000 surgery to align her jawbones if she wanted to eliminate her persistent neck pain. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dispute: Elise Golbert, a professional model, was left with 'monstrous teeth' after her four-part surgert . Review: Her then-husband Jeff Cullen took to review site Yelp to brand Dr Zedah a 'butcher' and a 'crook' But when she emerged, she claimed, she 'had bigger teeth than any man around me'. Infuriated, her husband took to the reviewing site, where millions of people give stores, restaurants, bars, cafes and landmarks a star-rating plus a few comments. Now, four years later, the pair are being sued for libel despite removing the review. However, it comes just weeks after Governor Jerry Brown sanctioned the 'Yelp law', or Assembly Bill 2365, which bans companies from fining customers for online reviews. Angry: Dr Zedah (pictured) is now suing the couple for libel for writing 'false allegations' about him . Upset: This is a shot of Elise after surgery 'with teeth as big as a donkey's' that provoked the review . Dr Zedah insists the review contained lies and false allegations. 'It was nothing other than, 'Folks, this is our experience. Watch out,'' Cullen told ABC7. 'The last thing I need in my life is to have to go to court over something as ridiculous as this. Voice: The law suit comes after California approved the Yelp law banning firms from fining poor reviewers . 'This the First Amendment. This is your right as an American to voice your opinion. I wasn't out to slander,' Cullen said. Golbert is enraged as she claims she had nothing to do with the review. 'I'm not even the one who wrote the Yelp review. I don't know what he's suing me for. I really don't,' Golbert said.","Elise Golbert had $30,000 surgery to align her jawbones four years ago .

"Rwanda is requiring all visitors from the U.S. and Spain to self-monitor, fill out an extensive questionnaire and report their medical condition for the first 21 days over Ebola fears. The order by the Rwanda government was posted on the website of the U.S. Embassy in Rwanda yesterday. It said the Rwandan Ministry of Health had introduced new Ebola Virus Disease screening requirements which required anyone who had been in the two countries during the last 22 days to report their medical condition by phone - regardless of whether they are experiencing symptoms - for the duration of their visit, or for the first 21 days. Rwanda is requiring all visitors from the U.S. and Spain to self-monitor, fill out an extensive questionnaire and report their medical condition for the first three weeks over Ebola fears; both countries have reported deaths from the virus . Rwanda has so far being unaffected by Ebola; it is 2,600 miles east of Liberia - where a burial team is seen above moving the body of a woman suspected to have died from the virus . And that Rwanda continue to deny entry to visitors who travelled to Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, or Sierra Leone within the past 22 days. Rwanda is located about 2,600 miles east of Liberia, the closest of the three West African countries affected by the outbreak, and has so far reported no cases of the virus. The World Health Organisation says more than 4,500 people have died from the current Ebola outbreak, the vast majority of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Both the U.S. and Spain have recorded deaths from Ebola. In Dallas, a Liberian national died of the virus two weeks ago and two nurses who treated him tested positive for the virus. At least two Spanish missionaries died in Spain after contracting the disease in West Africa. One Spanish nurse also tested positive for the virus. The new screening system in Rwanda follows a controversy in New Jersey over the enrolment of two Rwandan children that prompted their parents to keep them at home for 21 days, USA Today reported. Health workers carry the body of a man suspected to have died of Ebola virus in the Paynesville Community situated on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia, yesterday . A nurse at Howard Yocum Elementary School in Maple Shade sent a note to staff members saying that the school intended to take the temperature of the students three times a day for the next three weeks, the normal incubation period for Ebola. Parents of pupils at the school then became aware of the note which later prompted the two Rwandan students' parents to voluntarily keep them at home . Yesterday the school district apologised over the incident and on its website, saying it had 'become the unwitting face of our nations fears with regard to pressing health concerns'. The school said the Rwandan students would start classes next week. In Sierra Leone, up to 20 people are dying and dozens of new cases are being reported every day as the Ebola outbreak there moves west from rural areas toward the capital, Freetown officials said. So many people are succumbing to the deadly virus that removing the dead bodies is becoming a serious problem. Lawmaker Claude Kamanda told the local Politico newspaper that authorities are experiencing challenges collecting corpses from both quarantined and non-quarantined homes. A man suffering from Ebola virus lies on the floor outside a house in Port Loko Community on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone. After emerging months ago in eastern Sierra Leone, Ebola is now hitting the western edges of the country near the capital . Health workers wearing protective clothing collect bodies and try to disinfect houses where Ebola has claimed victims near the Sierra Leone capital . Dozens of people are falling sick each day in western Sierra Leone and the death toll is mounting so quickly authorities are struggling to remove all of the bodies . Authorities say the uncontrolled movement of people from the interior to Waterloo - which is the gateway to Freetown - has fueled the increase of Ebola cases in the west. There are 851 total confirmed Ebola cases in the Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural zones, NERC reported. In terms of numbers of cases, the two western zones may soon surpass a former epicenter of the outbreak in Sierra Leone - the eastern districts of Kenema and Kailahun where there have been a total of 1,012 confirmed cases.","Rwanda has so far reported no cases of Ebola infections .

"A lab manager at University of Pittsburgh has testified that a medical researcher asked her to order potassium cyanide and have it shipped overnight two days before prosecutors claim his wife fell suddenly ill from the poison. Michele Perpetua said from the stand Monday that Dr Robert Ferrante was very specific in his request. 'He said he wanted the best and the purest,' Perpetua said from the stand. Rush order: Dr Robert Ferrante, 66 (left), had high-quality cyanide shipped to his lab just two days before his wife, Autumn Klein (right) ingested the poison . Ferrante, center, is escorted by Allegheny County Sheriffs deputies to court during jury selection October 23 for his trial on homicide charges in the 2013 killing of his neurologist wife . Ferrante is on trial in connection to the April 2013 death of his wife, 41-year-old Dr. Autumn Klein, a neurologist. Investigators say Ferrante, a 66-year-old expert on Lou Gehrig's disease, laced Klein's energy drink with the poison. On Day 4 of the trial, the jury heard from two lab assistants about Ferrante's conduct on the eve of his wife's death. Amanda Mihalik, now a medical student at the University of Florida, had worked in Ferrante's University of Pittsburgh lab and testified Tuesday her boss, whom she described as demanding and difficult to please, 'seemed a little bit different that week' and 'a little bizarre.' Among other things, she saw him mixing substances in a laboratory beaker and drinking them at a sink, a violation of lab policy since no food or drink was supposed to be consumed in the lab. Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini has said investigators believe Ferrante mixed cyanide with the energy supplement creatine, then gave it to his wife late on April 17, 2013, after telling her it would help them conceive a child. The couple had a 6-year-old daughter, but Klein was said to want another because she didn't want the girl to be an only child. Klein fell suddenly ill that night and was dead three days later. According to the prosecution, Ferrante did not want another baby and believed that his wife was having an affair. A lab manager told the jury that Dr Ferrante, picture center last week, asked her to order 'the best and purest' cyanide' claiming that he needed the poison for research . Ferrante (left) allegedly killed his 41-year-old wife, whom he suspected of infidelity, by mixing cyanide with an energy drink called creatine . Another lab assistant had previously testified that Ferrante's overnight order using a university credit card was the first time in six years that cyanide had been seen in the lab, though Mihalik said he was in a meeting in which Ferrante discussed possibly using the poison in his research. Because Lou Gehrig's disease involves the death of neurological cells, Mihalik said cyanide was one substance that was discussed as being used in the lab to simulate cell death in experiments on the cause of the disease. Despite that, there were no such experiments planned that would have required an overnight shipment of the poison, Mihalik said, and she didn't believe any such experiments were likely to be conducted until months later. Police later found three containers of cyanide in Ferrante's lab, one of them leaking. The couple have a six-year-old daughter together, but Ferrante allegedly did not want to have another child . Creatine, a naturally occurring protein building block, was routinely used in the lab. Mihalik said Ferrante mentioned Klein when she saw him with a one-gallon Ziploc bag of creatine just before Klein fell ill. 'He told me he intended to give it to his wife,"" Mihalik said. Police have said they found a similar bag of creatine on the couple's counter, in the kitchen where Klein was stricken. Earlier Tuesday, Klein's mother, Lois, testified that Ferrante seemed composed when she and her husband arrived at the house the morning after her daughter fell ill. But once he saw the Kleins, Ferrante appeared to 'fake' being teary-eyed, Lois Klein said. He also kept the couple at the house about 11 hours before finally taking them to a hospital to seek Klein, who was by then on life support. Lois Klein revealed that her son-in-law was against having an autopsy performed on his wife, TribLive.com reported. ABC News has reported that hours after a police interview following Klein's death, Ferrante allegedly performed a Google search, writing, 'Would ECMO or dialysis remove traces of toxins poisons?' The 66-year-old scientist also allegedly sought information on how to clear one's Google search history after an interview with police. Dr Ferrante has maintained his innocence, claiming that his wife either took her own life, or died from some unknown illness.","Dr. Robert Ferrante, 65, allegedly gave his wife, Dr. Autumn Klein, 41, the drink on April 17, 2013, telling her that it would help her get pregnant .

"Eton is to sponsor a free school to spread its ethos to state education, it revealed yesterday. The college will be the sole private backer of a secondary school aiming to give 500 pupils many of the hallmarks of a public school education for free, including a traditional house system and homework classes on the premises. Boarding will be available for nearly half the pupils, while day students at the non-selective government-funded school will be able to leave in the evening ‘after homework and a sociable supper with school friends’. Opening: Eton College has announced it is to back Holyport College (plans pictured above) - a new state boarding school set to open next year . Plans: How the College Square will look at the new school, which will evetually have 500 students . Restored: The existing palm house, which is to be refurbished as part of the plans for the school . Preparation: The new state-funded school, in Maidenhead, is due to open in September 2014 . A fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes and 21 boarding places will go to youngsters on the verge of being taken into care. The school’s prospectus says: ‘By providing stability, routine and exceptional pastoral care we believe we can turn their lives around and give them an equal chance to succeed in life.’ A further 28 boarders will be funded or part-funded through bursaries and some boarding places will be reserved for military families. The move is a coup for David Cameron and his Education Secretary Michael Gove, who have been wooing leading independent schools in the hope they will ‘share their DNA’ with the state sector through free schools and academies. The new ‘mini-Eton’, to be called Holyport College, will be a mixed school catering for 500 pupils aged from 11 to 18 in the village of Holyport, near Windsor, seven miles from Eton. Sponsor: Eton College, pictured, is set to back a new free school being established in nearby Maidenhead . Reserved: A fifth of places for day pupils will be set aside for children from poor homes .

Inside: An artist's impression of the dining hall at Holyport College, which will take pupils aged 11 to 18 . Eton’s involvement in the new school will be far-reaching, beginning with the appointment of a head teacher. The £32,067-a-year public school – whose old boys include Mr Cameron and 18 other British prime ministers – will also design the curriculum, advise on the boarding facilities, second teachers to Holyport, help pupils with applications to top universities and allow them to share its extensive sports facilities. Mr Gove said: ‘This is an outstanding example of a state-independent education partnership. ‘Eton College’s heritage of distinguished academic and co-curricular excellence will be of benefit to all Holyport’s pupils, and will allow them to enjoy exceptional facilities while attending a free school. Pupils: Princes Harry and William, pictured at Eton with Prince Charles in 2000, are two notable alumni . Prime Ministers: The school has also produced leaders from the Duke of Wellington, left, to David Cameron . Tony Little, Eton’s headmaster, said: . ‘We believe in the vision for Holyport College as a new state boarding . school and see its geographical proximity to Eton as a real opportunity. ‘We have a leading role on the governing body and will help shape the school ready for opening in September 2014. ‘We look forward to sharing a number . of our facilities and activities, and developing educational initiatives . for the benefit of pupils of both colleges.’ The new school’s founders include .

"Fallen: Thomas McGraw was awarded a Purple Heart after he was killed in Vietnam and now - decades after it was lost - it will be returned to his family . A Purple Heart awarded to a soldier who was killed in Vietnam in 1966 will be returned to his family on Tuesday - two decades after it vanished and turned up in an elementary school playground. Private First Class Thomas McGraw was awarded the Purple Heart after his death in an ambush in Vietnam on February 1, 1966, while serving in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. He was just 19. His daughter, Robyn DeCuffa, was just a toddler when he died, and when she turned 18, her mother gave her McGraw's Army medals, the flag that had covered his coffin and a photo album from his military service. 'The medal was really all that I did have from my father,' said DeCuffa, now a 51-year-old mother of eight from Cortland in central New York. But years later, the Purple Heart disappeared while she was living outside Syracuse, where her father grew up. She said someone likely stole the medal, but she wouldn't elaborate. 'It was a part of him I could physically hang on to,' she said. 'It was devastating when it was missing.' Then somehow, in the early 1990s, the Purple Heart was found by Jason Galloway on the playground at his Syracuse elementary school. He handed it in to the front office. Although McGraw's name was engraved on the back, apparently no effort was made to return it to its owner. When school ended for the year, the medal was given back to Jason, who brought it home. Karen Galloway, Jason's mother, said the medal mostly sat in a drawer in the kitchen of her family's home in Liverpool. Every now and then, her husband would search the Internet in an effort to locate McGraw and return the medal, but had no luck finding any information. 'We didn't put tons and tons of effort into it,' she said. Then, last Christmas, the now 34-year-old Jason was visiting from Virginia when his wife saw the medal and asked why the family had it since Jason, an Air Force veteran, hadn't been wounded. Reunited: McGraw's daughter Robyn DeCuffa, pictured left, will receive the medal on Tuesday. It was found by Jason Galloway, pictured right, when he was a boy but his family were unable to find its owners . When she learned how it had been found, Jason's wife said it would be 'cool' to find its owner. Weeks later, she called her mother-in-law to say she had seen a local news story on Purple Hearts Reunited, a Vermont-based organization that returns lost or stolen military medals to veterans or their families. Karen Galloway contacted the founder, Zachariah Fike, who traced the medal's origins and located DeCuffa, a manager for Capital Region Off-Track Betting, and her mother Sarah Dallas, who lives in Mexico, New York. 'It almost feels like a miracle that this is being returned,' said DeCuffa, whose second-oldest son is an Army veteran and whose second-oldest daughter is in the Air Force. Award: The medal (file picture) will be returned during a ceremony outside Syracuse, New York on Tuesday . Fike will return the medal to DeCuffa and Dallas during a ceremony being held at the Cavalry Club, a former National Guard camp-turned-golf club in Manlius, outside Syracuse. She plans to display the award in the center of her living room. More than 150 people are expected to attend, including Dallas, the soldier's widow, as well as Galloway and her husband. 'I'm so excited about it,' Galloway said. 'He lost his life and I think that it's really important that it gets back to his family.'","Pfc Thomas McGraw was killed in an ambush in Vietnam in 1966, aged 19 .

Manifesto: Vader is standing on a platform of promoting e-government and improving financial transparency . In June,  Imperial Stormtrooper characters donated blood to sick children, with one Vader saying: ‘Now Ukrainian children will have some blood from fearless Stormtroopers running in their veins.’ Seven of the Vaders were nominated for parliament by the Internet Party. In April, a man called Darth Vader was rejected in his bid to run for presidency by the country's Electoral Commission. According to the BBC, one official suggested the aspiring candidate’s campaign could have been made in an attempt to mock elections in Ukraine. An opinion poll showed yesterday that President Petro Poroshenko's bloc holds a big lead ahead of the election - while the Radical Party of populist Oleh Lyashko looks set to take second place.","Child  cries after being introduced to impersonator of Star Wars character .

"Last week SpaceX CEO Elon Musk claimed that artificial intelligence was mankind’s biggest threat. So he might not be too happy to hear that a company claims to have given a robot emotions for the first time via a microchip breakthrough. They say their artificially intelligent machine can recognise, emulate and empathise with the eight key emotions in humans. Scroll down for videos . London-based Emoshape has created a cube-shaped device with emotions. Called Emospark it can recognise and emulate the eight primary emotions using facial recognition (shown right in image). These are anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust and joy . Emoshape, based in London and New York, say they have achieved a major technological breakthrough with their EPU (emotional processing unit). This is the cornerstone of their new Emospark product, a small £195 ($315) cube that can recognise and respond to your emotions - and it even has emotions of its own. Using the microchip and a camera, either through your phone or a separate external camera, the cube monitors your facial expressions and works out what you like and don't like. The theory of emotion was devised by Dr Robert Plutchik (21 October 1927 to 29 April 2006), who was a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He suggested there were eight basic primary emotions - anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust and joy - with the concept of emotion applicable to all animals. According to his theory all species have evolved farious emotions over time, some used to help them survive such as fear for ‘fight or flight’. But, he says, all other emotions are derived from these primary eight. Thus, by having a machine recognise the eight basic emotions, it could theoretically replicate all other emotions. For example, when playing particular music it will see if you enjoy it or not. This will help it learn what you might enjoy in future. By syncing up to your phone the cube can then play songs, videos and more back to you if you make a request of it. But being mean or nice to the cube will also elicit a response from it. It is apparently able to emulate the eight so-called primary emotions. These are anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust and joy. In a video the robot is seen responding to particular words and phrases, including insults and compliments. ‘I hate you,’ the robot is told at one point. ‘I’m just trying to help you,’ it responds. The company claims this is the first time that machines have been empowered with the ability to respond to human emotions. Emospark (shown) can replicate emotions and can feel happy or sad. It can also recognise when a human is happy or sad via a camera. This can be either your phone or an external camera bought separately. The cube can play you music or video based on your requests . In a video the robot is seen responding to particular words and phrases, including insults and compliments.‘I hate you,’ the robot is told at one point.‘I’m just trying to help you,’ it responds. IT's central eye looks eerily similar to Hal 9000 from the 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey . Speaking to MailOnline, Olivier Zimmerman from Emoshape says they built the device in order to make machines more like us. 'If we create a robot in the future, we want them to be more like us,' he said. 'We want machines to be more like humans, not humans to be more like machines.' He was not willing to say how the technology works exactly, as he says it is still patent pending. But while the machine can only monitor facial expressions for now, Mr Zimmerman says the company plans to also monitor emotions in a human's voice as well eventually. Emospark runs on Android or iOS and connects to other devices via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The company plans to launch Emospark by Christmas this year. ‘How can any inanimate object interact with humans and learn how to please them without empathy?’ said Patrick Levy Rosenthal, CEO of Emoshape. ‘The EPU advancement represents a step change for the future of technological goods such as smartphones, computers, toys, medicine, finance and robotics.’ Speaking to MailOnline, Olivier Zimmerman from Emoshape says they built the device in order to make machines more like us. 'If we create a robot in the future, we want them to be more like us,' he said.

"A girl born with a curved spine spent years defying expectations to become a model - before finally giving it up after realising focusing on looks is superficial. Ayesha Jones, 24, suffers from scoliosis and was told by her doctor she would be a 'pretty girl with an ugly back' without invasive surgery. But Ms Jones, from Birmingham, decided to prove the doctor wrong by working hard to become a successful model without undergoing the risky operation to correct her spine. Scroll down for video . Ayesha Jones, 24, suffers from scoliosis - which makes her spine curved (left) - and gave up a successful modelling career (right) to become a visual artist after realising 'beauty comes from within' Ms Jones was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 13. She was advised to have an invasive operation to put a metal rod into her back, but opted for more holistic treatments such as back exercises . Though she was working as a model, one designer turned away Ms Jones even though she had travelled miles down to London, because he said her back was unsightly . However, when a designer brutally made her leave a photo shoot because he thought her back was unsightly, Ms Jones quit modelling to become a visual artist. She realised that focusing on superficial looks is not healthy, and through her art and photography, wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it's OK to have a curved back. Ms Jones said: 'Looking back, modelling was a way to prove that I was beautiful. I didn't want the doctor's remarks to come true. 'I worked my socks off to become a model and put all my efforts into proving that, in spite of my back, I was just as hot as everyone else. 'But I came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy, I'm good. 'I want to inspire other young women to do something meaningful rather than just want to look attractive for a living.' When Ms Jones was diagnosed with scoliosis at age 13, when on holiday in Saint Kitts in the West Indies, her mother noticed her right shoulder blade was poking out more than the left from the back. When she finally had the spinal fusion operation at age 21 it was because her back had become painful, not for cosmetic reasons . Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not handing properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children could of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain. Source: NHS Choices . After the diagnosis was confirmed back in the UK, doctors told her she would need a 'spinal fusion' - a major operation to put a metal rod in her back. She said: 'When I was diagnosed with scoliosis, the doctor was quite forceful and patronising and wanted me to have the 'spinal fusion' surgery. 'But it didn't feel right putting my body through such an invasive procedure. I was still growing and it just didn't feel like the right time to be having spinal fusion. 'Also, the pain had not set in yet and my scoliosis was only a cosmetic issue for me. 'But the doctor told me that if I didn't have the surgery I would be ""a pretty girl with an ugly back"". I was hurt but replied: ""No, it's not going to be ugly, it's just going to be different"". 'From that point on, I was determined not to give up. After the mean comment my doctor had made, I wanted to go and prove that I could make it as a model. 'And I wanted to try as many holistic things as I could, like exercise and therapy, to manage my condition.' In 2003, Ms Jones went to the annual Clothes Show in Birmingham and was scouted by a top modelling agency. She said: 'I went to the call back at the modelling agency's London offices and naively told them about my curved back. 'I heard them talking about me and expressing concern about my poking shoulder and I never heard back from them. Ms Jones went back to university to study photography. In one of her projects she examined her struggle with her physical appearance . Through her art and photography, she wants to show other scoliosis sufferers it's OK to have a curved back . After giving up modelling, Ms Jones is now working as a visual artist and is now working with Scoliosis Association UK to inspire other sufferers that it's OK to have a curved spine . 'After that, I would keep getting scouted by top modelling agencies and then rejected by agencies because of my back.' Desperate to be considered beautiful, she began practising poses which hid her curved spine. She said: 'I still wanted to prove the doctor wrong and I didn't want to become the 'pretty girl with the ugly back'. 'I became good at hiding my scoliosis. I learnt to pose in such a way that would make the most of my asymmetrical body. Looking back at those pictures, I was actually a magician! 'I began networking and started getting paid work all without a modelling agency. I was modelling in music videos with some big UK music artists and was modelling swimwear, too. 'It felt like I was finally sticking two fingers up to everyone who doubted me.' But at age 19, Ms Jones travelled miles for a modelling shoot but was turned because a photographer considered her back unsightly. She said: 'I had travelled all the way from Birmingham to London on my own for a shoot and the photographer sent me home without paying me, all because he didn't like the look of my back. 'I came to realise over time that my body is my shell and as long as it is healthy, I'm good' she said . 'They liked the look of my photographs when you couldn't see my shoulder poking out, but when they saw me in person, they were unwilling to give me a chance. It broke my heart.' She realised her focus on looks and determination to be considered attractive was unhealthy. She said: 'I realised that I had placed way too much importance on my looks and finally, I could see what really mattered in life. 'There was no point in modelling for me. What was the point in having nice pictures of myself in which I looked nothing like how I do in reality? 'I decided that I wanted to inspire people and do something meaningful with my time on this planet. Modelling didn't give me that.' Ms Jones went on to study photography at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston, and become a full-time freelance visual artist. She has worked with the charity Scoliosis Association (UK) to create images for publication and is putting on an exhibition for international Scoliosis awareness month next June. She has also published a book of her self-portraits entitled 'Imperfection', which examines her struggle with her physical appearance and identity as a woman. When Ms Jones eventually decided to have the 'spinal fusion' surgery at age 21, it was because her back had become painful, rather than solely for cosmetic reasons. She explained: 'I want whatever photography work I do to show that we are all beautiful exactly the way we are. Don't believe the adverts when they tell you that you need to change to be accepted. 'Scoliosis made me take the focus off my body and into myself. Once I accepted that I couldn't alter my body, I felt a lot happier in who I was. I hope I can help other scoliosis sufferers in some way.' For information on Ms Jones' work visit her website.

"Gone are the days of the dreaded head lice nit comb, as a new lotion has been developed to kill off the pests in a single 10 minute application. While existing treatments need multiple applications to rid the parasites plus time-consuming combing of the hair to remove their eggs, Xeglyze lotion offers a simpler solution. The new treatment, developed by an Australian pharmaceutical company, has gone through final clinical trials in the US Food and Drug Administration with results showing that 81.5 per cent of subjects were free of lice after the one dose without nit combing. A new lotion has been developed to kill off head lice in a single 10 minute application without the need for a nit comb for the eggs . There were 704 subjects who had lice infestations as part of the US clinical study trial for Xeglyze lotion . Hatchtech CEO Hugh Alsop says this will be welcoming news for any parent who's spent hours nit combing their child's hair following multiple lice treatments. Chief executive of Australian pharmaceutical company Hatchtech, Hugh Alsop . 'When we tell parents they can clear head lice in a single treatment they get very excited,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Alsop says the lotion is different to others as it treats both eggs and the lice, which is why the repeat application and combing are not required. He says there is a need for novel treatments given that head lice have developed resistance to many existing products. Xeglyze lotion, which commenced testing and development in 2005, uses a different method with no known resistance. This involves a treatment which hardens the outer skeletons of the lice and eggs so that they die when they're unable to discard their skin. The trial tested 704 subjects, who all had an active head lice infestation aged six months and older, across 14 clinical study sites in the US. The results were assessed after one, seven and 14 days with no reports of serious reactions. Mr Alsop says there are plans to submit a new drug application with FDA in the first half of 2015 and the treatment is expected to be sold in pharmacies in early 2016.","Xeglyze lotion has gone through final clinical trials in the US Food and Drug Administration .

"The leader of a labor union that represents 12,000 U.S. immigration officials launched a frontal assault against the White House on Tuesday, asking Americans to oppose what he said is a plan to unilaterally open the door to a flood of new immigrants after the Nov. 4 election. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, warned in a rare public policy statement that America's immigration tensions are 'about to get exponentially worse – and more dangerous' if the federal government expands, as expected, the numbers of green cards and work permits it issues to foreign nationals. President Barack Obama has promised to make a move on immigration policy this year, but his timetable and mechanics are a popular Washington, D.C. guessing game whose ramifications touch on next week's election and the possibility of a December budget stalemate that could shut down the federal government. Palinkas warned Tuesday, however, that the state of play – and his army of paper-pushers – are working in the president's favor. 'We are still the world's rubber-stamp for entry into the United States – regardless of the ramifications of the constant violations to the Immigration and Nationality Act,' Palinkas said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE UNION'S MESSAGE . US Citizenship and Immigration Services officials are in charge of issuing documents to immigrants – a task their union chief fears will grow by orders of magnitude if President Obama makes good on his promises . The fate of border-crossers and other illegal immigrants in the US – 11 million of them at least – hangs in the balance as the president mulls his political options . His union's members, all of whom work for the Department of Homeland Security, staff 223 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field offices around the world where visa applications and asylum requests are processed and citizenship decisions are rendered. Their union is a bargaining unit of the American Federation of Government Employees, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. 'Whether it's the failure to uphold the public charge laws, the abuse of our asylum procedures, the admission of Islamist radicals, or visas for health risks,' he said, public safety is already 'being endangered on a daily basis.' Palinkas is known inside the beltway as a consistent thorn in the side of Democrats who want to expand work-visa programs and create new guest worker designations, both of which were part of a Senate immigration reform proposal that stalled in the House of Representatives last year. The bill, which the White House shepherded through the Senate with the help of a 'Gang of Eight' lawmakers – four Democrats and four Republicans – would have attached those conditions to the GOP's demands for more border security. It would also have put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship. When the House adjourns on December 12, that legislation will be a dead letter. But Obama has pledged to take action on his own if the Capitol Hill stalemate persists. Part of that action may have been spelled out in a draft proposal published this month, which spelled out USCIS's intention to purchase the paper stock required to produce as many as 34 million new documents – a combination of work permits and 'green cards,' the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the United States. According to the solicitation, the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum of 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages. The company that wins the contract must be equipped to handle a 'potential ""surge"" in ... demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements,' it reads. Palinkas said Tuesday that his union members are already seeing an increase in the numbers of interviews they are expected to complete, putting national security at risk. 34 MILLION new cards: USCIS has drafted a solicition for bids to sell the government enough raw materials to produce 34 million new green cards and work permits, including a 'surge' of 9 million in the early days after a government policy shift . 'There are plans,' he warned, 'to waive interviews of applicants who seek adjustment of their status in the U.S. to ready our workforce for the coming onslaught of applications unforeseen in previous administrations.' Americans, he said, should 'act now to ensure that Congress stops this unilateral amnesty. Let your voice be heard and spread the word to your neighbors.' 'We who serve in our nation's immigration agencies are pleading for your help – don't let this happen.' It's unclear what Republicans could do to counter the White House if the president decided to create new paperwork options for millions of people to emigrate to the U.S. It's likely they will take over the U.S. Senate in January, but Obama would be signing any executive order against the backdrop of a lame-duck session of Congress in which Democrats would retain temporary control. It's also possible that Senate races in Georgia or Louisiana could go to runoffs, leaving the Senate gavel up in the air while Obama readies his signature. If Republicans do secure 51 or more Senate seats on Election Day, they will hold most – but not all – the cards. The latest congressional budget resolution kept the government's bills paid through December 11, a date that the president could hold over the GOP's head in order to win immigration concessions. Two political analysts, one who works with Democrats and another who services Republican clients, agreed in background conversations with MailOnline that the White House will likely use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage, even if the Democrats have already been demoted to a Senate minority. Republicans will need an uncharacteristic show of party unity, the two analysts agreed. A little busy with Ebola: Obama (right) originally said he would act on immigration by the end of the summer, but that deadline has now become an end-of-year mandate . Major constituency: Immigrants' rights groups are a large part of the Democratic Party, a faction the president can't afford to string along forever as the GOP grooms new Hispanic candidates to take the national spotlight . 'The White House is really counting on disarray in the GOP,' the Democratic operative said. 'This is the gang that couldn't shoot straight, and the president is waiting for them to squabble their way to chaos. Who's against ""amnesty""? Who's part of the Gang of Eight? Who's in bed with the business lobby that wants cheap labor? Obama's team thinks they'll get what they want because no one will be able to stand in a straight line on the other side.' Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, told party activists during a conference call on Monday that the GOP establishment is moving to the right and embracing the tea party's position. 'It's unconstitutional, illegal, and we don’t support it,' Priebus said of an executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, according to Breitbart.com. 'I don’t support it. It is wrong,' Priebus said. 'It is un-American for a president to try and do such a thing. I want to make it clear: There is no part of me, there is not a molecule in my body that agrees with the president on executive amnesty.' A Republican campaign adviser told MailOnline that Obama will have to 'lick his wounds and take this one in the teeth if the Democrats lose the Senate. He's just not going to antagonize the majorities of both houses of Congress with a massive immigration executive order.' 'He has two years left in office, and he's going to have to learn how to cross the aisle,' the operative said. 'If he does this amnesty thing, no one on Capitol Hill takes his phone calls and his legacy goes to pieces.'","National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council president represents 12,000 US Citizenship and Immigration Service personnel .

"Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc. is snuffing out smoking in its offices and buildings in Winston-Salem, Pennsylvania. The nation's second-biggest tobacco company informed employees Wednesday that beginning next year, the use of traditional cigarettes, cigars or pipes will no longer be permitted at employee desks or offices, conference rooms, hallways and elevators. Lighting up already is prohibited on factory floors and in cafeterias and fitness centers. Kick the habit, Joe Camel: Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American has banned the use of traditional cigarettes, cigars or pipes in the workplace . Banned: Lighting up already is prohibited on factory floors and in cafeterias and fitness centers at Reynolds headquarters in Winston-Salem, Pennsylvania . Old school: L. Joe Inman, then-vice president manufacturing of RJ Reynolds, holds a lit cigarette while talking about the tobacco industry during a plant tour of the facility in Tobaccoville North Carolina in 1998 . The no-smoking policy will go into effect once Reynolds builds indoor smoking areas for those still wanting to light up indoors, spokesman David Howard said. 'We believe it's the right thing to do and the right time to do it because updating our tobacco use policies will better accommodate both non-smokers and smokers who work in and visit our facilities,' Howard said. 'We're just better aligning our tobacco use policies with the realities of what you're seeing in society today.' While Reynolds will no longer allow smoking, it will allow the use of smokeless tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, moist snuff and pouches of finely milled tobacco called snus. The company also will allow the use of Eclipse, a cigarette made by Reynolds that uses a carbon tip that heats tobacco after being lit by a lighter. First released in the mid-1990s, Eclipse is in limited distribution and one of the top-selling brands in the cafeteria at the company's Winston-Salem, North Carolina, headquarters. The percentage of Reynolds' 5,200 employees that smoke is in line with the smoking rate in the U.S. That is about 18 per cent of adults, according to the federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Through its subsidiaries, Reynolds American also makes Pall Mall cigarettes, Grizzly smokeless tobacco and Vuse-branded electronic cigarettes.

"A New York  couple decided against a fancy wedding and tropical honeymoon and have opted instead to spend the last two years traveling from state to state performing random acts of kindness. Mark and Ismini Svensson of Orangeburg are going to all 50 states, in fact, as they help the sick, homeless and disadvantaged in some small but meaningful way. The couple have thus far made their journey car, train, bus and plane. They've fittingly dubbed it '50 acts of giving back.' Helping out: A New York State couple have spent the last two years going state to state in order to do a good deed in each . Keeping it simple: Mark and Ismini Svensson of Orangeburg, New York have been on the road for two years. They decided to forego a fancy wedding in order to bankroll their helping of others . 'We both realized what really made us happy was helping people in need,' Ismini Svensson told CNN. Mrs. Svensson's father helped to inspire the trip. He died suddenly while attending a charity event. In between visiting a lonely terminal cancer patient in a North Carolina hospital and helping out at the Humane Society in Pensacola among their other acts, the couple have started a family. Their 16-month-old daughter has hit the road with them as they finish out the journey. StayUNITED: The Svenssons have become so popular that fans have sent them money. They've always planned to pay their own way, so they used the money to start their own non-profit .

He died suddenly while attending a charity funcion . 'The message is everyone can do something to make a difference, even in their own communities, even if it's a compliment to someone,' Mark said. 'You never know the impact it may have on another person' The couple's most memorable moment was visiting this dying woman's hospital room in North Carolina. She told them she'd been praying for a miracle before they showed up with flowers and gifts . The Svenssons always intended to foot the bill for their own trip, but the cause has won them many fans who can't help but send a helpful donation their way. So the couple put the money to good use by starting their own non-profit. Called Stay United, the organization is geared toward helping children in Svensson's native New York. 'The message is everyone can do something to make a difference, even in their own communities, even if it's a compliment to someone,' Mark told CNN. 'You never know the impact it may have on another person.' So what's up next for the couple? They have just a few more stops in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest to go. Then it's off to Alaska before their journey culminates in sunny Hawaii. What's next: The couple is almost done with their journey. They're moving on toward final destinations in the Midwest and Pacific Northwest before going to Alaska and, finally, Hawaii .","Mark and Ismini Svensson of Orangeburg, New York have been on the road for two years .

"A policeman accidentally sprayed eight children as young as four with pepper spray during a bungled classroom display. The officer was supposed to be using a mock canister filled with water - but instead performed the demonstration with a genuine version - spreading the potent chemical around the room. Police have been forced to issue an embarrassing apology for the incident, which took place at school called Ysgol Gymraeg Gilfach Fargoed, in Caerphilly, Wales, on Wednesday. Shocked: Councillor Tudor Davies, who represents the town of Bargoed on Caerphilly council said: 'I'm amazed. As far as I'm concerned, this needs to be investigated. You don't pepper spray children at the end of the day' The eight spray victims, all aged four and five, suffered from the effects at the time but are said to be fine now. Councillor Tudor Davies, who represents the town of Bargoed on Caerphilly council, said: 'I'm amazed. As far as I'm concerned, this needs to be investigated. You don't pepper spray children at the end of the day.' Yesterday parents also expressed their concerns over the shocking blunder. One mother, who did not want to be named, said: 'My son was in the class when the pepper spray was released. We had a phone call from the school to say it had happened. Careless: Eight primary school children, all aged four and five, were left feeling the affects of the PAVA spray . 'I'm not happy about it but at the same time, it seems to be a genuine mistake. She has been monitoring her son for any problems and said she will continue to do so over the next few days. A spokesman for Gwent Police said: 'On Wednesday, a schools liaison officer was delivering a lesson to pupils at Ysgol Gymraeg Gilfach Fargoed. 'As part of the lesson, equipment that police officers use is demonstrated. This included a mock PAVA spray, which is usually filled with water, genuine PAVA sprays are not taken into schools. The active ingredient in pepper spray is capsaicin - a chemical derived from the fruit of plants including chilies. Mixed with other chemicals in a compound - the device is designed to irritate the eyes, causing tears, pain, and temporary blindness. It can also cause breathing difficulties. Although considered a less-than-lethal agent, in rare cases it has been deadly. 'On this occasion a genuine PAVA spray was picked up in error, therefore, whilst undertaking the lesson and demonstrating the equipment, the spray was discharged in the classroom. 'This resulted in eight pupils, aged four and five, being affected by PAVA spray. 'The pupils were cared for by school staff, and their parents were informed. Parents were contacted by a senior officer to explain what happened, discuss any concerns and offer our sincere apologies. 'Medical treatment wasn't required on the day; however, parents were advised to seek medical attention if they had any concerns. 'Further inquiries into the error are now being undertaken, and a result of the incident school liaison officers will no longer be taking any demonstration (mock) PAVA spray into schools.' A spokesman for Caerphilly council and YG Gilfach Fargoed said: 'This was obviously an unfortunate accident and we gather that Gwent Police are undertaking their own investigation. Embarrassing: Gwent Police apologised for the incident and said 'further inquiries into the error are now being undertaken' 'Our main priority was the health and welfare of the children and swift steps were taken to ensure the pupils were removed from the classroom.' News of the shocking incident comes the day after police admitted to another demonstration blunder which left a seven-year-old girl with facial injuries. The girl was hurt when an armed police officer accidentally fired a gun during a demonstration for winners of a colouring competition. The incident, which left the girl with a minor injury to her lip, happened at Nottinghamshire Police's headquarters while a group of children and parents were being shown around the building in the Arnold area of the city. The weapon was fired during a lunchtime visit on October 30 but the police force only made a public statement yesterday after details of the incident were leaked.

"Kai Lambe, from Hatton, Derbyshire slipped into the weir at Tutbury Mill and got into difficulty . A nine-year-old boy drowned in a weir trying to save his friend, an inquest has heard. Schoolboy Kai Lambe slid down a fish pass which runs over the weir when he saw a friend struggling against the current. But Kai, who was a weak swimmer, then found himself in trouble in the 6ft deep water and could not be saved. Kai, from Hatton, in Derbyshire, had been playing with three friends next to the River Dove, near Tutbury, on August 22. Although some of the boys had entered the water, investigators do not believe Kai went in until he saw his friend, Connor, was struggling. The boys frantically tried to get to Kai, who was seen waving for help before disappearing beneath the surface. A dog walker then raised the alarm, dialling 999. He was rescued from the water by the Staffordshire fire service and taken to Queen's Hospital in Burton where he  died. Detective Sergeant Kerry Shaw, of Staffordshire Police, told the hearing at Burton Town Hall: 'We came to the conclusion Kai entered the water after seeing his friend getting into trouble. 'He was seen to struggle and it becomes apparent he is in danger. It is fair to say the panic among the children set in.' Coroner Andrew Haigh concluded Kai was just a 'happy-go-lucky little lad having fun' before tragedy struck. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'Over the years it has been common for young people visiting this location to go swimming and indeed go down the fish pass, which has been used as a slide for generations too. 'I do accept Kai goes to do this; there is no evidence any improper force or pressure that encouraged him but I accept the circumstances are unclear. 'Kai was not a swimmer, he was described as being a very weak swimmer. The height of the water varies greatly. Where Kai was found it was at least 6ft.' Kai died after falling into a weir on the River Dove in Staffordshire, in the water near Tutbury Mill (pictured) Although some of the boys had entered the water, investigators do not believe Kai went in until he saw his friend, Connor, was struggling . At the hearing, Derbyshire police faced criticism for the way the emergency call was dealt with, when it emerged time was wasted as the call was passed over to Staffordshire police. When the 999 call was made by a dog walker, it was directed to the force in Derbyshire. The call handler then took the decision to hand it over to the neighbouring county as the incident took place in Staffordshire. Coroner Andrew Haigh said officers should have been sent immediately before worrying about which force was responsible. He said he would be filing a report with Derbyshire Police  to avoid any similar incidents in the future. Inspector Darren Abbott defended the call handler, saying his actions were ‘standard practice’ but agreed with Mr Haigh that officers should have been sent to the scene right away. Mr Haigh said: 'A report comes in that a child may be drowning in an emergency situation and you are aware somebody is calling from the border, wouldn’t it be appropriate to send officers immediately?' Inspector Abbott responded: 'In this case I agree with you.' Kai Lambe, pictured here with his mother Dawn, was playing with three children at the weir, around half a mile from his home in Hatton, Derbyshire, on August 22, when he fell in to the river . Villagers in Hatton were left stunned by Kai's death, with hundreds of people turning out for his funeral last month. St Mary's Church, in Marston on Dove, Derbyshire, could not contain the large number of people who had turned out to say goodbye and so speakers were placed outside to broadcast the service. In a statement following the tragedy, his family said: 'Kai was a happy, outgoing and lovely little boy. We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of our vibrant, happy, bubbly little man, Kai Joseph, 'ginge' to all who knew him. 'He was our ray of sunshine who brightened up the darkest day. We, as a family, are overwhelmed with the support of everyone in the close-knit village of Hatton and from people afar. 'He was always out and about, whether it was fishing, taking his beloved dogs for a walk with his dad or just in the village. He would smile and put his thumb up to everyone. 'He was a much-loved son of Dawn and Ali, little brother of Ellie-May and Tom, grandson, uncle, nephew, cousin and loved by many. RIP wee man.'","Kai Lambe, nine, drowned in a Staffordshire weir trying to save his friend .

"A married couple have been sentenced life behind bars by a Filipino court for creating 'crush' videos, where animals are killed for sexual fetishisation. Dorma and Vicente Ridon, both 54, were convicted on Monday of human trafficking, cruelty to animals, child abuse and violating wildlife protection laws. However, Vicente 'Vic' Ridon told the regional court in the northern Philippines province of La Union that his customer and 'director' of the videos was an Australian man known to him as 'Mick Tanks' or 'Michael Clark', whom he met playing online video games in 2007.

Later he sent the video equipment and a courier to pick up the tape, the court was told. Some scripts called for women to be videoed butchering dogs, others to stretch apart snakes. One actor was a girl aged 12. The man sent $100-$200 in payment and the enterprise continued for about a year, until he wanted a woman to appear naked, the court heard. The case was pursued by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in a year-long investigation. While the conviction can still be appealed, PETA says the verdict is a victory for Philippine law enforcement and anti-cruelty campaigners. 'The Ridons' sentences are a warning to anyone involved in the vile 'crush' video industry: there are grave consequences to harming animals,' PETA Asia vice president Jason Baker said. PETA says it will now turn its focus to pursuing the Australian man and people who bought the crush videos.","Dorma and Vicente Ridon were convicted of human trafficking, cruelty to animals, child abuse and violating wildlife protection laws .

"Kellie Maloney, 61, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney, shocked the sports world - and her family  - when she announced that she had embarked on a new life as a woman. But the news, as well as her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, led to greater understanding of their father from her estranged daughters - so much so, that they now want her back in their lives on a daily basis after a two-year rift. Today she spoke to Lorraine Kelly with her 19-year-old daughter Sophie about the impact the news had on their family, as she prepares for her final operations next year. Scroll down for video . By her side: Ex-boxing promoter Kellie hit the headlines in August when she announced she was having a sex change from Frank to Kellie. Today she spoke to Lorraine for the first time with her 19-year-old daughter Sophie about the impact the news had . Kellie recently told the Sunday Mirror that being on Celebrity Big Brother after nearly two years of living alone and as a recluse from her family was a tremendously positive thing. Speaking to Lorraine about starring on the reality TV show, she said: 'I think it's helped me, it's just thrown me into the world. I had time to sit back and think about it. 'I've just had to get on with it and that's what helped me and other transgender people.'

On air: Speaking about whether she had an inkling of her father's woes, Sophie, 19, said: 'I knew that she was unhappy, very angry and upset a lot but I had no idea why' Opening up: Speaking about her father's news, Sophie said: 'I much prefer Kellie,'  before explaining that she still calls Kellie 'dad' Research: Sophie said that when she found out the news, she and her sister spoke about it for ages and looked it up and tried to figure it out . Opening up about how being on the show helped bring her daughters back into her life, she said: 'My family, they are the most important people. 'Without being rude, if the public hadn't accepted me, I could've got through that but if my family rejected me, that would've been the hardest thing to get through. 'Thankfully my three daughters, granddaughters and some of my nieces and nephews, my aunts, have been fantastic.' Speaking about whether she had an inkling of her father's woes,  Sophie, 19, said: 'I knew that she was unhappy, very angry and upset a lot but I had no idea why.'

'I said to them, I'm always going to be your dad so if you want to, call me dad,' added Kellie. 'It doesn't really matter.' Sharing her plans, Kellie revealed that she's having surgery in Belgium in November to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said. 'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.' She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly. 'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.' Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people. She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked.

"The woman at the centre of Kurtley Beale’s latest scandals is currently on ‘heavily medication’, according to Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie. The Australian team’s former business manager, Di Patston resigned from her role as Wallabies business manager on Friday ‘due to stress’. Controversial rugby star Kurtley Beale could potentially be sacked this week, as the Integrity Unit continue their investigation into two separate incidents involving Ms Patston. Last week, Ms Patston notified the Wallabies' integrity unit about sexually explicit texts sent by Beale in June, which ridiculed the team's only female official. Beale was already being investigated after allegedly verbally abusing Ms Patston on a team flight from South Africa to South America last month. At a media press conference on Tuesday afternoon, McKenzie opened up about the distress Ms Patston is experiencing , as well as the responsibility he feels for her current predicament. Scroll down for video . Di Patson, left, was copied into a message sent by Kurtley Beale in June and has become subject of an ARU investigation . At a press conference on Tuesday, Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie revealed Ms Patston is currently on 'heavy medication' as she struggles to deal with the fallout after her altercations with Kurtley Beale . That move came while the ARU was considering disciplinary action against Beale after a mid-air row with Patston as the Wallabies travelled from South Africa to Argentina for their final Rugby Championship test. Local media have since focused on Patston's work history, casting doubts over her qualifications and questioning the ARU's due diligence in their hiring. McKenzie, who was moved to deny having had an 'intimate relationship' with Patston in an extraordinary media conference last week, defended her again on Tuesday and revealed the extent of her turmoil. Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds . 'I've got a former staff member out there who is heavily medicated, without a job and without job prospects,' he said. 'She did an outstanding job for me for a long period of time and made a massive contribution,' said McKenzie. 'But now (Di's) suddenly out there on the outer and under massive pressure.' Wallabies inside centre Christian Leali'ifano has also come out in support of Ms Patston, explaining that her resignation feels like 'losing a mother'. 'I sort of treated her as a mother and she was the same to me and she was like my sounding board if I had any troubles,' Leali'ifano said, according to SMH. Wallabies player Christian Leali'ifano has spoken out in support of Patston, explaining that her resignation 'feels like losing a mother' 'I can't fault anything she has done for the team. 'She worked countless hours and I was always going over to her and telling her to take a break but she always had things on to make this team better.' Ms Patston was reportedly recruited to her position with the Wallabies by McKenzie, after working as McKenzie's personal assistant whilst he was the coach of Queensland Reds. During the press conference, McKenzie explained he had a responsibility to ensure Ms Patston's wellbeing whilst working with the Wallabies, after bringing her. 'When you employ someone you bring them into that environment. But then when that environment then cast them out…' he said. 'I do feel responsible for her welfare so I can't then not take that responsibility.' 'She's out there on her own and it's a difficult place to be.' Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early . McKenzie also indicated that he is currently more concerned about Ms Patston's future than he is about his own, as he faces speculation that he will be outsted as Wallabies' coach. 'If you google (Di's) name it'll be difficult for her to get a job so I think it's been a really difficult time. 'The speculation about my job probably isn't front of mind for me. 'There's a lot of other issues going on at the moment and I like to make sure that I'm attending to things that are important. 'I monitor her welfare.' Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked. 'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.' The scandal has completely overshadowed the Wallabies' preparations for their third and final Bledisloe Cup test against world champions New Zealand in Brisbane on Saturday. Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina .","Wallabies coach told press conference Di Patston is on 'heavy medication'

"She has wowed the X Factor judges with her incredible voice and unconventional style but according to Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, 23, the latter has come at a price. The X Factor finalist is to appear in a new Channel 5 documentary in which she confesses to being a shopaholic and to running up huge bills in order to amass her designer wardrobe. Chloe-Jasmine, whose jazz version of Britney Spears' Toxic on Saturday night, was enough to see her through the first round of the X Factor, says she could quite happily shop all day and spends 80 per cent of her income on clothes. Scroll down for videos . Passion for spending: X Factor finalist Chloe-Jasmine Whichello has confessed to being a shopaholic . So marked is her obsession with fashion, her London flat overflows with items that are yet to see the light of day - as does her parents' Somerset home. 'I absolutely adore shopping,' explains the X Factor finalist. 'I’ve really developed a taste for style and an appreciation of fine tailoring and materials. 'In a dream world, I would shop at Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Givenchy. I love J Mendel, and anything from the Harrods international designer showroom is insanity. 'I love pieces that are works of art, that are beautifully crafted, that are bespoke, that are gorgeous, like pieces of music almost.' The would-be singer, who claims that being on the X Factor is 'my dream', also spoke of her love for modelling, waxing lyrical about getting to dress up for a living and meet big name designers. Plenty to choose from: Chloe-Jasmine has so many clothes, her London flat is practically 'overflowing' Splashing the cash: Chloe-Jasmine spends 80 per cent of her income on her wardrobe of designer clothes . 'As a model, I am so surrounded by clothes and fashion and style, and encounter so many different outfit changes a day,' she added. 'I get such a buzz out of working as well. It’s essentially dressing up, it’s quite a cool occupation. In my job you get to meet the designers working and grafting to create this fantastic item which is so inspirational to us mere mortals.' But her close encounter with the world of fashion has had a deleterious effect on her bank balance, with Ms Whichello admitting that she spends up to 80 per cent of her earnings on clothes. 'Having worked in the fashion industry for about seven years or so, I've become accustomed to being surrounded by beautiful things,' she explains. 'I can be in one store looking for the perfect thing for up to two-and-a-half hours. I would say that around 80 per cent of the money I earn goes on clothes. 'The vast majority of what I do earn, it goes on clothes. I’m not going to lie about that. I mean, obviously a girl has to eat. Big impression: The X Factor judging panel was left  impressed with her performance on Saturday night . Expensive tastes: Chloe-Jasmine says her dream wardrobe would include lashings of Dior and Chanel . 'But I would rather not get a cab, and walk, and put that money aside for an incredible dress. I could quite happily shop every day, it just depends on how hard I work. It’s like a motivation for me to earn money really.' Ms Whichello has proved one of this year's most controversial X Factor contestants, with allegations of nude photos and being significantly less well-spoken than she claims dogging her footsteps. Nevertheless, she has consistently impressed the judges, among them Simon Cowell who on Saturday said that he thought she was 'a sweet girl but ditzy'. She has also won plaudits for her fashion choices, most recently the silver beaded flapper dress by high street brand Quiz worn for her appearance on Saturday night's show. No surprise then, that Ms Whichello says making a big impression is all part of her act. 'You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and clothes maketh the man,' she explains. 'The feeling when you walk into a shop, and it’s just filled with this abundance of fabulous attire, is inexplicable almost. High hopes: Chloe-Jasmine hopes to make her singing dreams come true via her appearance on the X-Factor . 'It’s like a crazy rush. And everything negative just melts away. It’s like a transportation down the rabbit-hole, you feel like Alice in this crazy wonderland.' And despite rumours of topless photos and orgies doing the rounds, Ms Whichello says the thing that really gets her heart racing is finding a stunning (and stunningly expensive) pair of shoes. 'It gets my heart rate up,' she admits. 'It’s quite frightening. I really do believe that shopping has some kind of addictive property, it releases hormones into our bodies which we can’t get anywhere else, it’s like a certain, special type adrenalin. 'It’s quite an incredible feeling when a garment makes you feel special and unique, it’s almost like it has secret powers. I believe the minute I stop shopping, the minute I stop caring about myself. 'Some people go to the gym, some people play badminton, some people play tennis, some people run, me, I shop, it is a sporting form.'","Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, 23, has confessed to being a shopaholic .

"Thanks to an animal charity, Elsa, a six-year-old lioness, has been rescued from San Martin Circus in Sardinia, Italy, and given a new life. The charity Born Free took action after seeing the lioness forced to perform demeaning and unnatural tricks to entertain the public. Today Elsa and all the other animals at the Italian circus have been formally seized by the Italian government after it was discovered that the circus’s conditions do not meet legal requirements and safety regulations. Fortunately, Elsa is relatively healthy and, if anything, is a little over-weight. She was bred at another Italian circus and then left dumped at San Martin when she couldn’t be trained. Her brother was born deformed and died. Elsa has been removed to a temporary home on the Italian mainland. There she will be examined and if healthy to travel and permission is received from the Italian authorities she will be driven to Olbia port. From there she will be taken to Born Free's rescue centre in South Africa where she can live out her days at a three-acre enclosure, with trees and bushes, sandy soil to roll in and dense undergrowth to explore.

"Martin Thomas, 30, is accused of attacking his four-month-old daughter Evie Grace in series of attacks . A father left his baby daughter with a fractured skull and ribs in a series of vicious attacks, a court heard today. Martin Thomas, 30, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, is accused of injuring four-month-old Evie Grace on five separate occasions including striking her head and stamping on her ribs. The infant, who like her father was born with Treacher Collins syndrome, has since died from unrelated causes. Liverpool Crown Court heard the skull fractures inflicted on Evie were ‘likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument’. Mark Kellet, prosecuting, told a jury that doctors believed the rib injuries were ‘caused by squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult’. He said: ‘In short the defendant was responsible for causing those sets of injuries on Evie Thomas when she was aged between one month and four months. ‘Because of the force required to cause these types of fractures in such a young child, doctors can be sure these fractures were caused by unlawful assaults rather than innocent day to day handling. ‘In the absence of any plausible explanation about how she came by these serious fractures they say the likely causes of these fractures are kicks, stamps and blows, striking Evie's head with a blunt instrument or against a blunt hard unyielding surface.’ He explained that the symptoms of Evie’s condition - Treacher Collins syndrome - included, for her, poor formation of facial bones including the cheek and a small lower jaw which can be associated with sudden death in children because of respiratory obstruction. She also suffered from colic which caused pain, distress and discomfort. Evie Grace died in February 2013 as a result of respiratory failure, which was unrelated to the attacks . Hayley Fisher, Evie's mother, took her to hospital after finding 'a massive lump on her head' He added: ‘Tragically she died on the morning of 21 February 2013 as a result of respiratory failure while sleeping at home with her parents - the defendant and Hayley Fisher.’ Mr Kellet emphasised that there was nothing to suggest that the injuries she had suffered led to her death. As well as Treacher Collins syndrome she also had an upper respiratory infection causing inflamed lungs shortly before she died. A full skeletal survey was undertaken after her death and CT scans taken on December 6, 2012 were examined by two radiologists and a forensic pathologist. She had been taken to Wigan Infirmary after her mother, who was upstairs, heard shouting and later found her with ‘a massive lump on her head’ and there the scans were taken. Thomas claimed that while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit Evie on the head. After her death the CT scans were reviewed and along with the skeletal survey the doctors identified injuries caused on five separate occasions, and fractures to her skull and ribs. Mr Kellet said the evidence demonstrates that Thomas's explanation of how she sustained the injuries was a lie. He said: ‘The medical experts say these injuries are typical of non-accidental injury.’ Thomas denies five offences of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between November 26, 2012 and February 22 last year, and five alternative lesser charges of inflicting grievous bodily harm. The trial  continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Martin Thomas, 30, is accused of injuring four-month-old Evie Grace .

"Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are donating $25 million to fight Ebola . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are donating $25 million to the CDC Foundation to help fight the outbreak of the Ebola virus. The money will be used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ebola response effort in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and elsewhere in the world where Ebola is a threat. Zuckerberg and Chan are making the grant from their fund at the nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation. 'The most important step we can take is to stop Ebola at its source. The sooner the world comes together to help West Africa, the safer we all will be,' said CDC Director Tom Frieden in a statement. The grant follows a donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has pledged $50 million to fight the outbreak of the deadly disease. Ebola has already killed more than 4,000 people, nearly all of them in West Africa. The Foundation's money will go to United Nations agencies and other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients. It will also help to to expand the emergency response in West Africa and any other countries affected by the virus. Last month, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen pledged $9 million to fight the virus, just weeks after giving $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak. The World Health Organization said today that West Africa could see up to 10,000 new Ebola cases a week within two months and confirmed that the death rate in the current outbreak is now 70 percent.

The devout Christian couple, who held hands throughout the ceremony, also lit a candle symbolizing their unity. 'Before God, as a married couple, we're one person,' Derick explained. Sweet gesture: Jill and Derick held hands throughout the entire ceremony . Family tradition: The couple chose to follow in Jill's parents' footsteps by holding their nuptials at the same church where Jim Bob and Michelle were married 30 years ago - and even used the same vows . One tradition the couple chose not to follow was the groom's custom of waiting for the wedding to see the bride in her dress. Jill decided to show Derick her custom-designed Allure Romance gown shortly before the ceremony, with the groom becoming quite overwhelmed at the sight of his beautiful bride to be. 'Babe, you look absolutely amazing,' he said. 'I've never seen you so gorgeous.' Jim Bob, who introduced his daughter to Derick after meeting him while doing missionary work abroad, was particularly moved by the union. Proud papa: 'Your whole life, you invest in your daughter and then one day you give her away,' said Jill's father, Jim Bob . Sister, sister: Jessa (left) and Jana (right) Duggar were among Jill's six bridesmaids . Family affair: The youngest Duggars served as flower girls in the ceremony, holding up signs that spelled out 'Here comes your bride' 'Your whole life, you invest in your daughter and then one day you give her away,' he said. 'It's kind of a happy and sad time, and I just can't put it into words.' The couple chose to follow in Jill's parents' footsteps by holding their nuptials at the same church where Jim Bob and Michelle were married 30 years ago - and even used the same vows. 'I pledge here and now this solemn vow. With this ring I thee wed. With loyal love I thee endow, so long as I shall live,' both repeated. Carried away: Derick gives his new bride a lift right after the wedding ceremony . The couple are now expecting their first child, and recently revealed that they're having a boy after learning the gender from an ultrasound. 'I was really excited,' Derick told People, adding, 'As a new dad, to have a firstborn son to be our first child and be the leader of his siblings, it is very special.' The couple are due to have their baby in March 2015. Breaking the rules: One tradition the couple chose not to follow was the groom's custom of waiting for the wedding to see the bride in her dress . First look: 'I've never seen you so gorgeous,' Derick said upon seeing Jill in her custom-designed Allure Romance gown before the ceremony . The couple married less than three months after Derick proposed to Jill, who told Us Weekly that they purposely kept their engagement short so as not to tempt themselves into being unchaste before the wedding. The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's 17 and Counting, a series that followed the lives of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children. They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement, which 'teaches that children are God's blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'","The wedding finally aired on a special episode of 19 Kids and Counting last night .

"A father-of-four who picked up a laptop from PC World only to find it had a large scratch down the side seconds after leaving the store has hit out at workers who told him it couldn't be replaced. Dale Covell, 32, said he was shocked when a manager allegedly accused him of scratching it himself - despite having just picked it up from being repaired at the store in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Mr Covell originally paid £380 for the HP laptop last month but after a number of technical problems, took it in to the Trinity Retail Park store to be fixed last week. He said he noticed a large mark down the side of his laptop after collecting it but was told by workers that the firm was not responsible for the damage because he had 'stepped outside the store'. Scroll down for video . Dale Covell found a large scratch on his £380 HP laptop after collecting it from being repaired at PC World in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The firm initially denied responsibility but has now given him a new laptop (above) He dropped his relatively new laptop off at the store to be repaired and only discovered the new scratch after collecting it a short time later. He said he returned to the store but staff said it wasn't the firm's responsibility . The finance director said he went back inside the shop to report the problem but was told that because he had left the store, the firm would not accept responsibility for the damage. He said: 'To say they wouldn't replace it because I stepped one foot out of the door is a disgrace. 'I was still on their land. When a damage report was done on it when I initially dropped it off, the scratch wasn't there.' However, it appears bosses at the store later had a change of heart and offered him a replacement. Mr Covell, 32, alleged that a store manager had accused him of causing the damage to his laptop himself . PC World has since apologised to the father-of-four and has given him a replacement higher-spec computer . A spokesman for Currys & PC World said: 'It is unfortunate that Mr Covell feels he had a poor experience in our store. 'We offered him several like-for-like replacement laptops as well as the option of a slightly higher-spec model. Mr Covell opted for the latter. 'Great customer service is at the heart of everything we do.'","Dale Covell, 32, took his £380 HP laptop to PC World in Bolton to be fixed .

"The widow of the late rock singer Phil Everly has opened up about his long struggle with the lung disease that took his life. Everly, half of Grammy-winning duo The Everly Brothers, passed away in January this year, aged 74. After a life-long smoking habit, the Bye Bye Love singer was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 2011. Rest in peace: Phil Everly's widow Patti, pictured with the late singer in 2009, has spoken of his last years of struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . His widow Patti, who has openly blamed the lung disease on his smoking, spoke about how Everly had to carry oxygen tanks with him wherever he went in his last years. Although Everly quit smoking in 2001, the habit had done permanent damage to his lungs and he started experiencing problems that eventually ended his singing career in 2004. At his last public appearance in 2011, at Buddy Holly's induction to Hollywood Boulevard's Star Walk of fame, Everly was struggling to catch his breath as he addressed the crowd. 'It went from mild COPD to severe. He skipped medium,' Patti Everly told The Tennessean. 'When I met him, he was 55 and taking nothing but vitamins. By the end he was taking 20 medications, and hooked up to oxygen 24/7, carrying it with him.' Phil with his brother Don Everly support Simon and Garfunkel in 2004 for what would be their last shows together . Final walk: Phil Everly, pictured with  Buddy Holly's widow Maria Elena and Garey Busey at the unveiling of Holly's Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, which would be his last public appearance . Phil Everly, at the height of his fame, is pictured at London's Savoy Hotel with a cigarette and a guitar . 'In the middle of the night, you look over to see if they're still breathing. Pretty soon, all you're waiting for is death.' In January this year, Phil Everly died in hospital in Burbank, Los Angeles. At the time, Patti said: 'We are absolutely heartbroken. He fought long and hard.' The Everly Brothers were best known for their steel-string guitar playing and close vocal harmonies and dominated charts on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1950s and early 60s. Their biggest hits included Wake Up Little Susie, All I Have To Do Is Dream and Bye Bye Love. Their unique vocal style directly influenced The Beatles – who even referred to themselves early in their career as 'the English Everly Brothers'. The Everly Brothers still hold the record for the most top 100 singles by any duo in history. During the height of their success, the crooners charted nearly three dozen hits on the Billboard Hot 100. The pair broke up on stage in 1973 and reportedly did not speak to each other for a decade except at their father's funeral. They got back together at a reunion concert at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1983 and three years later were among the first acts to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","Phil Everly died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in January .

"Petrol prices have fallen to a four-year low after big name supermarkets move to slash costs to win back customers. Latest figures show that on Monday unleaded petrol cost 126.78p, down 2p in just a week and the lowest since January 2011. The drop is thanks to retailers passing on falls in the cost of oil, but motoring groups warn the good news could be short-lived with rises expected this winter. Latest figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change reveal petrol prices fell by 2p in a week . Since July the price of petrol has fallen by almost 5p, including a 2p drop in the last week. At the end of September Sainsbury's announced a 5p cut across its 294 forecourts. Avishai Moor, Sainsbury's Head of Fuel, said: Fuel is a big part of the weekly budget for many households, which is why we're taking the lead and cutting the price of unleaded petrol and diesel by up to 5 pence per litre.' Asda and Tesco followed suit with big cuts, with Tesco fuel director Peter Cattell declaring: 'As Britain's biggest fuel retailer this means more motorists can make real savings.' The moves by the big name supermarkets came as they faced renewed pressure from budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl. The latest drops have been triggered by Sainsbury's cutting prices by 5p, leading other retailers to follow suit . Independent petrol stations have also moved to cut prices to compete with the supermarkets, who traditionally have been cheapest for drivers. On September 29, the average cost of a litre of petrol was 128.59p but by this week it had fallen to 126.78p, according to official figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change. The price for diesel was 131.4p per litre, this is also 1.8p per litre lower than the previous week. The last time fuel was so cheap was in the first week of January 2011 when it stood at 124.85p and diesel was 129.11p. Edmund King, AA president, said it was great news that pump prices are falling . Edmund King, AA president, said: 'It is great news that we are seeing pump prices falling. The main reason for the drop in prices is the global supply and demand. 'To put it crudely we are swimming in oil. US oil output has doubled in the last six years and is running at its highest production levels for a quarter of a century. However, global demand has declined particularly as the Asian economies cool down. 'In the UK the reductions we are seeing at the pumps have also been speeded up by competing supermarket offers of discounts of up to 5p litre. 'Drivers haven't seen such prices since 2011 but oil prices are still volatile and more global unrest in oil producing countries can just as easily send the price spiralling again. Enjoy it while we can.' Petrol retailers had been accused of failing to pass on savings from a dramatic fall in oil prices to motorists. Fears over the spluttering global economy has caused oil prices to fall by more than 16 per cent since early June from $109.13 (£67.98) to $91.48 (£56.99) a barrel. This is enabling retailers, including supermarket giants Tesco and Sainsbury as well as Shell and BP, to make bigger profits on Britain’s forecourts as they can buy fuel on the wholesale markets more cheaply while cutting prices more gradually for customers. Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said: 'Motorists struggling with the cost of living crisis have been hit hard by the government hiking VAT on petrol and by retailers who are sluggish at passing on falls in global oil prices. 'Lower petrol prices are good news but the government needs to do more to ensure that oil companies are passing on price fall savings in full.'","Average petrol price has fallen to 126.78p, down 2p in just a week .

"India is finally on the reforms path once again. The Narendra Modi Government has boldly bitten the bullet for the sake of the nation’s future after India got rid of the unpardonable policy paralysis of the previous United Progressive Alliance Government. On Saturday, the Government under PM Modi kicked-off the much-needed reforms yatra by deregulating the diesel price, besides approving a new gas price policy and ensuring that the benefit of the LPG subsidy in cash directly reaches the consumers. With that the Modi Government has proved that it will do everything to usher in a higher growth plane. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley (right) with Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan during a press conference in New Delhi . The good news of reforms came from Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. “Henceforth, like petrol, the price of diesel will be market determined,” Jaitley said after a Cabinet meeting. “We have decided to reduce prices and in Delhi the price of diesel will go down by Rs 3.37 per litre from Saturday midnight,” said B. Ashok, chairman of the Indian Oil Corporation, the country’s biggest fuel retailer. Retail prices of diesel will now reflect international movement in oil prices which are currently down to a four-year low. This is the first reduction in diesel price in over five years. Diesel rates were last cut on January 29, 2009 when they were reduced by Rs 2 a litre to Rs 30.86. Diesel prices were last raised by 50 paise on September 1 and cumulatively raised by Rs 11.81 per litre in 19 instalments since January 2013. The NDA Government also approved a hike in the natural gas price to US$ 5.61 per mmBtu (million British thermal unit) with effect from November 1, but Reliance Industries will continue to get current US$ 4.2 rate till it makes up for shortfall in output from KG-D6 block. “The Cabinet has modified the Rangarajan formula approved by the previous UPA Government to bring down the increase in rates from US$ 8.4 to US$ 5.61,” Jaitley said. The new formula will be effective from November 1 and the rates will be revised every six months with the next revision being on April 1. “This price takes into consideration the provision of a sufficient incentive for oil and gas exploration by the companies and is also not excessively burdensome for the consumers,” Jaitley pointed out. The new formula excludes some of the international hub prices such as Japan, included in the earlier Rangarajan formula used by the UPA Government to arrive at the higher price of US$ 8.4 which was to be implemented from April 1, but was put on hold by the Election Commission due to the Lok Sabha elections. The private sector companies which were lobbying for a higher price appeared disappointed after the decision but Oil and Natural Gas Corporation chairman D.K. Sarraf welcomed the hike saying he was “enthused by the increase in gas price”. For RIL's flagging D1 and D3 gas fields in KG-D6 block — where output should have been 80 mmscmd but is languishing at less than 8 mmscmd — the Cabinet decided the current rate of US$ 4.2 per mmBtu will continue to apply. Consumers will, however, pay the revised increased price but RIL will get only US$ 4.2 with the difference being deposited in an escrow account. RIL will get the higher rates if it is legally able to prove that it did not deliberately cut production and output fall was a result of geological reasons as it claims. Jaitley said that the Cabinet had also cleared the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for LPG in which cash subsidy will be directly transferred to the bank accounts of consumers. Earlier the scheme was linked with the Aadhaar numbers. The Finance Minister said 6.02 crore accounts have been opened so far under the Jan Dhan Yojana, and the new scheme to transfer cash subsidy to the consumers would start from November 10.","Diesel price cut and linked to international market .

"A veteran of Mitt Romeny's failed presidential campaign unveiled a new slogan this weak meant to humanize the GOP's image, but older Republicans may experience a shudder of wary recognition upon hearing it. 'Republicans Are People, Too,' reads the new promotional material including a video, Web site, and social media campaign, launched by Republican Vinny Minchillo, and repeating the same slogan meant to make the brand more friendly in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Minchillo decided to revive the slogan because he believes that it has become 'socially acceptable to say bad things about Republicans' and that it's time to 'let people know that it's OK to be a Republican.' A new campaign slogan meant to humanize GOP members has a sad history in the party after the Watergate scandal . 'People, I'm afraid, think that Republicans spend their days huddling over a boiling cauldron throwing in locks of Ronald Reagan's hair,' he told The New Republic. 'We thought let's get out there and show who Republicans really are: 'regular folks interested in making the world a better place.' He added that, like the Republicans in his campaign videos, he himself shops at Trader Joe's and reads the New York Times. An executive at Glass Housing Strategies consulting firm, he says he came up with the idea on his own seeing Republicans lambasted on the internet. Republican Vinny Minchillo came up with the slogan without knowing its history, saying he was inspired by seeing Republicans treated badly online . 'A big part of the idea is from my life experience as a Republican online,' he said. 'I've been called a lot of really bad things. It seems like it has become socially acceptable to say bad things about Republicans.' However speaking to Yahoo, Ronald Reagan biographer and political consultant Craig Shirley said the slogan was originally received as 'the wail of pathetic losers.' He had already addressed the campaign's failure in his book Reagan's Revolution, comparing the 1974 GOP to a 'stray cat' people would like to 'immediately' euthanize. He further mocked the campaign material for the then 'party of losers' writing: 'As if to remove all doubt about the Republican's insecurities and cowardice, the buttons were manufactured in bright yellow.' Ronald Reagan biographer and political consultant Craig Shirley said a similar campaign was originally received as 'the wail of pathetic losers' The Republican National Committee spokesmen contacted by reporters about the slogan did not respond to interview requests. Minchillo said he had no idea his campaign slogan was a repeat of the infamous tagline. 'That's a little before my time,' he told Yahoo. 'I'll have to go back and take a look at it. That's really funny. Those were some pretty dark times for Republicans for sure.' He says he still has faith in the slogan despite its checkered history, and thinks the video could help with voter registration. 'I've heard from a lot of campaigns who say it's a breath of fresh air, especially this time of year. If you're in a competitive state it's just one negative ad after another,' he said.","Slogan was originally used following the Watergate scandal in 1974 .

"Many women who check their breasts for cancer are doing so incorrectly, a leading doctor warned today. While many don't bother at all, many of those who do take the time are still at risk due to not being thorough enough. Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, Dr Hilary Jones explained a monthly examination should take several  minutes - much longer than the cursory swipe many women may perform in the shower. Scroll down for video . Of those who do check their breasts for cancer, many are doing so incorrectly. Instructing how to perform a live examination on the Lorraine show, Dr Hilary Jones explained a monthly check should take several minutes . Dr Hilary told presenter Lorraine Kelly: 'The key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them. Has anything changed? That's the vital thing' To remind viewers what to do, and with the help of a female volunteer, he instructed how to perform a breast examination. When he did the same last year, it led to many women being diagnosed, including viewer Lisa Maddison. Watching at home, she realised that like many women, she too was going about the process incorrectly. Today, as he reminded viewers of the correct procedure, Dr Hilary told presenter Lorraine Kelly: 'The key is to be breast aware - look at your breasts and feel them. Has anything changed? That's the vital thing.' He added: 'Bear in mind, periods will change things, so wait until a week after your period to check. 'And remember one woman will have different consistency breasts compared to someone else - some have soft balloons, others lumpy beanbags. 'You need to know what's normal for you so you can detect change. After the menopause, for example, breasts become softer, less firm and less lumpy,' he said. With the help of the model, Sue, Dr Hilary then proceeded to show viewers exactly how to perform a breast examination. DR HILARY'S GUIDE TO BREAST EXAMINATION . * Stand with your hand on your hip to relax the muscles on that side of the chest . * Divide the breast tissue into four quadrants: a line across the nipple, a line through the nipple, one coming vertically across and all the way up to the collar and under the armpit. * Using the soft pads of your three middle fingers, examine each quarter in a grid search. * It's important to go all the way up to the collarbone and feel the lymph nodes under the armpit. Around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant and the enlarged lymph glands are a sign.  Don't just feel around the nipple and forget the armpit. * Do a superficial feel on the surface first and then press deeper. * Spend three minutes on each side, doing each quarter in turn, getting right into the tail of each breast. * When you come to the nipples, feel under the areola. * It's also important to watch out for a rash or discharge, such as that which is milky, straw coloured or bleeding - and tell your doctor. * Overall, watch for a change in the shape or contour of breasts - one may be asymmetrical compared to the other. * Check for puckering or dimpling of the skin - perhaps because something is pulling underneath. It's important to go all the way up to the collarbone and feel the lymph nodes under the armpit. Around 50 per cent of breast cancers occur in this outer quadrant, Dr Hilary said . Lisa Maddison discovered a lump in her breast after watching a breast cancer examination last year . Lisa Maddison was watching Lorraine last year during Breast Cancer Awareness Month and realised she too had been checking herself incorrectly. After following the technique shown by Dr Hilary, she discovered a lump - and was diagnosed with cancer. Speaking a year on, she said: 'I've realised since then that many women - and men - don't check their breasts at all, if properly. 'After watching Dr Hilary, I used the technique he showed and found a large lump on my left-hand side.' Two weeks later, she was diagnosed with cancer and has since gone through six months of chemotherapy and three weeks of radiation therapy. Now on the hormone drug Tamoxifen to prevent the cancer recurring, she said: 'I have daughters and I urge them and other people to check themselves. 'We must be more aware - the amount of people who aren't [is worrying].' However after treatment, she is on the road to recovery, and said today: 'I feel absolutely smashing. Life is great at the minute.' As part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, women are being asked to donate unwanted bras to donate towards further breast cancer research. Under the Bin Your Bra campaign, unwanted bras will be shipped to Africa where they will be recycled. The money generated will go towards new and ongoing research. Bras can be left at any of the 535 F&F clothing sections of Tescos across the UK and Ireland.","Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, Dr Hilary Jones explained a monthly examination should take several minutes - not a few seconds as many people do .

"This is the 85-year-old New York wannabe playboy who was allegedly robbed by 17-year-old twin sisters he met on a sugar daddy dating site called Seeking Arrangement. Paul Aronson was tied to a coffee table for 20 hours after he took  Shalaine and Shaina Foster to dinner where he is accused of providing them with alcoholic beverages. The trio then headed back to his 38th Street apartment where he served them more alcohol - before the girls bound him with zip ties, a court heard. They then stole his credit cards and $470 in cash before going shopping for make-up, it has been claimed. Pictured: Paul Aronson, 85, (left) was tied up and robbed by Shalaine Foster, 17, (right) and her twin . Seeking Arrangement: Paul Aronson met the twins on the sugar daddy dating site Seeking Arrangement . Aronson was later found tied up on the floor by a friend. That's when Aronson called the cops. The Foster sisters were charged on Monday with kidnapping, robbery, burglary, larceny, and assault. The girl's, who both have criminal records, were held without bail in a Manhattan Criminal Court. The New York Daily News reports that when Aronson excitedly took the girls back to his brownstone on 38th street, he served them a few more drinks before the girls turned the table on him and robbed him after tying him up with zip ties. The New York Daily news spoke to the girls' brother outside the courtroom on Monday. 'The story sounds f****ed up,' he said. 'But it’s also an 85-year-old wealthy man who basically has these young girls like they’re in a candy store,' he said. 'We know he bought them liquor and intoxicated them and took him back to the house.' Reporters also spoke the twins' mother who is denying all accusations against her daughters. 'These are 17-year-old girls ... college-bound, upstanding citizens,' said their overwhelmed mother. 'They’re not sleazy girls at all, whatsoever. It’s going to ruin their lives forever.' 'I don’t know what to say other than this is horrible,' she said. Shaina has one felony arrest for possession of a sealed instrument (alcoholic beverage) plus one sealed arrest. Shalaine was arrested last April for introduction of prison contraband in addition to two sealed arrests. While the age of consent in 17 in New York, the website Seekingarrangement.com states that all members must be over the age of 18. Aronson signed up for the website on October 1 where he encountered Shaina. When Aronson invited her to dinner, to his delight, she showed up with Shalaine. The site defines a sugar daddy as, 'Successful men and women who know what they want. They’re driven, and enjoy attractive company by their side. Money isn’t an issue, thus they are generous when it comes to supporting a Sugar Baby.' Took them home: When Paul Aronson took the teens back to his brownstone (not pictured) on 38th street in Manhattan, they allegedly tied him up with zip ties and took his credit cards along with $470 .

"Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to scrap the controversial fixed-term parliament act . David Cameron is under growing pressure to agree to tear up the Government's controversial fixed term parliaments act which means general elections take place only once every five years. The minister who oversaw the legislation said it would make it all but impossible for either Mr Cameron or Labour leader Ed Miliband to run a minority government if they fail to win a Commons majority next year - as polls currently suggest is likely. Mark Harper, speaking ahead of a debate on the issue by MPs, said few had appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which means prime ministers no longer have the power to call an election when opinion polls are favourable. Instead, they need to win the support of a 'super majority' of two-thirds of MPs for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period - meaning the leader of a minority administration would be handing a decision on timing to his or her opponents. Critics say the legislation, cooked up to keep the current coalition together, is therefore a recipe for never-ending coalition government. Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, who will lead a revolt in the Commons in a debate on Thursday, insisted his party should commit to scrapping the legislation. 'We've never had fixed term parliaments in the past and it creates terrible inflexibility,' he said. 'It was created artificially just for the sake of the current coalition, supposedly to stop one party walking off, rather than any good constitutional innovation. Five-year parliaments are too long. We should repeal it.' In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr Harper, who was in charge of constitutional reform as Nick Clegg's Conservative deputy at the Cabinet Office, and was appointed as work and pensions minister in Mr Cameron's last reshuffle, said: 'In the past, you could run a minority government for a short period of time and then have an election. 'The problem now is that you need to be able and prepared to govern on that basis for an entire five-year parliament. You can't run a minority government for a short period of time and then hold another election. You would either have to do a coalition again, or at the least a formal arrangement that could last for five years with a smaller party. 'I don't think a lot of people have cottoned on to this fact.' Mr Harper's warning is a blow to senior figures in both the Conservatives and Labour who are determined to prevent another coalition after next year's election, despite polls indicating another hung parliament is likely. Scroll down for video . MP Mark Harper said few had appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change, which means prime ministers no longer have the power to call an election when opinion polls are favourable . Supporters of Boris Johnson have floated the idea of trying to install him as Tory leader in the event of Mr Cameron again failing to win an overall majority, with the intention of running a minority Conservative government and holding another election a few months later. Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the shadow Cabinet, meanwhile, suggest Labour should not enter coalition with the Liberal Democrats if it emerges as the biggest party but does not secure a majority, also with the aim of calling a rapid second general election in the hope of winning outright. While this was always possible in the past, Mr Harper said the fixed term parliament law passed by the coalition - designed to be a 'lock' on the Government to prevent either the Tories or the Lib Dems walking and triggering an election - would make such a course politically perilous today. 'You now need to have MPs representing two-thirds of seats - not just the MPs voting - wanting to have an election. If you look at history back to World War Two, that means you would have to have the opposition and the governing party agreeing at the same time to call an election - something not likely to happen.' Veteran Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, who will lead a revolt in the Commons in a debate on Thursday, insisted his party should commit to scrapping the legislation . Other than gaining the support of a super majority of two-thirds of all MPs, the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no confidence. But other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held. 'So if you try to run a minority administration, there's then always the chance that somebody else can put together a government,' Mr Harper added. Supporters of Boris Johnson have floated the idea of trying to install him as Tory leader in the event of Mr Cameron again failing to win an overall majority . The minister said that simply scrapping the Act would not be a solution. The old right a Prime Minister had to call an election when he or she wanted was a prerogative power granted by the Queen, and once abolished these cannot be resurrected without new legislation. 'If you simply repeal the Act, you are left in a position where there is no power for anyone to dissolve Parliament,' Mr Harper added. 'You would need detailed legislation setting out new rules. Even if the previous system was better, the idea that you could actually argue as the governing party that it was better to give yourselves the exclusive power to call an election back again, and that everybody else would go along with that... I just can't see it happening.' The minister said the fixed term parliament reforms that had been introduced were a 'recipe for coalition or for parties winning majorities'. The suggestion that Mr Cameron and his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg have overseen constitutional changes that ensure future coalitions are far more likely will anger some MPs who had not appreciated their long-term implications. Some senior Tories, including at least two Cabinet ministers, believe Mr Cameron should have run a minority government after failing to win an outright majority in May 2010 and gone back to the country in a second election in October of that year. One Conservative MP sceptical about the coalition said: 'The coalition was a mistake in the first place, and now Cameron and Clegg are going to leave behind a law tying the hands of future party leaders.'","David Cameron faces pressure to scrap government's fixed-term ruling .

"An Indiana college student convicted of stabbing and shooting to death a classmate at Purdue University earlier this year has been found dead from an apparent suicide in his prison cell. The Indiana Department of Correction said 24-year-old Cody Cousins was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after being found unresponsive Tuesday night at the Indiana State Prison with self-inflicted lacerations to his neck and arms. An autopsy is still pending, but officials say it appears Cousins slashed himself with a razor, which inmates are allowed to keep for shaving purposes. His estimated release date was July 22, 2046. Grisly end: Cody Cousins, 24 (left), sentenced last month to 65 years in prison for the murder of 21-year-old Purdue University student Andrew Boldt (right), was found dead in his cell from cuts to his neck and arms . Imprisoned: Cousins met his end at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, where he arrived October 23 . Investigators said the Warsaw, Indiana, man entered a classroom filled with students on the West Lafayette campus January 21 and attacked Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Boldt died after suffering five gunshot wounds, three of them to the face, and 19 cuts. Dr Elmo Griggs, the veteran pathologist who examined Boldt's body, said of the crime: 'it was the worst homicide I have ever seen.' Both Cousins and Boldt were teaching assistants in Purdue's electrical engineering program at the time. Cousins was sentenced September 19 to 65 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder. Defiant: Cousins told a judge during sentencing in September that he killed his classmate because he 'wanted to' Chilling words: The 24-year-old man said in court he will deal 'with the consequences later' During that hearing, Prosecutor Pat Harrington said Cousins, who had trouble keeping up in some classes and left Purdue at one point, envied Boldt, who was described as a top student. 'Andrew was everything he was not,' Harrington said. During his sentencing last month, a defiant Cody Cousins admitted to the murder. 'I killed Andrew Boldt because I wanted to, and I do what I want to do,' he declared in court. 'I will deal with the consequences later.' Defense attorneys argued that the 24-year-old was mentally ill at the time of the attack and asked that he receive treatment at once instead of upon his release from prison. Attorney Kirk Freeman said during sentencing his client was 'so sick, he may not know he's sick.' Experts who examined Cousins said he didn't show signs of mental illness the day Boldt was killed, and Cousins himself bragged to the judge last month that he lied to doctors about experiencing auditory hallucinations and had taken amphetamines. Envy: The prosecutor said that Andrew Boldt (center), a top student pictured here with his brothers, was everything that Cousins was not . Battling demons: Cousins' defense attorney insisted that his client was mentally ill . On Wednesday, Cousins' attorney reiterated that his client had struggled with serious mental illness. 'It's a horrible, tragic end to this and I've expressed my condolences to his family,' Freeman said. The Boldt family have not publicly commented about the death of Andrew's killer. The 21-year-old is survived by his parents and two brothers, Erich and Nathan. Indiana State Prison spokeswoman Pam James said Cousins arrived at the prison October 23 and had been given a single cell of the sort assigned to new inmates. James said inmates in those cells are checked by staff every 30 minutes and prison logs indicate a correctional officer had last checked on Cousins at 8:.30 pm, about 25 minutes before he was found. She said Cousins had not been on suicide watch. Cousins' death is being investigated by the Department of Correction's internal affairs office and the LaPorte County coroner's office.","Cody Cousins, 24, was found dead from lacerations to his neck and arms at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City Tuesday night .

"Two parents of a 9-month-old girl named Avarice have been charged with her neglect - days after a fundraising page was set up to collect money for her funeral. Adam  and Jasmyne Alexander, both 21, were charged on Thursday with felony neglect after allegedly leaving their baby girl alone in her crib from 8:30pm Saturday night to 12:30pm Sunday, when she was found dead. The young couple have been living with Adam's mother and sister in Nokesville, Virginia. Neglect: Jasmyne Alexander and Adam Alexander, both 21, have been charged with felony neglect . Police say that the baby was put to sleep on her stomach Saturday night. Later Jasmyne got home from work and the parents drank that night and went to sleep. They t hen didn't check on their child until the next day. Emergency responders pronounced the child dead on site at about 1pm Sunday. According to detectives, NBC reports, the baby had not been to a doctor in seven months despite the fact her parents had noticed she was having breathing problems four weeks ago. Hours after the child died a GoFundMe page was set up to collect funds in Avarice's name. Avarice had not been to a doctor in seven months. Her parents told authorities she had developed breathing problems about four weeks ago . As of Saturday, over $5,000 had been raised for the baby's funeral fund. A woman who says she is the baby's aunt Mia has updated the site to say the parents would get no extra money raised. Mia also acknowledged that baby may not have died of SIDS as originally claimed . The day after Avarice died her mom Jasmyne put up a photo of the baby on Instagram which included the hashtag #rip and directed people to the GoFundMe. Three days after this post she was charged with felony neglect . Days later, after the parents were charged, someone named Mia, claiming to be the baby's aunt, posted an update. On Friday she wrote in part, 'Even if the baby did not pass from SIDS I will still donate the remaining fund money because that is what I stated I would do. Please do no criticize me I have all the right intentions & I loved my niece dearly :'( The parents have no access to any of the online donations that have been made here.' Photos on social media show the couple's wedding and several photos of the baby. On instagram, before her arrest, Jasmyne wrote alongside a photo of her child, '#imissyou #iloveyou #rip.' Avarice, which isn't common as a name, is a noun meaning, according to Merriam Webster, 'excessive or insatiable desire for wealth or gain.' The couple are being held on a $10,000 secured bond. Little Avarice was given a name which names 'extreme greed'. She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders . The young family had been living with Adam's mother and sister in this Virginia home .

"Vice President Joe Biden came to the defense of embattled Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Friday in a speech at the organization's annual Women's Leadership Forum. Biden told the predominately female audience that it's 'great to work' with the Florida congressman and that he'd 'never seen anybody work as hard and as tirelessly' as her. 'And by the way, if we want anybody to do that 60 seconds or 120 seconds we get to respond to some attack on the president or the administration, the best person...is always Debbie,' he said. Biden's full-throated support for Wasserman Schultz came a day and half after a Politico report claimed she was on the outs with the White House - and the Democratic Party - and may soon be asked to step down from her position in party leadership. The fiery federal lawmaker was never a lock to have a third term as chief spokesperson for the main branch of the national party, but her recent comparison of a GOP governor to a wife beater put her position in even greater jeopardy. Vice President Joe Biden, right, laughs as he is introduced by Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Friday at the DNC Women's Leadership conference. Wasserman Schultz called Biden a 'national treasure' and he described her are a tireless advocate for the party . While speaking at a forum in support of Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke, a Democrat, Wasserman Schultz claimed that incumbent Republican Governor Scott Walker 'has given women the back of his hand.' 'I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' she said. The DNC chair went on to claim that 'Republican Tea Party extremists' like Walker 'are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back.' The female lawmaker's claim was roundly criticized as inappropriate and insensitive to survivors of domestic violence, and the following day Wasserman Schultz issued an apology. While the outspoken Democratic leader has made colorful remarks in the past about Republicans' opposition to policies her party says benefit women, Wasserman Schultz latest claim ruffled more feathers than usual and restarted an underground campaign to have her ousted as DNC chair. Among the complaints lodged against the female party head in the article is that she's more concerned with her own political ambitions than promoting the party. 'We say the big ""D"" is for Democratic,' a Democratic member of Congress is quoted as telling his colleagues in February during retreat. 'For her, the big ""D"" is always for Debbie.' 'People know she works hard,' another contemporary of Wasserman Schutlz's is blindly quoted as having said. 'But there’s this sense that she only works hard for herself.' The article also claimed that President Barack Obama and Wasserman Schultz have 'rarely' spoken to each other since 2011, either in person or over the phone. When the president has meetings with other party committee heads, he does not invite Wasserman Schultz, Politco's sources said. Desperate for the president's attention, Wasserman Schultz join photo lines at events featuring Obama in order to have his ear, if only for a few moments, Politico contended. In an official statement about Wasserman Schultz's tenure as DNC chair, Deputy White House spokesman Eric Schultz claimed that that Florida politician was doing 'a great job' helping Democratic candidates put their best foot forward in their upcoming elections. 'The president is grateful for all of the hard work being done by the entire team at the DNC. He fully recognizes the value of their work, and that’s why he has worked so hard to support them,' the White House flack said. But behind the scenes, Democrats are arguing that Wasserman Schultz should be replaced as the committee's head at the conclusion of the current election cycle, Politico revealed. If the incidents relayed in Politico's article did in fact happen, Democrats' opinion of the Florida representative have shifted significantly since she was named head of the influential party committee in 2011. In announcing her promotion, Politico stated that she was 'beloved by the Democratic rank and file for her aggressive, outspoken advocacy for liberal points of view.' The Democratic National Committee chairwoman did not address her critics during today's event, but in keeping with the theme of the conference, she made the case for putting women in charge of the Democratic Party's outreach efforts. 'The reason that you're here,' she told conference attendees, is 'because you know as well as I do that more often than not if you want to get something done, you send a woman to do it.' Wasserman Schultz notably cudgeled Republican candidates for not knowing how to talk to appropriately talk to women voters in her remarks, as well, and argued that female voters should elect Democrats to office if they want lawmakers who reflect 'their values as women.' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, right, gets a hug from Wasserman Schultz before speaking at the Women's Leadership Forum. Democrats had nothing but praise for Wasserman Schultz at today's conference but a recent news report suggests it's all for show . The Vice President, who made a few gaffes of his own in recent days, didn't weigh in on controversy plaguing Wasserman Schultz, however he went out of his way to talk her up as both a friend and a party leader. Biden teasingly compared his former colleague to his 'little sister,' noting that when she needs him to do something, 'she doesn't even ask, she just tells me where to go, what to do,' before moving on the topic of his speech, which was, somewhat ironically, domestic violence and sexual assault. Speaking about his early support for legislation that would make make violence against women illegal, Biden said he 'couldn't understand why a woman, who twice a week her husband was home smashing her head against a wall, chocking her, would live in that circumstance for years.' Biden used the speaking gig to promote the White House's new public awareness campaign about sexual assault on college campuses, It's on Us. 'There will always be some man raising his hand to someone weaker physically, whether a woman or a child,' the Vice President admitted. 'But success will come when the societal attitude changes, and not a single woman in the world asks herself the question, what did I do? 'Never, never, never is it the woman's fault, other than self-defense. Never! Never!' Biden shouted amid uproarious clapping from the crowd. President Obama will also address the women's leadership conference later this afternoon, and he will likely talk about the importance of electing women to the Senate, in addition to the White House's efforts to decrease sexual assault on campus. Touching on the upcoming elections this morning, Biden claimed the progress women have made will 'slide back a decade' if Democrats lose control of the Senate and don't gain seats in the House. 'The president is a wonderful guy. He's my great personal friend. But right now we feel like [Horatius] at the bridge or little Dutch men at the dyke,' Biden said referring to two ancient fables about outnumbered men overcoming unthinkable obstacles. 'I mean all we're able to do right now is stop bad things from happening. That's useful, but that's not why we wanted the job,' Biden continued. 'We wanted the job to do things, and we've done a lot through the president's executive orders and the first two years when we had a Democratic House. So folks it's time for us to step up and make our case without apology.' As the Vice President took the stage to give his remarks, Wasserman Schultz lavished praise on him, saying, 'He is a treasure. A national treasure.' Stating that she was neutral as the DNC chair 'and would be' in 2016, she told the audience she sported a Biden for President button on her backpack in 1988 during the Delaware politician's first run for president. 'My God, I'm getting old,' Biden told attendees afterward, eliciting an outburst of laughter from the audience. 'A national treasure. Gosh, almighty,' he said.","Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is rumored to be on the outs with the White House .

But in 1939 their diplomatic delegation departed and Lion Lodge was left vacant - only for the Germans to destroy it during a bomb raid the following year.

Bradlee, who died last week at age 93, was at the helm of the Washington Post for almost 25-years and was known for his forensic search for the truth in his reporters work and from public officials. His funeral drew colleagues past and present including his equally legendary former reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who with Bradlee helped expose the Watergate scandal in 1972 which eventually brought down President Richard Nixon. Resembling a funeral for an elected political dignitary more than that of a newspaper editor, Bradlee's service which began at 11am, was marked by elaborate security and leaders from both  parties - including vice president Joe Biden, who broke down in tears during the service. In a touching gesture before the eulogies began, Bradlee's wife, the writer Sally Quinn, laid a solitary white rose on his coffin and then Bradlee's son Quinn approached the coffin and laid his head down ontop. After the pageantry of the funeral, invited guests retired to Bradlee's home in the exclusive Washington suburb of Georgetown. Scroll Down for Video .

Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and many government officials and journalists were among hundreds who filled the massive church. Few cities could honor a gruff, profane and aggressive journalist quite like Washington. Bradlee was a lion of Washington journalism during the glory days of newspapers.  He led the Pulitzer Prize-winning coverage of the Watergate scandal that elevated the Post and toppled the presidency of Richard Nixon. Bradlee died last week at 93 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease in recent years. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were among eight men who paid tribute to the man who led the Post newsroom from 1968 to 1991 - through the coverage of the Watergate scandal that toppled the presidency of Richard Nixon and elevated the newspaper to new heights. 'What is the central part of his character?' Bernstein said. 'It's this: He was not afraid.'

Famed Washington Post reporters Carl Bernstein (L) and Bob Woodward (R) walk away from a lectern after speaking at the funeral for former Washington Post editor Benjamin Crowninsheld Bradlee at the National Cathedral . The former Post reporter recalled Bradlee's unwavering support of his young reporters as they confronted the Nixon administration. 'We live now in an era where too many of us are not unafraid,' Bernstein said. 'The dominant political and media culture is too often geared to the lowest common denominator - make noise, get eyeballs, cover the political battles like a football game and manufacture as much controversy as can be ginned up.' Woodward, who partnered with Bernstein in covering Watergate and now is an associate editor at the Post, said he loved Bradlee and remembered how he prowled the newsroom like a wolf in search of news, gossip or any signs of hidden truth. 'He was a journalistic warrior, unequaled and probably never to be matched,' Woodward said. 'He had the courage of an Army, a lion in all season. He wanted his newspaper ... to be like the Navy destroyer he served on in World War II.' Other journalists, including Tom Brokaw, also offered tributes. Donald Graham, whose mother, Katharine Graham, hired Bradlee to lead the newspaper the family controlled until last year, said Bradlee was greater, smarter and even more fun than his reputation.

At times, Bradlee was called a 'male chauvinist pig' for his language and style, but he also had the confidence to work for one of the few women leading a major company in the 1960s and 1970s, Graham said. 'The Post staff could be fairly described as hard bitten. They were a group of men and women who proudly had no heroes,' Graham said. 'But he was our hero, Benjamin C. Bradlee, and he will be always.' Ben C Bradlee, who transformed the Post into a venerated institution during his 26 years as its executive editor, passed away in his home in Washington last Tuesday night after his health declined due to Alzheimer's disease. Mr Bradlee joined the Post as managing editor in 1965 before becoming executive editor in 1968, bringing with him a vision that elevated the city paper to one of the top news outlets in the nation. The Washington Post would earn national acclaim - including more than a dozen Pulizer Prizes - and draw the ire of government officials for several stories pursued by the paper under Mr Bradlee. Legend: Ben Bradlee of the Washington Post was known for his fearsome pursuit of the truth and his long helm at the newspaper .

Mr Bradlee also oversaw the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, along with the New York Times, which revealed the extent of US military involvement in Vietnam. 'Ben Bradlee was the best American newspaper editor of his time and had the greatest impact on his newspaper of any modern editor,' said Donald E Graham, who succeeded his mother Katharine as publisher of the Washington Post.

"Curbing immigration to Britain would be a 'disaster', Tony Blair has claimed in a warning against Labour copying Ukip policies. The former prime minister said Labour must be 'really careful' of saying things that suggested Nigel Farage's party is justified in its policies. The intervention comes as Ed Miliband faces the prospect of Labour being defeated by Ukip in the election of a new police and crime commissioner in South Yorkshire. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Labour must deal with Ukip 'by what you believe' Labour has been stung by the dramatic rise in popularity of Ukip, only narrowly holding the previously safe seat of Heywood and Middleton in this month's by-election. Recent polls have put Ukip on as much as 19 per cent, with Labour neck and neck with the Tories. Some senior Labour figures, including rising star Chuka Umunna, have launched strongly-worded attacks on the 'absolutely vile' views of 'racists' in Ukip. However, Mr Miliband has come under pressure to take a tougher stance on immigration and Europe to prevent the loss of working class voters. Last week he announced that a Labour government would immediately bring in an Immigration Bill and said the EU 'needs to change if we are to deal with the problems of immigration'. But Mr Blair insisted Labour should focus on its own values and not appear to lend credibility to Ukip's policies on halting immigration and leaving the EU. He said the way to tackle the threat from Ukip was to 'deal with it by what you believe'. Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) is urged not to try to copy the policies of Ukip leader Nigel Farage (left) Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June . He told Progress magazine: 'Let's be clear: We don't think that Ukip's right, not on immigration and not on Europe - so the first thing you've got to be really careful of doing is ... saying things that suggest that they're kind of justified in their policy because what you're actually going to do is validate their argument when in fact you don't believe in it.' Stopping immigration would be 'a disaster for this country', he said. Labour must not 'end up chasing after the policies of a party like Ukip, who you don't agree with, whose policies would take this country backwards economically, politically, in every conceivable way, and who, ultimately, at the heart of what they do, have a rather nasty core of prejudice that none of us believe in, which you've actually got to take on and fight. So the way to deal with this is to deal with it by what you believe'. Mr Blair claimed the way David Cameron is dealing with the threat from Ukip 'doesn't do them any electoral favours at all'. He claimed the Tories would be better off at the ballot box 'if they actually stood up against these people and said 'you don't understand the way the world works today, your policies will take us backwards and we're not going there'.' Mr Blair added: 'There's a huge desire in a large part of the media in this country to return British politics to a traditional Tory party fighting a traditional Labour party.' That would lead to a 'traditional result', he warned. Ed Miliband is facing a battle to hold off Ukip in his own back yard today – as voters go to the polls in South Yorkshire to elect a new police commissioner. A defeat for Labour would be seen as a major blow for Mr Miliband whose Doncaster constituency lies in the South Yorkshire police force area. Today’s contest was sparked by the resignation of Labour’s previous police commissioner Shaun Wright – who stood down in the wake of the Rotherham child sex abuse scandal, where an estimated 1,400 children were abused over 16 years by Pakistani gangs. Labour leader Ed Miliband is facing a fight to hold off the growing Ukip threat in the party's heartlands . Ukip has exploited the child abuse scandal to attack Labour. Last week, the party launched a poster featuring a young woman with the slogan: ‘There are 1,400 reasons why you should not trust Labour again’. Nigel Farage told MailOnline the election was be close – despite his party finishing a distant fourth in the 2012 contest. He said: ‘It will be nip and tuck. We definitely feel that if we win this it will add fuel to the fire that from Birmingham northwards, if you vote Conservative you get Labour.’ Mr Farage hopes it can keep its current momentum going by securing the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner post following its recent by-election success in Clacton. Voters are going to the polls across the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster - but the turnout is expected to barely top 10 per cent amid widespread disinterest. Ukip’s candidate for the position is the retired police officer Jack Clarkson. Labour has chosen retired Anglican priest Alan Billings as its candidate – in a bid to distance itself from the Rotherham scandal. A lone voter enters an empty polling station on Herringthorpe Valley Road, Rotherham today, which had seen only nine voters by 10.30am . An empty polling station in Brinsworth, Rotherham today , which had seen less than five voters by 10.30am . An empty mobile library being used as a polling station on Rotherwood Avenue, Rotherham today, which had seen only two voters by 11am . There will be almost as much interest in how many of the 1,010,599 electorate bother to cast their votes as there will be on which of the four candidates wins when the by-election result is announced in Barnsley tomorrow. Mr Wright's initial refusal to step down highlighted the fact that there was no way to get rid of a PCC unless they had committed an offence. The saga surrounding his future further undermined confidence in the new PCC system, which had been dented first by the record low turnouts in 2012, and provoked furious calls for the law to be changed or the post to be simply abolished. The Lib Dems have branded the coalition experiment with directly-elected commissioners a failure and pledged to scrap them. The party decided not to field a candidate in the by-election for this reason . Labour has declared it is committed to scrapping them if it wins power in 2015. Ukip leader Nigel Farage with the party's candidate for the position of South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner Jack Clarkson (right) Mr Wright only resigned after weeks of pressure following the Jay Report which revealed how more than 1,400 children had been exploited by gangs of men in Rotherham. He was the councillor who oversaw children's services in the town between 2005 and 2010. But Labour's campaign to retain the post has been hampered by the controversy in Rotherham. Mr Farage has insisted Ukip can build the party's recent by-election victory in Clacton and close second in Heywood and Middleton by getting its first PCC elected. And his confidence has also been supported by strong Ukip showings in Rotherham's council elections this year and in the European elections in parts of South Yorkshire. But Ukip only came fourth when Mr Wright was elected in 2012. The English Democrats, came second two years ago and they believe they will still be the biggest rivals to Labour today's poll. Former police officer Jack Clarkson hopes to replace former Labour police commissioner Shaun Wright who stood down in the wake of Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal . Ukip has exploited the Rotherham child abuse scandal - where 1,400 children were abused - to attack Labour . English Democrats chairman Robin Tilbrook said his party has a high profile in South Yorkshire in the wake of it winning the Doncaster mayoral election in 2009 and pushing Labour hard in 2012. Four candidates have declared for the by-election: David Allen (English Democrats), Alan Billings (Labour), Jack Clarkson (Ukip), Ian Walker (Conservatives). Mr Allen came second to Mr Wright in the 2012 election. He is a trained foundry engineer and a sales manager from Doncaster who is married with two children. Dr Billings is a former deputy leader of Sheffield City Council and was once a parish priest in Sheffield. Mr Clarkson is leader of the Ukip group on Sheffield City Council. He is former police inspector in the city. Mr Walker is an engineer and a company managing director in Sheffield. He is married with four children. The turnout in South Yorkshire in 2012 was 14.93 per cent.","Former Prime Minister warns against copying Nigel Farage's party .

"Petrol prices across Australia are expected to rise in the next two weeks as the government introduces a new tariff on fuel companies. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann announced the new tax, which will increase from 38.143 cents a litre to 38.6 cents a litre from November 10, during a press conference on Tuesday. It is expected to cost the average Australian household, which consumes about 50 litres of petrol each week, an extra 40 cents a week by the end of the next financial year. However, if the opposition parties fail to approve the change when it is reviewed by parliament in 12 months time, Mr Cormann warned that the money would be returned to fuel companies rather than the paying motorists. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann announced the new tax, which will initially increase from 38.143 cents a litre to 38.6 cents a litre from November 10, on Tuesday . Senator Cormann explained that the government had bypassed the parliament and will use 'tariff proposals', to be tabled in parliament this week, to bring about the hike. He downplayed the effect the tax would have on motorists, describing it as a 'very modest' rise, but said the $2.2 billion dollars that it would raise for the government over four years would go far in providing structural reform. 'While the impact on individual households will be modest, this measure will provide a predictable and growing source of revenue, which will help the government boost its investment in job creating and productivity enhancing road infrastructure,' Senator Cormann said. 'In the budget, we've announced a record investment on infrastructure - $50 billion dollars - and our commitment remains for 100 per cent of the money collected by the fuel excise indexation to go into road infrastructure investment,' Senator Cormann told Sky News. The average Australian household, which consumes about 50L of petrol a week, is expected to eventually be paying an extra 40 cents a week . The Finance Minister told reporters the parliament's support would be needed to validate the measure within 12 months. 'If the measure is not validated within 12 months - and we're confident it will be, by the way - the money would have to go back to those that have paid the excise and the duty,' Senator Cormann said. 'It will go back to fuel manufacturers and to fuel importers, who would essentially have a windfall gain at that time.' Opposition leader Bill Shorten, called the move a 'new sneaky tax on Australian motorists' and slammed the federal government for being 'so addicted to new taxes' However, Mr Cormann said there would be 'no requirement' for fuel manufacturers and importers to pass the windfall on to road users. He said he expected Labor and the Greens to 'see sense' within a year and that the money should be used for roads and not go back to fuel companies. Opposition leader Bill Shorten, called the move a 'new sneaky tax on Australian motorists' and slammed Prime Minister Tony Abbott for going back on election promises that his government would not see the introduction of any new taxes. Senator Cormann revealed the tax would raise $2.2 billion dollars for the government over four years . He said the move came less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament he wanted a 'mature discussion' about tax. 'Yet today he ambushes Australian motorists, ambushes the parliament of Australia and through the back door has launched a sneak attack on the wallets and cost of living of every Australian,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Canberra. 'This is outrageous. He doesn't have the courage to take his new taxes to an election. He is desperate to prop up his unfair budget.'","Finance Minister Mathias Cormann announced the new tax on Tuesday .

"A young man's footage of being bitten by a black snake as he calmly stands still has gone viral on social media. You grow up being told to keep not to move if you are unfortunate enough to come across snake and they will leave you alone - but for one guy this age-old trick didn't quite go to plan. Jono Roberts, from Forbes in central west NSW, posted a video on his Facebook page of a one-and-a-half metre snake slithering towards him, when he was only wearing thongs, before it strikes out at his right foot. Scroll down for video . The video shows the snake slowly approaching Jono as is he calmly stands in the middle of the road . The snake winds around Jono's right ankle before suddenly striking out at him . Jono offered wise words of wisdom when he posted the footage by pointing out that standing still when encountering a snake is not always a sure bet. 'Tried the old stand still trick. Always show respect and never get too complacent,' Jono commented. The video shows the snake slowly approaches Jono, who is standing in the middle of the road, and winds around his right ankle before suddenly biting him. Jono was so shocked (and probably in pain) that he kicked the scaly reptile about a metre away as he exclaims 'f***!' as his thong then fell off his foot onto the ground. The footage has gone nuts online with more than 3,000 views and almost 5,500 shares. There has been a mixed reaction from social media users with some really impressed with the video. Andrew Robbo Robinson described it as: 'This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life.' While Luke Braid posted: 'sweet footage mate'.

Others comments on the insanity of even thinking to film such a scary moment as he was also described as 'crazy', a 'nutter' and a 'loose unit'. While Jason Craig Steward pointed out that how Jono experienced a lucky escape. 'Your (sic) a special guy Jono that didn't look like a warning bite he definitely droped a few mls in you.'

"European migrants should not move to Britain unless they have a job lined up, George Osborne suggested. The Chancellor insisted that European Union freedom of movement rules were not created to allow people to live off the welfare state in other countries. But in an escalation of tensions between London and Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel today made clear that the general principle of freedom of movement in the EU is 'not negotiable'. Chancellor George Osborne today insisted that EU freedom of information rules did not envisage 'people coming who don't have job offers' or moving into a life on benefits . Mr Osborne today visited the Meterolink Trafford Depot in Manchester, where he became one of the first customers on the new tram to Manchester Airport . David Cameron is under increasing pressure to tackle EU immigration, which has fuelled a rise in the number of people moving to Britain. A number of ideas floated by senior Tories in recent weeks have been dismissed as illegal or unworkable. Downing Street today admitted that the Prime Minister still does not know how to curb immigration, telling journalists: 'No final decisions have been taken.' Instead of imposing quotas or caps on the number of people who could move to Britain, the PM is being urged to focus on limiting access to the benefits system for the unemployed. However, Number 10 insiders insist he is determined to tackle the 'huge numbers of people' who move to the UK for work. One proposal would see European migrants banned from the UK unless they have guaranteed work – and would get kicked out after three months if they could not support themselves. Mr Osborne insisted that Germany understands 'the disquiet that is caused amongst British people'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'You have people coming from other parts of Europe here to claim our benefits, who don't necessarily have jobs to go to. 'This is creating a huge pressure on public services and the British public want this addressed.' He added: 'We're going to do this in a calm and rational way, but the British people want this addressed; we're employed by the British people and that's what we're going to do. 'What we're going to address is this question of how freedom of movement operates in the 21st century. 'It was never envisaged that you would have such large numbers of people coming, people coming who don't have job offers, people who move onto our benefit system – although we've been able to tighten that up in recent months, but it's still the case that they can do that. 'And that causes a lot of public unhappiness because they think it's unfair. Of course, these are welfare payments paid for by hard-working British taxpayers.' David Cameron is being forced to change his planned reform of immigration rules to win Angela Merkel's support . What Berlin says about freedom of movement . German government source: 'Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.' Angela Merkel's spokesman: 'The general principle of freedom of movement in the European Union is not negotiable.' What London says . Chancellor George Osborne: 'You have people coming from other parts of Europe here to claim our benefits, who don't necessarily have jobs to go to. This is creating a huge pressure on public services and the British public want this addressed.' Downing Street source: 'We are talking about numbers. Overall numbers are too high.' Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith: 'All I know is that the work that we have done is to get rid of the pull factor; the Prime Minister’s always made clear that there are limits in all of this, but I wouldn’t get engaged in a debate about principles. I always think to myself when people start debating principles, what actually happens is they lose the reality of what is happening on the ground.' A Downing Street source insisted in addition to tackling abuse of the benefits system, Mr Cameron had made clear he wants to limit the overall number of migrants to Britain. 'We are talking about numbers. Overall numbers are too high. We have significantly cut migration from outside the EU,' the source told MailOnline. 'We are now in a position where the UK economy is performing much more strongly... and huge numbers of people are coming here from those European countries to work in the UK and that is now an issue.' However German Chancellor Angela Merkel has fired a warning shot at the Prime Minister, suggesting she would rather see Britain leave the EU than allow the Prime Minister to tear up its rules on free movement of labour. The Chancellor warned the Prime Minister that he is reaching a 'point of no return' by pushing for reform of the bloc's sacred free movement system. The pair clashed at a summit in Brussels last month, German magazine Der Spiegel said. Citing senior officials, it said Mrs Merkel told Mr Cameron he was nearing a 'point of no return' with plans to introduce quotas for the number of EU workers who can come to Britain. She threatened to abandon her efforts to keep Britain in the EU unless he backed down. One government insider was quoted on Radio Bavaria saying: 'The time for talking is close to over. 'Mrs Merkel feels she has done all she can to placate the UK, but will not accept immigration curbs from EU member states under any circumstances. It has come to a Mexican stand-off and it is now a question of who blinks first.' Today Mrs Merkel's official spokesman, Steffen Seibert, insisted that Germany wants Britain to remain an 'active and engaged' member. But he stressed that Mrs Merkel has also made it very clear that 'the general principle of freedom of movement in the European Union is not negotiable'. National Insurance numbers (NINOs) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the EU, up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed . George Osborne is to seek a deal on cutting Britain's shock £1.7billion EU bill at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels this week. The Chancellor will lobby other member states to look again at the rules which hammered the UK, while giving rebates to the likes of France and Germany. Downing Street said the government was still examining the detail of the rules used by EU officials to calculate the astonishing demand, linked to better than expected economy growth. David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'What's clear is that there are a number of issues at play here. 'There is still more work to do to understand the forecasts, how these compare to other countries.' Any new deal on EU migration will have to be agreed by 28 member states. Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said: 'The point we are making is when the founding fathers established the European Union and introduced the principle of free movement it was about labour and how  countries integrated in the single market. 'The mass migration that we have seen with new countries joining, the impact on other populations in countries like the UK, free movement in order to claim benefits, these are all ways that have developed and evolved.' Senior Tories want the government to limit access to tax credits for new arrivals to the UK. Syed Kamall, the leader of the Conservatives in the European parliament, said claiming benefits should be linked to contributions to the welfare system. He told The Times: 'One of the problems we face is that we have a universal benefits system, whereas other countries have the contributory benefit system.' He suggested that all benefits, including tax credits, would only be available to someone who had paid tax. It would cover everyone, so it does not discriminate against EU migrants. Mr Kamall added: 'Anyone who wants to get benefits would have to pay in for two years. 'I'd like us to say if we win the next election that benefits from the end of 2017 have to be contributory. That gives people now in the system time to contribute.' It is the latest idea to emerge in the Tory search for a policy which will satisfy demands for tougher controls, woo Ukip voters and be agreed by all 28 EU member states. An earlier proposal to impose quotas on access to National Insurance numbers, needed to work in the UK, was dismissed as 'illegal' by outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Another option was to apply an 'emergency brake' to the numbers which could come from a particular country if, for example, their economic collapse led to large numbers flocking to the UK in search for work. Mr Cameron has promised to put immigration at the heart of his plan to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU, before holding at in-out referendum by 2017. However, his speech setting out his plans will now be delayed until after the Rochester and Strood by-election, which Ukip is on course to win after the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless. In 2011, Mr Cameron promised to bring borders and immigration under control: 'No ifs. No buts.' He vowed that net migration would be in 'the order of tens of thousands each year', but latest figures put it at over 200,000.","New ideas emerge in rush to find a way to curb immigration from Europe .

Roman Miller, 48, was caught with an empty bottle of whisky in his gym bag after police were called when his sports car was seen being driven erratically in Plymouth, Devon. The orthopaedic surgeon also had a hip flask 'full of alcohol' when police found him in the changing rooms of a fitness club on Sunday, Plymouth magistrates court heard today. Roman Miller, 48, had been 'depressed' over the possible closure of his workplace in an NHS treatment centre . Mr Miller had been 'depressed' in recent weeks after his future was thrown into 'limbo' with the threatened closure of his workplace at an NHS treatment centre in Plymouth, the court was told. Prosecutor Angela Furniss said police had been notified about a possible drink driver by members of the public. 'They observed the car coming to a complete stop, racing off at speed and mounting a kerb twice.' She added witnesses saw Miller drive into the car park of Virgin Active Health Club at Derriford, Plymouth, and said he had been falling out of his Porsche and swaying as he made his way into the club. 'He was located in the changing rooms. There were visible effects of having alcohol: glazed eyes, unsteady on his feet and smelling of intoxication. Witnesses saw Mr Miller 'swaying' after he fell out of his car and made his way to the Virgin Active Health Club . 'He repeatedly told police they wouldn't be able to prove it as they didn't stop him while driving.' He failed an initial breath test but failed to later provide a second sample to police after he was taken into custody on Sunday evening. Miss Furniss said: 'When they looked in his bag there was an empty bottle of Grants whisky, a 70cl bottle of whisky and a hip flask full of alcohol. 'He was adamant he had done nothing wrong and it couldn't be proven he'd driven.' Mr Miller gave a third breath test that night which was still high, she said. Roger Page, defending, said Mr Miller had been feeling stressed about the uncertainty of his job at the NHS Peninsula Treatment Centre which could close next Spring because of falling waiting lists. 'For the last four weeks or so, workwise, he's been left in limbo. He has been getting depressed about that and the ramifications that may have.' He said Mr Miller is seeking GP help to discuss his alcohol intake. 'He seems like a rational man who is starting to address his problem.' Mr Miller, of Warspite Gardens, Plymouth, was banned from driving for 18 months, fined £1,000 for failing to give a breath sample and ordered to pay £205 in court costs.","Roman Miller also had hip flask 'full of alcohol' at a fitness club in Plymouth .

"John F Kennedy Airport has begun new screenings for West African passengers flying into New York from countries being ravaged by the Ebola virus. As many as 150 travelers per day who arrive from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers in the hope of keeping the disease out of the United States. Anybody who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an Ebola sufferer, and from there can be quarantined if necessary. Scroll down for video . New screenings: Public health workers are now using contactless thermometers like the one above to screen potential Ebola victims. Pictured is a test taking place in Casablance, Morocco - much closer to the outbreak . High-tech: This is how the advanced thermometers will work without putting public health workers at risk . Roll-out: The tests will only affect some 150 passengers per day from the worst-hit countries. Pictured above are queues at JFK . The new scheme, which began today, will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. Between them the five airports carry around 95 per cent of passengers from the countries worst afflicted by Ebola. No airlines fly direct to the U.S. from the three countries. But Homeland Security can track passengers' routes even if they make several stops. Announcement: Gil Kerlikowske, Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, explains the new screenings to be implemented at JFK and other airports . Quarantine: Authorities across the country have been making ready for Ebola. Pictured are staff at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York, standing in an isolation room . Safety first: Staff at Laguardia airport put on protective gloves after being given classes on dealing with Ebola . Airlines from Morocco, France and Belgium are still flying in and out of West Africa. President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the new screening measures are 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place. First U.S. victim: Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who flew to Texas, died of Ebola this week . Border Patrol agents already look for people who are obviously ill, as do flight crews. Passengers are also screened for the virus when they leave West Africa. Public health workers are expecting some false alarms from travelers who have a high temperature from other illnesses. Ebola isn't contagious until symptoms begin, and it spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of patients. However, even these measures are not a foolproof block on the disease. The extra screening wouldn't have identified Thomas Eric Duncan when he arrived from Liberia last month - because he had no symptoms while traveling. Duncan was the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S.. He died on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas.","JFK is the first airport to start new screening - Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Newark Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta will follow .

"When you're a size 30, finding a beautiful wedding dress isn't always easy. But now two best friends from Essex have come to the rescue with a bridal boutique that only stocks plus size gowns. At Curves & Couture, sizes range from a size 20 to a size 36 - and bigger brides from all over the UK are flocking to Jo Cooke and Alison Law's door. 'Why should you endure the humiliation of having a dress hung around your neck or pinned against your body or being paraded around in front of a group of size 10 skinnies in a dress that quite obviously doesn't fit you?' says Cooke. 'I think until recently, that's been the only option.' Scroll down for video . Women in charge: Alison Law (left) and Jo Cooke (right) are the owners of a plus size only bridal boutique . Cooke, and her friend Law, have been friends for more than a decade and set up the shop after being unable to find anything to wear for their own weddings. 'Now there are all these beautiful gowns and I feel like I want to try them on when they come in,' says Law, sadly. 'Because I couldn't have that and it was quite upsetting at the time. If I could do it [getting married] again, I would. And I will one day.' For the customers, Law and Cooke's shop is a haven or, as Cooke pithily puts it, 'a little slice of plus size heaven'. One such client is Jenna Merritt, a 29-year-old from Essex who turned to Curves and Couture ahead of her wedding to now-husband, Chris. Pretty and with long blonde hair, she says her experience of searching for dresses in 'normal-sized' bridal boutiques left her so traumatised, the search had to go on hold for eight months. Overjoyed: 29-year-old Jemma Merritt from Essex is one of the plus size brides to wed in Curves and Couture . 'It's such a big thing putting on your dress,' she says. 'If the venue burnt down, I wouldn't care but if my dress wasn't right, I wouldn't get married. I wouldn't. 'I didn't really want to go wedding dress shopping,' she continues. 'I went to one place and had a panic attack in the dress. 'I was like: ""Get me out of here, get me out of here, get me out of here"". I  had such a bad reaction to the way they made me feel in the shop, I didn't try on any dresses for about eight months.' Everybody deserves the chance to feel special on their day, whether they're black, white, yellow, green, pink with polka dots,' adds Law, furiously. 'We don't care.' The only thing we specify is that you've got to be fat,' adds Cooke. 'It's no good coming here if you're size 12 because we've got nothing for you.' But what really tugs at her heart-strings is the reaction of the brides themselves. 'It's not unusual for someone to walk through those doors and cry,' she reveals. 'Once we say we've got this dress in a size 20 to a 36, they can be quite overwhelmed that there is somewhere where you can try on those dresses. 'We were those girls, we were there,' she continues. 'We've been there, we've done it. Alison had to wear a bridesmaid's dress.' Nerves: Lindsey Kent, 28, from Cambridgeshire said just trying on dresses made her nervous at first . Now the pair are to star in a documentary, My Big Beautiful Wedding Dress, which follows three brides, among them Merritt and Cooke herself, in the run up to their weddings. But while Merritt and Cooke are confident in their stunning wedding gowns, for the final bride, Lindsey Kent, 28, from Cambridgeshire, just the thought of putting on a wedding dress is hard to stomach. 'When I first turned up [at the shop], I was really anxious and concerned,' she admits. 'I was quiet and sort of... not uncomfortable but panicking about it. 'I suppose for me it's the dress because I don't wear dresses. But by the end of it, I was loving it and I wanted to try on every dress. And then I found my dress.' For Kent, the issue was compounded by the loss of her sister Lisa who died in a car accident a decade ago. 'In 2003, my sister was killed in a car accident which devastated the family and for a while we didn't know what to do with ourselves,' she says, sadly. 'Then I found Mark and started my new life with him, even though it was still very hard. But then I had my daughter and I saw my parents smile and it brought new light. 'With the wedding, it's extra emotional because I personally would have gone abroad to get married because I hate the whole being centre of attention thing. It's just not me. 'But after losing my sister, I think my dad has the right to walk me down the aisle. We were joined at the hip and I allowed my sister to do all the talking for me. Thrilled: Cooke says she felt like a bride for the first time when she renewed her vows with husband Kevin . 'Now she's not here, I have the responsibility to do that for him and I'm going to make sure that happens.' Such is Kent's lack of confidence, even fittings proved a challenge although she says the confidence classes run by Cooke and Law helped a lot. 'The master class that they provide is really good and the fact that they offer it to brides and help with their confidence. It really helped me. She adds: 'I've always been a bigger sort of girl but I put a lot of weight on after my sister [died]. Mark loves me for who I am and so do my parents. 'My mum has tried to get me to lose weight but that's not for my looks, it's because she's concerned for my health. My wedding will be a happy day but there's a lot of heartache with it.' One bride who has no such qualms is Cooke, who is renewing her vows with Kevin, her husband of 15 years, in a dress from Curves and Couture. 'I want to look a million dollars,' she says. 'I'm never going to be a skinny girl but I want to look good and like I'm rocking that dress. And I want Kev to go, That will be my wife. Again.' But even Cooke, who has lost four stone over the last 12 months thanks to a tough new gym routine, admits to feeling nervous when it comes to looking at herself in her bridal finery. 'I don't look in the mirror if I can help it. I don't look because I don't like what I see. I don't want to be skinny. All I've ever wanted to do is be accepted. 'My mentality is a fat girl's mentality because I've been a fat girl for over 45 years and I will always feel like a fat girl in a skinny girl's body.' She adds: 'My first wedding dress was a size 26 and it was all there was. Kev has told me every day for the last 15 years that I look beautiful. 'The only day he didn't tell me was on our wedding day and that's stuck with me. So if he doesn't do it this time, there will be no vows. 'This will be the fourth time I walk down the aisle and the first time I feel like a bride,' she smiles. 'And I know Kev will love it.","Curves and Couture in Essex caters exclusively for plus size brides .

"Anger: Rape charities and BBC listeners have complained after Michael Buerk criticised Ched Evans' rape victim for being drunk . The BBC apologised today after presenter Michael Buerk criticised the woman raped by Ched Evans for being drunk when she was attacked. The veteran presenter said that the woman, now 22, deserved no 'credit' because she 'could barely stand' on the night she was raped by the disgraced footballer, 25. Rape charities said today his words were 'deeply offensive' to the victim and others who have suffered sex attacks. She had drunk two glasses of wine, four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped, and the jury unanimously agreed she could not have consented to sex with Evans in 2012. Mr Buerk, 68, was discussing the attack ahead of his Radio 4 show Moral Maze this evening, which will discuss whether Evans should return to football. He said: 'Nobody comes out of the Ched Evans rape case with any credit – not the victim who'd drunk so much she could barely stand, nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances'. Evans raped his victim in a Rhyl Premier Inn in 2012 after his footballer friend Clayton McDonald, who was cleared of rape, texted Evans on the way there saying: 'I've got a bird'. McDonald had sex with the victim, before Evans arrived and raped her, as two others filmed it through the window. Rape charities have reacted furiously to Mr Buerk's words and demanded he apologises. Rape Crisis England and Wales spokesman Katie Russell said: 'It is difficult to stress just how inappropriate and potentially damaging this morning's live trail from the presenter for his programme was. 'To infer that being drunk is in any way 'morally' comparable to committing the serious and violent crime of rape is deeply offensive. 'Let us not forget that drinking is not a crime; rape most definitely is. Let us not forget that sex with someone incapable of giving their consent because through alcohol consumption is rape'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Prosecuted: Ched Evans, pictured yesterday with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, was found guilty of rape because his victim was unable to consent . 'We sincerely hope that Michael Buerk and the BBC will issue a full apology as a matter of urgency.' The spokesman added: 'It is partly because of the kind of shaming, victim-blaming attitudes voiced by Michael Buerk this morning that currently only 15% of all those who are raped choose to report to the police' 'Nobody comes out of the Ched Evans rape case with any credit – not the victim who'd drunk so much she could barely stand, nor the two footballers who had sex with her in the most sordid of circumstances. 'The jury convicted only one of rape and now, after serving half his five-year sentence, ashamed but unrepentant, Ched Evans has been released and there's talk of a £500,000 contract to return to his club, Sheffield United. 'But the internet is aflame. The victim, hiding like an IRA informer in official anonymity, is being hounded by internet trolls. So is Evans' girlfriend, abused as a gold digger for standing by him. 150,000 have signed an online petition calling for the club not to have him back, but the fans chant 'Super Ched Evans' at home games – a very modern moral mess. 'Difficult, incendiary questions about consent, remorse, atonement, the heightened moral responsibility of public figures, but it all boils down to one question: should Ched Evans play again for The Blades? The Moral Maze, after the news at eight tonight.' Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB) told MailOnline said: 'The only person in this case who bears no responsibility is the victim. Nothing she did makes her responsible for being a victim of rape. 'Michael Buerk's conflation of rape with sex is a deeply damaging rape myth and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the laws on rape and sexual violence within the UK. 'Evans did not have sex with the victim. He raped her. The only 'sordid circumstance' as Evans' choice to rape a woman who was incapable of consent'. The BBC said Mr Buerk's words had not been intended to offend. A spokesman said: 'There was no intention to suggest that the victim was in any way at fault, and we apologise if the way this live trail was phrased suggested this. Tonight's Moral Maze will ask whether a convicted rapist who maintains his innocence should be entitled to get his job back.' TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm' during a panel discussion on ITV's Loose Women. She also said the victim had 'had too much to drink'. More than 150,000 people have signed a petition demanding he is not allowed to play football again. Ched Evans continues to cause controversy and maintains he is innocent. He was released from prison last week and seen smiling in public with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, close to her parents' home in Cheshire. Police are investigating his family  because CCTV footage of his victim was published on his official website. The woman is seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans, who was released from prison last week. North Wales Police told MailOnline they are 'looking into' the post named: 'Too drunk to consent, too drunk to remember?', which uses the footage from the night of the rape two years ago. The woman he attacked, 22, continues to be targeted by trolls who support Evans. She has had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. Website: Evans, who despite his conviction maintains his innocence, raped the girl in a Premier Inn, pictured arriving with Clayton McDonald, in an attack also filmed by friends . She was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a 'slag', 'tramp', 'bitch' and 'whore'. Police put her 'relocation package' together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy on ITV's Loose Women by claiming his crime was 'non violent' and also said the victim had 'had too much to drink' But Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000, and now claim to have revealed her new identity. She may have to take another new name and move again. North Wales Police Detective Superintendent Jo Williams said: 'The victim in this case has been in regular contact with officers responsible for her care and she is receiving appropriate support at this difficult time. She has been fully appraised of all her options.' The BBC said today it has had nine complaints about Mr Buerk's comments, and it is not the first time Michael Buerk has caused controversy. Previously he complained the 'shift in the balance of power between the sexes' has gone too far, saying 'life is now lived in accordance with women's rules'. He has cited females in the top jobs in BBC broadcasting as an example, saying 'these are the people who decide what we see and hear'. Buerk also complained that men have been reduced to 'sperm donors' in an interview with  the Radio Times magazine in 2005. He also said recently described Tess Daly as 'a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing'. He called the BBC coverage of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee river pageant in 2012 was 'cringingly inept'and called the presenters 'airheads' 'On the screen, a succession of Daytime airheads preened themselves, or gossiped with even more vacuous D-list 'celebrities'. With barely an exception, they were cringingly inept.' He has also said TV presenters who got their jobs through their beauty have no right to complain if they're axed when their looks fade.","BBC apologises after Michael Buerk said that the victim deserved no 'credit' and 'could barely stand'

"Rupert Murdoch’s daughter has bought a luxury home for £38.5million just days after it was revealed her marriage was over. TV boss Elisabeth Murdoch, 46, bought the secluded detached house following revelations she and 50-year-old PR guru Matthew Freud were divorcing. The home in St John’s Wood, north-west London, includes a main seven-bedroom brick house in front of a three-bedroom mews home. Stunning: The home in St John’s Wood includes a main seven-bedroom brick house in front of a three-bedroom mews home . Luxury: The 12,723 sq ft house is described as an ‘ambassadorial residence’ with a driveway that has space for up to ten cars . A local property source told the London Evening Standard: ‘She exchanged and completed on Friday.’ The couple, worth a total of £260million, are divorcing amid rumours of a conflict between Mr Freud and his father-in-law. Miss Murdoch’s new 12,723 sq ft house is described as an ‘ambassadorial residence’ with a driveway that has space for up to ten cars. It dates back to the 1920s and was on the market for £40million before being bought by Miss Murdoch, reported the Standard. After a refurbishment the home has a main bedroom suite with separate bathrooms and dressing rooms, five bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. It also comes with a 725 sq ft drawing room with bow windows, while the ground floor has a 38ft-long formal dining room with capacity to seat 20 people. And on the lower ground floor of the air-conditioned home, Miss Murdoch has a cinema room, gym, ‘massage room’ and games room. Miss Murdoch joins other high-profile buyers in moving to St John’s Wood, such as fashion designer Stefano Gabbana and artist Damien Hirst.

Spacious: The ground floor of the home in St John's Wood has a 38ft-long formal dining room with capacity to seat 20 people . Kitchen area: Rupert Murdoch’s daughter bought the luxury home for £38.5million just days after it was revealed her marriage was over . One local agent told the Standard: ‘Marylebone is the new Mayfair and has made these parts of north London fashionable and interesting again. Former couple: TV boss Elisabeth Murdoch bought the house in north-west London following the end of her marriage to 50-year-old PR guru Matthew Freud . ‘It is now perceived to be desirable and good value compared with Mayfair and Belgravia.’ Earlier this month Miss Murdoch was seen without her wedding ring as it emerged she was to divorce Mr Freud after 13 years. Mr Freud and Miss Murdoch who have two children aged 13 and seven, were expected to be granted a decree nisi last week. Sources said one factor in the breakdown of their marriage was the antagonism between the PR chief and Mr Murdoch. Mr Freud took the side of his old friend Mr Blair when his 83-year-old father-in-law filed for divorce from Wendi Deng, 45, last year. It happened after he had become angered by claims the former prime minister met his wife several times without his knowledge. Friends of Mr Blair have always insisted his relationship with Miss Deng is entirely platonic. Relations between Mr Freud and Mr Murdoch then soured further. This culminated in him banning his father-in-law from attending his 50th birthday party at his £8million Oxfordshire mansion last November. Mr Freud said last December: ‘I will be eternally grateful to Rupert Murdoch for producing Elisabeth, who is practically perfect in every way. ‘Our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and I regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted. ‘But we have had good times as well as bad times, we both love his daughter and his grandchildren, if not always each other. I do not believe anything else is terribly important.’ The couple are expected to split their £260million fortune equally. Miss Murdoch personally made £130million in 2011 when she sold her TV production company Shine, whose hit programmes include MasterChef, to her father’s company News Corporation. Her husband, who is the great-grandson of psychoanalysis pioneer Sigmund Freud, founded PR company Freud Communications and is worth an estimated £100million. They met in 1997, when they were both married to other people, and were immediately attracted to each other. Having left their spouses, Miss Murdoch and Mr Freud had their first child, Charlotte, in November 2000. They briefly separated before marrying at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire in 2001. Their second child, Samson, was born in January 2007. The couple’s parties were legendary for their heady mix of celebrities, senior politicians, media stars and colourful entrepreneurs. Their combined wealth was estimated at £260million in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which ranked them as one of the top 25 wealthiest couples in the UK.

"The 44-year-old son of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has been discharged from the Navy following just one months service after testing positive for cocaine, it has emerged. Hunter Biden, a Yale graduate and high-profile lawyer, was an ensign in the Navy Reserve but was kicked out after failing a drug test,The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The married father-of-three, who only chose to enter into the military part-time last year, at the age of 43, reported for duty at the Navy Public Affairs Support Element East in Norfolk, Virginia, on May 7, 2013. However in June, the following month, Biden tested positive for cocaine during a urinalysis, according to The Journal. Scroll down for video . Kicked out for cocaine: Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter was discharged from the Navy Reserve in February after he tested positive for cocaine, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Hunter Biden is pictured here at a Town & Country event in New York on May 28, 2014 - a few months after he was discharged . No comment: Vice President Joe Biden - seen here with son Hunter Biden at the Duke Georgetown NCAA college basketball game in Washington in 2010 -is yet to comment on reports his son was booted from the Navy Reserves . He was officially discharged in February this year. In a statement released to The Wall Street Journal, Biden apologized for his actions, but did not address the reason for his discharge. '(It was) the honor of my life to serve in the U.S. Navy, and I deeply regret and am embarrassed that my actions led to my administrative discharge,' the statement to the newspaper said. 'I respect the Navy’s decision. 'With the love and support of my family, I’m moving forward.' The vice president's office have not commented on the reports. The Navy would not comment on the reasons behind Biden's discharge as per restrictions of the Privacy Act. Navy personnel who are discharged from the military because of a failed drug test don’t receive honorable discharges. While Biden did not address why he was discharged in his statement, he mentioned it was an 'administrative discharge'. Adding to the revelations, The Journal also reported that Biden needed two waivers in order to be accepted into the Reserves - one on account of his age, and a second 'because of a drug-related incident when he was a young man'. The newspaper cited sources close to the matter. The Vice President Biden joked that his son’s decision to join the Navy late in life was one of poor judgement while speaking at the American Legion’s Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball in 2013. 'We have a lot of bad judgment in my family,' Biden said. 'My son over 40 just joined the Navy to be sworn in.'

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (L) waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden at the airport in Beijing December 4, 2013 . Hunter Biden is the youngest son of Joe Biden and wife Jill Biden, who is Hunter's stepmother. A self-proclaimed 'military family', his brother, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, served in the state’s National Guard. Beau Biden was also deployed to Iraq for one year while in the guard and has recently spoken of plans to run for governor in 2016. According to The Washington Post, Hunter Biden accepted a position on the board of Burisma Holdings, the Ukraine's largest private gas firm, in May this year - three months after his reported discharge. The appointment attracted controversy, as Vice President Biden has moved to influence energy policies and other issues of the Ukrainian government as it battles Russia and pro-Russian separatists to control the county, Fox News reported. Married: Hunter and Kathleen Biden attend a reception for British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to America, in Washington D.C.  on March 14, 2012 . Hunter Biden also serves as managing partner at Rosemont Seneca Partners, a Washington DC-based investment firm, and is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University. His biological mother, Joe Biden's first wife, Neilia Hunter, and his younger sister, Naomi, were killed in an automobile accident in 1972. Hunter and Beau Biden were seriously injured. Joe Biden went on to marry second wife, Jill, with whom he had a daughter, Ashley. Hunter Biden and his wife Kathleen have three daughters - Naomi, Finnegan, and Maisy. The revelation of Hunter Biden's administrative discharge for drugs is not the first time the family of the Vice President has been rocked by scandal. In 2009, The New York Post ran a series of stories about the youngest of the clan, Ashley Biden, now 33. The newspaper claimed a person claiming to be a friend was shopping around a video, purportedly of the social worker snorting lines of white powder at a party. 'On a 90-second clip from the video that The Post viewed, a young woman strongly resembling Ashley is seen taking a red straw from her mouth, bending over a desk, inserting the straw into her nostril and snorting lines of white powder,' the newspaper reported. However the video was never purchased and subsequently not released publicly. 'Party girl': Ashley Biden with her father in 2013 (left) and getting married to Dr. Howard Krein in Delaware in 2012 (right) At the same time The Post reported of Biden's reptuation as a wild party girl in college. One Tulane University classmate, Nat Berman, told the paper he had to bail Biden out of jail after she was arrested for marijuana possesion as a freshmen. The incident occurred in New Orleans in September 1999 but does not appear on Biden's record. In 2012, Ashley Biden and her husband, Dr. Howard Krein, were married.","Hunter Biden, 44, is a Yale graduate, lawyer, and father-of-three .

"Mexican security forces on . Thursday captured the leader of the once-feared Juarez Cartel in . the country's restive north, making it the second drug kingpin . to fall in just over a week. Vicente Carrillo, 51, long-time head of the Juarez Cartel, . was a fierce rival of Joaquin ""Shorty"" Guzman, the leader of the . Sinaloa Cartel and the world's most wanted drug boss until his . capture in February. A turf war between the two cartels in 2009-2011 unleashed a . bloodbath in Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state on Mexico's . border with Texas, making it one of the most violent places in . the world. Carrillo, alias 'The Viceroy', was captured after . identifying himself with a false name at a checkpoint in the . northern city of Torreon, national security commissioner Monte . Rubido said in a press conference. Nabbed: Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords and leader of the Cartel de Juarez""drug trafficking organization, is arrested by Mexican Federal Police at Torreon City in Northern Mexico . End of an era: Carrillo had been the leader of ""Cartel de Juarez"" drug trafficking organization since 1997 . Federal policemen escort Vicente Carrillo, drug kingpin of the Juarez Cartel, upon their arrival to the hangar belonging to the office of the Attorney's General in Mexico City on October 9, 2014 . Finally: Vicente Carrillo Fuentes was arrested by Mexican Federal Police at Torreon City in Northern Mexico . No shots were fired in his arrest, Rubido said, adding that . Carrillo was wanted on five charges related to organized crime . and drug trafficking. 'The criminal organization that he led up until today led to . the strengthening in Chihuahua of various groups that at one . time contributed to Juarez being considered one of the most . violent cities in the world,' Rubido said. United States had put a $5 million bounty on Carrillo's . head, while Mexico had offered a 30 million peso ($2.24 million) reward. President Enrique Pena Nieto took office two years ago . pledging to end a wave of violence that has killed around . 100,000 people since the start of 2007. Although homicides have . fallen on his watch, other crimes have increased, including . extortion and kidnapping. Pena Nieto has been under fire over the past week over the . apparent massacre of dozens of trainee teachers in southwest . Mexico at the hands of gang members and police. He hailed the . capture on Twitter on Thursday. A keen horseman who used a network of cattle ranches in the . northern state of Chihuahua to store shipments of Colombian . cocaine, Carrillo took over the Juarez Cartel in 1997 after his . brother Amado, known as 'The Lord of the Skies', died during . plastic surgery. Carrillo's capture comes just days after Hector Beltran . Leyva, one of the most notorious Mexican drug lords still at . large, was captured by soldiers in a picturesque town in central . Mexico popular with American retirees. Drug boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes sits after his arrest, in a helicopter in the hangar of the Mexican Attorney Generals Office in Mexico City, Thursday October 9, 2014 . It also comes as the government is grappling with public . outrage at an apparent massacre of trainee teachers by police in . league with gang members, which has triggered mass . anti-government protests. Alejandro Hope, an independent security consultant who used . to work for Mexican state intelligence, said Carrillo and the . Juarez Cartel were not as powerful as they used to be. Nonetheless, he added, the capture of Carrillo was part of . larger phasing out of the era of the Mexican drug kingpin. Guzman was arrested in February, and most of his longtime . business partners and enemies are now either dead or jailed. 'In lots of ways, it's the end of the era of the narco,' Hope said, adding that international drug smuggling is now no . longer controlled by large, hierarchical organizations like . Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, but rather by smaller, more violent . groups with less clear organizational structures. Carrillo, a devout Catholic, was seen as more discreet than . his flamboyant brother, but his position was weakened by the . violence in Ciudad Juarez that claimed nearly 12,000 lives . between 2008 and 2012 alone. The government said his organization was dealt a major blow . in 2009 when soldiers in Mexico City arrested his nephew, . Vicente Carrillo Leyva, accused of being the No.2 of the Juarez . Cartel. Most-wanted: An undated handout picture shows alleged Mexican leader of the Juarez drug cartel Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, frequently referred to by his alias El Viceroy, who was arrested by the Federal Police Thursday . Drug experts say Carrillo, who had a secondary role in the . Juarez Cartel when his brother was in charge, once ran about a . fifth of the drug business in Mexico. Carrillo was considered a priority by the Drug Enforcement . Administration. Hitmen for the Juarez Cartel were behind the high-profile . murders of Lesley Enriquez, an employee of the U.S. consulate in . Ciudad Juarez, as well as her husband and the husband of another . consulate employee in 2010. The episode strained relations between Mexico and the United . States. The hitmen were extradited to the United States and . jailed. The late author Charles Bowden, who was an expert on the . drug trade in Ciudad Juarez, once described Carrillo as . soft-spoken but not showy and definitely in charge. Despite several years of attacks by Guzman's heavily armed . gunmen, Carrillo ceded little ground in Juarez. His henchmen hit back by torturing and beheading rivals, . while continuing to ship tonnes of cocaine into the United . States, according to U.S. security officials.

"Breathtaking aerial photographs have revealed isolated communities in some of the most remote areas of Africa. Canadian photographer Joel Krahn witnessed  villages, pastures and lone huts while flying over isolated regions in Kenya, Sudan and Nairobi this year. The 25-year-old captured beautiful images of incredible landscapes and evidence of civilisation across the remote plains of Africa during journeys between locations for a non-profit company. Working the land: Joel Krahn captured images including this one of fields near Arua in Uganda while working in Africa earlier this year . Isolated: Beautiful images show isolated civilisation in remote Africa, like this village, Iboni, in South Sudan . Hobby: The Canadian photographer worked for missionary group Africa Inland Mission for three months . 'I was assigned to some remote places while I was there and had to fly around in small aircraft a lot of the time,' says Joel. 'I probably spent more than 25 hours cramped into the co-pilot's seat gazing out the window. 'The African landscape is vastly different from vistas I am used to seeing flying in Canada. And after flying for hours and hours over parched land, I wondered how anyone could live there. 'But sure enough, whenever I looked for it, I could see evidence of civilization, whether it was a hut, a road, or the outline of a pasture.' Remote: Krahn spent over 25 hours flying in small aircraft to remote places and took photographs, such as this of a Kenyan river, during his journeys . Beautiful: The photographer witnessed some incredible landscapes - this image is of the Didinga Hills, South Sudan .

The pictures show scenes such as the Nile River weaving its way through South Sudan, the luscious green Didinga Hills and sprawling rural villages in Kenya and South Sudan. Joel said: 'I love the patterns and abstract graphics that aerial shots show. It's a much different perspective from above than it is from the ground. 'When you're on the ground, you see only a small portion of what you're part of and can easily lose sight of the larger picture.

"Jeffrey Fowle, the American man held captive in North Korea for the past six months, beamed with happiness today as he appeared with his family for the first time after arriving home in the U.S. The 56-year-old greeted the media with his wife and three young children outside their home in rural Miamisburg, Ohio on Wednesday morning. Mr Fowle had earlier landed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton after being flown in by the Department of Defense. He was met on the tarmac by his wife and elated children who rushed to hug him after having no idea that their father was returning home. The family attorney made a brief statement on Mr Fowle's behalf today, saying that he was overjoyed to be reunited with his family. Scroll down for videos .

The statement also referred to the two Americans still being held in Pyongyang - Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller - and the continued struggle for their families. Attorney Timothy Tepe said Mr Fowle had been treated well by the North Korean government and needed time to adjust to life at home. 'The past 24 hours have been a whirlwind for Jeff and his family. Jeff needs some time right now to get adjusted to his life at home,' Tepe said. The New York Times reported today that North Korea said Kim Jong-un, had personally ordered the release of Mr Fowle following requests from President Obama. The State Department announced on Tuesday that Mr Fowle had been released. The news came about six months after he was taken into custody after leaving a Bible at a nightclub. Christian evangelism is considered a crime in North Korea. He had been awaiting trial - the only one of three Americans held by Pyongyang who had not been convicted of charges. The two others were each sentenced to years in North Korean prisons after court trials that lasted no more than 90 minutes. The three Americans entered North Korea separately.

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said on Tuesday that Mr Fowle was seen by doctors and appeared to be in good medical health. She declined to give more details about his release except to thank the government of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, for its 'tireless efforts'. Harf would not say whether any American officials had intervened directly with the North Koreans. Relations between Washington and Pyongyang, never warm, are at a particularly low point, and the U.S. has sought unsuccessfully for months to send a high-level representative to North Korea to negotiate acquittals for all three men.

'We are very concerned about the remaining American citizens who are in North Korea, and we have great hopes that North Korea will see the benefit of releasing them also as soon as possible,' Kerry told reporters. 'We're in constant touch with their families, we're working on their release, we've talked to the Chinese and others, and we have a high focus on it,' he said.

"A 22 metre billboard showing a dead horse plastered above a major Melbourne freeway has been branded 'highly inappropriate and distasteful' by a racing boss. Ahead of Melbourne's Spring Racing Carnival, the highlight of the racing year in Australia, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses published their graphic campaign on the CityLink road near Footscray Road, west Melbourne, asking race-goers 'is the party really worth it?'. The group are campaigning to 'improve the lives of racehorses' but Racing Victoria Chief Executive Bernard Saundry has blasted the sign. 'To put a dead animal, be it a horse, a dog or a cat, on a billboard is highly inappropriate and distasteful,' Mr Saundry said in a statement published on Racing Victoria's website. Scroll down for video . The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses published their graphic campaign on the CityLink road in Melbourne . 'The billboard is offensive both to the 70,000 participants within the Victorian thoroughbred racing industry who love and care for their animals and indeed to the wider community who are travelling past this distasteful image.' The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses also published the image of the dead horse on their Facebook page. 'The racing industry has rejected our proposal to retire racehorses humanely,' they claimed. They said the industry 'has allowed jumps racing to continue when it said the sport would end, allows under-developed horses to race and thinks it's OK to beat a horse an unlimited number of times towards the end of a race'. Racing Victoria Chief Executive Bernard Saundry has blasted the sign as 'distasteful' One Twitter user also complained about the billboard and highlighted the way it's one of the first things people arriving in Melbourne would see . Another Twitter user pointed out that the next billboard on the road advertises the Melbourne Cup . The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses have published controversial ads before for their campaigns . However, Mr Saundry refuted any claims of animal cruelty. 'The health and wellbeing of our equine athletes is at the heart of our industry and central to the thinking of participants and administrators alike. 'The level of care afforded the industry’s equine athletes is practically unmatched by any other domesticated animal. Trainers, owners and breeders afford outstanding care to their horses. 'Indeed, over $300 million is spent annually in Victoria alone by owners on the training, care and welfare of the state's racehorse population,' he said. Mr Saundry explained that trainers and breeders have their own vets to ensure the welfare of their horses is maintained, alongside the 60 vets contracted by Racing Victoria on racedays. He added that the average fatality rate in Victorian thoroughbred racing is the lowest in world racing. Verema was put down after pulling up early in the 2013 Melbourne Cup race .

"Victim: Nanny Teresita Sison worked at a house near to where she was killed on Tuesday . Police could face an investigation by the independent watchdog after failing to place a cordon around a storm-damaged tree after a pedestrian was killed. Nanny Teresita Sison died after the tree was uprooted opposite Knightsbridge Barracks, Kensington, during high winds caused by the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo earlier this week. The 58-year-old was killed on the spot when masonry was dislodged by a falling tree and collapsed on to the pavement on Kensington Road. The Metropolitan Police said that the incident was being reviewed by the Major Crime Unit, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission has also been contacted. Officers were called to reports of a partially fallen tree shortly after 11am on Tuesday, as winds of up to 108mph and heavy rain battered the UK. Police said vehicle cordons were put in place to redirect traffic, but admitted that pedestrians were still able to access the pavement below. Around 30 minutes after officers arrived, a supporting wall collapsed and the tree slipped further - moving the brick that crushed Mrs Sison as she passed underneath. Detectives are now asking for anyone who may have recorded mobile phone footage of the incident to get in touch. A post-mortem examination is due to take place at Westminster Mortuary tomorrow. Mrs Sison, originally from the Philippines, worked at a house near where she was killed. The nanny, who first came to the UK in the 1980s, also worked as a beautician and a cook alongside working for a family who lived close to the scene. Fatal: Mrs Sison died after the tree was uprooted opposite Knightsbridge Barraks, Kensington, west London . Struck: The victim was killed at the scene as winds from the tail end of Hurricane Gonzalo felled trees . Probe: Police could now face an investigation after they failed to properly limit access to the scene on Tuesday . Yesterday, Mrs Sison's cousin Efiliciano Quimbao, 63, described her as the 'breadwinner' of the family, adding that her husband Roberto was 'really devastated' by her death. Speaking at the scene of her death, Mr Quimbao said: 'She was such a lovely woman, she was a hard worker, she always wanted to provide for her family back home. 'She was the breadwinner, she worked for one family, cared for their children while they grew up and now they are at university, everyone will be sad.' 'Breadwinner': Mrs Soison, originally from the Philippines, was killed on the spot when the tree fell. Above, firefighters and emergency service workers inspect the scene after the fatal incident . Prevention: Police said cordons were put in place, but pedestrians were still able to access the pavement . Clean-up: Emergency workers clear the scene where Mrs Sison was killed by the falling tree on Tuesday . Elsewhere a man was crushed to death underneath a van in Canvey, Essex, after a van fell on top of him. The victim, in his thirties, was underneath the van repairing it when a strong gust of wind caused it to fall off a car jack at 10.40am. Another man, 63, was killed after his car hit a bridge near Merseyside, Liverpool, on Tuesday. At the time of the crash the area was experiencing gusts of up to 35mph and heavy rain as the tail end of Hurricane Gonzalo blew ashore. Police are now appealing for anyone with information on the circumstances surrounding Mrs Sison's death to come forward. Detective Inspector Dave Bolton, of Westminster Police's major crime unit, said: 'I would appeal to anyone with information to come forward as it may be vital to piece together what happened. 'There were many people in the area at the time and these witnesses could hold key information.' Anyone with information is asked to call the police non-emergency line on 101. Admission: Police said that they had redirected traffic around the damaged tree, pictured, but had not cordoned off the pavement where Mrs Sison was later crushed to death . Review: The Metropolitan Police said that the incident was being reviewed by the Major Crime Unit, while the Independent Police Complaints Commission has also been contacted.

But after her condition deteriorated the 12-year-old was taken to hospital before being transferred to a specialist unit where she passed away. Olivia Diamond died on October 4, four days after she first complained of feeling ill. The 12-year-old was diagnosed with myocarditis, a condition where the heart muscle becomes inflamed . Ms Diamond said: 'She was out playing with her best friend Macy on Saturday. 'She came home, and sat and ate biscuits with a glass of milk. After half an hour, she said she did not feel well. 'She had a headache and felt cold, but she was hot. She was hallucinating and had chest pains in the night.' The family sought medical advice, before later contacting the family doctor, who prescribed medication. They took her to Accrington Victoria Hospital on Wednesday after her condition continued to deteriorate. Olivia was transferred to Manchester Children's Hospital after doctors suspected she had suffered a heart attack. Ms Diamond said: 'She had a stent put in to rule out a heart attack. She had to be resuscitated because her blood pressure dropped. 'They said she did not have a heart attack, but said it was very weak. The flu virus got to her heart. The main pump stopped working. Myocarditis is often triggered by a virus, which attacks the heart muscle. In Olivia's case doctors believe the flu virus, pictured under the microscope, caused her condition . 'Olivia knew what was coming because she was spending time individually with me and her dad, Chris. She said she loved us, and did not wake up again.' 'Olivia meant everything to us,' she added .'We are taking it day by day, but instead of getting easier, it's getting harder. It's ripped my heart out to be honest.' Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, and is usually caused by a virus. Cases range in cause and severity. Some recover completely, but it can cause serious health problems. Olivia's mother described her daughter as a 'devoted' sister to Asif, Aleesha, Sophie and Kallie. 'She did anything for them,' Ms Diamond.  'She wanted to become a nurse looking after sick children. She had a lot more to give. I can't get my head round the fact she is not here anymore.' Olivia was fanatical about horses, and attended Accrington Horse Riding Centre. Her favourite horse Amos will be taken to her funeral, her mother said. The service will be held later today in Clayton-le-Moors. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle. There are no specific causes of the condition but it is usually triggered by a virus. Some of the most common infections which cause myocarditis, are those called adenovirus and Coxsackie B. Others include: . Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle, often caused by a virus . Symptoms of the condition, include: . If the inflammation damages the heart muscle or the fibres that conduct electrical pulses to the heart, complications can develop. They can develop quickly, and include sudden loss of consciousness, an abnormally fast, slow or irregular heartbeat, and heart failure. In most cases of viral myocarditis, the illness goes away and there are no complications. In some cases the inflammation and damage is so severe the only treatment option is a heart transplant. In very severe cases the condition is fatal. Also, some cases of sudden death in a previously healthy person are due to an acute myocarditis that develops rapidly.

"At its peak, in the early 1990s, Muslim references were relatively common in rap songs, but over the past decade these have all but vanished from the genre. Graphs have revealedl that references to Islamic culture in rap lyrics have been steadily dropping since the early 2000s, and are now a sixth of what they were during a peak between 1990 and 1995. At the same time, the graphs reveal that lyrics about Jesus and Christianity have been rising. Graphs from RapStats reveal that references to Islamic culture in rap lyrics are steadily dropping, and are now a sixth of what they were during a peak in 1990. At the same time, the graphs reveal that lyrics about Jesus and Christianity have been rising. The trend was identified by Vocativ’s Adam Raymond. During comparisons, he discovered that references to the word ‘Islam’ once occupied around 0.00245 per cent of songs - it now sits at 0.00037 per cent. ‘Muslim’ lyrics peaked in 1993 at 0.00156 per cent, and is now 0.0007 per cent. The word ‘Christianity’ peaked in 1988 on 0.00035 per cent of songs, before vanishing completely during 1992 and 1993 and between 2004 and 2005. It is now referred to in 0.00012 per cent of lyrics. The Five Percent nation - sometimes referred to as Nation of Gods and Earths - was created by Clarence Smith in 1964. Mr Smith is a former member of the Nation of Islam, which is a religious movement designed to improve the condition of African Americans in the US. The Five-Percenters get their name from the idea that only five per cent of humanity known the truth about existence and are 'poor righteous teachers' trying to tell the rest of the world the truth. In April, Jay-Z was photographed at the Barclay's Center wearing a medallion symbolising the Five Percent Nation. It is widely reportef that one of the core tenets of the Five Percent Nation is that white people are 'wicked and inferior' to black men. Meanwhile, the word ‘Christian’ has been rising since 1995, up from 0.008 per cent to 0.00253 per cent. Mr Raymond also compared Jesus’ versus ‘Muhammad.’ Between 1988 and 1992, the references were at similar levels, after which ‘Jesus’ soared and ‘Muhammad’ stayed constant. Mr Raymond explained that Muslim rappers affiliated, or who identified with Islamic group Five Percent Nation were at a high during the 1990s - and this may explain the peaks. Rappers linked with Islam, either through this group or as practicing members of the religion, include Nas, Mos Def and Q-Tip. In Common and Q-Tip’s 1996 song The Remedy, taken from Get on the Bus soundtrack, Q-Tip raps: ‘To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell and sound. 'Let's deem it profound! And prioritise this cause it was Allah's wish.’ While in Nas’ 1999 Ghetto Prisoners, he raps: ‘Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised? The mighty dollar - or almighty Allah.’ And in Common’s G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition) featuring Cee-Lo from 1997, lyrics address both Islam and Christianity: ‘Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital.

Rappers linked with Islam, either through this group or as practicing members of the religion, include Nas (pictured left), Mos Def and Q-Tip (pictured right) Between 1988 and 1992, the references to 'Jesus' and 'Muhammad' were at similar frequencies, after which ‘Jesus’ soared and ‘Muhammad’ stayed constant . ‘And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys. ‘You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief, but one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em . ‘And use religion as an emblem, when it should be a natural way of life . ‘Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right. There is also a notable decline in Islamic references in the early 2000s, which may have been caused by the negativity around the religion caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. ‘That's who got you doin right and got you this far, . ‘Whether you say ‘in Jesus name’ or ‘Al hum du'Allah’ However, as Mr Raymond points out, many of these rappers are older now and don’t appeal to ‘hip-hop’s young fan base.’ There is also a notable decline in references in the early 2000s, which may have been caused by the negativity around the religion caused by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He said: 'In the decade after 9/11, America’s views toward Islam plummeted. 'Meanwhile, Christianity is viewed much more positively than Islam. Simply put, Jesus is a much easier sell than Muhammad.'","Graphs reveal that references to the word ‘Islam’ is at an all-time low .

"A new phone app for people as young as 13 to find any private parties on offer in the area has proved in high demand but there are serious concerns it will be misused by gatecrashers. Founder of KickOn, Charles Stewart, from Sydney, came up with the idea when he was at a venue which was closing and he wanted to know where else he could party on nearby. The party app was launched on Friday without any fanfare yet gained 5,000 downloads by the end of the weekend - Mr Stewart's target for the entire month. 'It will change the way people party forever,' Mr Stewart told Daily Mail Australia - who had expectations of getting no more than 1,000 users on the app in the first weekend. Scroll down for video . Founder of KickOn, Charles Stewart (centre), from Sydney, came up with the idea when he was at a venue which was closing and he wanted to know where else he could party on nearby . Mr Stewart (right) said the app will change the way people party 'forever' 5,000 people have downloaded the app since Friday . But not everyone is jumping on board the party bandwagon with many fearing the new social media craze opens up the potential for unwanted party guests. The Sammy D Foundation, which runs school and youth programs to end alcohol and drug fuelled violence, is concerned about any technology that opens up parties to strangers. The foundation's general manager David Hutton said suggested invitations should be unique and parties should not be promoted via text or open social media networks. 'Our Party Wise program educates adults and young people about holding safe parties and one of our key messages is that if you don't know the person, don't let them in,' Mr Hutton said. Mr Stewart, 29, argues that the app was in fact safer option to invite people to parties than sites such as Facebook because the host has full control of who they can attend the event. Guests receive a ticket to be able to enter the party which the host scan at the front door and there is also a system for rating the guests. 'Once you've attended the party you have to rate it out of five stars and the organiser then votes three attendees for MVP - most valuable partier - you reward people for positive partying, Mr Stewart said. 'People end up generating a score out of 100 for their historical partying and if you get a party pooper rating it will ruin your reputation which means you wont be invited to anymore parties in the future.' Mr Stewart had expectations of getting no more than 1,000 users on the app in the first weekend . Mr Stewart (second from right) is happy to sit down with the police to discuss the app's benefits . To prevent the 'party poopers' from re-registering under different names, Mr Stewart said he was looking into introducing guests posting a photo of their driver's licence or some other form of ID - as well as their profile picture.. However, NSW Police Association president Scott Weber described the app as fraught with danger' and said police will probably monitor it to look at intercepting any arising issues. 'I don't see it as a winner. There's going to be no control in regard to the people that attend,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. Mr Stewart said he had contacted the police to let them know about the benefits of young people using the app. 'We haven’t received a response yet but we are looking forward to sitting down with them and giving them some confirmation about how this is going to make their life a little bit easier,' he said. Mr Stewart said he foresaw the potential criticism that the app could bring which he remained mindful of while building the design. 'We are expecting a really positive conversation,' he said. 'Ultimately, the natural response is ""the party is going to get out of control"" but once you learn about some of the features I think the police are going to warm to it very nicely.'

"Father: Misty Upham's father recently spoke out saying that he fears his daughter is suicidal . A Washington actress is still missing  one week after her disappearance and her family fears she is suicidal, officials say. Misty Upham, 32, was last seen near her Auburn home Oct. 5. Police responded to a suicide call at Upham's apartment, People magazine reports, but when they arrived, Upham was not there  and officers were not able to contact her. However, this is not the first time Upham has reportedly left her apartment without notice and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at Upham's apartment. People reports that, in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. Upham's father, Charles Upham, said in a statement that Upham has a 'medical condition,' but neither he nor Upham's mother have revealed what the condition is. Upham's father recently told The Hollywood Reporter that he fears his daughter is suicidal. 'She had recently changed her medication, so she was sort of having erratic behavior,' Upham's father told THR. 'She told me and her mom that we didn't have to worry about her any more. … I thought it sounded suicidal myself, so I called the police. 'She's always been a suicidal person.' Upham's father went on to say that Upham sometimes made suicide threats, but 'never went through with it.' Phone Call: Upham's father recently revealed the last conversation he had with his daughter where she said that he and her mother didn't 'have to worry about her anymore' 'Missing person': The police did not comply to Upham's father's request to have his daughter listed as a 'missing person.' People reports that Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her disappearance. A source reportedly told people that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent. One day after Upham went missing, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.' The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today. Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. We are asking for help from people who live in the area to search the wooded areas near the Muckleshoot casino.' The post stated that the police are not looking for Upham. Another post revealed that Upham's family has no income. '[The] father is recovering from a recent stroke and is disabled.,' the post reads, '...mother is disabled with congestive heart failure...the family is dependent on donations. The family wrote in the post that they are 'doing everything within our means to bring our daughter home safe.' Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.'   Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.

"Clutching onto her relatives in heartbreaking despair, an anguished mother climbs into her son's grave, grief etched across her tear-stained face. Just moments earlier, she had watched mourners desperately cling onto her child's coffin as it passed through their close-knit mining village, lovingly draped in a Turkish flag. Her son was among 18 workers who were trapped 11 days ago, when water surged through a coal mine in Karaman, southern Turkey. Today, emotional scenes unfolded as the community of Asagi Caglar in Karaman, came together to bid farewell to two of the victims. The mother of a worker who died in a collapsed mine in the Ermenek district of Karaman, southern Turkey, climbs into his grave during his funeral in Asagi Caglar earlier today . Her son was one of the 18 workers who were trapped 11 days ago when a water flooded a coal mine in Karaman, southern Turkey . The relatives were visibly distressed as the community came together to pay their respects to two of the victims, whose bodies were retrieved from the mine yesterday . Family members and friends clutched onto the coffins as they passed through the village, draped in the red and white Turkish flag . The service came less than 24 hours after authorities pulled the bodies - the first two to have been retrieved since the accident - from the Has Sekerler mine in the Ermenek district of the town. As mourners stood together in visible grief, two politicians reached across to console Sukru Haznedar, the father of miner Kerim Haznedar, one of those killed in the disaster. Lutfi Elvan, Turkey's transport, maritime affairs and communications minister and the minister of energy and natural resources Taner Yildiz were among those paying their respects. The miners were trapped more than 1,000ft below ground on October 28 after a sudden flood. Rescue teams, including divers, have continued their work at the mine, amid efforts to pump out 12,000 tons of water from the mine. But, within hours of the tragedy, hopes had all but faded that any of the trapped workers would be rescued.

"Parents need to be aware predators could use smartphone location apps to monitor and track the precise location of their children, the former head of MI6 has warned. Sir John Scarlett has said there is no 'absolute protection' of information children share online and once smartphone location apps have been given consent to track the phone, it is difficult to control who uses the information. Ahead of a speech at the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) annual meeting in Newport, south Wales, Sir John said that the world, and above all the technological environment, has rapidly changed. Tracking information on apps such as Find My iPhone (pictured) could be used by predators . The former spy chief warned that in general, there is 'no absolute protection' against a determined online attack, adding it is vital to know what young people are learning online. The public can protect themselves by using passwords and other measures against 80% of intrusions but 'everybody has to understand that you can't be absolutely certain that somebody, somewhere, won't get it'. Information gathered through tracking apps is meant to be secure - however, recent scandals such as the celebrity nude photos hacks have shown such data can be easily accessed for other, more sinister purposes. Sir John, who served as chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service for five years until 2009, said: 'You've got to know what your children are doing, it's very difficult to know exactly what they're doing in particular when they're on a tablet or something they've got and you've got to have some kind of idea. Sir John Scarlett (pictured) has warned predators may be able to use location apps to track children . 'They are extremely vulnerable, everybody is, to a whole range of things. Clearly when they're young children they're particularly vulnerable to predators.' He said this also included sexual predators. 'Personally what worries me, in a way, most, is tracking devices. 'The way in which locational apps for example are now quite freely available, of course you can start off by consciously giving out that information, but once you've done that, you've lost control of it. 'There is a need for everyone to be aware that once information is shared online, for example through using a search engine, it can be used by different firms, ' He added that youngsters can also be tracked through getting into conversations online, or by using apps that use an individual's location. 'It's the tracking, and obviously if you get into conversations, I don't really see how that can be controlled unless you have some idea what your child's doing.' His 'basic advice' was to teach children common sense values to stick to, such as being aware of the information they give out and how they express themselves. Young girls were obviously vulnerable to tracking and there were individuals able to track someone 'right down to more or less precisely where you are'. He also suggested that the public should be more worried about threats from terrorists and international criminal networks than the Government snooping on them. MailOnline has requested comment from Apple. The way in which an online predator could go about tracking a child's smartphone is astonishingly simple. Only days ago the FBI indicted a man for selling a spyware application which could monitor smartphones' calls, texts, videos and phone calls. Not only could it monitor that information, but it could pick up the phone's GPS as well as operate its microphone turning it into a bug to listen into conversations up to 15 feet away from the handset. For example, Find My iPhone  is an security-enabled app which enables a GPS inside the phone to give off a signal. Theoretically, in the event of the theft of the phone, you can then use your secure log-on to find its exact location on a web browser. However, spyware programmes - for which the predator needs only a few minutes on their victim's phone to install - enables the data from that phone to be synchronised with its customer's account on the internet. This information includes the GPS signal given off by the phone - which when monitored online (either by its intended user, or a predator using spyware) gives off a green dot signalling its exact location. If you suspect your phone has been infected with spyware, it's recommended you perform a factory reset which will delete all data and apps installed after the handset was purchased.","Predators can use location apps to track your children, warns Sir John .

"After weeks of slow, stop-and-go movement towards a village on Hawaii's Big Island, a menacing river of molten lava was calmed by an overnight downpour on Saturday night. The rain has reduced the smoke that's coming from the lava flow - which remains stalled 480 feet from the main road in and out of Pahoa, a town of about 1,000 people. Hawaii County Civil Defense director Darryl Oliveira claims the the moisture helped pack down some of the smoke that's been generated by small fires from the lava. Glimmer of hope: An official claims an overnight downpour on Saturday has reduced the smoke that's rising from the lava flow . He said: 'It was pretty light this morning when we were out there. There's still supply or material coming down the mountain from the source. The lava is burning through vegetation on an agricultural property containing trees and grass, but Mr Oliveira says there are no brush fires and the flow is no longer advancing towards the road. He added: 'At this point, that supply that's reaching the front of the very leading edge is being shared throughout the system and the volume has decreased. It's not allowing it to push forward.' Lava has been spilling down the flank of Kilauea volcano toward the northeast since June and recently crossed a country road, then smothered part of a cemetery. It also has toppled trees and burned a shed, tires and grass. Moistened: Hawaii County Civil Defense director Darryl Oliveira claims the the moisture helped tamped down some of the rising smoke . Last week, 83 National Guardsman were dispatched to the area to aide in the evacuation of homes threatened by the hot molten rock. The lava flow from the Kilauea volcano had been advancing at less than five miles-an-hour before it stalled, said Mr Oliveira. While it threatens to destroy homes and cut off a road and a highway through Pahoa, officials have not offered any predictions on when exactly it could bisect the town at the site of an old sugar plantation. Stalled: The river of molten rock remains 480 feet from the main road in and out of Pahoa, a town of about 1,000 people. Defiant: A chiropractor's office vows to stay open for business in Pahoa as lava threatens to bisect the town's main road . The lava flow stems from a June eruption of the Kilauea active volcano. The lava surfaced from a vent on the volcano and may reach all the way to the sea . Destructive power: The lava is hot enough to incinerate any homes, roads and businesses that fall in its path (photo taken October 31) No homes have been destroyed so far, and a finger of lava that threatens one house on the edge of town has not advanced closer to the evacuated structure since Wednesday night - remaining around 100 feet away. Meanwhile, the glowing leading edge of the lava flow is now about 160 yards from Pahoa Village Road, the main street through the town. Residents of about 50 dwellings in what civil defense officials called a 'corridor of risk' have been asked to be ready to leave, and many have been slowly emptying their homes of furniture and treasured possessions. Menacing: Lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano, one of the earth's most active, has been sliding northeast toward the ocean since an eruption on June 27 . Lava from a vent at Kilauea volcano, one of the earth's most active, has been sliding northeast toward the ocean since an eruption on June 27. Locals say the molten rock is being spread by Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. 'She is so gentle, but so unrelenting. She is just slow and steady,' said Jamila Dandini, a retiree who stopped at a coffee shop down the road from where scientists have forecast the lava will likely cross. Superstition: Locals say the molten rock is being spread by Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess . Erbin Gamurot, 48, a handyman, said Pele just wants to visit her sister, Namakaokahai, the sea goddess. 'She's doing what she gotta do. That's her way, that's her nature. Who can stop her?' he asked. Last month, scientists said it was two weeks away from hitting the main road in Pahoa. The lava slowed but has largely remained on course. The slow pace has given residents time to pack their valuables and get out of the way. Paul Utes, who owns the Black Rock Cafe, said: 'It's like slow torture. It speeds up, it slows down. It speeds up, it slows down. After weeks of slow, stop-and-go movement towards a village on Hawaii's Big Island, a menacing river of molten lava bubbled over a road and overran a cemetery and crossed onto a residential property on Tuesday . 'It's not like any other event where it comes and goes and it gets over with and you can move on.' Mr Utes' restaurant is not in the predicted path even though it's just a few hundred yards south from where the lava will likely cross the main road. But he worries this could change. Even if the cafe is spared, he doesn't know how traffic will be diverted once lava crosses the road, how his vendors will supply his restaurant and what the public - his customers - will do. For the time being, business is up because more people from around the island and tourists from outside Hawaii have been streaming into town hoping to get a glimpse of the molten rock. Construction crews prepare Pahoa Village Road as lava flow from Mt Kilauea approaches the village of Pahoa, Hawaii, on Tuesday . 'The anxiety building up is kind of hard to deal with,' he said. Some changes brought by lava are already starting to have an effect. The county bus no longer passes through the main street lined with wood buildings dating to the town's heyday as a lumber and sugar-plantation town. Locals have been discussing pooling their resources for supply runs to Hilo, the nearest city, because it could take hours to get there on alternate routes once Pahoa's main roads are cut off.

"The U.S. Supreme Court opens on Monday a new term in which the nine justices will decide issues such as whether a Muslim prison inmate can have a beard and whether a man can be prosecuted for making threatening statements on Facebook. The term, which runs to the end of June, is expected to be defined by whatever action the justices take on whether states can ban gay marriage. They have not yet agreed to hear any of the seven cases already decided by federal appeals courts. The U.S. Supreme Court opens on Monday a new term in which they will decide issues such as whether a Muslim prison inmate can have a beard and whether a man can be prosecuted for making threatening statements on Facebook . Inmate Renzee Standberry, facing, gives a sermon to fellow Muslim inmates during a prayer service inside the Indiana State Prison chapel in Michigan City, Ind., Friday, March 11, 2011 . Muslim inmate Renzee Standberry, right, talks with prison Chaplain Rev. Terry Harman inside the chapel at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Ind., Friday, March 11, 2011 . Most legal experts expect them to decide the issue, with oral arguments early next year and a ruling likely in late June. Arguments start on Monday in the cases the court has already accepted. It has agreed to hear a number of cases involving people challenging their treatment by the government, whether it be prosecutors, police or agencies. Arkansas inmate Gregory Holt's challenge to a state prison grooming policy will be heard on Tuesday. Holt, who initially got the court's attention with a handwritten plea last year, says the policy violates a 2000 federal law giving religious rights to prisoners. He wants to grow a half-inch (1.3 cm) beard in accordance with his Muslim beliefs. William Couch, a Sunni Muslim, has challenged the Virginia Department of Corrections' grooming policy, which bans long hair and beards . Virginia's prison system did not violate Muslim inmate William Couch's religious rights when it refused to allow him to grow a 1/8-inch beard, which he believes is required by his religion, a federal judge has ruled . Holt's lawyers note that 44 state prison systems and the federal government allow inmates to have similar beards. Legal experts predict he has a good chance of victory. The case gives the court another chance to rule on religious freedom just four months after it decided that certain for-profit corporations can assert religious claims under another federal law. The Facebook threat case, to be argued on Dec. 1, concerns Anthony Elonis, who posted statements on the social network in 2010 after his wife, Tara Elonis, left him. Aimed at his wife, co-workers and others, the posts were mostly in the form of rap lyrics in which he fantasized about committing violent acts. Elonis was charged with violating a federal law that outlaws sending threatening communications. He was convicted on four of five counts and sentenced to 44 months in prison. The legal question is whether prosecutors needed to convince jurors that Elonis intended his statements to be interpreted as threats. Orlando Wright, center, listens as the Imam speaks to the group of Muslim inmates, Friday, June 20, 2008 in Monroe, Wash. The first argument the court will hear on Monday comes in a North Carolina case brought by Nicholas Heien, who was charged and pleaded guilty to drug trafficking after police found cocaine in his car during a traffic stop. He challenged whether police had the right to stop his car for having a broken tail light when state law does not require two working tail lights. During its term, the court also will hear important business-related cases. These include a closely watched housing discrimination case, a federal agency's claim against Abercrombie & Fitch Co for not hiring a Muslim women because she wore a head scarf and a dispute over whether workers should be paid for the time it takes to go through security checks.","The term runs from Monday to the end of June .

"A virus that usually attacks algae, has been found in the throats of humans and researchers believe that it may produce a subtle change in an infected people's cognitive function. The virus called ATCV-1 is typically found in algae and seems to be responsible for poorer spatial awareness and a shorter attention span in affected humans. The discovery sheds new light on a class of viruses that has been previously been deemed non-infectious to humans, highlighting the ability of certain microorganisms to trigger delicate physiologic changes without causing full-blown disease. A virus called ATCV-1 that usually attacks algae (pictured), has been found in the throats of humans and researchers believe that it may produce a subtle change in an infected people's cognitive function . ‘This is a striking example showing that the “innocuous” microorganisms we carry can affect behaviour and cognition,' said lead author of the PNAS-published study, Dr Robert Yolken, a virologist and paediatric infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University. He and colleagues from the University of Nebraska stumbled across the algae virus by accident while they were studying microbes living in the throats of healthy humans for a non-related study. By analysing the DNA of swabs, they discovered DNA matching that of ATCV-1 (Acanthocystis turfacea Chlorella virus 1), known to infect green algae, which includes more than 7,000 water-dwelling organisms resembling plants that are commonly found in ponds, lakes and the sea. A total of 40 people from the 92 participating in the study tested positive for the algae virus. Mice infected with the virus exhibited deficits similar to those observed in humans, including recognition memory and spatial awareness . The researchers found that people infected with ATCV-1 performed 'measurbly lower' in a set of tasks measuring the speed and accuracy of visual processing, than healthy people. For example, people who harboured the virus scored, on average, nearly nine points lower on a test that measured how quickly they could draw a line between sequentially numbered circles on a piece of paper. Viral carriers also scored an average of seven points lower on tests measuring attention. To extend the study, the scientists infected a group of mice and analysed their performance during a battery of tests designed to measure their brain power. Animals infected with the virus exhibited deficits similar to those observed in humans, including lesser recognition memory and spatial awareness. For example, they found it more difficult to navigate a maze and spent 30 per cent less time examining a new object than healthy mice - a finding that suggests a shorter attention span. While the scientists are cautious in linking mouse behaviour with that of humans, they say that the similarities seen in the tests are ‘striking’. Dr Mikhail Pletnikov, director of the Behavioural Neurobiology and Neuroimmunology Laboratory at the university, said: ‘The similarity of our findings in mice and humans underscores the common mechanisms that many microbes use to affect cognitive function in both animals and people.’ ‘This commonality is precisely what allows us to study the pathologies that these microorganisms fuel and do so in a controlled systematic way.’ Analysis of brain samples from virus-infected mice revealed changes in the expression of multiple genes found in the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that sorts and catalogues short-term and long-term memories and guides spatial orientation. ATCV-1, or Acanthocystis turfacea Chlorella virus 1, is usually found in algae living in ponds, lakes and the sea. Until now, it was thought to non-infectious to humans. Now, scientists say that when it infects humans, it may be responsible for cognitive decline. This includes a drop in poor spatial awareness and a shorter attention span. While the difference was not dramatic, performance in certain tests measuring cognitive function were 'measurably lower'. The virus also seems to change the expression of multiple genes found in the hippocampus, which is the part of the brain that sorts and catalogues short-term and long-term memories and guides spatial orientation. The discovery sheds new light on class of viruses that has been previously been deemed non-infectious to humans, highlighting the ability of certain microorganisms to trigger delicate physiologic changes without causing full-blown disease. The new findings follow several recent studies showing that microbes can play an important role in the origin of cognitive and mental health disorders. For example, some have previously shown that infection with the cat-borne parasite Toxoplasma gondii (pictured) can alter behaviour in genetically predisposed people . Some of these alterations involved genes that regulate brain response to dopamine - a neurotransmitter that affects a wide range of cognitive functions - as well as genes involved in immune cell regulation. Because multiple genes are involved, the scientists think that numerous mechanisms may explain the effects seen in the study. The new findings follow several recent studies showing that microbes can play an important role in the origin of neurologic, cognitive and mental health disorders. For example, Dr Yolken and others have previously shown that infection with the cat-borne parasite Toxoplasma gondii can alter behaviour in genetically predisposed people.","The virus, called ATCV-1, is typically found in algae - but it has also been detected in the throats of healthy humans .

"Chris Robshaw vowed England can still topple the All Blacks if the two sides clash in next year's World Cup, despite Saturday's loss at Twickenham. The England captain shrugged off the bitter 'frustration' of a fifth successive defeat to the world champions inside a year. Robshaw and his players were left devastated having again pushed New Zealand all the way, only to walk off the rain-soaked Twickenham pitch on the wrong end. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chris Robshaw suffers in the Twickenham rain as England fall to defeat against New Zealand . They had so badly wanted to make their own statement of intent just 10 months before England 2015 kicks off at that very ground. But the Harlequins flanker, whose side led 14-11 at halftime before going down by three points, claimed: 'We could still beat them, especially at home. The crowd were fantastic today and will be right behind us in the World Cup. We had them on the ropes in that first half and we must remember that. 'We had the best team in the world on the ropes and we just need to be able to finish them off and put in a similar second half performance. New Zealand celebrate scoring their final try against England to earn a narrow victory . 'It's extremely frustrating to come so close to beating them but just not getting across the line. We wanted the win but didn't get it. 'We wanted to be the pace-setters and impose ourselves on them because they were coming to our place and we needed to put them on the back foot. 'We did just that with Jonny May scoring an incredible try from 50 metres or so which really got the crowd going. Jonny May celebrates England's first try . 'But then we were a little ill-disciplined and allowed them to kick some goals and we lost the momentum. 'Unfortunately, the second half is where we need to take a look at ourselves.' Robshaw defended his decision to go for a scrum and a try rather than kicking a quick drop goal and saving some time when there were just 90 seconds left on the clock. He insisted: 'I still think it was the right choice. We wanted to win today so I would make the same decision again.' Robshaw is confident his team will bounce back and go on to enjoy success in the remaining autumn clashes, with South Africa up next on Saturday followed by matches against Samoa and Australia. He said: 'We'd much rather have started with a win but this will set us up nicely for South Africa. That's going to be another massive physical test for the guys but we will be ready for them. It's important to get this result out of our system quickly and get back on the training ground to prepare for the Springboks.'","England went down 24-21 to New Zealand at Twickenham .

"It's a manoeuvre that'll wedge your heart in your mouth, tie your stomach in knots and wrench at the gut. But it's all in a day's work for daredevil Rob Holland who has perfected a signature trick which sees him fly upside down directly above other planes while travelling at more than 150mph. Once in that position he can fly with what seems like barely a few feet between the two planes' cockpits as he barrels over the pilot below, zooming into dramatic aerial photographs.

He said: 'The whole manoeuvre is all about trust and experience. I pick only experienced pilots I trust to fly with and then we all fly exactly as we plan. 'We brief what we fly and fly what we brief. I fly off the photo plane the whole time. Once I roll upside down, I try to stay as level and smooth as I can. It takes years of experience flying in formation to perform manoeuvres like this safely. 'But it's a lot of fun and also an honour to share the sky with so many incredible planes and pilots.

"David Cameron is likely to come under pressure after he committed to increasing the aid budget despite the money doing little to increase freedoms . Fast-rising aid spending has done nothing to help the economic and political freedoms of people in the countries which benefit, a new analysis found yesterday. It examined the progress of 28 countries which have had a share of the aid financed by British taxpayers and found that the money ‘does not have any discernible impact on freedom in developing countries’. It found that twice as many countries lost freedoms after receiving British aid than improved the political and human rights conditions for their citizens. The report produced by the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Our current approach to development is not delivering the progress many hoped.’ The findings are likely to deepen suspicion of aid spending among Tory right-wingers who are unconvinced by David Cameron’s commitment to increasing the aid budget to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. The pledge pushed aid spending close to £12billion last year and means further sharp increases over the next few years. The Prime Minister has given his personal support to a LibDem-backed private member’s bill which would write the 0.7 per cent target into law – a decision which means Mr Cameron faces the prospect of seeing many of his backbenchers vote against him. The new report measured the impact of aid spending against benchmarks laid down by international organisations. These included the World Bank, which assesses how firms are bound by red tape; the Heritage Foundation, which published a measure of trade and property freedom; Freedom in the World, which measures political and civil liberties, and various groups which assess internet and press freedom. Among 28 countries which received British aid, 12 showed no effective change at all in their measured levels of freedom over a decade. Six had a falling score while just three – Nepal, Rwanda and Tanzania – had freedom levels that improved with increasing aid. Among the 28 countries to receive British aid,12 showed no effective change on human rights and political freedoms, while six went backwards . Four countries – Ghana, Paraguay, Peru and Zambia – had improved freedom scores even though the amount of aid they received from Britain went down. Russia, which ceased to get UK aid in 2011, had a falling score. Ukraine’s share of British aid money went down, and its measured levels of freedom remained little changed. The report said: ‘Emergency aid can help prevent famine and limit the spread of disease. 'Health programmes can ensure millions of children in the developing world are vaccinated against serious illness. 'But the impact of other aid spending, on things like education, infrastructure, governance, capacity building and more, is much harder to measure.’ It warned that the amount of money that is spent on aid should not be confused with the effectiveness of the aid programme. Countries: . Afghanistan . Nigeria . Kenya . Somalia . Sudan . Mexico . Russia . Aid spend 2012/13: . £265million . £218million . £111million . £85million . £57million . £5.6million . £1.3million (2010/11) ‘While international structures and organisations are critical in the global effort to tackle poverty, the iron triangle between the Department for International Development, recipient governments and non-governmental organisations must not push donor governments into believing that financial inputs are more important than actual outcomes,’ the report said. A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Britain’s aid budget is focused on helping developing countries become self-sufficient, stopping the spread of disease and supporting civilians through war and famine. ‘But in addition to bearing down on poverty and instability, Britain promotes freedom by backing fair elections, a free press and individual rights, and we should be proud of that.’ Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With Britain’s public finances in such a horrendous state, it’s crucial that foreign aid delivers results. 'Too often, British taxpayers’ money is spent propping up governments that refuse to grant fundamental freedoms. ‘The arbitrary spending target of 0.7 per cent so loved by politicians means that money is spent for the sake of it, rather than for any obvious need. 'Every penny of foreign aid should have one goal - making the lives of ordinary people in developing countries better. If it isn’t doing that, it should be stopped.’","David Cameron pledged to increase aid spending sharply in coming years .

"A 21-year-old man was left in a coma and eight others were hospitalized after attending a weekend pool party in the Mexican city of Leon where organizers of the event poured liquid nitrogen into the water. According to authorities of the Health Department of Leon in the state of Guanajuato, the party that took place Saturday was organized by Jagermeister, the alcoholic beverage maker based out of Germany. According to witness accounts and videos recorded at the event, organizers of the soiree hosted in La Colonia Granjas El Palote attempted to create a smoke effect by pouring four buckets of liquid nitrogen into the pool. Scroll down for videos . Bad move: Employees dressed in orange unfirms could be seen pouring liquid nitrogen into the pool, which quickly filled with thick white smoke . Party gone awry: The event held in the Mexican city of Leon was hosted by the German alcoholic beverage company Jagermeister . Crowded soiree: There were about 200 people who turned out at the pool party, among them several hostesses hired to promote the drinks . Officials say that when the liquid nitrogen came in contact with the water, the chemical substance with a low boiling point displaced oxygen, leaving young party goers gasping for breath, Excelsior.com reported. Guests who were milling about around the pool quickly realized that those inside the water began passing out and quickly called for help. Blacked out: Hostess Jael Jimenez said she passed out from asphyxiation while swimming in the pool and was rescued because other gusts spotted her tray floating in the water . The victims were pulled to safety by paramedics and rushed to the regional hospital where many had been diagnosed with cardiovascular problems.

"A hedge fund billionaire allegedly told one of his employees to burn down his neighbor's Bahamas mansion in a long-running dispute over the beachfront property. Louis Bacon, 61, initiated the blaze that devastated Canadian clothing magnate Peter Nygard's home on the island of Lyford Cay in 2009 after he refused to sell him the property, court papers allege. It is claimed that in a fit of anger, the founder of New York-based Moore Capital Management ordered an employee to 'find a way to burn Mr Nygard's f***ing house down'. Billionaires' feud: Louis Bacon (left), 61, initiated the blaze that devastated Canadian clothing magnate Peter Nygard's (right) home in Lyford Cay in 2009 after he refused to sell him the property, court papers allege . Island: Mr Nyford's mansion, set on Lyford Cay (pictured), is inspired by the Mayan civilization's architecture, with one of its major buildings being a 32,000-square-foot grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling . It is the latest accusation in the spat between Mr Bacon and Mr Nygard, who is the founder and chairman of women's fashion house Nygard International, based in Winnipeg. According to the court papers, filed in Los Angeles, a representative for Mr Bacon told one of Mr Nygard's employees, 'See what I told you', just two weeks after the blaze in November 2009. However, fire authorities say the incident was 'accidental', while 68-year-old Mr Nygard admits in the papers that the cause of the fire is 'unknown'. Mr Bacon's legal response has not yet been filed with the court but he has denied the allegations and called them 'groundless'. He points out that he was extremely concerned about the fire which he understood to be down to faulty wiring. He points out that his wife and young children were asleep next door and a change in wind direction could have had tragic consequences. He also says that it was his security team that raised the alarm. The eccentric Mr Nygard, who has seven children by four women, built his impressive 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', in 1987. Above, Mr Nygard's Mayan-themed home . Husband and wife: According to the court papers, a representative for Mr Bacon (seen with his wife Gabrielle) told one of Mr Nygard's employees, 'See what I told you', just two weeks after the blaze in November 2009 . It is inspired by the Mayan civilization's architecture, with one of its major buildings being a 32,000-square-foot grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling. Before the blaze, it had been featured on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous', with visitors including former U.S. President George Bush and actor Robert De Niro. In recent years, Mr Bacon has been fighting Mr Nygard's attempts to expand the property, claiming he has been illegally and surreptitiously adding to the size of his compound. He has previously accused Mr Nygard of creating an environmental disaster by enlarging his  estate in the exclusive community at the western tip of New Providence island with illegal sand dumps. Eccentric: Mr Nygard (pictured, center, with women at Beverly Hills Hotel), who has seven children by four women, built his impressive 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', in 1987 . He has also accused his neighbor of character assassination, claiming he used a private jet to fly Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, to the Bahamas, where he denounced Mr Bacon as a racist at a rally. And last month, Mr Bacon alleged that Mr Nygard paid dozens of protesters to march through the streets of Nassau carrying signs linking him to the Ku Klux Klan. However, the clothing magnate argues that Mr Bacon is simply angry at his refusal to sell him his 'prized parcel'. In his action, Mr Nygard also claims that Mr Bacon installed four 'large, military-grade' speakers at the boundary between their two properties, before aiming them at his bedroom. Visitors: Before the blaze, Mr Nygard's home had been featured on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' and 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous', with visitors including ex-President George Bush (left) and actor Robert De Niro (right) He then blared 'ear piercing noises' toward Mr Nygard with the sole aim of embarrassing him in front of his guests, the papers allege. 'There, that's a message from Mr. Bacon. Don't f*** with Louis,' one of the Mr Bacon's assistants allegedly shouted after blaring the noise. The lawsuit, which cites a conversation between the tycoons, has finally hit the U.S. after going through the Bahamian courts. In New York court papers, filed yesterday, Mr Bacon alleges that videos taken by Mr Nygard’s former employee, Stephen Feralio, will prove he was behind a smear campaign. Fashion mogul: Last month, Mr Bacon alleged that Mr Nygard (pictured  at Beverly Hills Hotel) paid dozens of protesters to march through the streets of Nassau carrying signs linking him to the Ku Klux Klan . But in his Los Angeles legal move, Mr Nygard is aiming to keep the 1,000-plus hours of alleged footage away from his neighbor. Earlier this year, more than 100 people, including actor Sean Connery and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, filed a legal complaint against the Bahamian government over efforts by Mr Nygard to redevelop his compound. Those who filed the complaint accuse the government of withholding public records related to work on Mr Nygard's compound. They also say the fashion mogul previously caused significant environmental damage during continuing renovations that they say occurred without the required permits. In addition to redeveloping his compound, Mr Nygard is seeking to develop and gain access to land surrounding his property, prompting an outcry from other residents.","It is the latest accusation in long-running dispute between the two tycoons .

"These incredible photographs show the moment a pair of frogs camouflaged themselves against a leaf to help protect their precious eggs. The amphibians can barely be seen at a quick glance as they cling to the green foliage at the La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. The stunning images of the reticulated glass frogs, which were taken by British wildlife photographers Michael and Patricia Fogden, show the animals watching over their unhatched offspring. The stunning images of the reticulated glass frogs, which were taken by British wildlife photographers Michael and Patricia Fogden, show the camouflaged animals as they watch over their unhatched offspring in Costa Rica . Glass frogs lay their eggs out of water to stay away from predators and often pick leaves overhanging streams so that when the tadpoles hatch they drop into the water. Once hatched, the tadpoles hide among leaf litter . The tiny male - who measures just 19 - 24mm in length - has been keeping guard over the eggs and has even been moistening them with water in dry weather. Mr Fogden said the animals choose to lay their eggs out of the water to stay out of the reach of predators which lurk there. He said: 'They pick leaves overhanging streams so that when the tadpoles hatch they drop into the water. 'Once in the water, the newly hatched tadpoles swim to the edges of the stream and hide themselves amongst the leaf litter. 'The dad looks over them during the day and protects the eggs from parasitic wasps, flies, and small predators like ants and spiders. 'In temperate zones most frogs lay their eggs in water, leaving their tadpoles to develop without any parental care so it would be very unusual there. The amphibians can barely be seen at a quick glance as they cling to the green foliage at the La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. The Fogdens made the trip in breeding season to take the images . 'Several species of frogs in tropical rainforests use this or a similar strategy but it is unusual for the male to attend the eggs throughout daylight hours.' Mr Fogden, who, along with his wife, divides his time  between Norfolk in the UK and Ecuador in South America, said they timed their visit to the research centre to tie in with the frogs' breeding season. He said: 'The frogs are well camouflaged, especially in the dappled light of the forest canopy, but we knew the sort of place to search for them.

"A Seattle couple discovered their 12-year-old adopted son was molesting their other children and are now suing the Department of Social and Health Services, who they say failed to reveal to them the boy's startling past. Trish and Steven, who've withheld their last names from reporters, say their social worker and the state neglected to tell them that at his previous home the boy wasn't even allowed to be in the same room as younger children. When they learned was he was capable of, it was too late. They say he's now been convicted of child molestation. Nowhere to turn: Trish and Steven are suing the state of Washington after learning the 12-year-old boy they adopted in 2013 molested their six other children soon after . Had no idea: The couple's son, the eldest of their family seen here, was barred from even being in the same room as other children in a previous home, which Trish and Steve weren't told . Now there's no where for the boy to go and, since he's not allowed to stay with their other children, Trish and Steven must pay for him to live in a separate home from the one where they're raising their six other kids. The nightmare began shortly after they adopted the boy. Trish told state officials: 'We can handle his behaviors as long as he's not a danger to my children.' The boy was placed in the couple's home along with two other foster children and the couple's four biological children. Two months after his March 2013 adoption, Trish and Steven's 8-year-old adopted son began made 'sexual gestures,' KIRO reports. The 8-year-old soon admitted to his parents what his adopted older brother had done. 'I was getting scared,' Trish said. 'Then he said, he does this to our other one too. I lost it. I was crying.' But the situation only worsened thereafter. Trish and Steven spoke to their other children and all six had been fondled or otherwise molested by the eldest adopted son. After some digging, Trish 'found there was a safety plan put in place for him in another home, where he wasn't even supposed to be in the same room as younger children.' Since the couple have adopted the boy and are no longer simply fostering him, he can't simply be taken back by the state. 'They lied to us, put our children in danger, and then told us we had to live with it,' Trish said. 'Throwing him away is not an option': The couple are admirably still supporting the boy, who must now live in a separate home from them and their other children, which they must pay for . Not that either deeply devoted parent would allow the state to have him. They say they intend to continue doing everything they can to help him. 'Throwing him away his not an option. We're still trying to do everything we can,' Steven said. The couple are now suing the Washington Department of Social and Health Services. 'Not only did the state fail us, they failed him,' Trish said. The state agency is not commenting on the matter. They told KIRO only: . 'We are working with our partners in the Office of Attorney General to review this lawsuit filing. At this point, it contains allegations that will be proven or disproven in court, and we do not intend to try the case in the media.'","Seattle parents Trish and Steven, who are withholding their last name, were horrified to learn a boy they'd adopted was fondling all their children .

"The White House is struggling to assert President Barack Obama's relevance as drowning Democrats have had to decide between defending him and throwing him under their campaign buses. Several liberals in tough re-election fights have opted, Peter-like, to deny him three times before Election Day's cock can crow. Mark Begich, Alaska's embattled Senate Democrat, put his finger on what his party's bigger names are grappling with, saying that while he voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012,'that's irrelevant. The president's not relevant. He's gone in two years.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Weak: Senators in the Democratic Party are shunning President Obama (left) as he dashes from crisis to crisis – including a widely panned Ebola response now being helmed by party operative Ron Klain (on couch) First choice, Bubba: Former President Bill Clinton (center) became part of Kentucky Senate hopeful Alison Grimes' selfie on Tuesday, before telling Kentuckians not to give Republican Mitch McConnell 6 more years in the Senate because of anger toward a president with 2-years left in office . 'I've disagreed plenty with Obama, but that’s not an issue to me,' Begich said. 'It’s where we are today, it’s the next six years. He’s gone in two.' 'Whoever’s the next U.S. senator will be dealing with a new president. That’s the bottom line.' The White House fired back on Thursday after that report appeared in The Washington Examiner. 'I didn’t see those comments,' Obama's press secretary Josh Earnest said improbably. 'The vast majority of Americans would agree that that whoever the sitting President of the United States happens to be is relevant in a lot of important ways.' Even the party's chairwoman, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is putting space between herself and the Oval Office. She needs to win re-election, too. Asked on the MNSBC 'Morning Joe' program if voters who support Democratic congressional candidates on Nov. 4 will be symbolically backing the president, Wasserman Schultz insisted he's is not an Election Day issue. 'Barack Obama was on the ballot in 2012 and 2008,' she said. True enough, but his policies are on the ballot. Just ask Obama himself. The president ensured his relevance, at least in the cutthroat Senate campaigns that will determine who runs Congress in 2015 and 2016, by insisting during an Oct. 2 speech that his 'policies are on the ballot' in November, 'every single one of them.' David Axelrod, Obama's longtime political savant, told NBC's program 'Meet the Press' days later that inserting that language 'was a mistake.' 'I wouldn't put that line there,' Axelrod said. With that one rhetorical flourish near the end of an otherwise uninspiring economic speech at Northwestern University, the president made the elections, in part, about himself. And with Obama's approval numbers hovering just below 40 per cent – and dipping to a disastrous 33 per cent in Begich's Alaska – that turn doesn't bode well for his party. Stalking horse: Obama said in a radio ad that Michelle Nunn (right), a Georgia politician who won't be seen with him, will nonetheless vote for his policies if she wins a Senate seat . Already four different Democratic Senate candidates have dodged the question of whether they voted for the president, including Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In the tense North Carolina Senate race, Democrat Kay Hagan found herself between the proverbial rock and hard place on Tuesday, when an MSNBC reporter asked her if Obama is 'a strong leader' in the face of crisis. 'We were late to the table' on Ebola, Hagan conceded. 'So you don’t think he showed strong leadership?' came the reporter's follow-up. 'Certainly,' she conceded, 'there are issues that I certainly think – um, no.' Earnest, at the White House, demurred on Thursday with stronger resolve than Hagan showed in defending Obama. Hagan has a history of delivering results for North Carolinians, Earnest told reporters, 'even if it means criticizing the leader or her own party. I think that's a testament to her leadership.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama is 'relevant' because he's president – but didn't offer specific policy reasons . As Obama's coattails have shrunk in his second term, surrogates like former President Bill Clinton have given speeches and worked fundraising rooms on his behalf in states where a lost Senate race could contribute to a Congress controlled exclusively by the GOP. 'Make sure nobody casts a protest vote,' Clinton told a crowd of Kentuckians on Wednesday. 'Whoever heard of somebody giving a six-year job for a two-year protest?' Obama tried this week to clamp off the flow of blood to the Democratic Party's more resentful wing by telling MSNBC host Al Sharpton that his electorally vulnerable detractors are all 'folks who vote with me.' 'They have supported my agenda in Congress,' he said, even if they're keeping their distance when voters are within earshot. That message resonated in Georgia this week when a radio ad started running on urban-contemporary radio stations in majority-black counties. 'If Michelle Nunn wins, that means that Democrats keep control of the Senate, and that means that we can keep on doing some good work,' Obama is heard saying in the 30-second spot. Nunn is squaring off against Republican David Perdue in a contest for an open Senate seat. Obama hasn't appeared with her on the campaign trail.","Alaska Democratic Sen.

"In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took the first recognisable images of Earth from space. He used a Hasselblad camera and Zeiss lens to take the photographs on the Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) mission. More than 50 years later, the unique camera is set to go to auction at RR Auction’s Boston Gallery - and it is expected to ‘far exceed’ the estimate of between $50,000 (£31,250) and $100,000 (£62,500).

Hasselblad sill makes medium format cameras and is based in Gothenburg, Sweden. They were also used during the Apollo program missions when humans landed on the moon. Mr Schirra reportedly bought it himself at a Houston photo supply shop in 1962 and then took it to Nasa to prepare for his mission. MA-8 was the US' fifth manned space mission.

He was a US naval officer, aviator, aeronautical engineer and test pilot - but most notably, one of the original seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury, America's first effort to put humans in space. He flew a six hour orbit, nine hour Mercury-Atlas 8 mission on October 3, 1962. The capsule attained a velocity of 17,557 miles per hour (28,255 kph) and an altitude of 175 miles (282km). In doing so, he became the ninth human to ride a rocket into space. He was the first person to go into space three times and the only person to have flown in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. In the third orbit, he took photographs over California and on the sixth orbit, of South America. ‘It was not until astronaut Wally Schirra - a known camera enthusiast - naturally sought the finest camera available at the time to accompany him on his MA-8 mission that Nasa’s photographic identity began to take shape,' said Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President at RR Auction. While his pictures are not as famous as Earthrise - a snap taken by William Anders in 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission - it paved the way for such images, which are given credit for changing people’s perceptions of planet Earth. Engineers at the United States Air Force camera laboratory worked with Wally Schirra and later fellow astronaut Gordon Cooper to modify the camera. This included the installation of a 100-exposure film container, an aiming device mounted on the side, and modification of the camera surface. The original metal facing was repainted black to minimise reflections. Mr Cooper used the Hasselblad camera along with the  Zeiss lens on the next Mercury mission, MA-9.

Rather than call for a boycott or launch defamation lawsuits, Opus Dei seized the opportunity that the publicity generated to open up. After years of dodging press inquiries and fending off criticisms that it was a cult, Opus Dei launched a global, media-friendly PR 'get to know us' campaign that culminates with the beatification that was open for all to attend.","Mass celebrated by Cardinal Angelo Amato, the first step on becoming a saint .

"He's the airline boss who called his own customers 'stupid' and told refund-hunters to 'f*** off'. But it seems Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is finally ending his not-so-friendly approach to customer service - and admits he should have done so a long time ago. With profits and passenger traffic on the rise amid a charm offensive, the divisive chief executive told MailOnline Travel: 'We should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been'. Scroll down for video . Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline should have been 'nicer' to customers in the past . The Dublin-based carrier has long faced public criticism for its surcharges and treatment of customers, and now it appears Mr O’Leary feels that his management style may have been too abrasive. Mr O’Leary said he realises that his mentor and Ryanair co-founder, the late Tony Ryan, was on to something when he campaigned for a customer-friendly airline. He said: ‘The thing that we repeatedly would have clashed over was my determination to make Ryanair the lowest cost airline in Europe and Tony’s desire to make it the most beloved airline in Europe. ‘I think the Always Getting Better programme we’ve launched in the last 12 months and the significant improvements we’ve made in the customer experience, and the way that customers have responded to that, would suggest that he was right.’ Mr O’Leary added: ‘He wanted it to be very low cost and very profitable but then he also wanted it to be winning awards for customer service and being beloved, and the two generally don’t match, but I think he was probably a little bit too extreme on the customer service side and I was certainly too extreme on being low cost and mean. ‘But I’m leaning over the last year or two that a lot of what he was saying was actually right, we should have been nicer to customers earlier than we have been.’ In response to his critics or sceptics, Mr O’Leary insists the no-frills carrier’s friendlier approach is not a gimmick or a temporary effort and they are ‘real’ and ‘genuine’ changes. Mr O'Leary says the carrier's attempt to improve customer service is not a gimmick or temporary effort . Ryanair's effort to win over customers includes a softer stance on baggage charges and booking conditions . He said: ‘This is a change. We have just completed the first year, I think we have two more years of the program to roll out where you’re going to see more and more focus on improving the experience and actively listening to customers and trying to provide them with the services they’re looking for. ‘As I said myself if I had known being nicer to our customers was going to work so well I would have done it years ago.’ Ryanair has implemented a number of measures to improve its image and address the impact that poor customer service has had on sales. It has softened its stance on baggage charges and booking conditions, overhauled its website and introduced allocated seating, a new business class service and a family discount scheme. Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Transport Roger Lewentz (left) and Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary hold a press conference at Frankfurt-Hahn Airport in Lautzenhausen, Germany on 12 May 2014 . Ryanair  expects to carry 87 million customers, an increase of one million from the previous forecast, this year . But as for what Ryanair has planned next for its customers, Mr O’Leary remains tight-lipped. He said there are plans to in-flight wifi and a holiday brand, but declined to identify additional measures. He said the carrier is ‘looking at a couple of things’ and plans to cut fares and will ‘never say never’ to easing other surcharges. On the no refund policy: 'You're not getting a refund so f*** off. We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 'no refund' don't you understand?' On a passenger charged £236 in fees for forgetting to print boarding cards: 'We think Mrs McLeod should pay 60 euros for being so stupid... There are 0.02 per cent of passengers who are equally stupid. We say quite politely to those passengers, b***** off' On removing toilets and charging 'per pee': 'We are flying aircraft on an average flight time of one hour around Europe. What the hell do we need three toilets for? If you get rid of two [toilets] you can get six seats on a 737' On what powers his planes: 'All flights are fuelled with Leprechaun wee and my bull****' Travellers appear to be warming up to Ryanair’s effort to revamp its image with the airline expecting more passengers and a higher net profit than originally forecast this fiscal year. It expects to carry 87 million customers, an increase of one million from the previous forecast, and it has raised its full year net profit towards the upper end of its previously guided range of £484m to £507m. It comes as Ryanair plans an aggressive expansion across Europe and into new markets, including North Africa, Israel and the Gulf States with the purchase of up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft. Mr O’Leary told MailOnline Travel that the airline is also looking to offer flights between Ireland and Moscow and St Petersburg in Russia, but talks that began six months ago are facing a hurdle. He said: ‘The problem at the moment is the Irish Tourism Authority, despite the fact that they say Russia is one of their target markets, aren’t willing to support the launch of services into Russia so we’re not willing to open up Russia until we get support from the Irish authorities.’ The 53-year-old Irish executive has been at the helm of Ryanair for 20 years and recently agreed to a five-year extension that will keep him with the airline through 2019. He spoke to MailOnline Travel to promote a biography of Mr Ryan, who took Mr O’Leary under his wing as a personal assistant at Guinness Peat Aviation, the aircraft leasing company he founded, in 1987. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, centre, speaks to Tony Ryan, right, in this photo from 2001 . Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said he had a 'quasi father-son relationship' with airline co-founder Tony Ryan . Mr O’Leary said he was interviewed by the book’s author, Richard Aldous, to provide ‘unvarnished recollections’ of Mr Ryan. The book details how their relationship became strained over Mr O’Leary’s brash management style and aggressive strategy for the airline. Mr O’Leary described it as a ‘quasi father-son relationship’ that had its ups and downs, and said he owes much of his success to Mr Ryan. He said: ‘We fought a lot made up a lot and achieved a lot together. ‘I learned his ambition, his world vision. He was never content to be a big noise just in Ireland, he wanted to go and conquer the world. I think that outward looking vision is what has made Ryanair a success, the quest to always get bigger and better.

"Its history is steeped in bloody battle, treachery and intrigue. A thousand years after William the Conqueror built it, Warwick Castle is still at the centre of drama. There’s not so much gore and murder these days, but feelings are certainly running high amid fears of a new kind of invader laying siege to the castle walls… glampers. Local burghers are considering whether to approve plans for 20 medieval-style lodges, five tree houses and 41 glamping tents and a banquet area in the castle’s historic grounds. Scroll down for video . The grounds of Warwick Castle could soon be home to 20 medieval-style lodges, five tree houses, 41 glamping tents and a banquet area . The inside of the glamping tents - Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle, were granted temporary permission for the tents last year but want 41 permanent ones on the site . At present, families can book one of the tents, some of which come with their own four-poster beds, for between £160 and £200 a night . Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle originally developed by William as a motte and bailey fortress in 1068, were granted temporary permission for glamping tents last year. Families can book one of the tents, some of which come with their own four-poster beds, for between £160 and £200 a night. But now the firm has lodged larger plans with Warwick Council to create a permanent holiday village on the banks of the Avon. The one and two-story luxury lodges would have a traditional timber frame and thatched roofs and be linked by a network of boardwalks. The council is expected to rule on the plans – which could see up to 900 tourists stay at the castle each year – at a meeting in November. If it goes ahead, the holiday village will be built on a 13-acre site 500 yards south of the castle, known as Foxes Study. But furious locals say that the scheme will turn the castle into a ‘Butlins holiday park’. Locals are furious that the historic castle is being turned into a theme park with the latest plans . The castle was built a thousand years ago by William the Conqueror - there are now plans for a holiday village .

If the plans are granted, the village will be built on a 13-acre site 500 yards south of the castle . Merlin Entertainment, the current owners of the castle, are hoping to get permanent permission for glamping . Chris Edwards, 65, said: ‘This is not Alton Towers. It’s not Legoland. It is England’s premier medieval castle. 'Granting permission for glamping was the first step in turning this historic heritage site into a theme park. And granting this application would be another nail in the coffin of Warwick as a historic town and of the castle as a place abounding in history.’ Account manager Robert Jenkins, 45, added: ‘From the plans the lodges look beautiful and in a tranquil spot, yet in reality what you will have is a glorified Butlins holiday park overshadowing a wonderful castle. ‘The whole character of the castle will be lost if this goes ahead which will be a real shame.’ Merlin Entertainment’s plans state: ‘The castle is the most important landmark building and both the castle and parkland are of exceptionally high visual quality. ‘The proposed glamping tents will have no significant effect on the character and appearance of the wider or immediate sub-area of the Warwick Conservation Area, particularly given the relatively enclosed nature of the application site and given the site is well screened by the existing mature trees, dense foliage and shrubs.’","Burghers could approve plans for 20 medieval-style lodges, five tree houses, 41 glamping tents and a banquet area in the castle’s historic grounds .

"Road rage: Kimberly Pankratius, 36, was at a Walmart on Saturday evening when she spotted Julie and Christopher Weakly pulling into a parking spot that she had been waiting for . An angry shopper drove her car into a  couple  after she spotted them 'stealing' a parking spot that she had been waiting for in Walmart. Kimberly Pankratius, 36, flew into a rage  when she spotted Julie and Christopher Weakly pulling into the spot at a Walmart on Saturday evening. She then pulled up alongside their vehicle and shouted out ‘douche bags.’ Julie Weakly, 40, told police that she and her husband ignored Pankratius’s comments ‘and continued walking towards the store. But Pankratius sped toward them in her PT Cruiser, striking one of the victims, according to police. Christopher Weakly told police that as they approached Walmart, the couple heard tires squealing and saw Pankratius speeding towards them. As the car turned in front of them his wife was struck in the arm by the driver’s side mirror. The impact caused the mirror to break and hang off the vehicle. Though she was in pain, Weakly declined medical treatment. Christopher Weakly told police that the PT Cruiser--which sped away from the lot--was ‘only inches’ away from hitting him. They then quickly wrote down the  car’s license plate, according to The Smoking Gun. Weakly said that he ‘inadvertently’ took the spot for which Pankratius was waiting. Later, when police questioned Pankratius, she confessed to the parking lot rage incident. She said that she felt 'really bad' and added, ‘I did do it. I’m so, so scared.’ Pankratius claimed to be  angry that the couple had taken her parking spot and was ‘attempting to drive fast towards them to scare them.’ Road Rage: Pankratius, sped toward the duo in her PT Cruiser, striking one of the victims . But she  did  not intend to hit anyone and became ‘scared’ after realizing that she ‘hit Julie with her driver’s side mirror.’ Police noted that Pankratius was ‘very cooperative and apologetic’ while being questioned. She has been charged with two felonies, assault and use of a deadly weapon to commit a felony. She was booked into the Lancaster County jail, where she remains locked up in lieu of $2500 bond.","Kimberly Pankratius, 36, was shopping at Walmart on Saturday evening .

"Two new moons have been discovered orbiting Jupiter, bringing the planet's total number of known satellites to 67. And, at just two kilometres in diameter, one of the moons may be Jupiter's smallest known satellite. The two distant moons - S/2010 J 1 and S/2010 J 2 - were discovered during routine tracking observations of already known satellites in September 2010. They were then re-observed by scientists several times that autumn. Two new distant moons Of Jupiter - S/2010 J 1 (circled) and S/2010 J 2 - were discovered during routine tracking observations of already known satellites in September 2010 . With Jupiter now having 67 known satellites, the discovery of two tiny moons does not have a large bearing on our understanding of the system. Their size has been estimated based on their brightness. S/2010 J 1 is 3km in . diametre, while S/2010 J 1 is estimated to be just 2km in diameter. It . is believed that nearly all moons the size of S/2010 J 1 or larger are . known. But as there are always a lot more small moons than large . moons, there must be dozens of satellites in the 1-3 km class. The researchers, whose study is published in Astronomical Journal, claim their finds confirm this. And as S/2010 J 2 is the faintest, and thus smallest, Jovian satellite discovered to date, its discovery confirms that the planet's satellite population does continue down to those sizes. Researcher Mike Alexandersen, from the University of British Columbia, said: 'It . was exciting to realise that S/2010 J 2 is the smallest moon in . the Solar System that was discovered and tracked from Earth.. S/2010 J 1 orbits with an average distance from Jupiter of . 23.5million kilometres and has an orbital period of 2.02 years. S/2010 J 2 . has a semi-major axis of 21million kilometres and an orbital period . of 1.69 years. The . irregular satellites of the giant planets are clustered in 'families' with similar orbits and colours. These families are believed to have . formed as a result of ancient collisions of passing-by comets or . asteroids with former larger moons. S/2010 J 1 was discovered on images taken by the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope by an international team led by Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomers Robert Jacobson and Marina Brozovic, and University of British Columbia astronomy professor Brett Gladman and PhD student Mr Alexandersen. S/2010 J 2 was spotted on images taken with the MegaCam mosaic CCD camera at the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii telescope by CFHT executive director and director Christian Veillet. Upon later inspection, S/2010 J 2 was also weakly visible in the images taken just days earlier by Palomar.","One of the moons - S/2010 J 1 - is just 2km in diametre .

"Vince Cable has launched an astonishing broadside against the party’s green agenda, saying that it imposes too high a cost on industry. The Business Secretary said industries with high energy costs such as steel, are struggling against their international competitors because of soaring electricity costs. Chancellor George Osborne has given £250million compensation to ‘energy intensive’ industries, but Mr Cable admitted this ‘doesn’t go the whole hog’. It is a surprise admission from a Liberal Democrat, because the party is passionate about renewable energy which is funded by levies on households and businesses. His party colleague, Energy Secretary Ed Davey, clashed with the Conservatives last year when they blocked his attempt to set an even more ambitious green energy target for 2030. But Mr Cable told a conference fringe event last night: ‘We do have an issue which should concern us as Lib Dems because of our very strong environmental commitments. Many of our manufacturing companies and exporters – particularly in areas like steel and cement and others which consume lots of electricity – are struggling against international competition because of the cost of energy.’ George Osborne has warned against imposing green taxes which leave British business disadvantaged . He said his party had to recognise that forcing businesses abroad would simply ‘export pollution’ to other countries and not benefit the environment. Mr Cable was talking about why, despite the economic recovery, Britain’s exports have stalled. He said the main reason is that half of UK exports go to the eurozone which is still emerging from the financial crisis. They have also been battered by the growing strength of the pound against the euro. But another reason is green energy. ‘They [firms] argue that because we are trying to be green we are imposing costs on them which their competitors don’t have,’ he said. ‘Now of course a lot of that is unfair, and we have now introduced compensation schemes to offset some of those costs, but... it doesn’t go the whole hog by any means. 'There’s an issue here about the extent to which we are willing to tolerate the export of pollution because of our own system of taxing and charging industries which have a high energy content.’ Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, representing heavy industry which directly employs 200,000 people and contributes £15billion a year to the economy, said: ‘The penny is dropping.’ He said: ‘We have been used to hearing comments like that from minister in private, about their fears driving industry offshore. But it is really significant to hear those comments from a secretary of state at a party conference, particularly at the Lib Dem conference because of their green agenda. ‘Hopefully the penny is dropping both with those who have been enthusiastic about the green agenda that we have to temper our ambitions to keep manufacturing investment coming into the UK. The compensation available does not out us on a level with European competitors such as Germany. Mr Nicholson said Germany has some of the most ambitious green energy targets in the world – and much higher household bills than in Britain, but the government gives billions of pounds in support to heavy industry. He added: ‘British business, however, is trying to compete internationally with one arm tied behind its back.’ Britain’s revenue from green taxes was £43billion in 2013 – the second highest in Europe.","Business Secretary said levies on energy were undermining British exports .

"The dog that killed its owner's baby granddaughter in a frenzied attack was investigated by council officials just five months before the tragedy. The animal, believed to be a pitbull, was brought to the attention of local authorities following complaints from neighbours  in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in May. Daventry District Council officials visited the woman's home, but decided no action against the dog was needed. Neighbours placed a single bunch of flowers at the door of a home where a woman's granddaughter was mauled to death by a pitbull. The pet was reported to local authorities five months before the attack . On Friday it mauled its owner's six-month-old granddaughter to death before being destroyed by vets. Its owner was bitten repeatedly in the hand as she tried to pry the baby out of its mouth's grip. Today council chiefs admitted doing nothing to prevent its dangerous behaviour after being phoned by one of the woman's neighbours. Ian Vincent, Chief Executive of Daventry District Council, said: 'We received one noise complaint in May from a neighbour relating to two dogs barking at the property. 'As with all such complaints, we spoke to the owners of the dogs who acted to control the noise to a reasonable level. 'We have not received any other complaints relating to these dogs. 'We always encourage anyone with concerns about the safety of any dog to report them to us or the police.' Daventry District Council visited the property in May following reports that the dogs were too noisy . Tragic: A message from neighbours left on a bunch of yellow and red flowers rests outside the woman's front door . He added: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family following this tragic incident, which has shocked and saddened our local community. 'We are working with Northamptonshire Police to assist their investigation into the circumstances leading up to this tragedy.' It comes after neighbours revealed they were worried about the animals in the weeks before the child's death. The residents, who didn't want to be named, said the 'devil dogs' were walked with muzzles. 'The neighbours whose homes back on to the side of the house have been complaining to the district council and dog wardens since May. 'They have complained multiple times but nothing has been done. They were even recording sound levels. 'You could hear the dogs killing each other fighting non-stop in the house from 100ft away inside our house. Neighbours claimed the dog was similar to a pitbull terrier (file image of the breed above) 'They were screeching, growling and barking all the time. It was terrifying, they are known as the devil dogs. 'One of the ladies who complained said she was worried her two young children would be killed if they escaped. 'You see all the emergency services there and you really feel for the family. 'But at the end of the day if something had been done and the complaints were listened to then that little girl might still be alive.' Daventry District Council said only one complaint had been lodged. While police are yet to formally identify the breed of the dog, residents claimed it is similar to pitbulls which are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991. This afternoon a spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said the family had been devastated by the 'harrowing' incident. Detective Inspector Stuart Hitchon is leading the investigation into this incident. He said: 'My officers are working hard to piece together the events that led to the tragic death of a six-month old child. 'We are supporting the family through what is an incredibly harrowing time.' A post-mortem examination of the animal was under way at Royal Veterinary College this afternoon.","Neighbours complained about the dog to Daventry District Council .

"Jade Lomas-Anderson who was mauled by four dogs as she ate lunch at the house of her friend . The inquest of a teenager killed by four  dogs that leapt at her because she was carrying a pie heard the animals were 'stir crazy'. The 'hyper-aggressive' dogs that killed Jade Lomas-Anderson, 14,  in Atherton, Greater Manchester, on March 26 last year were owned by Beverley Concannon. The 45-year-old failed to attend the girl's inquest today after she was taken to hospital by ambulance at 7.30am this morning, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. One dog was later described as 'stir crazy' after being kept constantly caged while the others were cooped up in her council house and 'never' seen being walked or let out. Jade, a friend of Concannon's daughter, Kimberley, was bitten from 'head to toe' and died from her injuries during the attack. The dogs were shot dead by police. Concannon later admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the pets and was given a 16-week suspended jail sentence after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge her with manslaughter by gross negligence through lack of evidence. At the inquest into Jade's death today, members of her family were told that Concannon, who should have been a witness, had been taken to hospital. Alan Walsh, Coroner for Manchester West, told them he would hear from some witnesses before adjourning the hearing while police made further inquiries to see if Concannon is fit to attend the court to give evidence tomorrow. Jade's stepfather, Michael Anderson, 35, told the hearing Jade was well-behaved, very polite with good manners and 'the ideal daughter'. Initially Mr Anderson and his wife, Jade's mother, Shirley, 37, had refused permission for her to stay over at the home of her school friend, Kimberley Concannon - but eventually agreed because she had had a good school report. Buddy, a Bull Mastiff, was one of four dogs owned by Colcannon destroyed by armed police after the attack . A male Staffordshire Bull Terrier (right) and Bull Mastiff Neo (left). It is believed the dogs attacked Jade when she walked into the room carrying a meat pie . Jade returned home the next day but then went back to her friends house in Chaucer Grove in Atherton, Greater Manchester. Around 2.30pm on the day of the fatal attack a neighbour knocked on their door to tell the parents 'there had been an accident'. Mr Anderson told the inquest: 'I drove around and panicked and I left, Shel ran off. I shot off in the car.' Alan Welsh, coroner for Manchester West asked Mr Anderson: 'When you got (there) police had closed off the road and you were very sadly told in a short time that Jade had died?' Mr Anderson replied: 'Yes.' Beverley Concannon, 45, was taken to hospital by ambulance at 7.30am this morning, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. Grief: Shirley Lomas Anderson (pink top), mother of Jade Anderson, arriving at Bolton Coroners court . Shirley Lomas Anderson and Michael Anderson (right), parents of Jade Anderson arriving at Bolton Coroners court . Dr Naomi Carter, the Home Office pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination, concluded Jade died of 'multiple injuries' from dog bites, particularly to her neck, from at least two dogs. A tearful Mr Anderson asked the doctor: 'Did she suffer for long?' Dr Carter replied: 'The answer to that is no, she did not.' Paul Carter, a next-door neighbour of Beverley Concannon, said she kept five dogs - two large mastiffs, called Ty and Sky, two Staffordshire Bull terriers, Buddy and Neo, and a smaller cross breed dog called Charlie. Mr Carter said the dogs were always kept in the house and Buddy - which would bark if approached and would be aggressive - kept in a cage in the kitchen. A gate was kept across the kitchen door and when he visited he would be 'ushered' in with the dogs kept away from visitors, until they 'settled down', the hearing was told. Beverley Concannon's house, where Jade was attacked, has now been boarded up . Mr Carter said on the day of the attack Kimberley Concannon visited his house to ask if she could warm a pie up as their microwave was broke. She then went home but returned a 'very short time' later. Mr Carter continued: 'Banging on the kitchen window, banging really loud. 'She then said she had seen Jade and she said she's dead. She kept repeating the words over and over again and tears rolling down her face.' Meanwhile his partner, Jody Lewis, had called Beverley Concannon and told her to return home immediately. A brief statement from Kimberley Concannon stated: 'I left home to warm a pie up for my friend. 'When I left Jade was in the house on her own. When I came back in the girl I saw laid down on the floor was Jade Anderson. I had only been gone for about five minutes.' Jade's parents have said they want the law change to prevent the same tragedy happening to another family . Jasmine Steward, a friend of Catrina Concannon, another of Beverley Concannon's daughters, told the hearing she never stayed over at the house and always insisted on the dogs being put outside if she went round. She added: 'I was scared of dogs but Catrina's dogs scared me even more as they would go mad when I went past the fence at the side of the house. 'Catrina used to tell me they were safe and would not bite.' Laura Tonge, a neighbour, said Concannon would send her a message on Facebook asking her to come round, 'for the sake of a cig or could you lend the kids a couple of quid'. But Mrs Tonge said she would never be allowed into the house because of the dogs. 'As far as I got was the doorstep,' she said. Mrs Tonge added: 'I do recall her telling me one time she would not like anybody to rob her house because they would not be walking back out.' Coroner Mr Walsh asked: 'Did you ever see them being walked?' 'Never,' Mrs Tonge replied. The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow morning.","Jade Lomas-Anderson died after the four dogs attacked her .

"A 13-year-old boy from Washington DC was fatally shot by his best friend when a loaded handgun they were playing with went off. Tyrin Caldwell died Wednesday after a bullet struck him in the chest in his friend’s apartment on Downing Street in Northeast Washington. His father, 31-year-old Tyrone Celey, said he believes the shooting was an accident and doesn't want any charges to be brought against Tyrin’s friend, a 14-year-old. Scroll down for video . Too young: Tyrin Caldwell (pictured left and right), 13, was killed in an accidental shooting after his best friend fired a round from a gun the two boys were playing with . Crime scene: The accident took place on the third floor of the Brooklyn Manor apartment complex in Washington DC where Caldwell's friend lived with his mother . The unnamed teenage shooter was placed in police custody immediately following the fatal incident. Police responded to the Brooklyn Manor housing complex in the 1400 block of Downing Street at around 7.20pm Tuesday after getting a call about shots fired. Officers went up to the third floor and found Tyrin Caldwell with a gunshot wound. The teen was still conscious and breathing. Tyrin's father, who ran up to the apartment after hearing the gunshot, said his dying son kept repeating, 'Daddy, hurt,' according to NBC Washington. The eighth-grader was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he died less than an hour later. If police learn that the gun used to kill Tyrin belonged to his friend's mother, she could face charges for failing to keep the weapon in a secure location. Speaking to a Washington Post reporter outside the apartment building, a heartbroken Tyrone Celey said he feels like he failed because he could not keep his son safe. Last words: Tyrin's father rushed to his side and heard the teen say, 'Daddy, hurt' over and over again . Forgiveness: The victim's father said he doesn't want any charges to be brought against the 14-year-old, who was inseparable friends with his son (pictured left and right) The father won custody of Tyrin only last year after a protracted and bitter custody battle with the boy's mother. Celey described his son and the 14-year-old boy as inseparable friends who were always seen together. The boys stayed indoors most of the time playing video games to avoid the drug dealers peddling their product on the street. Tyrin's father recalled that when he rushed up to the third-floor apartment and found his son lying mortally wounded on the floor, his friend was crying and told him he did not mean to fire the shot.","Tyrin Caldwell, 13, died after a bullet struck him in the chest in his best friend’s apartment in Washington DC .

"Archaeologists have unearthed a 6,000-year-old temple in the Ukraine that shows evidence of of complex sacrificial practices. The prehistoric place of worship was found to contain altars and burnt lamb bones as well as human-like figurines, shedding light on practices within a huge prehistoric settlement. Measuring 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres) the temple was originally a two-storey construction made of wood and clay with a courtyard, . Scroll down for video . Archaeologists have discovered a 6,000-year-old temple in the Ukraine that shows signs of sacrifices. Measuring 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres) the temple (pictured) was a two storey construction made of wood and clay with a galleries courtyard . Nataliya Burdo and Mykhailo Videiko told the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, that the upper floor of the building was divided into five rooms. The prehistoric place of worship contained altars and burnt bones of lambs as well as humanlike figurines (pictured), shedding light on practices within a huge prehistoric settlement . Archaeologists discovered the remains of eight clay platforms (pictured) that could have been used as altars, as well as ‘numerous burnt bones of lamb, associated with sacrifice’ The temple is at the heart of a vast prehistoric settlement near modern-day Nebelivka (marked with an A on the map), thought to cover an area of 288 acres (238 hectares) based on the results of a geophysical survey . The temple was discovered in 2009 near Nebelivka in the Ukraine. It measures 197ft by 66ft (60 metres by 20 metres). The two storey structure was made from wood and clay, with a courtyard. It is divided into rooms that held clay 'altars' and had red walls. Pottery fragments, humanlike figurines and gold hair ornaments were found. The structure was at the heart of a prehistoric village covering 288 acres (238 hectares). They discovered the remains of eight clay platforms that may have been used as altars, as well as ‘numerous burnt bones of lamb, associated with sacrifice’, according to the journal Tyragetia. The researchers, of the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the floors and walls of the rooms could have been decorated with red paint – perhaps to create a sacrificial atmosphere. There were seven ‘altars’ on the ground floor as well as a courtyard filled with animal bones and fragments of pottery. Clay humanlike figurines were found, which have beak-like noses and eyes that look as if they are mismatched because they are different sizes. Hair decorations made of gold and measuring less than an inch in size were unearthed too. The settlement would have contained more than 1,200 buildings and 50 streets. The complex temple was built in the Ukraine at least 1,000 years before Stonehenge (pictured). Archaeologists believe the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire was built anywhere from 3000 BC to 2000 BC . Hair decorations made of gold and measuring less than an inch in size were unearthed at the temple, which was an important building in the prehistoric village. The settlement would have contained more than 1,200 buildings and 50 streets . The researchers, of the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the floors and walls of the rooms could have been decorated with red paint – perhaps to create a sacrificial atmosphere. Pottery fragments (pictured) were also found at the site . It is not known what the human figures (pictured) were used for at the temple, but similar figurines have been discovered at similar prehistoric sites in the Ukraine and eastern Europe . It was a similar size to others found in the Ukraine and in and other parts of Eastern Europe, which belonged to the ‘Trypillian’ culture. The modern name is inspired by the village of Trypillia, where artefacts from the ancient culture, similar to the figures found at the site,  were first discovered. Archaeologists believe that the settlement at Nebelivka was abandoned by ancient people, who burned the temple down. This is believed to have happened at several Trypillian sites. Curiously, temples of a similar size and design were being built in the Middle East between the fifth to fourth millennia BC, the researchers said. For example, a 6,000-year old temple at the ancient city of Eridu, in modern-day Iraq was also divided into small rooms.","Burnt bones of lambs were found on raised clay 'altars' in the temple .

"A 91-year-old woman's house has lost half its value because an overgrown Japanese knotweed has started taking over the back garden. Elizabeth Abraham has been told the house in Swansea, which was expected to be valued at £80,000, will not sell for more than £45,000 because of the untamed wild weed. Her great niece, Elizabeth Wakeman, has been appointed power of attorney over her affairs and needed to sell the property to pay for Ms Abraham's stay at a care home. Scroll down for video . A Japanese knotweed has started taking over the back garden of Elizabeth Abraham's home in Carmarthen Road, Swansea . She said the strip of land where the invasive plant is growing is unregistered, so they do not know who owns the area. 'The strip of land is about big enough for four or five houses, but I've been in touch with the Land Registry, who say the land is unregistered,' said Ms Wakeman. 'So we face losing out on half the property's worth. 'The money isn't for us — we need to pay social services for the care they've received, as well as accommodation. 'So it's extremely frustrating, because we can't find out who the land belongs to.' The house is now estimated to be worth £45,000, much less than the £80,000 expected . A jungle of Japanese knotweed has started invading the garden, highlighted in red. The strip of land behind the garden is unregistered, so they do not know who owns the area . Japanese knotweed can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October . The Land Registry said the strip of land behind the property on Carmarthen Road was not registered. Compulsory registration of land only came into force in 1975 and any land sold after that date is obliged to be registered with them. Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians. Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days. Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.","A Japanese knotweed has taken over the back garden of a Swansea home .

"American tobacco heiress Doris Duke fell in love with Islamic art and culture during her honeymoon through the Middle East and Asia in 1935. So much so that she commissioned a bedroom and bathroom inspired by the Taj Mahal, the mausoleum in India built by a 17th century emperor for his favorite wife. The marble- and mirror-lined private living quarters will be opened to the public for the first time this weekend in Hawaii after years of extensive repairs and restoration. Duke, who died in 1993, never explained what prompted her to build a house with architectural elements of Syria and India in the oceanfront home she built in Honolulu or to collect items such as 13th century Persian tiles. Open house: The private living quarters of the Honolulu, Hawaiian mansion owned by the late American tobacco heiress Doris Duke will be open for the first time to the public this weekend . Good taste: Duke nicknamed the oceanfront estate Shangri La and it had it decorated with architectural style elements borrowed from Syria and India . Deborah Pope, executive director of the home that's been functioning as a museum of Islamic art since 2002, said Duke was drawn to cultures different from the elite East Coast society of her youth. She also loved things of beauty. 'I think she's an aesthete,' Pope said, sitting on a red settee in Duke's bedroom. The bedroom is located at the end of an open-air passageway extending from the main courtyard of the home that Duke called Shangri La. A perforated marble door, or jali, made by artisans in India opens to a tiled room. Light pours from more jali doors facing the ocean and garden. The highlight, however, might be the bathroom lined with marble that's been inlaid with precious stones in the shape of tulips, anemone and other flowers.

Breezy: A perforated marble door, or jali, made by artisans in India opens to a tiled room. Light pours from more jali doors facing the ocean and garden . Ornate: The highlight, however, might be the bathroom lined with marble that's been inlaid with precious stones in the shape of tulips, anemone and other flowers . Intricate: The rest of the 14,000-square-foot house, including the grand foyer and living room, have been open to the public and scholars for more than a decade . Most of the rest of the 14,000-square-foot house, including the grand foyer and living room, have been open to the public and scholars for more than a decade. But the bedroom and bathroom - called the Mughal Suite after the period when Islamic emperors ruled what is today India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh - was closed while the roof was repaired. Sugata Ray, a University of California, Berkeley professor, said the bath is important for scholars studying an early 20th century revival in Mughal arts and craft techniques. The 18th century earrings and necklaces on display in the suite are unique because few of Duke's contemporaries bought and preserved such things. 'It gives a sense of the diversity of Islamic art,' said Ray, who specializes in the study of South Asia and Islamic art. 'It's not just about masterworks but about everyday objects of the Mughal elite: jewelry, textiles and things that were really not fashionable in the 1930s as a collector's item.' Estate: The bedroom and bathroom - called the Mughal Suite after the period when Islamic emperors ruled what is today India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh - was closed while the roof was repaired . Grand plans: Duke initially envisioned it as a section of her mother-in-law's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but decided to build her own place in Hawaii after stopping on the island on the way home . Generous: Duke died at the age of 80 in Los Angeles in 1993. She established the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art in her will and stipulated that her home be open to the public and scholars. Ray noted Duke later began buying masterpieces - such as a 13th century Persian tile piece called a mihrab - as she began to see her home as a center for the study of Islamic art. Duke commissioned the Mughal Suite while in India during her 10-month honeymoon. She initially envisioned it as a section of her mother-in-law's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but decided to build her own place in Hawaii after stopping on the island on the way home. Pope said she wanted the room to capture the moment when Duke, as a 22-year-old, has a profound experience in India while traveling outside the U.S. and Europe for the first time. The Shangri La team of curators and conservationists consulted 1930s photographs to restore the rooms to what they looked like when the home was first built. 'I thought there was something valid in showing what makes this young woman fall in love with the Islamic world at such an early age and undertake a project of this scale,' Pope said. Duke died at the age of 80 in Los Angeles. She established the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art in her will and stipulated that her home be open to the public and scholars.","The private quarters of Duke's 'Shangri La' Honolulu, Hawaiian state will open to the public for the first time this weekend ."
"A father accused of torturing and killing his two young children, and burying their bodies in Alabama and Mississippi, has been found guilty of capital murder. John DeBlase was convicted Wednesday after a 10-day trial. DeBlase and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, have each blamed each other for the killings of DeBlase's 4-year-old daughter Natalie and his 3-year-old son Chase, who were poisoned with antifreeze and strangled to death four years ago. Miss Keaton will be tried separately for the killings in March. Scroll down for video . Guilty: John DeBlase (pictured in court on October 22) has been convicted of capital murder for killing his two children in 2010 . Tragic: Natalie (left) and Chase (right) were killed in Mobile County in 2010. Chase's remains were discovered in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi in December 2010. His sister's were found just days later . John DeBlase's attorneys argued that Keaton's harsh discipline tactics lead to the children's deaths, but prosecutors said DeBlase likely killed the children to end their suffering. 'I don't think there's any doubt that the person who had the motive and hatred was Heather Keaton,' defense attorney Glenn Davidson said during his closing arguments Tuesday. 'She had no regard for the children and evidence showed she had no concern for their safety or their well-being. She was consumed with jealousy of Natalie's relationship with her father. When she couldn't control the children, she killed them.' Local media outlets reported that 31-year-old DeBlase showed little emotion other than shake his bowed head as the jury's unanimous verdict was read aloud in court. The father faces either life in prison or the death penalty, and is likely to be sentenced Thursday or Friday after testimony from character witnesses. DeBlase's parents, Richard and Ann DeBlase, were in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. Mrs DeBlase told Fox 10 TV she is confused and feels like she lost her best friend. Wearing a pink dress with an angel brooch pinned to the front in honor of her slain grandchildren, she revealed that she was hoping for a 'not guilty' verdict. The biological mother of the victims wept in court last week as she told of how she had trusted her ex-husband to care for them. Wiping away tears, Corrine DeBlase said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and three-year-old son Chase to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father'. 'He was their father, he was supposed to protect them. That's what a father is supposed to do,' she told the jury. She added: 'Nobody can blame me more than I can blame myself. I know there are things I could have done then. I was their mother I should have done something.'Scroll down for video . Breaking down: Wiping away tears, Corrine DeBlase (pictured) said she had given up custody of her daughter Natalie, four, and son Chase, three, to John DeBlase in 2008 because she thought he was a 'good father' Natalie and Chase were killed in Mobile County, Alabama, in 2010. Chase's remains were found in a wooden area in Vancleave, Mississippi, in December 2010, six months after he was killed. His sister's remains were discovered in Cintronelle days later. DeBlase, then 27, and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, then 22, have been charged with murder. They have blamed each other. Taking to the witness stand today, Mrs DeBlase said she had been forced to give up custody of her 'well-mannered' children after she lost her job and home, and her marriage collapsed. She said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror, according to AL.com. On trial: DeBlase (pictured in court on October 22) and his common-law wife, Heather Keaton, have been charged with murder in the killings, which allegedly occurred in Peach Place. They blame each other . Both accused: Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase (left), claimed the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton (right) She said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing, Fox 10 reported. 'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase told the court. Yesterday, Brandon Newburn a former cellmate of DeBlase, claimed  the suspect wrote a series of letters saying he choked the youngsters to 'end their suffering' at the hands of Keaton. In the 10 letters, DeBlase reportedly said Keaton rained 'tortures and abuse' on his children at their home in Mobile County, Alabama, before finally giving him an ultimatum that it was 'her or the kids'. Innocent: Today, Mrs DeBlase said that her ex-husband mainly treated Natalie (pictured at a younger age) like 'his little princess', but had once 'popped her in her mouth' when she was suffering from a night terror . Siblings: Natalie (right) was reportedly killed on March 4, 2010. Her brother (left) died on June 20, 2010 . The father also allegedly revealed that Keaton was spiking his children's sippy cups with antifreeze because she wanted to 'break their spirits so they would be more obedient to her will'. In the hours before their deaths, the stepmother duct-taped and gagged the helpless youngsters, according to the letters, the TV station reported. DeBlase then allegedly wrote he 'picked them up in the air and choked them to death... where their bodies hung lifeless,' adding: 'I know what I did was wrong, but she left me no choice.' Welling up: The grieving mother (pictured speaking to reporters outside the courtroom) said the last time she had seen her children was November 17, 2009. A year later, she was told the youngsters were missing . Lost without her children: 'They were my heart. It may not seem the way they make it look but I loved them so much. I loved them so much and I can’t have no more (kids),' Mrs DeBlase (pictured) told the court . The defense contends Newburn coerced DeBlase and cannot be trusted.

"The Apple Watch divided fashion opinions when it was unveiled just a month ago. GQ had its reservations about the fashion tech accessory, and even Alexandra Shulman was on the fence. But for Vogue.com and Marie Claire, it was love at first sight. Now Vogue China is the first fashion title to feature the gadget on its cover for November 2014. Scroll down for video . Vogue China is the first fashion title in the world to style the Apple Watch on its cover, it was revealed today . The issue features supermodel Liu Wen wearing the device in an iconic moment when fashion meets technology. Vogue stands unrivalled as the world's leading style bible, so this placement certainly solidifies the Apple Watch's fashion credentials. And certainly comes as no surprise that the wearable tech features on the version in China - where science and technology have developed rapidly in recent years. Angelica Cheung, Editorial Director of Vogue China commented: 'As the very first fashion publication to feature the recently launched Apple Watch on its cover, Vogue China is following in the Vogue tradition of moving with the times, giving our readers the first glimpse of a pioneering piece of technology that also doubles as a highly covetable fashion accessory. 'In its slick marriage of technology, fashion and lifestyle, the Apple Watch will have a significant impact on the way we live. 'The look that David Sims and Karl Templer put together is fresh, modern and with good energy, fitting with the spirit of Vogue China which has been showcasing the best fashion around the world for the past 10 years.' On the cover Chinese supermodel Liu Wen models the 38mm Apple Watch Edition in 18-carat yellow gold, with a bright red modern buckle, styled by Karl Templer in a striped ensemble by Céline, and photographed by long time Vogue collaborator David Sims. When Apple unveiled its first wearable accessory to a high-profile crowd last month, it certainly proved to be the tech event with the biggest fashion buzz this year. The item marks a brand new territory for the tech giant, who, for the first time ever, are targeting the style-conscious rather than tech-obsessed. But the Apple Watch is less of a risk and more an organic step into the next phase of Apple's development. They recently hired ex Burberry boss Angela Ahrendts, YSL's CEO Paul Deneve and - crucially - Patrick Pruniaux, ex Tag Heuer. The gadget, which must be paired with an iPhone, debuts next year and prices start from £216 in the UK. It comes in three versions - sport, standard, and a luxury edition, with finishes including stainless steel and gold plated. The display is highly customisable and wrist bands range from leather and stainless steel to sports models in hues from pink to blue. GQ's Daniel Dumas wrote at the time: 'The Apple Watch certainly has a lot going for it from a technological standpoint, but we'll never vouch for wearing a digital watch with a tux. If you have a special occasion coming up, opt for something classic... Remember; the Apple Watch is built to check emails. You don't want your wrist lighting up with a message from the CEO when you're toasting the groom.' The Apple Watch was unveiled just a month ago to mainly positive reactions . Meanwhile style bible Vogue.com was more open and complimentary in regards to its look. 'From a fashion point of view, the external aesthetic seemed neutral: neither super-stylish nor repellent. I would imagine that geeks would love it more than aesthetes,' writes Suzy Menkes. 'I suspect that I, as a non-digital specialist, would fail to use this device to its full capacity. But I like the idea of setting the visual aspects according to my mood. And perhaps my wardrobe. 'A bunch of violets to set off my purple outfits? Why not look at my watch - and dream.' Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was a little less convinced: 'It is immaculate in terms of how function meets design,' she said. 'The issue is really about how much people want to wear something so clearly, essentially an amazing gadget.' Fashion editors were curious about an expected wearable accessory from fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff; a high-fashion smart bracelet from Intel; and a smart ring from Ringly. 'This is just the beginning. How long before there is a partnership with Marc Jacobs and Valentino to do more sophisticated faces?' said Lea Goldman, features and special projects reporter for Marie Claire.

She travelled without a shark net but had spotters and shark repellent 'bombs' on hands, which release the odour of rotting shark into the water. McCardel, who has previously set records for swimming 60 laps across Bondi Beach and completing two non-stop double crossings of the English Channel, says she feels a special connection during a long swim.

"The mother of pop star Kesha allegedly fired off an email threatening to go public with allegations her daughter was raped by producer Dr. Luke if he didn't revoke her contract. The pair are currently embroiled in a nasty legal battle after Kesha claimed in a lawsuit that she was 'sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally abused' by the 41-year-old producer over a period of 10 years. Now it has been claimed that the singer's mum, songwriter Pebe Sebert, contacted Dr. Luke's lawyer last year, demanding that the 27-year-old was released from her contract or she would publicly speak about allegations he assaulted her. Amid these allegations sources connected to Kesha's lawsuit, according to TMZ, claim that the troubled star told doctors while she was in rehab earlier this year that she had been abused and assaulted by Dr. Luke, which will likely become evidence in the suit. New twist: It has been claimed that Kesha's songwriter mother Pebe Sebert sent an email to Dr. Luke's lawyer last year insisting she would go public with claims he raped her famous daughter if he didn't release her from her contract and hand back publishing rights . Meanwhile, in an email obtained by TMZ, Kesha's mother allegedly writes: 'We, me and Kesha and her friends... like Lady Gaga, are going to make all of this Really PUBLIC, in the next few days. Luke date raped Kesha when she was 18... 'Luke gave Kesha pills. She ended up naked in his hotel room 2 days later. No longer a virgin? 'Do we all want this to come out? Either Luke releases Kesha from all legal contracts, and gives me back all my publishing, or we, Kesha and I, tell the truth.' Dr. Luke - whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald - is responsible for all of Kesha's music and gave the singer her first record deal in 2005 when she was just 18-years-old. Abuse: Kesha - seen here this month in Venice - claims Dr. Luke called her 'fat' in a new lawsuit against the music producer, also claiming she suffered years of abuse, including one sexual incident . After Kesha's legal team filed their suit, Dr. Luke filed his own documents against the singer claiming she is 'lying to get out of her legally binding contract'. His lawsuit claims the star's suit has been 'engineered' by her mother and Kesha's new management company. He also appeared to detail the email, accusing her team of trying to extort him by threatening to 'spread lies about him' unless he released her from her contract. Kesha claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with the hitmaker, who is known for producing some of the biggest hits in pop music for the likes of Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Close: Kesha - real name Kesha Rose Serbert - claims that the alleged abuse started early on when she signed her deal with Dr Luke in 2005 . Dr. Luke allegedly made 'repeated sexual advances' towards her and 'would use drugs and alcohol to remove her defences'. UsWeekly report that Kesha claims Dr. Luke allegedly gave her 'sober pills' and the following day she woke up naked in his bed 'sore and sick with no memory of how she got there'. Kesha claims that Dr. Luke reportedly 'threatened that if she ever mentioned the rape to anyone, he would shut her career down, take away all her publishing and recording rights, and otherwise destroy not only her life but her entire family’s lives as well'. The lawsuit also alleges that he also 'threatened her and her family’s physical safety'. MailOnline has reached out to representative for both Kesha and Dr. Luke who have so far been unavailable for comment. Claims: In a lawsuit obtained by TMZ, Kesha claims she was 'verbally, emotionally, sexually, and physically abused' by music producer Dr. Luke . Kesha and Dr. Luke are seen (far right) alongside Adam Lambert and producer Max Martin at the 28th Annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards at the Grand Ballroom at Hollywood & Highland Center in 2011 . The news comes after Kesha was sent to rehab earlier this year for a reported eating disorder, which the lawsuit claims was caused by the abuse. Since U Been Gone - Kelly Clarkson . Wrecking Ball - Miley Cyrus . Tik Tok - Kesha . I Kissed A Girl - Katy Perry . Roar - Katy Perry . California Gurls - Katy Perry . Who Knew - Pink . Hold It Against Me - Britney Spears . Domino - Jessie J . Where Have You Been - Rihanna . About You Now - Sugababes . In April this year, TMZ reported that Dr. Luke was behind Kesha's eating disorder, after he had called her 'fat'. A source told the publication that he had told her she 'looks like a f***ing refrigerator' and Kesha was understandably affected by it. Kesha has hinted at a fall out with the producer before when she told her Twitter followers that she never wanted to record or release their hit song Die Young, which was pulled from radio stations after the devastating Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. In September last year, one of Kesha's fans set up a petition 'Free Kesha' to help release the singer from Dr. Luke's management. It followed reports that Kesha had hardly any creative control of her second album Warrior. Meanwhile, Kesha's lawyer, Mark Geragos, told TMZ in a statement: 'This lawsuit is a wholehearted effort by Kesha to regain control of her music career and her personal freedom after suffering for ten years as a victim of mental manipulation, emotional abuse and an instance of sexual assault at the hands of Dr. Luke.' Geragos added: 'The facts presented in our lawsuit paint a picture of a man who is controlling and willing to commit horrible acts of abuse in an attempt to intimidate an impressionable, talented, young female artist into submission for his personal gain. Kesha is focused on moving her life and her career beyond this terrible time.' Long-term mentor: Dr. Luke (far left), Kesha (center) and her mother Pebe (second right) in 2010, after her hit first single TiK ToK had been released . Dr. Luke has produced all of Kesha's big hits including, TiK ToK, We R Who We R and Your Love Is My Drug. He has also produced hundreds of hits for other artists, including Roar, California Gurls and Teenage Dream by Katy Perry, as well as Till The World Ends and Hold It Against Me by Britney Spears. He's also worked with Taio Cruz, B.o.B, Jessie J, Flo Rida, Miley Cyrus,T.I., Nicki Minaj, Juicy J, Rihanna and Shakira. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards for his work on Katy Perry's Teenage Dream album.

"A California air tanker smashed into a canyon wall Tuesday afternoon while fighting a wildfire near Yosemite National Park, killing the pilot. Yosemite spokeswoman Ashley Mayer said the aircraft went down at 4.30pm near Arch Rock. Emergency personnel were making their way through difficult terrain to reach the plane's wreckage. ‘We determined there was a crash, but they're still trying to work their way through pretty rugged terrain to determine the status of the pilot,’ said Janet Upton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. ‘Obviously we're hoping for the best, but the situation is very serious.’ Scroll down for video . Lost: An S-2T air tanker similar to the one pictured here, went down at around 4.30pm Tuesday . At around 11pm pacific time, officials announced the pilot has died. His name has not been released pending the notification of family members. San Francisco Chronicle reported the victim was based out of the Hollister Air Attack Base and was flying Tanker 81. California Highway Patrol Sgt. Chris Michael said he was stopping traffic along state Route 140 at the west entrance to the park about 4.24pm when he witnessed the crash. ‘I heard a large explosion, I looked up on the steep canyon wall and saw aircraft debris was actually raining down the side of the mountain after the impact,’ he told The Associated Press by telephone. ‘It hit the steep side of the canyon wall. It appeared from the direction he was going, he was trying to make a drop down the side of the canyon when he hit the canyon wall.’ The fire was spreading up the canyon wall, and it appeared the pilot was trying to lay down fire retardant to stop its progress, Michael said. ‘It most definitely did disintegrate on impact,’ he said. ‘It was nothing. I didn't see anything but small pieces.’ Pieces of the aircraft landed on the highway and came close to hitting fire crews on the ground nearby, but no one on the ground was injured, he said. ‘It came pretty close to hitting them, but they were far enough away that it missed them, fortunately,’ he said. Smoking wreckage: In this photo provided by Donald Talend, smoke rises from a plane crash near Chinquapin, California . The airplane, manufactured in 2001, is an S-2T air tanker, which is flown by a single pilot and normally has no other crew members. The tanker uses twin turbine engines and is capable of carrying 1,200 gallons of fire retardant, said another CalFire spokesman, Daniel Berlant. Don Talend, of West Dundee, Illinois, said he also may have seen the plane go down. Talend and friends were vacationing at the park when they stopped to snap some photographs of the fire, which was several miles away. The plane ‘disappeared into the smoke and you heard a boom,’ he said. ‘I couldn't believe what I saw. There was actually a ranger there behind us. ... He had a look of disbelief on his face.’ The missing pilot is an employee of DynCorp., a contractor that provides the pilots for all CalFire planes and maintenance for the department's aircraft, Upton said. The fire had broken out about 90 minutes earlier Tuesday near Route 140, which leads into the heart of the park. It had grown to about 130 acres by Tuesday evening and forced the evacuation of several dozen homes near the community of Foresta. Blaze: A wildfire broke near state Highway 140, which leads into the heart of Yosemite National Park. Smoke from the Dog Rock Fire can be seen in this webcam image . The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration were investigating the crash and were expected to arrive at the crash site Wednesday morning, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. FAA records show the plane is registered to the U.S. Forest Service, which originally provided the plane to CalFire, Upton said. The last time a CalFire air tanker crashed was in 2001, when two tankers collided while fighting a fire in Mendocino County, killing both pilots, Berlant said. The agency had another plane crash in 2006, when a fire battalion chief and a pilot were killed while observing a fire in a two-seat plane in Tulare County.","An S-2T air tanker went down at 4.30pm Tuesday near Arch Rock, California .

"He looked delighted when he was presented with a traditional black and white sombrero vueltiao hat during a visit to an organic fair on Wednesday. Now, Prince Charles has two after he was given another while inspecting the treasure at the Museo del Oro Zenu in Cartagena. The Prince, clearly delighted with his duplicate gift, swiftly donned the hat and encouraged the Duchess of Cornwall to do the same with hers - much to the delight of local well-wishers. Sombrero vueltiao hats are made from cane fibre and are a symbol of Colombia, as well as the northern Caribbean region in which the city of Cartagena is located. Scroll down for video .

Popular: Charles got his first hat while visiting an organic food fair at the British Ambassador's residence in Bogota on Tuesday . Originally worn by peasants, the hats have become an enormously popular fashion accessory and are loved by everyone from cowboys to presidents, and now, princes. Charles and Camilla are on the last leg of an eventful four-day visit to the South American country, which has seen the Prince speak of his anguish following the death of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, as well as a passionate intervention from the Duchess on the subject of sexual violence. This morning, however, most of the drama came from a flamboyantly-dressed dancer who met the couple outside the museum, although the impressive impressive collection of fabulous gold treasures dating from the mediaeval period came a close second. A huge crowd of people, many of whom carried Union flags, had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive, with Prince Charles taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout. He also tried his hand at playing the drum and appeared to be enjoying himself, even if those listening were less than enamoured with his musical talents. Following the visit to the museum, the couple continued on to the Naval Academy, where they got an insight into the country's infamous drug problem courtesy of a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school. Not sure: At first, Camilla looked a little wary about trying on her black and white sombrero vueltiao hat . This is how you do it: An obliging local man then showed her how to put on and wear the hat . What do you think: The pair then looked to the Prince of Wales to see what he thought of the Duchess' new look . Success! Clearly delighted with Charles' verdict, Camilla beamed for the cameras as María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos looked on . Afterwards, Charles and Camilla will continue on to a war memorial dedicated to the British soldiers who died during an attempt to take the city's Fort of San Felipe in 1741 before attending the Health of the Oceans conference where the Prince will make a speech. The event, which will also see a speech from Colombia's President Santos, has been organised by the Presidential Co-operation Agency and the Prince's International Sustainability Unit, and will promote sustainability in the development of marine economies. Finally, the couple will wave goodbye to Colombia during a sunset ceremony on board HMS Argyll, a Type 23 'Duke' class frigate, which is currently moored in Cartagena. The tour of Colombia began on Tuesday with a rainy welcome on the tarmac at Bogota airport ahead of a formal welcome - which included taking a salute from a guard of honour - the following day. After an encounter with ballet dancer Fernando Montaño during the state dinner that evening, the royal couple then went on to spend yesterday focusing on the real theme of the tour - promoting peace and combating sexual violence. New talent: The couple were also presented with a traditional drum, which Prince Charles couldn't resist trying out . Not so good: The Prince of Wales burst into laughter following his attempt to play the drum - along with Camilla and Cartagena locals . All smiles: The couple appeared to enjoy their visit to the museum, during which they were shown its collection of gold treasure . Charles also spoke movingly about the loss of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten, when he visited Bogota's Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation which commemorates those killed and displaced during five decades of violence in the fight against guerillas and drug cartels. In a speech about how he had 'experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence' and stress, he added: 'Many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family ... were murdered in Northern Ireland, just over 30 years ago. 'So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.' Charles was extremely close to his uncle, who died in a terrorist bombing in August 1979. Indeed he viewed the Queen’s second cousin and former Viceroy of India as a second father and mentor. Mountbatten, 79, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, who planted a bomb in his boat in Co Sligo, in the Irish Republic, during a family fishing trip. One of his twin grandsons, Nicholas Knatchbull, 14, lost his life, along with a local boat boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell. Another passenger on the boat, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, 82, died in hospital the day after the attack. Big arrival: The couple arrived in Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coastline, after spending three days in Bogota . Colourful: The couple were met by a flamboyantly dressed traditional dancer outside the Museo del Oro Zenu . Wonderful: Charles and Camilla looked on in delight as the dancer twirled her multicoloured skirts during the dance . Magical: This is the second time the couple have encountered Colombia's flamboyant Caribbean dancers, the first time earlier this week . The only person convicted for the murders, Thomas McMahon, an experienced IRA bomb-maker, was released from jail under the Good Friday peace agreement after serving 18 years in jail. A second man was acquitted. Colombia itself is only just emerging from the longest running civil war in the world which began in 1956 and has so far claimed an estimated 250,000 lives, while displacing more than five million people. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are also widespread, with one woman raped every 15 minutes according to government estimates. The Duchess, who met with a group of brave rape victims, told MailOnline of her admiration for their courage and vowed to speak out and bring the issue of sexual violence 'into the light'. 'I was humbled by the courage of the Colombian women I met today,' she added, 'who had been raped like so many others, in horrendous circumstances, and I salute their determination to bring rape and sexual abuse out of the shadows into the light.' Later, the royal couple went their separate ways with Camilla staying in Bogota and Prince Charles travelling to La Macarena to see Cano Cristales - a river that has been dubbed the liquid rainbow thanks to its propensity for changing colour. Good work: After the dance, the couple congratulated the dancer before meeting a group of excited locals . Nice to meet you: Even more excited was the crowd of locals who had waited outside the museum to see the royal couple . Entertaining: Prince Charles, who was on jolly form, shared a joke with one delighted-looking lady . All together now: The royal couple and Colombia's First Lady also stopped for a glamorous group photo with a group of dancers . The  impressive sight is the result of algae on the riverbed changing its colour at different times of the year, from green and yellow to blue and black and, famously, red. Cano Cristales, south of the capital Bogota and once part of a FARC rebel controlled area, is close to the town of La Macarena and its residents and other groups are attempting to develop a sustainable tourism programme so local people benefit from foreign visitors and the environment is protected. Julia Miranda, director of Colombia's national park service, hosted Charles' visit to the natural wonder and said, after the royal had left, that the visit had been 'marvellous', adding: 'The red colour of the waters was very intense. 'He was really happy to be here and he asked many questions and seemed really interested in the geography of the area.' Charles was also joined during his visit by Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos who has been instrumental in helping to preserve Colombia's Amazon region. He joked to Charles' entourage that the picturesque spot was known as the FARC country club where a guerrilla general would bring his partner and they would swim in the waters. Before leaving the region Charles visited the quiet settlement and toured a local church built by guerrilla fighters which has a mural painted above the altar showing Jesus with his 12 disciples, who are depicted as Colombian peasants. During the visit, the Prince chatted to members of the local community and looked utterly delighted when one excited little schoolgirl planted a kiss on his cheek. Touching: In La Macarena yesterday, Prince Charles found himself on the receiving end of a kiss from one excited little schoolgirl . Striking: Charles also visited Cano Cristales, a river dubbed 'the liquid rainbow' thanks to its propensity to change colour . Emotional: Charles spoke of his anguish at the loss of his uncle Lord Mountbatten during a speech in Bogota yesterday . Beautiful: Camilla, who was dressed in a pistachio ensemble, spent yesterday afternoon at the Quinta Bolivar museum in Bogota . Important work: The Duchess, who met rape survivors yesterday morning, told MailOnline that she was left 'humbled' by the experience .","The royal couple are in Cartagena where they were met by a colourful dancer outside the Museo del Oro Zenu .

"A family of six were kicked out of a Butlin's swimming pool because the mother had 'too many children' with her. Kelly Noble, 34, took her five children with her to the family-friendly resort in Skegness, Lincolnshire, as a treat for her 14-year-old autistic son, Lewis, earlier this month. But just minutes after the children started playing in the pool on the second day of their holiday, a lifeguard ordered them to leave over health and safety fears. Scroll down for video . Kelly Noble, her son Lewis, 14 and her other children (l-r) Jonny Tougher 9, Jake Tougher 7, Kadee Mattley 5, Lishay Mattley, 10, were kicked out of a Butlin's swimming pool because she had 'too many children' Ms Noble was told that there were not enough adults to care for the children - Lewis, Jonny, nine, Jake, seven, daughter Lishay, 10, and stepdaughter Kadee, five, safely because she was on her own. Despite Ms Noble being within Butlin's rules by supervising a maximum of two children under the age of eight, a lifeguard insisted the five children had to get out of the water because of fears that she would not be able to care for her autistic son, as well as two under-eights. A furious Ms Noble said: 'We'd all been in the swimming pool on the first day, and the children had been saying how brilliant it was. 'They really wanted to go again the next day, so we went as soon as it opened at 10am. 'But after about 10 minutes, the lifeguard came up to me and asked if they were all my children. 'He said he was going to have to ask us to leave as their policy is to only have two children to one adult. 'I was really upset and so were the children - I practically had to pull them out of there kicking and screaming.' Ms Noble, from Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, arranged the trip through the charity Family Fund, which supports disabled children. The family were kicked out of the pool at Butlin's in Skegness on the second day of their holiday . And the family were dealt another blow when resort bosses told them they could not go on any fairground rides without extra supervision. Ms Noble was offered the 'Red Riders' service, where Butlins workers accompany the children on rides - but this is only offered for two hours a day. The devastated mother says she was then forced to pay £250 to keep the children entertained with other activities instead. She said: 'It just seemed like the last straw and I ended up crying on the phone to my mum. 'I spent £250 on keeping the children entertained in arcades - my mum had to transfer money over. 'The kids were irritable and didn't have a good time. It ruined our holiday. 'I understand the health and safety thing, but why did they let me book a holiday in the first place without any other adults? I wish I'd known sooner.' A spokesman for Butlins said: 'When guests book with us, our phone advisors make them aware of our policies regarding child supervision in our pools and fairgrounds. 'The same information is on our website. 'Our policy in our pools, which would mirror those of other public pools, is that every two children aged eight years old and under must be accompanied by at least one adult. 'The team felt that the older child with autism could not be provided with a realistic level of supervision. 'The safety of all our guests is our priority.'","Kelly Noble took her five children to Butlin's for treat for autistic son, Lewis .

"Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have  made a formal complaint to the police after online rape threats were made against their daughter, Chloe. The television presenters said they had handed over 'a substantial amount of evidence' to the police. a week after their 27-year-old daughter was targeted by online trolls over the Ched Evans rape case. And they said detectives had 'launched an immediate investigation' as a result. Chloe was threatened with rape on Twitter after she defended comments made by Finnigan during a debate around the future of of the footballer rapist, in which her mother said his crime was 'non violent' and did not cause 'bodily harm'. Madeley, left, and Finnigan have complained to police about online rape threats to their daughter, Chloe, right . Madeley and Finnigan released a statement today, above, saying Scotland Yard had launched an investigation . Twitter trolls turned on Chloe after her mother appeared to defend rapist Ched Evans, right, on Loose Women . Today Chloe's parents put a statement on their website saying: 'Following legal advice, our family has now made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police about cyber-stalking, harassment and, most recently, rape threats made against Chloe on Twitter. 'We have presented the police with a substantial amount of evidence, and they have launched an immediate investigation. 'We will be making no further comment at this time.' The furore began when Finnigan, 66, appeared on ITV's Loose Women shortly before Evans was released from jail a week ago after serving two and a half years for raping a 19-year-old woman. Finnigan argued that the 26-year-old should be allowed to resume his playing career on his release from jail because, while the attack was 'unpleasant', his victim was drunk. She also said: 'The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn’t cause any bodily harm to the person.' Under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500. Since the 1988 law came into force before the widespread use of the internet, e-mail and social networking, prosecutors have used a number of different laws to charge Twitter trolls. Student Liam Stacey, who sent a series of racially abusive tweets after footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed, was charged under the Crime and Disorder Act. Two men jailed for inciting riots last summer were found guilty under the Serious Crime Act, and Paul Chambers, who joked he would blow Doncaster airport 'sky high' was charged under the Communications Act 2003. Earlier this month, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling revealed to The Mail on Sunday that the maximum six month sentence for internet abuse will be quadrupled . The tougher new legislation is already being dubbed ‘Chloe’s Law’ after Miss Madeley's public stance against the disturbing messages. Her comments provoked a storm on social media sites, with campaigners accusing her of perpetuating harmful myths about rape. Finnigan apologised several times for causing offence, insisting that rape was 'an appalling crime', and saying she was merely discussing 'the legal facts of the case'. But the trolls merely turned on her daughter, with one saying: 'Judy's given me her blessing to rape you.' Another tweet, directed at her mother, said: 'Hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot.' In a message put up via Twitter, Chloe said: 'My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society. 'The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. 'While it may anger some that the term ""non-violent rape"" exists, unfortunately it does. 'Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable. 'To believe that my mother is pro ""non-violent rape"" is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. 'To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.' At the time, Madeley used Twitter to warn the trolls he would go to police, saying: ''I have noted every sick troll threat. 'Do they really think it's ok to wish/threaten rape on a woman?  They're in deep trouble, trust me.' He added: 'Trolls who sent sick rape threats?  Prosecution awaits you.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'An allegation of harassment was made to Barnet police relating to messages received via a social media site. Targeted: Stella Creasy MP, left, and historian Mary Beard, right, have both been victims of online trolling . 'A criminal investigation has commenced.  There are no arrests at this stage but enquiries continue.' Last month Peter Nunn, a 33-year-old delivery driver from Bristol, was jailed for 18 weeks for using Twitter to threaten to rape Labour MP Stella Creasy in response to her backing of a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Historian Mary Beard was trolled after she appeared on television, with one troll, Cambridge student Oliver Rawlings, 20, calling her a 'filthy old slut'. She later accepted his invitation to lunch to apologise, and said afterwards: 'He is going to find it hard to get a job, because as soon as you Google his name, that is what comes up.' Rape in Britain is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force a decade ago, replacing and refining previous legislation. One of the key changes under the new Act was to define consent.  A person consents if they agree to have sex by choice, and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice. Therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink, the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice, ie did not consent. The law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent.

"A high security cell has been prepared for Oscar Pistorius alongside a notorious Czech prisoner on trial for torture, according to reports. The 27-year-old convicted killer will learn his fate tomorrow when he is sentenced for the Valentine’s Day shooting of his girlfriend. At last week’s sentencing hearing, Pistorius’ legal team called for the paralympian to be spared jail and placed under house arrest citing fears for his safety from violence and disease. Scroll down for video . Cell mates? A high security cell has been prepared for Oscar Pistorius alongside a notorious Czech suspected gangster Radovan Krejcir, right, who is standing trial on charges of alleged kidnapping and torture . High security: Krejcir is currently on trial at the High Court in Johannesburg for alleged kidnapping and torture, but is being held in a special wing at Pretoria Central Prison as he is considered a high security risk prisoner . Defence counsel Barry Roux quoted from a newspaper interview with a gang leader who had threatened to order a hit on Pistorius if he is given special treatment in prison. With prison authorities under acute pressure to guarantee the fallen track star’s safety, a meeting of senior correctional services officials met on Friday to draw up plans to keep him safe. According to South African news agency EWN, a cell has been set aside for Pistorius in a wing of just six cells at Pretoria Central prison, which is guarded by a special task force and where Radovan Krejcir is being held. Security at the wing is second only to the notorious ‘C Max’ wing - where the most dangerous inmates are held. Krejcir is currently on trial at the High Court in Johannesburg for alleged kidnapping and torture, but is being held in Pretoria as he is considered a high security risk prisoner. Pretoria Central Prison was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by South Africa's white-only apartheid government, which ended with the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994. It is now the home of apartheid death squad leader Eugene de Kock, known as 'Prime Evil', and is known for a vicious gang culture. The correctional services department on Monday denied that it was making arrangements in advance of Pistorius’ sentencing tomorrow. Lock up: Pretoria Central Prison was the execution site of dozens of black political activists by South Africa's white-only apartheid government. Now it is home to the apartheid death squad leader Eugene de Kock . Killer: Pistorius, right, pictured in November 2012 with girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, who he shot dead in their home in Pretoria while she was locked in the toilet, saying that he mistook her for a possible intruder . Gerrie Nel, who prosecuted Pistorius for the murder of 29 year old Miss Steenkamp, told Judge Thokozile Masipa that the idea of the athlete serving his sentence at home under 'correctional supervision' with an order to carry out community service, was 'shocking inappropriate' for the severity of the crime he had committed. He said the double amputee’s disability should not be taken into consideration when he is sentenced and called for a minimum of ten years behind bars. The trial of Krejcir is one of the most high profile and high security South Africa has ever seen. The fugitive arrived in South Africa on a fake passport and since then a number of his business rivals and associates have died in mysterious circumstances, including German super car conversion specialist Uwe Gemballa and the owner of a string of strip clubs, ‘Lolly’ Jackson. The special arrangements come after Pistorius's legal team told the court their client faces threats from a ruthless prison gang leader is he is given preferential treatment in jail. Khalil Subjee - known as The General - said he would order 'a hit' on the double-amputee if his fame and wealth bought him an easy time behind bars. Defence lawyer Barry Roux quoted the claims from a newspaper article to argue that the athlete's life would be at risk if he was jailed for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius talks to his lawyer Barry Roux on day four of his sentencing hearing at the High Court in Pretoria . Emotional: The athlete's sister, Aimee, wipes tears from her eyes next to her aunt Lois while listening to testimony from Miss Steenkamp's cousin, Kim Martin, during the sentencing hearing . If he is jailed, it was thought the paralympian could have been sent to Kgosi Mumpuru prison in Pretoria, where feared gangs are notorious for turning new inmates into sex slaves in exchange for protection. Mr Roux said Subjee, the head of the feared 26s gang who claims to control all of South Africa's inland jail, made his threats in an interview from a prison phone box. Subjee said: 'If he thinks he is going to come here and buy his way to get computers and cellphones and a lavish lifestyle, he must know that will never happen for as long as I am around.' The criminal kingpin, who has been in and out of prison for the past 33 years, admitted he had organised similar retribution on other prisoners who had received special care, including the killer of Chris Hani - a hero of the anti-apartheid struggle. The revelations came after Miss Steenkamp's cousin made a dramatic appeal for Pistorius to be sent to prison, telling the court that he 'needs to pay for what he's done' to her family and his own. Prison life in South Africa is characterised by an elaborate system of gangs, through which much prisoner-on-prisoner violence is mediated, a report by a human rights group has found. While gang activity is common to many prison systems, South African prison gangs are distinctive. Most importantly, they have a national organisation. As such, a gang member who is transferred from one prison to another, or even released and re-imprisoned, will keep his membership and gang rank in the new prison. Stark conditions: Prisoners are lined up inside the Kgosi Mumpuru 11 Management Centre during a surprise raid by prison officials checking for drugs and other contraband. The jail is the most likely one that Oscar Pistorius will be sent to if he is given a prison term for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . The gangs have a history that predates the formation of the South African prisons department. They are not spontaneous creations in each prison, with an improvised system of membership and command. They instead have an elaborate structure, ranking and disciplinary code that mimics the militaristic structures of the South African apartheid system in general and the prison administration in particular. The three predominant gangs operating in South Africa's prisons today are the 28s, 27s and 26s, known collectively as the 'number gangs'. The 'number gangs' trace their origins, by an elaborate oral history, to the late 19th century, when gangs were formed in the all-male compounds occupied by migrant laborers working in the mines on the Witwatersrand, near Johannesburg. Grim: The athlete's lawyer has argued that there will be a risk from prison gangs if he is sent to jail . A report by Human Rights Watch found that promotion is gained by carrying out acts of violence on non gang members or rivals . The 28s are said to be the most feared, operating an organised system of 'wyfies' - or sexual partners. The 26s are known for skill at obtaining contraband items, while the 27s enforce the codes of the other two groups. Inmates who are not associated with a gang complain of having to 'buy' back their own bunk from gang members and have other possessions confiscated. And any attempts to disrupt the structure of gangs often leads to warfare within the gang and with rivals. Most worryingly, warders often turn a blind eye to gang activities and in some cases, actively collaborate with them.","Czech migrant Radovan Krejcir is on trial for alleged kidnapping and torture .

"The old maxim goes that if men rather than women had to have babies, the human race would have died out long ago. Now those birthing pains are being felt by men in China.

A hospital in the city of Jinan in eastern China's Shandong Province is hooking men up to a childrbirth simulator to see what their partner's go through. The electronic device which simulates the experience of having a baby. Technicians at the hospital use the device to stimulate muscles in the male abdomen with electric shocks to make it contract and at the same time simulate the pain endured by mothers during childbirth. Most of the volunteers are partners of pregnant women. The hospital said they want to show men how much women suffer through childbirth, and to give men greater respect for what women go through. 'The event was aimed at creating awareness and more respect for childbearing women, especially highlighting the entire laborious nine-month process leading up to birth,' a hospital spokesman told CEN. To recreate the contractions and pain of childbirth, hospital technicians used machines to stimulate the men's abdomens with electric shocks to make it contract. Some men seemed reluctant— having been dragged there by their partners— while others were more enthusiastic, CEN reported. 'My wife is expecting a baby in three months, and we had a row when I told [her] not to make such a fuss,' father-to-be Guang Liao, 29, told CEN. 'When she found out about this project, she told me had to sign up for it, so I also know what is was all about.' Many of the participants were reduced to tears by the experience, and could only last a few minutes . The hospital said they want to show men how much women suffer through childbirth, and to give men greater respect for what women go through. 'I must admit I was curious and if what I experienced is really what she goes through, then I have to say I have changed my attitude. 'It was really incredibly painful and I only had it for a few minutes. 'If it went on for hours I don't know if I'd be able to bear it,' he told the news agency. Technicians at the hospital use the device to stimulate muscles in the male abdomen with electric shocks to make it contract and at the same time simulate the pain endured by mothers during childbirth. It is not the first time the system has been used. On Mother's Day, male volunteers in Nanchang City, in south China's Jiangxi province, were hooked up to complex machines that provided them with a painful taste of what women go through in labour. Some 20 men went on a local TV show to submit to the pains that women endure. The challenge consisted of ten levels of pain with an agony scale from 50 to 500. Electric shocks were sent into the abdomen of the male volunteers - including British singer Iain Inglis, 31, who lives and works in China - who gave up when the pain-o-meter hit 100. 'It was too much for me,' he said. 'The pain was terrible!'

Another man, Lee Hao, said: 'This was incredible. I couldn't stand much of it all. I understand now why my wife screamed for drugs when she was giving birth.' Zhou Nan successfully stuck to the end and hit the 500 mark. 'I am the father of triplets and wanted to understand the great pain my wife experienced when she was giving birth,' he said.

"A High Court judge has criticised Justice Secretary Chris Grayling after prison inmates were unable to attend the 'healthy sex' courses that were key to their release. Mr Justice Dingemans, sitting in London, allowed legal challenges brought by three prisoners serving indeterminate sentences who face long delays before they can get on the programme. The judge said the Justice Secretary had breached his duty to provide such resources for jailed sex offenders, whose progress towards release from prison was 'effectively impossible' without attending the courses. Criticism: High Court Judge Mr Justice Dingemans (left) has criticised Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right) after prison inmates were unable to attend the 'healthy sex' courses that were key to their release . He said more than 140 other inmates were also immediately affected by the problem. The judge said the cases raised an important issue about the extent to which the Justice Secretary's public law duty could be modified by the level of resources he made available for offenders still serving indeterminate sentences for public protection (IPPs). He ruled: 'The secretary of state is not entitled to overlook the public law duty by pointing to inadequate resources.... 'If Parliament retains sentences of IPPs for these claimants, as it has done and is entitled to do so, the secretary of state has a duty to provide resources to discharge the public law duty.' The heavily criticised IPP system was abolished in 2012 but many inmates sentenced earlier are still caught up in the IPP regime. Under the IPP system courts imposed a minimum period which had to be served before offenders became eligible for consideration for release. 'Unlawful': In 2009 the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court declaration that the then Justice Secretary, Labour's Jack Straw, was acting unlawfully by failing to make provision in IPP cases . The judge said the Justice Secretary was under a duty to provide resources to allow IPP inmates to demonstrate to the Parole Board by the time their prison tariffs expired that it was no longer necessary to keep them locked up for public protection. He said the three applicants for judicial review, Philip Fletcher, Paul Young and Keith Bentley, had served their IPP tariffs. Fletcher was convicted in 2008 of threatening to kill a child and sentenced to an IPP with a minimum tariff of 20 months. Young was sentenced in 2009 to an IPP with a three-year tariff for a sexual offence and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Bentley, who was nearly 73 years old, had a history of sex offences and was sentenced in August 2007 to an IPP with a tariff of two-and-a-half years. The judge said all three category C prisoners had waited at least two years for the healthy sex programme course which was critical to their chances of release. However, the earliest any of them was predicted to access the course was a further six to 18 months from the date of today's judgment. The latest was up to three-and-a-half years - at least five years after a recommendation that the inmate go on the course. The judge said the Justice Secretary accepted he was under a public law duty to make provision for the three applicants, but contended it had been discharged 'having regard to the available resources'. In 2009 the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court declaration that the then Justice Secretary, Labour's Jack Straw, was acting unlawfully by failing to make provision in IPP cases. Other problems arose of delay and failing to ensure prisoners progressed through the IPP system, leading to the abolition of IPPs. But prisoners like the claimants not yet released were still subject to the IPP regime, and the Justice Secretary was continuing to act in breach of his public law duty.","Mr Justice Dingemans allowed legal challenges brought by three prisoners .

In the letter, addressed to 'Mr Stumpf', he suggested that the 60-year-old used some of the bank's record-high $20.9billion profits to give everyone a $10,000 raise. Scroll down for video . Taking action: Tyrel Oates (left), 30, sent an email to Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf (right) - and copied in a staggering 200,000 co-workers at the San Francisco-based bank - in a bid to help end income inequality . For the San Francisco-based firm's approximate 300,000 employees - including the ones cc'd in the email - this would total around $3billion, still leaving more than $17billion in corporate profits, he said. Mr Oates, a customer service worker at the bank's Portland, Oregon, branch, also highlighted the $19.3million that Mr Stumpf received in total compensation last year - a figure confirmed by Forbes. He told Mr Stumpf, whose net worth is an estimated $50million: 'Last year, you had pulled in over $19million, more than most of the employees will see in our lifetimes. 'It is understood that your position carries a lot of weight and responsibility; however, with a base salary of $2.8million and bonuses equating to $4million, [it] is alone one of the main arguments of income inequality . Profitable: In the letter, addressed to 'Mr Stumpf', Mr Oates suggested that the chief executive used some of the bank's record-high $20.9billion profits to give everyone a $10,000 raise. Above, Wells Fargo bank . Speaking out: Mr Oates, a customer service worker at the bank's Portland, Oregon, branch, also highlighted the $19.3million that Mr Stumpf received in total compensation last year - a figure confirmed by Forbes . 'My proposal is take $3billion dollars, just a small fraction of what Wells Fargo pulls in annually, and raise every employees annual salary by $10,000 dollars. 'Think, as well, of the positive publicity in a time of extreme consumer skepticism towards banks. 'By doing this, Wells Fargo will not only help to make its people, its family, more happy, productive, and financially stable, it will also show the rest of the United States, if not the world that, yes big corporations can have a heart other than philanthropic endeavors.' He added: 'To all of my fellow team members who receive a copy of this email. Though Wells Fargo does not allow the formation of unions, this does not mean we cannot stand united.' Encouraging others: He wrote: 'To all of my fellow team members who receive a copy of this email. Though Wells Fargo does not allow the formation of unions, this does not mean we cannot stand united' Mr Oates's letter, sporting the subject line 'income inequality', was later uploaded to social networking site Reddit, where many users congratulated the employee for speaking out. However, the worker did acknowledge that the company provided some 'pretty good benefits, as well as discretionary profit sharing for those who partake in our 401k program'. Despite the letter's publicity, Mr Oates, who processes requests from Wells Fargo customers seeking to prevent debt-collection calls, said he is still employed by the bank. Successful: Mr Stumpf, who became CEO of Wells Fargo in 2010, has an estimated net worth of $50million . He also told the Charlotte Observer that he has no concerns about being fired and has even received numerous thank-you emails from co-workers. 'I’m not worried about losing my job over this,' said Mr Oates, who has worked at the bank for nearly seven years and earns just over $15 an hour, according to AOL.com. A spokesman for Wells Fargo - the most profitable bank in 2013 according to MarketWatch - told the newspaper the firm provides 'market competitive' compensation combining base pay with benefits. Despite his tremendous success as a businessman, Mr Stumpf himself had humble beginnings, having grown up on a dairy farm in Minnesota.","Tyrel Oates, 30, emailed Wells Fargo's multi-millionaire CEO John Stumpf .

"Twelve months ago Hana Tarraf was a happy, healthy five-year-old who found it easy to run around and enjoyed playing with her friends. Today she has more than doubled her weight to 44 kilograms and is putting on an average of a kilogram per week due to hypothalamic obesity, caused by treatment she received for a life-threatening brain tumour. The little girl from Bondi, Sydney is wheelchair-bound most of the time as she struggles to 'stand in one spot for more than a minute', her mum Naomi Cook told Daily Mail Australia. Hana Tarraf, 6, has doubled her body weight since she underwent surgery for a brain tumor in January . It also means she is constantly hungry, due to the signals being transmitted from her brain to her stomach. 'She cries a lot, she gets cranky, she gets grumpy and she'll stare into space,' Ms Cook said. 'She'll be playing a game and she'll say ""Dad I don't want to think about food"",' her dad Nour Tarraf added. When they took their eldest daughter to hospital in January of this year with concerns about her thyroid, they were devastated when told she had actually developed a brain tumour. When the day of the appointment came Hana had been suffering from a 'massive headache' for two days and a scan was done as a precautionary measure. Hana (centre) here with her dad Nour Tarraf (left), mum Naomi Cook (top right) and younger sister Maryam, 4, (bottom right) is suffering with this extra weight gain . The six-year-old (second from left) is pictured here at Christmas time last year with her family . Before her surgery she weighed 21 kilos, but now weighs 44 kilos and is continuing to put on weight . The six-year-old, here with mum Ms Cook, is gaining on average a kilo each week . 'The CT scan found a tennis ball sized tumor', Mr Tarraf revealed. Hana had surgery the same month and her parents said the fallout from the operation could have been 'blindness, seizures and even death'. While their daughter was in intensive care recovering from the procedure to remove the tumour, 'Naomi started to look into what other complications there could be', Mr Tarraf said. 'She (Naomi) was in hospital asking the doctors about this increased chance of weight gain', he continued, before adding that through their research he and Ms Cook had discovered there was an 85 per cent chance of Hana developing weight problems. Now, nine months later, Hana, 6, is still gaining weight - almost a kilogram every week - with no sign of it slowing. Hana, pictured left on Sunday and right before her surgery, now spends much of her time in a wheelchair . Hana suffers from severe knee and ankle pain and struggles to walk for more than a few minutes . The youngster had a tumor the size of a tennis ball removed in January, after it was discovered by chance . She is constantly hungry as the messages from her brain to her stomach . 'It's ten months later and we have a child that is morbidly obese at six,' Ms Cook said. 'We do have to use the wheelchair to get around, she has severe knee and ankle pain. She can't stand on the spot for more than a minute.' This struggle can also be isolating for Hana at school, as she can't join her classmates sitting on the floor when they're reading, and instead must sit on a chair up the back. Breakfast: A bowl of cereal and a piece of toast with a spread on it . Morning Tea: A handful of nuts . Lunch: A sandwich and a salad . Afternoon Tea:  A piece of fruit or some nuts . Dinner: Vegetable soup with some rice, followed by a yoghurt . Hana's diet is very tightly controlled by her parents, and she is fed only small portions of very healthy food each day to slow her weight gain down. 'Hana's weight has nothing to do with diet, her body became hardwired ... her body is telling her she is starving', Ms Cook said. 'Hana is very disciplined, there's other conditions where children have no control and they simply eat what they see or go searching for food,' her father added. 'She doesn't eat unless we actually allow her to. She will sit there and cry but she won't actually go searching for food. 'Her stomach is full, but her brain is hungry. Her brain is saying eat eat eat,' he continued. Though the toughest part for Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf has been trying to get Hana specialised treatment in Australia. 'We have found it difficult to see someone - it's not considered an emergency so when you ring a specialist they just slot you in to their books', Mr Tarraf said. Hana's family are desperately trying to get expert medical help for their daughter . Her parents have been conducting their own research, and have contacted medical experts overseas. Hana is pictured here before her surgery . The couple have been conducting a lot of research during the 12 weeks they've been waiting for Hana to see someone, and have even reached out to researchers overseas. One German specialist responded to their five page long list of questions to him with an equally detailed answer, and Hana's parents believe they need to enlist the help of international medical experts if they want to combat their daughter's rare condition. 'Some children are very lucky and they do reach a stablisation after a few months, we haven't and see no signs of this happening yet for Hana,' Ms Cook said. 'In my mind and my husbands mind this is ultimately a life-threatening condition and we need help.' Hana, here with sister Maryam, needs someone who is willing to do some extra work to help their daughter . However Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf were adamant that the doctors that had been treating their daughter in Australia were at no fault, but their situation was particularly complex. 'We understand their position, we know that it's difficult and it might be outside is a lot of people's expertise,' Mr Tarraf said. 'What Hana needs is someone who is prepared to do some extra work and someone who's willing to get out of their comfort zone,' he added. Hana doesn't fit the mold for many people suffering from hypothalamic obesity,and a plan needs to be put in place according to her parents. Though Ms Cook said there was one thing she was thankful for out of this ordeal her daughter has gone through. 'She doesn't have yet - thank god - have any understanding that she is obese.' 'I hope that by the time she's old enough, or in the next few months, we will find a solution for her that will help that,' Ms Cook added. Ms Cook and Mr Tarraf were adamant that the doctors that had been treating their daughter in Australia were at no fault, but their situation was particularly complex .","Hana Tarraf, 6, underwent surgery to remove a brain tumour in January .

"Twitter trolls who made rape threats against Judy Finnigan’s daughter were yesterday warned they face police action. Her father Richard Madeley told those tormenting his family over the Ched Evans rape case: ‘Prosecution awaits you.’ His daughter Chloe, 27, said: ‘To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.’ Her mother had sparked the storm by saying footballer Evans had not physically harmed the teenager he raped in a hotel. Scroll down for video . Madeley warned trolls they faced prosecution for threatening Chloe, right, after Finnigan's rape comments . Judy Finnegan's husband Richard Madeley warned off trolls on Twitter, saying: 'Prosecution awaits you' The 58-year-old TV presenter said he had 'noted' every troll's threat to Chloe, adding: 'They're in deep trouble' Appearing on ITV’s Loose Women, she argued the 26-year-old should be allowed to resume his playing career on his release from jail tomorrow because, while the attack was ‘unpleasant’, his victim was very drunk. Campaigners said her comments perpetuated harmful myths about rape and the 66-year-old had to issue an unreserved apology. The furore saw vile Twitter abuse directed at Chloe, including the threat: ‘Judy’s given me her blessing to rape you.’ Another tweet, directed at her mother, said: ‘Hope you discover first hand what rape is like you idiot.’ Chloe said: ‘My mother was voicing an opinion on the matter of criminals being accepted back into society. ‘The comments she made on the case in question were facts, so not opinions. While it may anger some that the term “non-violent rape” exists, unfortunately it does. Referencing it and explaining why that was the charge does not mean that you think this category of rape is acceptable. ‘To believe that my mother is pro “non-violent rape” is ridiculous and I am shocked that many people have jumped to this conclusion. To the trolls wishing rape on me, stop, you are utterly pathetic.’ Evans, 25, who was jailed in 2012 and will be released next week, has 'served his time', Miss Finnigan said . Chloe posted a note on Twitter defending her mother, and revealed she had been threatened with rape . Mr Madeley, 58, yesterday suggested the family would report the trolls to police. ‘I have noted every sick troll threat,’ said the TV presenter. ‘Do they really think it’s OK to wish/threaten rape on a woman? They’re in deep trouble, trust me. ‘Thanks to everyone who tweeted support for Judy’s intelligent, clear analysis today. Trolls who sent sick rape threats? Prosecution awaits you.’ Scotland Yard has not yet opened an investigation but social media users have been prosecuted before for attacks on high-profile figures. Miss Finnigan yesterday said it was legally correct to describe Evans’s crime as ‘non-violent’. ‘But let me add that, to me, rape is rape,’ she added. ‘It is an appalling crime. I was simply reporting the legal facts of this case before commenting.’ Despite calls for her to be sacked from Loose Women, a spokesman for the programme said: ‘She will be on the panel next week, so that answers the question.’ Miss Finnigan, right, appeared on Loose Women with (L-R) Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Jane Moore . Trolling: Chloe (left with her mother Judy and right) has been called 'deformed' and 'half-man, half-horse' The Evans case has been fought over on Twitter ever since he was convicted in 2012 of raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room in North Wales. Supporters including his cousin breached the teenager’s right to anonymity by naming her on Twitter. Evans’s cousin and nine others admitted breaking the law and were ordered to pay her £6,000 in compensation. Loyal: Ched Evans' girlfriend of two years, Natasha Massey, 26, says she is standing by her man . Detectives in North Wales have spoken of the difficulty of tracing Twitter users who post under made-up names, and admitted that only a fraction of those who abused the girl had faced justice. She was forced to adopt a new identity and go into hiding. Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign making the case that he was wrongly convicted. Her father Karl has bankrolled the campaign, which has hired private investigator Russ Whitfield and specialist appeals barrister David Emanuel to persuade the Criminal Cases Review Commission to re-examine his conviction. But Evans was refused leave to appeal against his conviction and failed in a challenge to his five-year prison sentence. Last month Peter Nunn, a 33-year-old delivery driver from Bristol, was jailed for 18 weeks for using Twitter to threaten to rape Labour MP Stella Creasy in response to her backing of a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Rape in Britain is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force a decade ago, replacing and refining previous legislation. One of the key changes under the new Act was to define consent.  A person consents if they agree to have sex by choice, and if they have the freedom and capacity to make that choice. Therefore in a situation where a victim had sex when they were incapacitated by drink, the law would say that they did not have the freedom or capacity to make the choice, ie did not consent. The law does not require the victim to have physically resisted in order to prove a lack of consent.

"A superdad who worked 'round the clock' to support his 16 children has died of a heart attack at the age of 56.

His eldest daughter Machala Evans said: 'Dad was a simple man, who loved his work and his family. 'He really was a family man, who was very patient and relaxed with his children and grandchildren, but he did ask for respect and the children knew that.

"Kacey Hambleton, two, died after her mother's boyfriend, Connor Gibson, 23, battered and shook her to death in April this year . A violent killer shook his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter with such ferocity that her fatal injuries resembled those of a car crash victim, a court heard today. Connor Gibson, 23, was said to have had a violent 'flare up' during which he grabbed and battered Kacey Hambleton in an assault which left her crying in pain. The youngster was later found unresponsive when police were called to her family home in Blackpool at around 10am in April this year. Today at Preston Crown Court, Gibson, from Blackpool, admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the prosecution. Kacey's mother Louise, 23, was visibly upset in the public gallery as prosecutor Mr Francis McEntee said a 'considerable amount of force' was used in the lead up to her daughter's death. He said: 'The principal cause of death was catastrophic head injuries. The prosecution always said there is a matter of shaking that is now accepted by the defendant. 'In this case there are other injuries notably a significant injury to the abdomen. There was a violent assault in anger we know not what the trigger was, during which injuries were caused to the thigh, very significant bruising to the liver. 'Injuries the result of a forceful blow such as found in a car crash or fall from height, that may be consistent with a single blow.' Mr McEntee added that Gibson then 'shook her to quell her, resulting in the most immediate cause of her demise.' Kacey's father Russell Hambleton, 27, said: 'The whole family has been left absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Kacey's death. 'My little princess is gone and I feel like my heart has been ripped out. Kacey was a beautiful little girl with so much to live for; she has been taken from us far too soon.' Mr Gibson was said to have had a violent 'flare up' during which he grabbed and battered Louise Hambleton's daughter at her family home in Blackpool . The killer admitted manslaughter after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the prosecution . Kacey was taken to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and was later airlifted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool in a critical condition. She died 48 hours later. It is not known what the trigger was for his attack. Gibson had no history of violence towards children. Gibson was remanded in custody and the judge Mrs Justice Susan Carr told him: 'You have now pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter. I will be sentencing you for that offence on Friday.'

"These are the dizzying views captured by a pair of 'outlaw Instagrammers' from atop a New York City tower that will be the tallest residential building in the western hemisphere once it is complete. One half of the duo has been charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass for scaling the tower at 432 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan.

At one point, it appears the pair have ascended into the heavens as they are enveloped in fluffy white clouds. One of the teens, known as Night Shift on Instagram, told MailOnline Travel that the whole climb took about four hours to complete. The teen, who declined to identify himself, said: ‘I never felt unsafe. I felt like I’ve done enough climbing to be OK. 'I did the climb because I just wanted to do it and we chose this building because it was the highest building we could get into. ‘The view was unreal. The photos can't explain how crazy it was being up there. Once-in-a-lifetime experience.’ Once it is complete the residential building will be home to luxury flats worth up to £52m apiece.

But the fury little creature has been receiving round-the-clock care and keeping everyone busy while melting hearts among the Zoo's keepers. Scroll down for video . Meet Chloe – a fury baby wombat who is Sydney Taronga Zoo’s newest addition to the family . ‘My biggest problem is getting her back [from the keepers],’ joked Ms Weston. As part of her 'motherly duties', Ms Weston carries Chloe in a makeshift pouch around her waist and stops her job every five hours to bottle feed her. Chloe was brought to Taronga Wildlife Hospital last week for ongoing care and the keepers hope she will be strong enough to return to the wild in about 18 months. ‘She’s very affectionate and also a bit naughty. She loves chewing on shoes and if you walk away from her she chases after you like a rocket.’ For now, Chloe's diet is limited to a special milk mixture but  she will gradually be introduced to solid foods within a month. ‘We did try to see if she’d nibble on a bit of grass, but she just thought it was something to lie on,’ Ms Evelyn said. Ms Weston's will care baby Chloe for at least another two months, before she moves to a temporary new home at Taronga's Australian  Walkabout. Ms Weston has paid tribute to the great work of wildlife carers and said Chloe’s story should serve as a reminder to motorists to watch out for wildlife on the roads. Taronga Wildlife Hospital cares for and treats over 1,000 injured or orphaned native animals every year, including wombats, wallabies, possums, echidnas, birds and sea turtles.

"A Florida woman is free to eat pasta in her car once again after serving a month in jail because cops confused a crusty spoon in her possession with SpaghettiO's residue as being the drug methamphetamine. Ashley Gabrielle Huff, 23, was arrested on July 2 by the Gainesville police department after they suspected her of having meth residue on a spoon in her car that she hard pressed was SpaghettiO's residue. She was released from Hall County Jail on Thursday after a crime lab analysis confirmed that the spoon had sauce residue instead of drugs, reports The Gainesville Times. Falsely accused: SpaghettiO's lover Ashley Huff, 23, served one month in jail after police confused a spoon with pasta sauce residue as being the drug methamphetamine . Spgahetti-Oh no: Ashley Huff repeatedly told police the spoon had SpaghettiO's residue but they didn't believe her and she even considered taking a plea deal even though she committed no crime . 'I think she said it had been SpaghettiOs,' Hall County assistant public defender Chris van Rossem said. 'From what I understand, she was a passenger in a car and had a spoon on her, near her, and I guess the officer, for whatever reason, thought there was some residue,' he added. Huff had no criminal record prior to her July arrest. 'She’s maintained all along that there’s no way in hell that’s any sort of drug residue or anything like that, ‘van Rossem added. Huff originally tried going through the Hall County Drug Court but was unable to make all of her court dates. She was incarcerated again on August 2 but couldn't afford to pay bond. She considered taking a plea deal even though she committed no crime. 'I think what the unfortunate part about her case is that she was probably willing to take the felony to close out her case so that she get out of jail, even though she always maintained innocence,' van Rossem said. 'The Crime Lab report showed no controlled substances on the spoon submitted for testing,' according to a dismissal signed by Northeastern Judicial Circuit District Attorney Lee Darragh. Innocent: The only sauce Ashley Huff, who has no criminal record, likes to consume is drug free and paired with delicious round shaped pasta .","Ashley Gabrielle Huff, 23, was arrested on July 2 by police after they suspected her of having meth residue on a spoon that was actually sauce .

"A 75-year-old man who was sentenced to death for killing his wife in a 1992 shooting rampage at the St. Louis County Courthouse has died in prison, the Missouri Department of Corrections said Monday. Kenneth Baumruk died late Friday at the Potosi Correctional Center in Mineral Point of apparent natural causes, the agency said. He was the oldest inmate on Missouri's death row. Baumruk pulled two handguns from a briefcase and opened fire in the Clayton courthouse on May 5, 1992, killing his wife, Mary, as their divorce hearing was about to begin. He also wounded both of their lawyers, a bailiff and a security guard, and fired at a judge and police officers but missed. Killer: FILE:  Kenneth Baumruk, seen in this 2010 file photo, died in prison on Friday. Baumrok killed his wife and injured four others at the St. Louis County Courthouse in 1992 . Police returned fire and struck Baumruk nine times, including twice in the head. Authorities said he had carried the .38-caliber handguns in his luggage on a flight from a Seattle, where he was living. Baumruk initially was ruled incompetent for trial partly because of head injuries suffered when he was shot by police. He was eventually found guilty and sentenced to die in 2001, but the case was thrown out by the Missouri Supreme Court. Sentenced: Kenneth Baumruk was sentenced to death in a 2001 trial as well as a 2007 retrial . A 2007 retrial held ended with Baumruk convicted of first-degree murder and again sentenced to die. The jury ignored pleas from Baumruk's lawyers to find him not guilty by reason of what they called a delusional disorder that left him incapable of appreciating the error of his actions. Baumruk was weeks away from execution in 2009, but the lethal injection was postponed by appeals. The state Supreme Court upheld his conviction in 2012, letting stand lower court rulings that denied his claims of ineffective work by his lawyers. A new execution date had not been set.","Kenneth Baumruk, 75, died last Friday at the Potosi Correctional Center in Mineral Point of apparent natural causes .

"Overweight people should be given free bikes on the NHS to get them fit, a former Tour de France great has said. Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling champion, said the move would be better for tackling obesity than giving out gym passes. Doctors can already write prescriptions for obese people to go to exercise classes. Scroll down for video . Chris Boardman (right) - pictured with the bike-fan Mary Creagh, Labour's shadow transport secretary - has called for fat people to take up cycling . But Mr Boardman – who won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympics – said forcing people to go to the gym put people off taking exercise. He told the Sun: ‘The problem with those solutions is that they bolt on to your life so they’re a chore. ‘If you can build an activity almost subconsciously into getting around then it happens organically. And that’s sustainable. Chris Boardman won a gold medal in the individual pursuit in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona . ‘If I want to go to the gym I come in some nights and I’m tired and I can’t be bothered. If when I come in I’ve just done three or four miles home, I’ve already done my exercise. ‘The vast majority of journeys in this country are less than five miles. Thirty per cent are less than two miles and still the preference is to make them by car. ‘So if it becomes part of the fabric of my life I’m going to do it.’ He added: ‘The Department of Health should be screaming at the top of its voice and banging on doors saying for God's sake if people want to ride bikes, get everything out of their way and we’re all going to benefit.’ Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, backed Mr Boardman’s idea. He said cycling would help overweight Brits keep their weight down. Mr Fry said: ‘Bicycling helps all the muscle groups. It is a brilliant exercise - but it has to be done responsibly. GPs will have to make sure patients have had the right training and wear helmets.’ Mr Boardman, one of British Cycling’s star advisors, has urged ministers to commit to spending £10 a person every year on improving cycling safety.","Ex Olympic champion said cycling was better than doling out gym passes .

"A senior executive at Rolls-Royce was given a pay-off of nearly £1million - just a day after the company announced 2,600 job cuts. Chief financial officer and executive director, Mark Morris, will step down from the post with around £900,000 in lieu of his 12-month notice period. The announcement came hours before the engineering group stated that it would be cutting thousands of jobs - mainly in the aerospace division - in the next 18 months. Mark Morris, chief financial officer and executive director, has stepped down from his post with a £1m pay-off . It currently employees around 25,000 employees, mostly in Derby, Bristol, and other UK cities, with around two third of jobs cuts expect to fall in the UK. Mr Morris's pay-off will include his £510,000 basic salary plus £207,150 for benefits such as his pension, motoring allowance and medical insurance. He will also receive the 18,591 ordinary shares he is due as a performance related incentive - worth £157,838 at today's valuation of 849p per share. And he will be entitled to £40,000 worth of 'career transition support'. A spokesman for the company said the executive had received his contractual severance based on his notice period. He said: 'His notice period is longer than for other employees, but a year is standard amongst directors of FTSE 100 boards. 'As to his salary, Rolls-Royce needs to pay the going rate in order to attract and retain directors but our remuneration policy is relatively conservative.' Rolls-Royce announced it would be cutting 2,600 jobs just a day before Mark Morris said he would quit his job . Mr Morris had worked at the company for 27 years, serving as chief financial officer since January 2012. The company has appointed David Smith, the chief financial officer of the company’s aerospace arm. He will reportedly be offered a similar pay and benefits package as his predecessor. Meanwhile the company hopes the job cuts will save it £80m and says it remains hopeful that civil aerospace markets will strengthen over the medium term. This is due to increasing demand for travel in emerging economies and the need to replace older aircraft with new fuel efficient models. Chief executive John Rishton said: 'We will work closely with employees and their representatives to achieve the necessary reductions on a voluntary basis where possible while making sure we retain the skills needed for the future.' However, the Unite union has warned the company of future skill shortages and called for guarantees over compulsory redundancies. Unite national officer, Ian Waddell, said: 'Rolls-Royce is danger of making decisions in the short-term that it will later regret. 'Engineering skills and expertise are already in short supply across the aerospace industry and will be difficult to replace should there be an up-turn in business. 'We will be seeking guarantees over no compulsory redundancies and seeking assurances that the company doesn’t turn to casual labour to plug the skills cap in the future, or seek to offshore skilled UK jobs. 'This is a bitter blow to a proud workforce and we will be doing everything we can to fight for jobs and skills.' The group, which has major bases in Bristol and Derby, said the cull will was part of a major restructuring at the firm, and will mainly impact its aerospace division .","Mark Morris, chief financial officer, will step down with £900,000 in lieu .

"Fitness experts have revealed the latest 'superfood' - and it'll cost you a lot less than chia seeds or lingonberries. They say walking is the 'superfood of fitness' and  that it may be far better for you than bursts of intense exercise.

"Tonight Nik Wallenda defied death walking across a tightrope more than 500ft above the Chicago river - then doing it again with a blindfold on. Setting two new world records in the process, the 35-year-old daredevil braved the winds and . But - though he had fans aplenty - many used his nail-biting challenge as a change to make jibes and mock those involved. According to the Discovery Channel, which aired the stunt live, more than 220,000 tweets were sent weighing in on the event. Scary: Wallenda shuffled out between the west and east Marina City towers wearing and blindfold, guided by a pinging noise . Some over-eager pranksters even killed Wallenda off by editing a death date of November 2, 2014 into his Wikipedia page. The change - edited out before any detail could be inserted - implied that he had perished in the attempt - which Wallenda freely admitted was a possibility even as he took his first steps over the brink of the west Marina City tower, by the Chicago River. Many used their social media accounts simply to marvel at his skill - with some pointing out they can barely walk through their homes in the dark. Another was impressed that Wallenda managed to give a running commentary of his attempt, talking to his father over an intercom. Keen: Many tweeters pointed out how much more capable Nik Wallenda is than them . Premature death: One Wikipedia user changed Wallenda's biography page to say that he died on November 2 2014 - implying that he had perished in the tightrope walk attempt . But others took a chance to snipe over issues close to their hearts. Several gestured towards the high levels of gun crime on the streets of Chicago - with one joking it would be a 'moral victory' if Wallenda made it across without being shot, with another quipping he was safer on the high-wire than on the streets. Others mocked their fellow tweeters after a spelling mistake made it on to Twitter's list of trending topics. Stay safe: Others roped in Chicago's reputation for gun crime when discussing the stunt . Stay smart: Many remarked on the fact that a mis-spelled version of the hashtag for the event gained traction . At one point, more accounts were posting under the hashtag #SkyScrapperLive than the correctly-spelled #SkyScraperLive, prompting ridicule from those with access to spellcheck. Some also took umbrage at the Discovery Channel's coverage of the event - which came with more than an hour of build-up before Wallenda took to the wire. One irate user described the coverage as 'a 2-hour weather update and a ten minute walk' with another wondering aloud whether enough emphasis had been put on the fact that the stunt is dangerous. Special attention was also reserved for TV evangelist Joel Osteen, who prayed on live TV with Wallenda before the attempt. A Tweeter joked that an even more daring venture would be to 'do his highwire act from one side of Joel Osteen's ego to the other'. Overegged? One tweeter took issue with the Discovery Channel's emphasis on how dangerous the stunt was . Excessive? Another commentator thought the channel had spent too long talking about the weather .

"Tabraiz Hussain has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing - to get rid of his stash during a car chase . A drug dealer has been jailed after he was found covered in £16,000 of heroin after trying - and failing -  to get rid of his stash during a car chase. Tabraiz Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year. Teesside Crown Court heard how Hussain was followed by police before he then led them on a pursuit round a 'heavily-populated estate' for several minutes before trying to throw the class A drug out of the window. The drug then burst all over him, his car and the pavement in a snow-like covering as he tried to get rid of it. Prosecuting Aisha Wadoodi told the court: 'The defendant refused to stop, exceeding the speed limit and driving on the wrong side of the road. 'He only stopped once he mounted the pavement after a close collision with parked cars.' Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and from the defendant's clothes. Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. The 34-year-old, admitted he was in possession of class A but claimed he was instructed by someone else to collect the package, and was paid £300. A pair of gloves and three tampered mobile phones were also recovered. The court heard how months earlier the father-of-two had arranged for a taxi to transport an associate to collect a supply of heroin from Manchester. The trip had been organised through a long-term friend of the defendant who paid £220 for the fare. The court heard that during the journey, at least 13 calls were made between the defendant and his co-conspirator who exchanged passwords and a postcode. Scroll down for video . Pictured is the car covered in heroin. Police used vacuum cleaners to suck up the drugs scattered on the road and the defendant . On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag. Hussain initially denied conspiracy to supply class A drugs but changed his plea to guilty on the day of his trial. He also pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply class A and dangerous driving. Hussain became involved in a police chase while driving to an address in the Park End area of Middlesbrough, on September 8 last year.  The drugs can be seen scattered . Once measured, they estimated the drugs to amount to one kilo, with a street value of almost £16,000. Pictured is scattered debris from the drugs haul . Defending Rachael Sewell said her client 'accepted fully' that he organised a taxi in order to pick up drugs but did not accept that he was person who was leading the trip. She said: 'The defendant's role was linked to the taxi only. He did not play a lead role.' Sentencing him to eight years and six months in prison Judge Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough, said: 'You, on two occasions were involved in the supply of class A drugs and involved to a significant extent. And it may well be that your involvement may stretch beyond these two incidents. On the way back to Middlesbrough, police stopped the car and recovered just under two kilos of heroin, with a street value of about £97,000, which was stored in a McDonald's paper bag . 'You were involved in the transportation of heroin, which on one occasion was just short of 2kg and the other occasion had an estimated amount of 1kg. 'Those involved in supplying drugs of course play different roles, but those closest to the source are the ones who are closest to the final retail on the street. 'There is an unhappy chain of drugs coming from the Manchester area to this area and I am determined to do all that I can to stamp it out.' The case has echoes of scenes in Hollywood blockbuster True Romance. A character, played by Bronson Pinchot, tries to evade police by chucking cocaine from the window of his moving car, only for it bounce back and cover him. He is stopped for speeding but ultimately arrested for drug possession as an officer is faced with the grinning white faced defendant. And in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, Allen - playing the nervy Alvy Singer - covers himself in 'cocaine' after accidentally sneezing into a tray of the drug while at a party.","Tabraiz Hussain tried to throw drugs out of window during police chase .

"Several pods of sperm whales emerged off the Southern California coast in an extremely rare, hours-long sighting that had whale watchers and scientists giddy with excitement. More than 50 mothers and juveniles were rolling and playing with dolphins Monday a few miles off Laguna Beach, the Orange County Register reported. 'I've been counting whales and been on the water for 35 years. We've never had a large group like this ever,' said Alisa Schulman-Janiger, director of the ACS/LA Gray Whale Census and Behavior Project. Unprecedented: Over 50 female and juvenile sperm whales appeared off the coast of Orange County, California on Monday in first ever sighting of its kind . Fascinating: The whales were spread out over an area of up to 3 square miles and came within inches of boats as they poked their heads out of the waves . The whales weigh up to 45 tons and eat about a ton of squid a day. The massive mammals were spread out over an area of up to 3 square miles and came within inches of boats as they poked their heads out of the waves, said David Anderson, who operates Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari sightseeing tours. Anderson said before Monday he had seen only one sperm whale in nearly 20 years on boats off Southern California. 'This was the most amazing sighting that I've ever had off Southern California, by a long shot,' he said. By 5 p.m. the whale pods were passing the Dana Point Headlands and heading south. Frolicking: The whales were playing with pods off dolphins during the hours-long swim-by. When a sperm whale or two have been seen in the area in the past, they were there to hunt the depths for squid. These whales appeared to be having a good time . While a group of this size is totally without precedent in the area, individual sperm whales have been seen off Orange County before. Some individuals have even continued to be spotted for years at a time. A male sperm whale dubbed Double Scoop was first seen off Newport Beach in March 1984. Double Scoop and another male sperm whale friend were seen off and on until 1990. A male named Mango was seen in the Point Vicente and Redondo areas in 2011 and 2013. Sperm whales mostly stick to warmer tropical or subtropical waters, but unusually warm waters off the Baja peninsula have brought with them species not usually seen. 'I’ve never seen anything like this,' said Schulman-Janiger. 'Nobody I know in Southern California has.' Sperm whales weigh up to 45 tons and eat about a ton of squid a day.

"They have already shown us how ordinary British families interact in front of the TV. Now the makers of Gogglebox will give us a snapshot of how we spend our time in our kitchens. The team behind the hit Channel 4 documentary have made a similar series charting the ways we cook and eat at home. The team behind Gogglebox have visited several households across the UK to see what happens at dinnertime. Here Solicitor Alasdair lives with wife Lucy, a luxury tour operator, and their three children in Gloucestershire, they prefer luxury home cooked cuisine . From the aristocrat who serves roadkill to his young family, to the Welsh family who survive on frozen meals from Iceland, the BBC2 show reveals the stark differences in what food we prepare. One of the stars of the show is graphic designer Hamish Mitchell Cotts. Despite being born into a life of privilege, the 63-year-old – whose father was an Army major and a baronet – gave up the chance of a lucrative career in London to raise his six children in rural Suffolk. He and his wife Merlyn, 48, survive on a £100-a-week food budget, forcing them to adopt the techniques of ‘medieval peasants’ and take vegetables from local fields to survive. The have named each of their offspring - Celandine, 18, Tamarisk, 15, Campion, 14, 11-year-old twins Rowan and Valerian, and Samphire, eight – after plants found near their house, and they rely on local produce to feed them. Hamish, the son of a baronet, and his South African wife Merlyn live in rural Suffolk with their six children (all named after plants). They have a far more frugal spread with a  budget of  £100 a week to feed the family . Mr Mitchell Cotts told the Daily Mail: ‘We try and make them understand that food isn’t just a shrink wrapped package from a supermarket. It’s a commodity that you’ve got to understand and look after. ‘I do see it as a challenge. I put a bit of effort into it. We look around to source our food. After the harvest wherever you go you see fields with thousands of potatoes or onions lying around. I nip in there once in a while and fill up a sack or a basket and that will last us a couple of months. ‘I see it as a time honoured custom. The farmers are not really too bothered. You’ve got to make sure you’re not trampling on crops.’ Mr Mitchell Cotts always buys the cheapest products from shops and supermarkets, and serves unpopular and cheap off-cuts of meat such as tripe and kidneys to his children. And he admitted he has occasionally served up wild animals killed on the roads near his house, although he does so rarely because skinning and gutting the animals is so time-consuming. He said: ‘We’re surrounded by forests, and wherever you go you see road kill. It’s unbelievable. I think road kill has its place. I’m not against it. I have prepared and eaten it in the past. ‘But in terms of feeding a family of eight it’s pretty impractical because you have to do an amazing amount of preparation, with skinning and gutting and so on.’ Marylyn and Wilf live in Devon. Marylyn enjoys making pasties for her husband who she has been married to for over 50 years . He added: ‘When I decided I wanted to have children, I made a conscious decision that I wasn’t going to spend my life working my socks off in some far off place. ‘I know people who get up at 5am, take the train to London, come back at 8pm and see their children for a few minutes. I didn’t want to do that. I have sacrificed a more lucrative existence by deciding to be in the country and stay in the country.’ The three-part documentary – called The Kitchen – features another family who take a very different approach to surviving on a tight budget. Warehouse worker Lee Barry and his wife Louise Powers, set themselves a budget of around £200-a-week to feed their five children aged between eight and 19. But instead of sourcing fresh vegetables, they do their weekly shop at Iceland and regularly eat sausages, chips and beans. Mr Barry, from Cardiff, said he would be happy to eat road kill and collect vegetables from the fields if he did not live in the city. He added: ‘I think it’s easier to eat cheaply when you live in the countryside. You don’t get a lot of road kill in Cardiff. Organic food is too expensive for us, so we tend to buy frozen stuff from Iceland. It keeps for longer and the kids like it. ‘We eat stuff like sausages, chips, and beans. We always try to sit down together for a Sunday roast, but it is hard feeding five kids as they all want different things and they are fussy eaters.’ Other stars of the show include pensioners Wilfred and Marylyn Bradshaw, who married 50 years ago after a whirlwind romance which started at the button factory where they worked. The couple, from Devon, eat a traditional English diet of meat pies, mash and gravy, prepared meticulously by Mrs Bradshaw. Lunch is always on the table at 12.30pm, and dinner is served at 5.30pm sharp so he can watch the Six O’Clock News. Whenever they go on holiday or visit friends overnight, they always pack their own food – often consisting of cheese sandwiches - so they are not a burden on others and in case they cannot stomach the local cooking. Recalling a disastrous trip to Italy, Mr Bradshaw said: ‘It was all pizza and pasta and things like that. It wasn’t very nice.’ Meanwhile, the middle-class Garbutt family, from Gloucestershire, are passionate about feeding their three children a healthy, organic diet. Alistair Garbutt, a solicitor, tries to live off the land as much as possible, by growing vegetables on the allotment, catching his own fish, and getting fresh cuts of meat from his father-in-law’s hobby farm. Their children Archie, 12, Harry, nine, and Daphne, seven, are encouraged to get involved with the cooking but it is not always easy to get them to finish their food. The Kitchen starts next Monday on BBC2 at 9pm.","The makers of Gogglebox have produced a new programme- The Kitchen .

"Lined with barbed wire, guarded by soldiers wearing riot gear and with tanks waiting nearby, this is perhaps not the welcome Kurdish refugees were hoping for as they fled across the Turkish border from Syria. But for now this is the safest place for the thousands of men, women and children to be as hoards of ISIS militants descend on their home town of Kobani. U.S.-led airstrikes and soldiers from the Kurdish peshmerga have managed to hold the brutal Islamic extremists back for now, but there are fears they could still take the town. If that happens, many Kurds fear they will be massacred in the same way the Yazidis were after ISIS fighters seized Sinjar last month, forcing them to flee into the hills. Scroll down for video . Shield wall: Turkish soldiers block access to the Mursitpinar crossing near the Syrian border, as Syrian Kurdish people try to pass, in the southeastern town of Suruc . Innocence: A women and a child are pictured among thousands of refugees left stranded in Turkey after Islamic State militants advanced towards their hometown . Anger: Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian territory . Among the 150,000 Kurds to arrive in Turkey in the last week is Mohammed Muslim. Dressed in a battered suit, his moustache flecked . with grey, he is distraught about having to leave, but fears what would have happened to him if he had stayed. 'I don't want to be in Turkey, I want to be in my village, I . want to die in Kobani,' Muslim said, running prayer beads . through his hands as he watched Kurdish and Islamic State . fighters exchange fire in the valley below.' He added: 'If the war goes our way, then of course we'll go home, but . it looks like it will be difficult.' Turkey, already home to an estimated 1.5 million refugees . from Syria's civil war, is pushing the United States and its . allies to create a safe haven for refugees inside Syrian . territory. A safe haven along the border would require a no-fly . zone policed by foreign jets. President Tayyip Erdogan, until now reluctant to commit to a . frontline military role in the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic . State, has said Turkish troops could be used to help set up such . a zone. Meanwhile, Turkey has deployed riot police at the Mursitpinar crossing gate near the Syrian border in the southeastern town of Suruc to stop Syrian refugees entering Turkey. Show of force: Turkey has massed troops and tanks close to the border and says it may be willing to help set up a safe zone for refugees inside Syria . Ready for action: Turkey has  been reluctant to commit troops to the conflict in Syria, but has changed its stance after 1.5million refugees flooded across the border . Assault: U.S.-led airstrikes have kept ISIS militants away from the town of Kobani, on the Turkish border, so far - but there are fears it could still fall to the radicals . U.S. air strikes have hit Islamic State targets around 140 . km to the south of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, in the . militant group's heartland of Raqqa, and on Saturday also hit . sites to the east of the town. But the heavily-armed Sunni insurgents appear gradually to . be forcing the Kurdish fighters back around Kobani, raising . fears that the town may fall. Either way, the tens of thousands . of refugees who have crossed the border in recent days may be in . Turkey for a long time, aid workers say. 'You've seen it in other places along the border. There's no . fighting anymore but people stay in Turkey,' said Umit Algan, . who runs the relief effort in the border town of Suruc for IMPR, . a Turkish aid organisation. Desperate: Approximately 1.5million Kurds have crossed the border into Turkey, fearing execution by ISIS troops who are attacking the town of Kobani . Helpless: There are fears that Kurdish Peshmerga troops, who are partly being armed and supplied by Britain,will not be able to hold back the ISIS assault on Kobani . Lost: Men wait beside a road near the town of Suruc in Turkey after fleeing from ISIS militants in Syria who are advancing on the town of Kobani, near the border . Victims: Today the U.S. released a video of warplanes attacking ISIS militants as they fired on Kurdish refugees trying to flee across the border to safety . 'I think it'll be the same here, they never know when . (Islamic State) might come back,' he said, adding that his . group's initial relief effort aimed to help refugees camping out . in mosques, schools and parks for a month only. Crowds of mostly Syrian Kurds cheered from the Turkish . hillside as Kurdish shells kick up plumes of dust near Islamic . State positions just across the border, but the next day the . jihadists seized new ground. The advance towards Kobani is the latest in a series of . lightning campaigns by the Islamist group which have seen them . seize swathes of territory in both Syria and Iraq. The United Nations, which has warned that as many as 400,000 . people could flee Kobani to Turkey, has said that the number of . displaced makes the influx from the besieged border town the . most serious yet of Syria's civil war. Insurgents appear gradually tobe forcing the Kurdish fighters back around the border town of Kobani, raising fears that the town may fall . Tensions between Turkish authorities and Turkish Kurds are high. The Kurds say Ankara is not doing enough to help their beleaguered brethren in Syria .

Many of those who have fled were from poor farming . communities in the semi-arid terrain and were forced to leave . their most valuable possessions behind - particularly livestock . and vehicles. 'We have nothing here, nowhere to sleep. If they let us . collect our cars, we can sleep in them,' said one Syrian Kurdish . refugee, 60-year old Hussein Kadir Cumo. Small crowds of Syrian Kurds gathered at crossing points . along the border to plead with Turkish officials to be allowed . to go back and collect their possessions, their vehicles . tantalizingly visible through the barbed wire fence. A steady stream of new refugees kept arriving, many of them . herding cattle. Syrian Kurds wait with their animals behind the border fences to cross into Turkey . Unaware: A child sleeps in the arms of their mother, as heavily armed and armoured Turkish soldier stand by . Limited access: Syrian refugees are allowed through the Mursitpinar border gate . Labour Minister Faruk Celik, who visited the border gate, . was later quoted as saying the authorities would start to let . livestock and vehicles cross. Turkish military outposts occupy commanding positions on . high ground along the border, the Islamic State front lines . clearly visible below them. Armoured military vehicles patrol . the frontier, but Turkish guns have remained silent, with Ankara . reluctant to be dragged into the war. The conflict has stirred up deep-seated resentment among . Turkey's Kurds, who inhabit large parts of the country's . southeast and accuse Ankara of backing the Islamist insurgents . in a bid to stifle a three-decade insurgency by Kurdish . militants pushing for greater rights. Thousands of Kurds from across Turkey have descended on the . border in recent days, some living in quasi-refugee camps, in . solidarity with displaced Kurdish communities, with police . repeatedly firing tear gas to disperse protesters. 'Our family and friends are in Kobani, this border has no . meaning for us,' said Songul Morsumbul, a protest organiser. 'But the state attacks us with gas, tells us we're terrorists.'

"The entire crew of a flight that Ebola-infected nurse Amber Vinson took from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas has been put on paid leave as Frontier Airlines scrambles to show passengers it is taking every precaution it can after learning Ms Vinson may have been contagious on board one of its planes. Ms Vinson boarded Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday with a low-grade fever after being told by Centers for Disease Control officials that she was OK to travel. The CDC has since reversed course, saying that Ms Vinson 'should not have traveled on a commercial airline' and warning that all 132 passengers on board may have been exposed to the deadly disease. Scroll down for video . Back in service: The Frontier Airlines jet that carried Amber Vinson hours before she was hospitalized with Ebola has been scrubbed and flew out of Denver on Wednesday . Frontier Airlines workers at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport wore latex gloves on Wednesday after it was revealed Ebola-infected Amber Vinson flew on a Frontier plane . Frontier announced on Wednesday that all six members of the  crew from Flight 1143 have been put on paid leave 'out of an abundance of caution.' The plane, an Airbus A320, was thoroughly disinfected and the seat covers and carpets around where Ms Vinson sat were torn out and replaced. However, before the plane was removed from service and thoroughly cleaned, it made five flights across the country, including to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Atlanta. Frontier said it stopped using the plane as soon as CDC officials notified the airline that Ms Vinson had flown on it. The CDC has not said there is any risk to passengers who flew on the plane after Ms Vinson got off. Amber Vinson asked for permission from the CDC before boarding a plane from Cleveland to Dallas while she had a low-grade fever. Hours later, she went to the hospital and was diagnosed with Ebola . The plane Ms Vinson flew on when she may have been contagious made four more flights full of passengers before it was removed from service. The plane returned to Cleveland from Dallas, then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Intentional Airport in Florida, then to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport . 'We take today’s events seriously as your safety and that of our customers is always at the forefront of everything we do,' Frontier CEO David Siegel said in an open letter. 'This was over and above CDC guidance that stated that our flight crews were safe to fly.' The CDC is trying to track down all passengers who flew on Flight 1143 with Ms Vinson and had asked them to call a government helpline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636). Officials at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport say they have cleaned and disinfected common areas at the airport after learning Ms Vinson passed through. Ms Vinson has flown to Cleveland to visit her fiance and her mother and plan her upcoming wedding. The CDC criticized her for traveling, though Dallas public health officials said the feds never warned the 76 healthcare workers who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan to stay off airplanes. Frontier has also notified passengers aboard five flights that the plane took after Ms Vinson's trip. Those flights are: .","Amber Vinson flew on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 with a low-grade fever after the CDC advised her it was OK .

"Remember that scorching September – sunny, warm and the driest on record? It only ended a week ago but soon it could seem like a distant memory. This week Britain will be battered by torrential downpours, hail storms and gales of up to 70mph. Temperatures are already plummeting and parts of the Highlands even had their first snow of the year yesterday. Scroll down for video . Through the mist: A deer runs through part of Richmond Park, south-west London, this morning as temperatures plunged following an unusually warm start to Autumn . Last night the Met Office issued weather warnings for the length of Britain’s western coast as a fierce Atlantic storm approached. Up to three inches of rain will fall in the worst hit areas and it is feared this could cause flash flooding. Daytime temperatures will struggle to get above 17C (63F) today and will drop to a bitter 3C (37F) in some parts overnight. The fiercest storms are set to clear by tomorrow, but the rain and wind will continue through the week. Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite warned that a stubborn area of low pressure over the UK will bring unsettled conditions until next week. Temperatures fell to as low as five degrees in parts of Northumberland, where an early morning blanket of fog covered the Tyne Valley . Thick clouds of fog hid most of Haughton Castle, in Northumberland, this morning, with only the turrets emerging above the mist . He said yesterday: ‘There is a system developing to the west which will move in through Sunday night and Monday morning. Coastal regions in the west could see strong gusts of up to 70mph in exposed regions though it will be a wet and windy day generally on Monday. ‘There is a heavy band of rain moving across the country during the day, reaching London and the east by the middle of the day. It is going to be unsettled for the rest of the week thanks to low pressure which isn’t moving away quickly. Instead it is going to hang around bringing more showers and the potential for heavy rain until the weekend. ‘It is also going to feel cooler than we have seen with temperatures slightly below average for the time of year, though it will be milder at night.’ The fog began to disperse as the temperatures increased, with highs of 14 degrees in parts of the north-east today - but storms are just around the corner . The first snow of the season fell in the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland as the mercury dropped below freezing, hitting -1.4C (29.5F) in the nearby village of Braemar. The Mountain Weather Information Service warned there could be more sleet and snow this week. Leon Brown, of The Weather Channel UK, said heavy rain could trigger flash floods in western parts. He added: ‘Gusts of up to 70mph are possible in Cornwall, Devon, west Wales and western Scotland which may bring down a few trees and certainly large branches and a lot of leaves. Low pressure will then dominate the rest of next week. ‘We can expect bands of heavy showers, especially over the west, with hail and thunder. ‘Temperatures are feeling rather cool so coats and hats at the ready, and beware your umbrella doesn’t blow inside out.’ A Met Office warning said: ‘Given the very strong winds and their coincidence with Monday’s rush hour, as well as standing water on roads, some disruption to travel is likely.’ The Environment Agency issued flood alerts for the coast between Plymouth and Lyme Regis and for the North Sea coast at Bridlington, Yorkshire, where high tides were forecast this morning. A forecast by the Met Office shows Britain is in for a sudden downpour tomorrow morning, which will continue in the south-east on Tuesday . After the driest September since records began, Autumn will finally strike Britain tomorrow with fierce storms, 70mph winds and driving rain set to lash the north-west . The torrid conditions are expected to cause floods and disrupt travel, with the Met Office issuing severe weather warnings for parts of England, north Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .

"Newborn twins who were born prematurely after ambulance crews spent half an hour trying to get into their pregnant mother's tower block have had their life support machines turned off. Jocelyn Bennett, 27, was rushed to hospital from Pleck House, on Winterbourne Croft, Druids Heath in Birmingham and gave birth to Rose and Melody by emergency caesarean section. But with Ms Bennett still in a coma after the ordeal, her devastated family have switched off the twins' life support machine in a poignant farewell - as nursery rhymes played in the background. Jocelyn Bennett, left, called 999 over stomach pains, but paramedics couldn't enter  Pleck House tower block in Birmingham for 30 minutes. She was rushed to hospital and gave birth to twin girls Rose and Melody. Ms Bennett's father Joe is shown right holding one of the babies in a picture released by the family . The twins were starved of oxygen after paramedics were locked out of the council-run tower block from which their 27-year-old mum dialled 999 for half-an-hour. They suffered multi-organ failure and lack of oxygen to their brain. Ms Bennett was found unconscious after her heart stopped. At 1pm today her partner Kevin Clarke, 31, along with the couple's close relatives, wept as medics turned off the babies' life support machines at Birmingham Women's Hospital. A hospital chaplain performed a touching service and the babies were placed in their father's arms for a last cuddle. Ms Bennett had dialled 999 after being woken by severe stomach pains in the early hours of last Wednesday morning. But when a first response paramedic arrived in 12 minutes at Pleck House tower, Ms Bennet was unable to answer the buzzer. Ms Bennett, who was 32 weeks pregnant, had suffered a placental abruption which had left her in too much pain to reach the entry button. An emergency crew that arrived at the scene failed to reach other neighbours through the buzzer system for help at the tower block. The police were called and helped the crew to enter the building and the paramedics reached Ms Bennett at 6.10am – some 30 minutes after she dialled 999 at 5.39am. But by the time the ambulance crew arrived at Ms Bennett's home on the third floor of the tower block, her heart had stopped and she was lying on the floor. Pleck House in Druids Heath, where residents say the intercom system is faulty or answers in a foreign voice . Birmingham City Council are investigating why paramedics were unable to gain access to Ms Bennett's home in Pleck House. After Ms Bennett was rushed to Birmingham Women's Hospital, hours later she gave birth to Melody, weighing 4lbs 1oz, and Rose, who weighed 3lbs, by emergency caesarean section. Her family had had the little girls christened and held a Christmas party for them as they worry Ms Bennett will suffer brain damage. Ms Bennett's father, Joe, said his daughter and her partner Kevin Clarke had been so excited about the twins they had named them weeks ago. Mr Bennett, from Kings Norton, said his daughter had a trouble-free pregnancy up to last Wednesday and had enjoyed a family party just days earlier. The 54-year-old said this afternoon: 'It was so hard and I could barely breath. 'They looked so perfect and when the ventilators were taken off their tiny bodies, I expected them to start moving. 'The vicar performed a lovely service and then the girls were held by Kevin for the last time. 'We left him with the twins so he could spend time with them on his own.' 'Jocelyn is still in a coma but we wanted to be able to give her closure too. 'We have been through so many emotions. What helped us was the support that we had from people online. 'It was amazing.' Earlier Kevin, who also has a three-year-old son, Slater, with Jocelyn, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Thank you everyone for all your support. Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin were so excited about the baby girls (shown in pictures released by the family) that they had christened them weeks ago . 'Joyce is still in a coma and today the babies will have the life support switched off. 'Thanks again for all your prayers.' Earlier, Mr Bennett, had said of his daughter's ordeal: 'It could have all been so different if the ambulance crews could have reached her earlier.' He feared that an out-of order trades entrance and inefficient entry system at Pleck House had prevented paramedics from reaching his daughter in time. 'The fact that paramedics couldn't get in was down to the terrible entry system at the building,' he said. 'There needs to be a better way for emergency services to access these flats. 'Because of this, I will lose my two precious grandchildren and my daughter is fighting for her life. 'Something needs to be done by the council about this because if there is another emergency, this could happen again. I cannot fault the paramedics and the police as they tried their best to get to Jocelyn as quickly as they could.' Mr Bennett does not blame Jocelyn's neighbours either and said that a police raid at the tower block had left residents reluctant to answer unexpected calls. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. Mr Bennett said emergency numbers are on the inside of the building at Pleck House which didn't help police . 'The trades entrance had been deactivated so they weren't able to get in that way. 'All the emergency numbers are on the inside of the building which didn't help the police and the ambulance crew. It took the police around 20 minutes to get through the front door when they did arrive. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place. 'Jocelyn had been blooming throughout her pregnancy up until this. She had been to a family party a few days before and had a great time. Her and Kevin had named the babies and were so excited about them. 'Her illness came out of the blue. Her placenta had come away and by the time she got to the hospital and underwent surgery she had lost two litres of blood. She suffered multi-organ failure.' A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: 'Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. This is the tragic timeline that shows it took paramedics some 30 minutes to reach Jocelyn Bennett after she called 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and we are investigating what happened in this instance.' West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed it received an emergency call from Pleck House at 5.39am last Wednesday. A spokesman said: 'West Midlands Ambulance Service can confirm it received a call to Pleck House, Winterbourne Croft, Kings Heath, Birmingham at 5.39am on Wednesday 29th October 2014. 'The first resource to arrive outside the building was a paramedic in a rapid response vehicle, at 5.51am. 'Two ambulance crews then arrived outside the premises at 5.58am and 6.01am respectively. 'Crews had difficulty getting into the building. They tried to contact other flats within the block; all with no answer. The control room contacted the patient's parents and partner by telephone. 'The ambulance service requested the help of police at 6.03am. Police arrived at 6.10am and entry to the building was gained soon after.' Police confirmed officers arrived at the scene and 6.10am and gained entry shortly afterwards. A spokesman said: 'We were called by the ambulance service at 6.03am on 29 October and arrived at Pleck House at 6.10am.' Tower block neighbours of Ms Bennett have complained about the security system at Pleck House. Some residents said their buzzers did not work and the intercom system in the entrance gave instructions in foreign languages. Jade Butler, 22,  said she heard a buzzer being rung in the early hours of Wednesday, October 29, when Jocelyn Bennett fell ill. She said: 'The buzzer was being pressed between 4.30am and 5.30am last Wednesday. I wasn't expecting anybody. I thought who's ringing the buzzer at that time in the morning? 'A few times people have rung the buzzer just to be let into the block so I don't answer. 'I thought the police and emergency services had a fob to get in? It's a shame, they should've been able to get to her.' Another resident, who did not wish to give their name, said: 'If you don't have a fob, you can't get in and if the emergency services want to get in they have to press the trade button which doesn't work. 'The system is all in German, so you can't get in. 'Most peoples buzzers don't work and some people have them turned off because you get everyone pressing them all the time saying 'let me in.''

In the letter, Lennon seeks to help the New York television personality better understand his wife's work. Lennon writes: 'I know you're a musician at heart! and especially I know you dig jazz.—Well, Yoko's music ain't quite jazz but to help you get off on it, or understand it, please listen to a track on the 'Yoko/Ono/Plastic Ono Band,' called 'AOS,' which was recorded in 1968 (pre Lennon/Beatles!) with Ornette Coleman at Albert Hall London, you could call it free form, anyway Yoko sits in the middle of avante-garde, classic, jazz—and now through me and my music—rock 'n' roll! He continues: 'On the new album 'Fly' the experiment goes a step 'further'—free form music—with robot musicians! (not computer—electronic—)—check the inside of Fly double-album for info and photo of the 'musicians,' of course Yoko can explain her music better in person, this is a kind of introduction. 'For something rather more 'straight,' a track called 'Mrs. Lennon' on 'Fly' is an example of her more conservative side! She was trained as a classical musician, and took music composition in Sarah Lawrence College as her major. It's far out, but don't let it frighten you. With love.' Lennon signs off with a thumbnail sketch of himself and Yoko along with a postscript. 'The book 'Grapefruit' speaks for itself,' he adds, 'now in its 4th edition paperback. Yoko calls them, 'instructions' to help you through life rather than poetry!'

Bobby Livingston, exec vp at RR Auction which is facilitating the letter's sale as part of it's Oct. 16 Marvels of Modern Music Auction, said the letter shows how proud John was of his oft-maligned wife. 'John writes to convince Franklin about Yoko's abilities and talents, validating her by noting that she worked with Ornette Colman at the Royal Albert Hall in 1968,' Livingston notes. 'He also urges Franklin to listen to a song on her 'Fly' album' A limited edition Paul McCartney Epiphone 'Texan' six-string acoustic guitar from 1964 will also be auctioned off .

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has appeared to make his second public appearance in a week following a period of over a month during which a lack of sightings had prompted speculation about his health and grip on power. The newly released photos show the rotund leader and wife Ri Sol-Ju meeting with gold medalists from the recent Asian Games and their coaches in Pyongyang. Kim, 31, was wearing his signature dark buttoned suit, although there was no sign of his black walking stick although in one photo it looked as if several of the athletes were having to help him stand up straight. Scroll down for video . Laughing dictator: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is all smiles as he meets athletes who won gold medals at the 17th Asian Games . Stand-up guy: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un looked as if he needed the support of several athletes to help him stand up straight in photos released on Sunday . The undated photos were released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday, but haven’t been independently verified. The 17th Asian Games was held in Incheon, South Korea, from September 19 to October 4. North Korea finished seventh in the medals table, winning 36 in total and 11 gold. After five weeks without being seen in public, Kim appeared on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper last Tuesday smiling and gesturing on a visit to a housing development, although there was no indication which day the event had taken place. Kim was surrounded by aides and supported himself with a black walking stick. Prior to that he hadn’t appeared in public since he and his wife had attended a concert on September 3. The rotund leader and wife Ri Sol-Ju were photographed meeting with gold medalists from the recent Asian Games and their coaches in Pyongyang . Following the leader's public re-emergence, the North Korean Ambassador in London, Hyon Hak Bong, told the BBC that there was ‘no doubt about it’ that Kim was healthy. His absence from events including an important political anniversary  and a session of the country's parliament has prompted speculation that he was receiving drastic weight loss treatment in China. A source told the Daily Mail that the 31-year-old had spent the past few weeks in a Beijing hospital having his stomach tied, or ‘banded’, to help him fight his weight gain. Last month it was claimed Kim has been putting his health at serious risk due to his dangerously high consumption of Emmental cheese, which he got a taste for while a student in Switzerland. Also on Sunday, troops from the rival Koreas exchanged gunfire along their heavily fortified border in the second such shooting in less than 10 days. There were no reports of injuries or property damage according to South Korean, but the 10 minutes of shooting highlighted rising tensions between the divided countries. Kim, 31, was wearing his signature dark buttoned suit, although there was no sign of his black walking stick . After five weeks without being seen in public, Kim appeared on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper last Tuesday smiling and gesturing on a visit to a housing development . The Koreas' first exchange of gunfire came after North Korea opened fire at balloons carrying anti-Pyongyang leaflets that were floating across the border from the South. Sunday's shootout began after North Korea sent soldiers close to the border line. The move was an attempt by the North to increase worries in the South about what might happen if leafleting continues, analysts say. South Korean activist groups, mostly made up of North Korean defectors, have been staunch in their vows to continue sending the leaflets, which Pyongyang considers propaganda warfare; one group says it will float about 50,000 on Saturday. North Korea has warned it will take unspecified stronger measures if leafleting continues. Generals from the sides met at a border village last week in their first military talks in more than three years to discuss how to ease the recent spike in tensions, but the meeting ended with no agreement and no prospects to meet again. On Sunday, South Korean soldiers broadcast warnings and fired warning shots at about 10 North Korean soldiers who were approaching the military demarcation line inside the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone that bisects the Korean Peninsula, according to a statement from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Recent appearance: Until his re-emergence last week Kim had last been seen in the state media  at a concert on September 3 (above centre, with his wife Ri Sol-Ju) Two shots believed to have been fired by North Korean soldiers were found at a South Korean guard post. South Korean soldiers fired toward the North, the statement said. South Korean defense officials said the North Korean soldiers turned back after the shooting. North Korea opened fire on October 10 after activists floated propaganda balloons across the border, following through on a previous threat to attack. There were no reports of casualties from that incident either. North Korea has repeatedly demanded South Korea ban activists from sending leaflets, which often urge North Korean citizens to rise up against leader Kim Jong Un. South Korea has refused, saying activists are exercising freedom of speech. South Korean army soldiers patrol through the military wire fence near the border with North Korea: Border guards of the rival Koreas exchanged gunfire on Sunday,  in the second such shootout in less than 10 days . Analyst Cheong Seong-chang at the private Sejong Institute think tank said Sunday's gunfire exchange showed North Korea is intentionally escalating military tension to spread fear about possible casualties should leafleting continue. He said North Korea is expected to launch more provocations as long as South Korea doesn't change its position on leafleting. The latest exchanges of gunfire serve as a reminder of long-running tensions between the Koreas despite earlier hopes of easing animosities after a group of top North Korean officials made a rare visit to South Korea early this month and agreed to resume senior-level talks. Only days after the North Koreans' visit, navy ships of the two Koreas also traded gunfire near their disputed western sea border, the scene of several bloody maritime skirmishes in recent years. The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.","The North Korean leader appears to have made his second public appearance in a week following a period missing from the spotlight .

"Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has quizzed defence force top brass over the threat Ebola-infected suicide terrorists could pose to Australia and its military. At a Senate Estimates hearing this morning, the controversial Tasmanian senator asked Vice Chief of the Defence Force  Ray Griggs if the nation's enemies could launch an attack with the deadly virus. Officials replied by saying there was no evidence we could come under attack from the hypothetical scourge. Scroll down for video . 'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action': Senator Jacqui Lambie (left) and Australian Defence Force Vice Chief Ray Griggs faced off at a senate estimates committee hearing on Wednesday morning . The Ebola virus: The deadly ailment has killed 4500 people in West Africa, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures . Ms Lambie asked a series of questions about the ADF's readiness for Ebola at a Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee hearing on Wednesday morning . Not at risk: Vice Admiral Ray Griggs said it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing Ebola symptoms, particularly given the nation's geographical isolation . Ms Lambie asked: 'Do you have any information to suggest that Australia's enemies could attack our country or military using the virus?' 'For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease.' Ms Lambie, a former Army soldier, then pressed Vice-Admiral Griggs on whether the Defence Force had a contingency plan for the scenario. But Vice Admiral Griggs said there was no proof militants were capable of attacking Australia or its troops with Ebola. 'I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action,' he told the hearing. He said because of Australia's isolation, it would be 'quite difficult' for a person to enter the country without showing symptoms. LAMBIE: I was just wondering if I could ask a supplementary on Ebola, if that's OK. Thanks Mr Chair. Do you have any information to suggest Australia's enemies could use attack our country or military using the virus? For example with suicide agents who are infected by the disease or who have access to bodily fluids containing the disease. And what is your contingency plan to fight this? GRIGGS: Well, I don't believe there is any evidence to suggest that is a likely course of action. One of the things, Senator, that we have playing to our advantage is our geographic (sic) isolation. And that the length of time that it takes simply to get to Australia. And (with) the life cycle of the virus, it becomes very obvious relatively quickly how sick someone is. So I think the ability to inject someone into the country who is not showing symptoms would be quite difficult. LAMBIE: I'm just asking if you have a contingency plan. Because if you listen to one side of it, they can say this can take off 10,000 a week, it can hit people by 10,000 a week. I just want to know... Is there a contingency plan through the Defence Force to tackle the Ebola issue. Are your men and women protected? GRIGGS: Senator, our men and women are protected as anyone else in the country is. The response to that hypothetical situation would be the response to any outbreak of Ebola in Australia. Our health system has its preparations ready for the virus appearing in the country. LAMBIE: And so are the civilian doctors and civilian nurses that... I'm not sure the ratio between defence and civilian now within that medical corps... Are they prepared to fight the Ebola alongside the military? I'm not sure what their contracts are. So are they prepared - do they get to move out if they do not want to fight this if it hits? How big is the corps, the medical corps, within the armed forces, which is military? GRIGGS: I'll have to take the exact numbers on notice please. LAMBIE: Thank you. In recent months, Ms Lambie, elected to a six-year term in the Senate last year, has waded into a number of controversial issues including the debate surrounding the burqa and Australia's preparedness for the Ebola virus . Last week, Ms Lambie told Daily Mail Australia the 'If you don't love it, leave' slogan on this controversial singlet sold at Woolworths did not go far enough . 'Senator, our men and women are as protected as anyone else in the country is,' Vice Admiral Griggs said. Ebola has been a pet topic for Ms Lambie in recent weeks. Last Friday, Ms Lambie proposed the government set up 'M.A.S.H. style' mobile field hospitals to fight Ebola as part of a virus-fighting 'action plan'. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), around 10,000 people could die of the virus each week if it is not brought under control. More than 4500 people have died in the three worst hit West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, WHO figures said. While there have been a number of scares at Australian hospitals in recent months - including the case of volunteer Red Cross nurse Sue Ellen Kovack - no Australian has reported an infection.","Senator Lambie asks defence chiefs if the nation is at risk from Ebola infected 'suicide agents'

"In August 1978, 15-year-old Barbara Nantais was found strangled to death, mutilated with a knife and with a fistful of wet sand stuffed down her throat on a beach in San Diego. Six years later, Claire Hough, age 14, was discovered murdered on the same stretch of beach and suffering roughly the same injuries to her body as Nantias. Both murders languished in the cold-case file for more than 30 years until this month, when police used DNA evidence to link two men to Hough's killing. Murder mystery: Barbara Nantais, 15, was killed and mutilated at a San Diego beach in August 1978 . Striking similarities: Six years after the slaying of Barbara Nantais (left), 14-year-old Claire Hough was found strangled and cut up with a knife on the same San Diego beach . Both suspects - convicted career criminal Ronald Clyde Tatro and retired police criminalist Kevin Charles Brown - have since passed away. Tatro was killed in an apparent boating accident in 2011, and Brown committed suicide last week by hanging himself in Cuyamaca State Park. But police said they have not found any evidence to link either man to Barbara Nantais' killing, which remains unsolved. The 15-year-old was found naked, beaten and strangled near lifeguard tower No. 7 at Torrey Pines State Beach on the morning of August 13, 1978. One of her nipples was cut open and sand was crammed into her mouth. Nantais and her 17-year-old boyfriend, both from Long Beach, were camping on the beach when they were attacked. Jim Alt, now 54 years old, has said he was knocked unconscious with a rock and a log from a firepit while he and his girlfriend were sleeping in their zipped up bags. The 15-year-old was found naked, beaten and strangled near lifeguard tower No. 7 at Torrey Pines State Beach on the morning of August 13, 1978 . Grisly crime: One of her nipples was cut open and sand was crammed into her mouth . Alt has never been considered a suspect in the case. He was found near Barbara's body with a serious head wound that left him slipping in and out of consciousness. Passers-by discovered Nantais' mutilated body lying on the sand. Naked and spread-eagled, the killer had cut into the circumference of her nipple with a knife, according to the autopsy report. Six years later, Claire Hough, from Rhode Island, was visiting her grandparents in Del Mar Heights when she turned up dead on Torrey Pines State Beach on the morning of August 23, 1984. Lead: Retired San Diego criminologist Kevin Charles Brown, 62, had been questioned over Hough's killing and was facing an arrest when he killed himself . The teenager was discovered by a local resident lying on a white towel, her left breast sheared off with a knife, and her body and face bruised and cut. A pair of jeans she had on were torn open and pulled down. Autopsy reports showed that both Hough and Nantais suffered injuries consistent with sexual assault, but no semen was found on their bodies, reported U-T San Diego. The striking similarities between the two cases have been gnawing at investigators and the girls' families for decades until in 1995 the FBI confirmed that both Barbara and Claire were likely killed by the same person. But Claire Hough's parents had their own suspect in mind. Samuel and Penelope Hough's suspicions fell on Wallace Howard Wheeler, the man who found the 14-year-old's mutilated body on the beach and called police. Before the Houghs had a chance to seek him out, Wheeler approached them himself, rambling about his supposed psychic abilities and claiming he had seen in a vision that an angelic girl would be killed by two men. Every week for more than a month after their encounter, Wheeler peppered the Houghs with 'bizarre' letters. The girl's parents raised the alarm about Wheeler, but police quickly determined that he had nothing to do with Claire's slaying. In 1988, four years after the murder, Wheeler committed suicide by jumping from the balcony of his 13th-floor apartment. His daughter said he had mental problems and had not been taking his medication, according to the newspaper. A break in Claire Hough's murder came last week when DNA evidence linked retired criminalist Kevin Charles Brown, 62, to the cold case. As police were preparing to arrest Brown, he was found dead. Brown had been interviewed in connection with the crime before his apparent suicide, UT San Diego reported. Crime scene: Archive footage above shows the beach where Claire Hough and Barbara Nantais were found dead six years apart . New evidence: Modern investigative techniques have linked Brown's DNA to the murder. Pictured above are police investigating in 1984 . Crime scene investigator: Brown was a criminalist with San Diego police for 20 years. He is pictured here at a crime scene in 1991. He retired in 2002 . San Diego police, which employed Brown between 1982 and 2002, have said he never had anything to do with investigating Claire's case. Other suspect: Ronald Tatro was also linked to the murder. He died in 2011 . A second suspect in the case, convicted criminal Ronald Tatro, died in Tennesse in a boating accident three years ago. Brown's widow has vehemently denied that he had anything to do with Claire's murder and suggested that his DNA could have become mixed with the evidence sample because he worked in the same lab. He had been questioned several times over the death, Channel 10 News reported, and preparations were being made to take him into custody. Rebecca Brown said: 'The police have hounded my husband all year, and he ended up having a nervous breakdown and killed himself. 'They kept hounding him on something he didn’t do. He’s a good, kind, sweet, gentle man.' The police department has dismissed the notion that accidental contamination could be the reason for Brown's DNA being present. As for Barbara Nantais' murder, both Tatro and Brown had alibis. In August 1978, Tatro was was serving time in prison for kidnapping and raping a young woman in Arkansas. He had been sentenced to 40 years, but for an unexplained reason was released after only eight years. Brown's lawyer said that the criminologist was working in New Mexico at the time of the teenager's killing in San Diego.","Barbara Nantais, 15, was found strangled and mutilated at Torrey Pine State Beach in San Diego in August 1978 .

"A council is to be forced to repay thousands of parking fines it handed out over six years after a legal blunder saw around 7,000 tickets declared null and void. Serious errors were uncovered in Calderdale Council's legal paperwork, meaning it hasn't had the right to enforce fines for on-street parking breaches in Halifax town centre since 2008. The blunder was uncovered after a parking ticket was successfully challenged by a member of the public, and is expected to cost the council around half a million pounds as thousands motorists claim refunds. Scroll down for video . Around 7,000 motorists are thought to be eligible for refunds after a local council in Yorkshire bungled legal paperwork related to parking tickets . All affected parking charges have now been suspended while the council try to obtain an emergency legal order. The local authority is expected to miss out on around £200,000 in lost revenue while the issue is resolved and will have to hand back at least the same amount for wrongly imposed fines and unnecessarily bought tickets. The blunder has caused anger amongst local residents, who claim strict parking enforcement in the town centre has hit local businesses. Andy Thorpe told the Halifax Courier: 'My son was half an hour late back to his car and it was towed away and we had to pay £180 to get it back. 'He's also been done for being 10 or 15 minutes late back and he had to pay, or actually I had to pay because I'm his dad, £30. It is utterly disgusting the price of the charging that they've been doing.' The council has had to set up a special phone line as residents flood it with calls about refunds for tickets and fines. Council leader Stephen Baines said: 'The decision was made because it became clear that our traffic regulation orders for these areas cannot be legally enforced. 'There have been some errors in all the background information on these orders - they were small errors, but they were sufficient to make them unenforceable. 'This doesn't affect the car parks, loading bays, double yellow lines or disabled bays, because they're under a different order. 'We are taking steps to make sure all of the parking charges are suspended and no tickets will be issued for these spaces.' Calderdale Council have been forced to suspend parking restrictions in Halifax town centre after the error, meaning they will miss out on an estimated £200,000 in lost revenue . Council officials are now looking into to whether the issue could affect parking fines and charges in other streets in the area. The council will still issue Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) where cars are parked on yellow lines, in loading bays, in disabled bays and in car parks. There is a fine of £70 for the more serious parking offences like parking on double yellow lines. This is reduced to £35 if paid within 14 days . There is also a fine of £50 for offences like not displaying a parking ticket, which is reduced to £25 if paid within 14 days. Calderdale Council's Director of Economy and Environment, Ian Gray said: 'Traffic regulation orders are highly technical documents and this issue only came to light after one of our orders was challenged. 'When we checked the details it became clear that there were errors within the orders, which date back to 2008. The council is expected to have to re-pay a further £200,000 to drivers who were wrongly given a parking ticket . He added:'When we realised there was a problem we immediately stopped issuing penalty charge notices in the affected areas. 'We are also switching off the parking meters in those streets so that they can no longer accept payments - we expect that this work will be completed by 8 October 2014.' 'The charges for on-street pay and display parking, and for some residents' parking in these areas have now been temporarily suspended. 'As the old order was unenforceable, drivers who have received a PCN after parking in the affected streets will be able to request a refund. We will write directly to all affected residents in Skircoat. 'We are now checking that the TROs which cover other areas of Calderdale are correct. 'We have started to review these but as they are very detailed, complex documents it will take several months for us to complete this assessment. As soon as we have more information we will make this public.' What happened? The council lost an appeal against a parking charge notice (PCN) and uncovered a number of errors in the notices for two areas; Skircoat and Halifax town centre. Who can claim money back? Those who were issued with a PCN or bought a pay and display ticket in one of the affected streets. What do they have to do? Anyone with a fine will have to provide their registration number and PCN number or evidence of the fine such as a receipt or bank statement. Those who paid for a parking need to provide a valid original pay and display ticket. Photocopies are not being accepted. How long will it take people to get their money back? The council says it will pay refunds within 90 days of a claim being verified. How are the council paying for the refunds and lost revenue? Local officials say they will dip into an emergency fund to cover the costs.","Error in small print meant six years worth of parking tickets are not valid .

"This is the moment a man climbed out of a sidewalk grate and hurled a smoke bomb into a crowded New York restaurant last night. Dressed in a baseball cap and a stars-and-stripes t shirt, the white blond man is captured on CCTV pulling himself onto the street clutching the firework in his right hand - before flinging it into celebrity hot spot Bar Pitti. He then disappears from sight. Actress Rose McGowan was among the dozens of diners seen fleeing the Greenwich Village restaurant at around 5.45pm as red smoke flooded the patio area. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Revealed: This is the young blond white man who jumped out of a sidewalk grate with a smoke bomb last night . Attack: Here the moment he hurled the makeshift firework into celebrity hot spot Bar Pitti is captured on CCTV . The grate is used as an emergency exit for subway passengers. It is thought that the suspect would have had to enter the subway at either Spring Street or W 4th station, before walking through a series of tunnels to access the grate and carry out the attack. Officials are now hunting for a white blond male around 20 years old. Panic: Diners, including actress Rose McGowan, fled the patio as red smoke flooded the area at 5.45pm . Disappeared: The assailant then disappeared - seemingly down the grate - as police were called to the scene . Attack: A man climbed out of a sidewalk grate, threw a smoke bomb into Bar Pitti in West Village, New York, and fled back down the grate, police said this evening.

Expressing her shock: The 41-year-old, who initially thought two smoke bombs had been thrown, tweeted: 'Someone just threw two smoke bombs into the restaurant I was eating in. Eyes are burning. #NYCWHAT' Despite landing on an outdoor table, the explosive which sent thick red smoke into the air, did not injure anyone, according to Eyewitness News. It was removed from the venue by a waiter. McGowan, 41, who initially thought two smoke bombs had been thrown, took to Twitter to express her shock just minutes after the bizarre attack.

"Like plenty of 40-something Australian men, Gus Worland spent Boxing Day last year watching the Test match over beers with his best mate. But unlike most, Worland's best friend is Hollywood A-lister Hugh Jackman. After a long day of drinking, the pair's conversation turned to Worland's health – or lack thereof. Scroll down for video . Radio host Gus Worland, pictured in April (left) and August (right), has been training for the New York Marathon . His best friend of 40 years Hugh Jackman challenged him to change his lifestyle and film it for a TV show . 'The next morning Jacko said ""We had a brilliant time but it looks like you've been doing those days more often than you should"",' Worland told Daily Mail Australia. 'Little did I know he'd had a chat with my wife and she had said to him perhaps if you get the right moment you should bring that up.' It was a difficult discussion for the friends of 40 years but Worland knew that Jackman was right. The 45-year-old, who hosts Triple M breakfast radio as part of the Grill Team, was a smoker, a drinker and he tipped the scales at over 140kg. For years he had tried various fad diets and weight loss pills but nothing had stuck. So Worland and Jackman, 46, came up with the idea to change Worland's lifestyle and turn it into a TV show in the process. 'We thought we might be able to show people you can lose weight through fun and a challenge rather than just a personal trainer yelling at you,' he said. Jackman (left circle) and Worland (right circle) played together in the Bannockburn Rovers Under  7's . Worland, who is a breakfast radio host on Triple M, lost 30kg in six months . 'And I'm probably more likely to keep weight off if we do it our way than just have fun.' They signed a contract with Foxtel, who the pair had previous worked with on the An Aussie Goes series. Three separate seasons followed Worland as he immersed himself with cricket fans in England, India and the West Indies – all after a challenge from Jackman. Fast forward more than six months and Worland has lost 30kg and is preparing to fly to the US to run in the New York City Marathon this Sunday. The first episode of Gus Worland: Marathon Man will air next Thursday November 6. But Worland, who lives with his family on Sydney's Northern Beaches, says it has been a lot of effort to get this point. The first thing he tackled was his smoking addiction, having his last cigarette on December 31 last year. The second thing he had to change was his diet. Before he started training for the marathon, his daily food intake was massive. 'For breakfast I'd have eggs and bacon with lots of toast, then mid-morning I'd have either bakery food – like a couple of cakes or sausage rolls - or I'd grab two cheeseburgers from Maccas,' he said. 'Then I'd have some sort of lunch like a chicken schnitzel roll maybe with some chips. 'In the afternoon I'd have a finger bun when I picked up the kids from school. 'Dinner would be a normal dinner of protein with veggies and salad, then later I'd have a cup of tea and a couple of rows of choccy.' But he says that is the 'old Gus'. Now he has cut out sugar and processed food, and started eating more fruit and vegetables. He still has bacon and eggs for breakfast, but he's swapped the toast for avocado or tomato. Worland training on the Coogee steps in Sydney in April, when he first started his weight loss regimen . The first episode of Gus Worland: Marathon Man will air next Thursday November 6 on Foxtel . Mid-morning he has a piece of fruit, followed by a chicken wrap or chicken salad for lunch. He has another piece of fruit in the afternoon followed by a dinner of fish or chicken with salad and veggies. And he's stopped having an after dinner snack. Worland says he's also cut down on alcohol. 'Basically I've stopped the grog, I might have a couple of beers a week,' he said. 'Before that the old Gus would have had a good filling of grog - I reckon probably one big lunch a week because of radio industry, a couple of bottles of wine and a case of beer.' Since filming started in April, Worland has also committed to a five-day-a-week exercise regimen with the help of personal trainer and nutritionist Brad Pamp. Worland and family (from left: son Jack, daughter Ella, wife Vicki and daughter Abi)  at Ayers Rock in July . Worland and wife Vicki took part in the Outback Half Marathon at Ayers Rock . 'For the first eight weeks all I did was walk, starting at 20 minutes the first week and building up to two hours,' he said. 'At the end of eight weeks I started walking for four minutes, running for one, and I'd do that for an hour. He slowly increased the number of minutes he was running until he could run for five minutes without needing a walking break. After three months of training he completed a 5km run. After four months he ran 10km. Three months in he ran a half marathon. The whole time Jackman has been talking to Worland over phone, email and Skype and encouraging him to push harder with his training. 'We talk every day pretty much – it's perfect timing as I'm driving to work because it's early afternoon New York time,' Worland said. Gus Worland, pictured training on the Coogee steps in April, will run the New York City Marathon this Sunday . 'He just fills me in on what is going on in his life, and keeps giving advice like ""Your kids are watching you, if you do this you'll set such a great example.""' Worland and Jackman have been best friends ever since they met at Pymble Public School on Sydney's Upper North Shore in the 1970s. 'The first day of school I held his hand walking into the class room,' Worland said. 'He's more like a brother to me – his mum left the family home at a reasonably young age and his dad had five kids and he needed people to look after various kids at different times. 'Jacko seemed to come to our place and stay for three or four months at a time.' Since then they've been best men at each other's weddings, godfathers for each other's children and Jackman will be there when Worland runs the Marathon in New York this Sunday. Worland will also be cheered on by his wife Vicky and their three children - Jack, 14, Ella, 13 and Abi, 11 – who have been a great source of support throughout his training. Worland (pictured in early October) is confident he will be able to keep up his new, healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling . Worland has mixed feelings about the Marathon now it is less than a week away. 'I'm anxious and excited – I don't want to let anyone down,' he said. 'But I'm so proud and so confident I can do it.' Worland is also confident that he will be able to keep up his new, healthy lifestyle after the cameras stop rolling. 'The underlying thing is I'm moving and I'm eating better and if you do that you'll be feeling better,' he said. 'My family and my mates won't let me give up, and my body now rejects crappy food, it really does. 'I've said that in the past but I think this time I might have cracked it.'

"Two men who tried to smuggle almost half a ton of heroin into the UK by packing it into a specially-designed Jaguar have been jailed. Nearly £40million worth of the Class A drug was found hidden in the luxury vehicle when it was searched by officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) last year. Investigators found 230kg of the 'high-purity' drug crammed into almost every available space in the car, including the rear seats, dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Packed: The packets of heroin pictured outside the specially-adapted Jaguar which was searched last year . Jailed: Noman Qureshi  of Bradford, West Yorkshire (right), was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan of Luton, Bedfordshire (left) was given an 18-year sentence. Police said they were part of an international crime group . Hidden: The Class A drug was packed into the boot (pictured), dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Even the car's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul . Even the car's electrics had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul. Noman Qureshi, 32, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan, 35, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was given an 18-year sentence after being found guilty of conspiracies to import and supply heroin. Police said that they were part of an international crime group who were planning to import the heroin, which, if cut and sold, would have had an estimated street value of £37.2million. Unaware that they were being watched by the NCA, Qureshi drove the car from his home to Luton to pick up Khan before travelling to Essex, east London in December last year. The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was due to be delivered to a repairer in north London but Qureshi called the delivery driver and told him to take it to a garage in Dagenham instead. NCA investigators watched as the car arrived at the garage during the early hours of December 7. Discovered: black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats, removed by police . Revealed: A scan taken of the car shows darkened patches where the drugs were stored in the Jaguar . Haul: If cut and sold, the drugs, pictured in packets, would have had an estimated street value of £37.2 million . Adapted: NCA investigators watched as the car (pictured) arrived at the garage during the early hours of December 7. It was seized from the garage forecourt and searched by officers . Qureshi and Khan left the scene but were arrested later that morning as they drove through Luton. The Jaguar was seized from the garage forecourt. Specialist Border Force search officers found 316 packages of heroin with a total weight of 507lb (230kg). After the hearing, NCA branch commander David Norris said: 'These men were part of an international crime group planning to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK. 'It was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin. Crucial parts of the vehicle, like electrics, had been removed to create more room. 'But NCA investigators were one step ahead and managed to prevent these harmful drugs making it on to the streets.' Another man, Mohammed Safder, 45, from East Ham, east London, was found not guilty of the same offences.","Officers found 230kg of 'high-purity' heroin packed in the luxury vehicle .

"If a tough weights class has left you with sore muscles, you might want to relax on the sofa. But moving around will stop the soreness more than resting, doctors have said. Resting, using ice packs, anti-inflammatory drugs and and painkillers like ibuprofen actually delay a person's recovery from exercise rather than speeding it up, says the doctor who came up with a well-known technique for treating minor injuries 36 years ago. Dr Gabe Mirkin came up with the RICE acronym, the most popular technique for recovering from muscle soreness, pain and injuries in 1978. Moving around will help muscles recover after intense exercise more than resting, doctors have said . RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation and describes the process he formerly recommended for treating minor injuries. This involved resting the injured muscle, putting an ice pack on it followed by a compression bandage and then elevating the muscle to reduce swelling. Now he has warned that the 'rest' and 'ice' elements should be scrapped as they could actually slow down the healing of sore muscles. Writing on his blog, he said: 'Coaches have used my ""RICE"" guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping.' He added that athletes can begin moving a day after their injury, if it is a minor injury like muscle soreness. He said: 'With minor injuries, you can usually begin rehabilitation the next day. You can move and use the injured part as long as the movement does not increase the pain and discomfort. 'Get back to your sport as soon as you can do so without pain.' His advice comes as new recommendations from the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) advise that heat patches and ice packs could actually harm patients and stall their recovery. These remedies 'discourage patients from becoming active', which makes the time it takes for them to recover longer, and increases the risk of eventually needing injections or surgery, the recommendations said. Muscle soreness is caused because muscles become damaged after intense exercise. To heal damaged muscles, the body's immune system sends inflammatory cells and proteins to the tissue to promote healing. The inflammatory cells - called macrophages - release a hormone called Insulin-like growth Factor (IGF-1) into the damaged tissues, which helps muscles and other injured parts to heal. Ice packs could delay muscles from healing as they constrict blood flow to the injury, doctors advised . But Dr Mirkin says that applying ice to reduce swelling actually delays healing by preventing the body from releasing IGF-1. Applying ice to damaged tissue causes blood vessels to constrict and shut off the blood flow that brings in the macrophages that will heal the muscles. Dr Mirkin added that this shutting off the blood flow can cause the tissue to die and can even cause permanent nerve damage. A previous review also found that using an ice pack might reduce pain but it also interferes with the athlete's strength, speed, endurance and coordination. Dr Mirkin said that anti-inflammatory medicines like cortisone and pain-relieving medicines like ibuprofen, also reduce's the body's immune response and so will also delay muscles from healing. Dr David Nieman, a professor at Appalachian State University told Outside Online magazine that people who take ibuprofen regularly have some cell damage, especially in their colon. 'That allows bacteria to escape in small amounts into the blood stream, augmenting the inflammatory response' he said. He advised that the best way to avoid sore muscles is to eat properly; preferably 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrate an hour, or half a banana every 15 to 30 minutes. He added that eating plenty of fruits and vegetables can help the speed up the healing process ad they contain flavonoids which protect the body against inflammation. He said: 'Tissues with high levels of flavonoids can help the body protect against the inflammation and oxidative stress all of us go through all of the time just being living, breathing humans. 'It'll help make your body's natural defenses a bit better.'","Moving around will aid recovery of muscles more than resting, doctors say .
Dr Gabe Mirkin came up with RICE technique for treating injuries in 1978 .
RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation .
Now, he says that resting muscles or using ice packs delays recovery .
This is because ice causes blood vessels near to the injury to constrict .
That stops the  flow of cells promoting healing into the muscle .
Anti-inflammatory drugs and painkillers like ibruprofen also delay healing ."
"An exhibition by Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei has transformed the former island prison of Alcatraz into a tribute to the world's political prisoners - some famous and some forgotten.

"David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was five but as now found out he had a congenital deformity and has finally been treated . A man who has lived his whole life believing he has cerebral palsy after being diagnosed as a child has discovered more than 50 years later that he never had the condition. David Hayes, 58, from Acomb, North Yorkshire, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was just five years old and has spent his life struggling to walk and using wheelchairs. It was only when his son, Philip, 31, started feeling pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago that doctors quickly realised the condition may be a congenital deformity. Now, almost half a century after he was first diagnosed, Mr Hayes has undergone knee and hip replacements , as well as an operation on his shoulder ball and socket, which has left him completely pain free. Mr Hayes, the former national vice chairman of charity Scope, said: 'I couldn't walk until I was six and it was always very painful. I was sent to a special school as they thought I would never really be able to do anything. 'When I was eight they transferred me to mainstream school because they realised my intelligence appeared to be normal. 'I never let the condition I thought I had hold me back but I accepted that I would always be in pain and there was no cure. 'To find out that the condition I actually had could be treated was a dream come true.' The father of two, who also has a daughter called Anne-Marie, said he owed a lot to the orthopaedic teams from York District Hospital who have operated on him over the last 12 weeks. He said: 'I have two children and my son started having a pain in his left hip every winter. 'After that it was obvious to doctors that it might be a congenital condition that I had passed down to him. They then realised it was operable.' He said he now feels like the Six Million Dollar Man - the fictional television character who was given bionic implants - after the operations allowed him to walk without pain for the first time in his life. He said: 'When I was a child I used to watch the programme, the Six Million Dollar Man, and I thought why they couldn't do that for me so I could walk? That's come true. 'The NHS has done that for me. There's a lot of knocking of the NHS but these were risky operations and for them all to be successful is remarkable.' The father of two only found out he had a congenital deformity as opposed to cerebral palsy when his son Philip, 31, started suffering similar problems five years ago and doctors realised it could be a genetic issue . Over the last 12 weeks, Mr Hayes has undergone a number of operations, including a hip and knee replacement, at York District Hospital (pictured) and can now walk completely pain-free for the first time . David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy - a neurological condition which affects movement and co-ordination – when he was aged five. He couldn’t walk until he was aged six and as he grew older he struggled to walk unaided and relied heavily on wheelchairs. He was in a lot of pain and didn’t doubt his diagnosis as symptoms of cerebral palsy include muscle stiffness and weakness, balance and co-ordination problems and uncontrolled body movements - all issues he was suffering with. There is no cure for the condition so Mr Hayes was forced to live with the diagnosis. However, when his son Philip, 31, started suffering from pain in his hip during cold weather five years ago, doctors realised the pair could be suffering from the same condition. After ruling out that Philip was suffering from cerebral palsy, medics started to investigate his symptoms and realised he was suffering from a congenital deformity passed down from his father. Congenital anomalies, which can result in long-term disabilities, are wide-ranging and in some cases – like the Hayes - can cause weak muscle tone and developmental delay. During adulthood, individuals with a congenital deformity experience reduced sensation and weakness in their arms and legs, an abnormal curvature of the spine, impaired muscle co-ordination, and joint deformities. David experienced these symptoms as a child but it wasn't until his son was genetically-tested that doctors realised they both shared the gene and that his symptom was hereditary instead of cerebral palsy. Having spent 15 years on the board of directors for Scope and four as national vice chair, Mr Hayes retired in 2007 due to his medical situation. He also previously chaired North Yorkshire Police Independent Advice Group and now hopes to return to work to help 'pay the NHS back'. His desire to return to work has seen him write to every police force in the country to inquire about employment opportunities. He said: 'I want to work to pay the NHS back. What's the point in having all this done and sitting at home?'","David Hayes, 58, was told he had cerebral palsy when he was five years old .

"Police shifted their search and a northeastern Pennsylvania school district tightened security Monday after the fugitive suspect in a deadly police ambush was possibly spotted near one of its campuses. A woman out for a walk Friday night saw a rifle-toting man with a mud-covered face near Pocono Mountain East High School in Swiftwater. State police believe the man was Eric Frein, 31, who has eluded capture despite an intense month-long manhunt in the Pocono Mountains. Authorities had been searching for Frein in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, but shifted their primary search area five or six miles to the southwest after Friday night's sighting. A Pennsylvania State Trooper patrols along a closed section of Lower Swiftwater Road on Saturday, October 18, 2014, during a massive manhunt for killer Eric Frein . Manhunt: An armed state trooper searches the woods near Lower Swiftwater Road . FBI agents in bulletproof vests and helmets prepare to patrol the woods in Swiftwater . Lt. Col. George Bivens said police have put a 'tremendous amount of pressure on him' and likely forced him to move. The high school — Frein's alma mater — and all other schools in the Pocono Mountain School District were open Monday, but took extra precautions in light of the fugitive's sighting. Additional officers from the Pocono Mountain Regional Police Department were stationed at the district's Swiftwater campus to supplement the lone police officer who normally patrols that location, which, in addition to the high school, includes a junior high and elementary school. Pennsylvania State Police did not recommend that schools close, district spokeswoman Wendy Frable said. 'We would not bring the students in if we did not have reassurance from police they felt the campus was safe,' she said Monday. The district will not have attendance figures until Monday afternoon, but anticipates that some students will have stayed home, she said. Prepared: Frein (right) has been described as a survivalist and 'gun enthusiast' with a grudge against law enforcement officials . Ambushed: Frein is accused of murdering Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Bryon Dickson (left) and the shooting of Trooper Alex Douglass September 12 . Bivens said Saturday that authorities do not make a recommendation about whether to close schools, but provide as much information as possible to school officials so they can make their own decision. Schools closed for several days early in the search because state police had closed roads and buses were unable to provide transportation. Frein, 31, is charged with opening fire outside the Blooming Grove state police barracks on September 12, killing State Trooper Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. State police have said they believe the self-taught survivalist and gun enthusiast has a hatred of law enforcement and wants to target police, not the general public. Marked man: Frein, 31, was reportedly spotted next to a Pennsylvania school last Friday . Cause for concern: A concerned-looking woman talks with a Pennsylvania State Trooper, as a section of Lower Swiftwater Road was closed on Saturday . State police said Monday that blood reportedly found at two homes in the search area is not linked to Frein. DNA testing ruled out any link to Frein in blood droplets found on a covered porch in the area. Material found on a back door at a second home near the first turned out not to be human blood. Police believe Frein could be breaking into vacant cabins or vacation homes to look for food or take shelter from the elements.","Police are focusing their search on area near Pocono Mountain East High School in Swiftwater .

"Britain now lags behind Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Latvia in gender equality. File picture . Britain has dropped behind developing countries in a global report on gender equality. In the Global Gender Gap Report, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), Britain has dropped eight spots to 26th place - lagging behind Latvia, Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Nicaragua. The report, which covered 142 countries, looked at how nations distribute access to healthcare, education, political participation and resources and opportunities between women and men. The UK was ranked ninth in the first report in 2006 and has dropped through the ranking ever since. It is believed changes in income estimates are behind the fall. Just five of the FTSE 100 companies have women in the top spot. Ann Francke, the chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute, told the Guardian: 'The issue in the UK is that while there are more women in the workplace they tend to be in the lower level positions. 'The pay gap continues to be alarmingly large for men and women doing the same senior role.' The Nordic countries - Iceland, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark - were the most equal. They were joined by Nicaragua, Rwanda Ireland, the Philippines and Belgium in the top 10, while Yemen remained at the bottom of the chart for the ninth year in a row. The United States meanwhile climbed three spots from last year to 20th, after narrowing its wage gap and hiking the number of women in parliamentary and ministerial level positions. France catapulted from 45th to 16th place, also due to a narrowing wage gap but mainly thanks to increasing numbers of women in politics, including near-parity in the number of government ministers. With 49 per cent women ministers, France now has one of the highest ratios in the world. Among other large economies, Brazil stood at 71st place, Russia at 75th, China at 87th and India at 114, the report showed. The top ten countries in terms of gender equality, with the UK, at 26, in red . Almost all the countries had made progress towards closing the gap in access to healthcare, with 35 nations filling it completely, while 25 countries had shut the education access gap, the report showed. Even more than in the workplace, political participation lagged stubbornly behind, with women still accounting for just 21 percent of the world's decision makers, according to the report. Yet this was the area where most progress had been made in recent years. 'In the case of politics, globally, there are now 26 percent more female parliamentarians and 50 percent more female ministers than nine years ago,' said the report's lead author, Saadia Zahidi. 'These are far-reaching changes,' she said, stressing though that much remained to be done and that the 'pace of change must in some areas be accelerated'. French Minister for Equality of Territories and Housing Cecile Duflot. Nearly half of French ministers are female . The report also found inequality at work is not expected to be erased until 2095 and had barely narrowed in the past nine years. Since 2006, when the WEF first began issuing its annual Global Gender Gap Reports, women have seen their access to economic participation and opportunity inch up to 60 per cent of that of men's, from 56 per cent. 'Based on this trajectory, with all else remaining equal, it will take 81 years for the world to close this gap completely,' the WEF said in a statement. The world would be better served to speed up the process, according to WEF founder and chief Klaus Schwab. 'Achieving gender equality is obviously necessary for economic reasons. Only those economies who have full access to all their talent will remain competitive and will prosper,' he said.","Britain has dropped  to 26th place In the Global Gender Gap Report .

"Like millions of women across Britain, I will stop at virtually nothing if it promises to make me fitter faster. From toning footwear to vibrating dumbbells, Jazzercise and aqua-aerobics, you name it, I’ve tried it. And, as a busy mother-of-two, if it requires no effort on my part, so much the better. So, when I heard about a new, high-tech exercise regime, which simply required me to strap myself into a body suit that looks like something from RoboCop, plug in some electrodes and let science work its magic, it sounded like a dream come true. Scroll down for video . A new, high-tech exercise regime, which simply requires you to strap yourself into a body suit, plug in some electrodes and let science work its magic - it sounded like a dream come true . And if it’s good enough for Usain Bolt — not to mention the WAGs and models who frequent the exclusive West London gyms that are the first to offer it in the UK, before it rolls out nationwide — it’s good enough for me. E-Fit was first designed as a rehabilitation aid for elite athletes — top footballers Frank Lampard and Lionel Messi are fans — but has since garnered a reputation as a quick fix for weight-loss and improved muscle tone. This, in turn, has led to huge demand from normal women who want to get rid of cellulite and stubborn body fat. It uses Electrical Muscular Stimulation (EMS) technology to provide the equivalent of an hour’s workout in 20 minutes, giving your muscles electric shocks as you work out. Although you can’t see results straight away — it takes about four sessions — EMS apparently stimulates 90 per cent of your body’s main muscles every time you use it. Nadia Cohen with specially trained E-Fit expert Csaba Hegedus who travels the globe training people to use the system . The scientists behind it claim it can help with body-shaping, weight-loss, stamina and endurance, as well as improving posture and reducing back pain. The system also promises to stimulate your mood and sense of wellbeing — in fact, pretty much the only thing it won’t do is give you a massage afterwards. During a single session, the device works 350 different muscles, contracting them a total of 36,000 times, meaning they’re working up to ten times harder than during conventional exercise — ideal for busy women who don’t have enough time in their week to spend hours pumping away in the gym. Admittedly, it sounds oddly reminiscent of the Slendertone-style slimming belts that have been around since the Seventies — the same belts that led thousands of couch potatoes to believe they could get a six-pack just from sitting on the sofa and which were dismissed as ‘quackery’ by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The scientists behind it claim it can help with body-shaping, weight-loss, stamina and endurance, as well as improving posture and reducing back pain . It’s true the principles of EMS have been around for a while, but the technology has advanced and new research shows EMS can have a positive effect in conjunction with exercise. Sadly, you still can’t just sit on the sofa and expect miracles. Various studies confirm you can get serious results from this approach. In fact, the American Council On Exercise recently tested developments in equipment, and revealed that muscle strength and endurance improved over time in those who had used an EMS device. So, with all this in mind, I headed to one of the six gyms in the UK to offer E-Fit, and eagerly squeezed myself into the gymwear provided — a skin-tight T-shirt and three-quarter-length gym trousers, specially made from 95 per cent breathable cotton, so that nothing will stand in the way of the electrodes as they power through to your muscles. Then, it was on with the gear that contains the technology — a bulky, high-tech jacket and unflatteringly-padded shorts — with extra straps fastened around the biceps and calves. I smiled at specially trained E-Fit expert Csaba Hegedus as he pulled the straps tighter. How bad could it be? Csaba, who travels the globe training people to use the system, warned me that my muscles would be put through their paces, thanks to short, sharp electric shocks. It sounded a little extreme, but the list of benefits spurred me on, not to mention the fact I knew it would be over in 20 minutes. As he jabbed at the buttons on the shiny, silver keyboard attached to the suit by a series of wires, I began to feel a slight tingle through my body. ‘Crank it up!’ I chirruped with a thumbs-up, thinking of all the hours of gym-time I’d save. This ultra-modern system works by contracting the muscles, during which you basically clench your entire body while waiting for the pain to subside . I felt brave — this was easy. All I could feel were jabbing, pinprick sensations all over my body. It was rather strange, and certainly not nice, but by no means painful or uncomfortable. So, at my insistence, Csaba cranked it up. The scale goes from zero to 100. By the time it reached half capacity, I was a jibbering, juddering wreck as, every few seconds, electronic pulses seemed to sink beneath my skin, before trying to blast their way out to the surface. I couldn’t say aloud what I was thinking — because I was too breathless to do more than gasp. In the Sixties, Soviet sports scientists used EMS in the training of elite athletes . This ultra-modern system works by contracting the muscles, during which you basically clench your entire body while waiting for the pain to subside. Csaba kept reminding me of the importance of moving — this is designed to boost your workout, not replace it, so you can’t just let the machine take the strain. He led me through a gruelling regime of bicep curls with light weights, lunges, squats, running and jogging on the spot, before fast-paced sit-ups, abdominal crunches, cycling and scissoring my legs — each of the exercises accompanied by what felt like constant, static electric shocks. As he cranked up the intensity, I gritted my teeth as electrodes pulsed on to my skin, triggering my nerves to contract and relax the muscles. At £50 per session, E-Fit is not much more than a regular session with a posh personal trainer, and takes up far less of your day . As your body is rigid, even the simplest squat or lunge is a real effort. Performing strengthening and toning exercises while wired up to the machine apparently intensifies the way the muscles respond, forcing them to work twice as hard in the same time. Towards the end, I could feel my muscles were contracting involuntarily, even when Csaba switched the machine off. Was this normal? I asked. ‘Yes,’ Csaba reassured me. ‘It’s a sign it’s doing the job.’ The underlying muscle tissue is activated, too, which is what gives such a powerful sensation and makes you even more exhausted. By the end of the session, I collapsed, drenched in sweat, feeling as if I’d been through an hour of circuit training, not a 20-minute workout. At £50 per session, E-Fit is not much more than a regular session with a posh personal trainer, and takes up far less of your day. So, if you can endure the discomfort, this could be worth the effort. And if it cuts down my time in a sweaty gym, I could definitely be persuaded to return.

"Sarah-Jane Staszak, 40, woke up a quadriplegic after routine surgery for a a herniated disc in her back . Panic instantly set in when Sarah-Jane Staszak woke up in her hospital bed and found she couldn't move. The 40-year-old mother from Blackheath in Sydney's Blue Mountains had gone to the Royal North Shore Hospital in November last year to relieve the pressure from a herniated disc in her back that left her with intense nerve pain in her left arm. Mrs Staszak had damaged the disc while carrying some heavy ropes before an abseil and, after experiencing pain that she described as 'up there with child birth,' she signed herself up for a laminectomy - a common back surgery. 'When I woke up I had a registrar standing above me saying the surgery went well, but I couldn't move. He wanted me to wiggle my toes and I couldn't – I was paralysed from the C5 down,' Mrs Staszak told Daily Mail Australia. 'I couldn't lift my arms and obviously started to panic so they sedated me and took me to have an emergency MRI which is when they discovered there was a big haemorrhage on my spinal cord at the C5 vertebrae and that was causing damage to the nerves and obstructing all the signals from getting through.' The former outdoor recreation teacher at Tafe NSW spent the next six days in the intensive care unit, then another six weeks in hospital followed by seven months at a rehabilitation facility before she was released in August this year. The 40-year-old said the hardest thing about her condition is not being able to care for her five-year-old son Hamish . Hamish helps his mum during a hospital visit: Mrs Staszak has been left paralysed from the C5 vertebrae down . 'Initially I was in a lot of denial – they pumped me up on steroids thinking it would settle down and calm itself down, but it was certainly not a pleasant experience,' Mrs Staszak said. 'It was a bit slow,' she said of her rehabilitation, which consisted of an hour and a half of physiotherapy and an additional hour and a half of occupational therapy each day. 'I struggled with my mental health more than anything for the majority of the time, so it was difficult to get on to the physical rehab side of things. 'Now, I'm getting a little bit of movement in my legs and I'm able to stand with a standing frame but I suffer from the high end of tone and spasticity in my muscles – my body gets very rigid and I get a lot of spasms. The former outdoor recreation teacher was constantly skiing, rock climbing, abseiling and canyoning before the incident . She spent seven months at a rehabilitation facility and says she has regained a small amount of movement in her legs . The day after she was released from  rehabilitation, Mrs Staszak headed straight to the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales with her son and some friends where she rode on a fixed ski . 'I'm able to move my arms but also have a lot of tone and spasticity in my triceps which prevents them from bending and I have next to no hand function.' An avid adventurer who was constantly skiing, rock climbing, abseiling and canyoning and has cycled around the whole of Australia, Mrs Staszak said the hardest thing about her current condition is her inability to care for her five-year-old son Hamish. Describing him as a very active, supportive and helpful little boy whom she taught to ski at only two, Mrs Staszak said it was not possible for her to care for Hamish as she depends on carers and friends for their constant support. 'The biggest emotional trauma to deal with is the loss of a relationship and all things I used to be able to do with him,' she said of her son, whom she taught to ski when he was only two years old . Mrs Staszak is determined to make the most of her life. She is able to move her arms, but due to the tone and spasticity in her triceps, is not able to bend them . 'The biggest emotional trauma to deal with is the loss of a relationship and all things I used to be able to do with him,' she said. With no way of ascertaining how much improvement there will be in her ability to move independently, she is trying to raise $300,000 to attend an intensive spinal rehabilitation program in December that she says is only available in the United States.

Alpha News in St Helens, Lancashire has apologised after a worker refused to sell cigarettes to a soldier because he was in uniform. A notice has since been put up in the shop claiming the incident was down to a mistake . The 27-year-old sapper, who is based at the Catterick Garrison, was taking part in a recruitment day in the area when the incident happened. He said: 'I just went into the shop with a work colleague to buy cigarettes. We were both in uniform and when I asked for them, he refused to serve me. 'I was taken aback and a bit confused as to why he was so determined not to sell us something as small as a pack of cigarettes. 'We'd never been in there before so I asked him why and he said it was because we were in military uniform. I thought I'd heard him wrong when he first said it. 'To be honest I was outraged, I've never been refused anything just because I'm a soldier, but he was adamant.' He added: 'I didn't want to make a scene, I'm not like that, so we just left feeling very confused.' Army chiefs initially criticised the newsagent's actions, but have since said the incident should not be used as an excuse for trouble. A MoD spokesman said: 'The Army is aware of an incident in which it appears two of our soldiers were refused service in a newsagent due to them being in uniform. 'This appears to be the result of a genuine misunderstanding for which the business has apologised. 'The Army condemns anyone who is seeking to exploit this minor incident for their own divisive ends.' Alpha News was shut yesterday following protests by locals angry about the soldiers' treatment. Protests have since been held outside the shop in response to the two soldiers' treatment . A sign put up in the store states: 'We were under the impression that by law, we were not permitted to serve under 18s and army personal (sic) in uniforms cigarettes. 'This has been checked with trading standards and this is clearly not the case. 'We sincerely apologise to everyone for this misunderstanding and we regret any offence we may have caused.' London and Cambridge Properties, who run The Hardshaw Centre where the newsagents is based, added: 'We believe this was a genuine error and not the result of any form of discrimination.' Police have now been called in to investigate a number of comments online surrounding the affair. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'Police are monitoring the situation and the owner of the business is helping officers with their inquiries. 'Police are also aware of offensive and threatening comments being posted on social media network sites towards this business. 'Although police have not received a report of complaint from the shop, a full investigation into the wider comments being made is underway.'","Soldier went into shop for cigarettes during recruitment day in St Helens .

"Revealed: Jane Austen's will was among more than a million published online today . With the Bennett sisters among her most famous creations, it comes as no surprise that Jane Austen left most of her worldly assets to her own sibling, according to her will published online today. The novelist's last request was for her 'dearest' sister Cassandra to receive all of her possessions, spare the cost of her funeral, £50 - the equivalent of £1,700 in today's money - to her brother Henry and another £50 to his cook. Austen's will was among a collection of thousands, including those of William Shakespeare and Sir Francis Drake, which were published online for the first time today. Just like her characters Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Austen and Cassandra were extremely close, so much so that the writer left the majority of her estate, worth around £800 (more than £27,000 today), to her elder sister. During Austen's lifetime the pair wrote hundreds of letters to one another, and it is from these missives that historians were able to gather much of what is known about the author. Austen also left a sum of money to her brother Henry, who helped her to get her books published, and to his cook Madame Bigeon. The will was written just months before Austen's death in July 1817 following a long illness, believed to be Addison's disease, at the age of just 41. She wrote: 'I Jane Austen of the Parish of Chawton do by this my last Will & . Testament give and bequeath to my dearest Sister Cassandra Elizth every . thing of which I may die possessed, or which may be hereafter due to me, . subject to the payment of my Funeral Expences, & to a Legacy of £50 to my Brother Henry, & £50 to Mde Bigeon - which I request may . be paid as soon as convenient. 'And I appoint my said dear Sister the . Executrix of this my last Will & Testament.' The collection of wills, including Austen's, is the most comprehensive collection of its kind, covering 1384 to 1858, and . detailing the assets, occupation and the standard of living of the dead. Family ties: The tight-knit Bennett sisters, as portrayed in the 1995 BBC series, were among Jane Austen's most celebrated creations . Sisterly bond: Jane, played by Gillian Kearney (left) in The Real Jane Austen, and Cassandra (Lucy Cohu) were exceptionally close . According to his will, William Shakespeare left £150 (£14,400 today) to his daughter Judith in 1616, and famously decreed that his 'second best bed' should go to his wife Anne. However, historians believe that during Shakespeare's life time wealthy families would reserve their best bed for guests, meaning the gift was actually far more sentimental than at first glance. Under common law Anne also had a right to one third of his estate and to live their marital home for the rest of her life, which she did. Most of the playwright's possessions went to his daughter Susanna and her husband John Hall. Last request: William Shakespeare (left) left £150 to his daughter Judith, while Sir Francis Drake wanted £40 to go to the 'poor people' of Plymouth . Sir Francis Drake, who died of dysentery at the age of 55 in January 1596, left £40 (£4,000 today) to the 'poor people' of Plymouth. Miriam Silverman of Ancestry.co.uk, which is publishing the collection, said: 'These probate records provide fascinating insight into the final fortunes of some of our nation's most famous names, right down to who should get their bed. 'They are an incredibly valuable family history resource, covering a period in history from which few official documents remain.'","Novelist requested sister Cassandra received the bulk of her estate .

"A demolition company has decided that the best way to tear down buildings is one brick at a time - even when that building is a 45 metre high chimney. The firm, which knocks down buildings in the city of Taiyuan in north China, believes - so long as you are not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the bricks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives. Company boss Chung Lei explained that he is able to offer the firm's  demolition services at a knock-down price as his methods are so cheap. The Chinese demolition company believes that - so long as you're not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the brinks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives . He said: 'If you are looking at demolishing anything here you need to spend a fortune for the explosives and the license to use them, as well as demolition experts and all sorts of insurances against making any mistakes. 'In contrast you can also do it with one man and a hammer, it takes longer, but if there is no rush then you save a fortune. Lei says that he has a dozen workers knocking down buildings across the city in Shanxi Province and business is booming. The chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed, but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged. So Chung Lei's firm demolished them carefully and slowly . He added: 'In the latest job the staff tackled a stack of 45 metre high chimneys was able to offer a knockdown price compared to other demolition firms that offer to do it with explosives. 'The chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed, but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged. 'For an explosives expert that's a specialist job and it means a lot of money, for me I just need to get another couple of lads and had them a hammer and a rope, and come back in a month to collect the cash.'","The firm, which demolishes buildings in Taiyuan, says business is booming .

"Nasa has issued a 'reality check' on news yesterday that an asteroid could hit Earth on August 26, 2032. The Crimean Astrophysical Observatory . found the massive asteroid, called 2013 TV135, last weekend. The . international scientific community has already rated it as one of the . two most dangerous asteroids ever recorded. But Nasa said that the probability of an . Earth impact is only one in 63,000.That means astronomers are 99.9984 . per cent certain that it will miss Earth's orbit. A satellite which can spot asteroids in orbit between the sun and Earth will be launched into space next month by the European Space Agency . The newly discovered asteroid made a close approach to Earth on September 16, when it came within about 4.2 million miles (6.7 million kilometers) of the planet. It is initially estimated to be about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in size and its orbit carries it as far out as about three quarters of the distance to Jupiter's orbit and as close to the sun as Earth's orbit. As of October 14, asteroid 2013 TV135 is one of 10,332 near-Earth objects that have been discovered. Scientists have given it a danger . rating of 1 out of 10 on the Torino Scale. Only one other asteroid has . been given a rating of 1. The risk for all others has been judged 0, . negligible. This diagram shows the orbit of asteroid 2013 TV135 (in blue), which has just a one-in-63,000 chance of impacting Earth. Its risk to Earth will likely be further downgraded as scientists continue their investigations . Massive: The asteroid would strike with 2,500megatons of explosive force, enough to create damage within a 100,000 square-mile radius. (Blast location for illustrative purposes only) The effects of an impact would be catastrophic, especially if it struck a populated area. If 2013 TV135 were to collide with Earth, it is estimated to impact with 2,500 megatons of explosive power. The standard U.S. Minute Man II missiles carries a nuclear warhead with an explosive power of a little over 1 megaton. But Nasa said that with only a week of observations for an orbital period that spans almost four years, its future orbital path is 'still quite uncertain.' The space agency expects the object to be easily observable in the coming months, and will be using the Minor Planet Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts to improve calculations. The asteroid was discovered by astronomers at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and later confirmed by scientists as observatories in Spain, Italy and Siberia, Russia . It said the most likely result will be a dramatic reduction, or complete elimination, of any risk of Earth impact. ‘To . put it another way, that puts the current probability of no impact in . 2032 at about 99.998 per cent,’ said Don Yeomans, manager of Nasa’s . Near-Earth Object Programme Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in . Pasadena, California. ‘This . is a relatively new discovery. With more observations, I fully expect . we will be able to significantly reduce, or rule out entirely, any . impact probability for the foreseeable future.’ The asteroid is much smaller than the interplanetary object that hit Earth and killed off the dinosaurs 65million years ago. Currently, 2007 VK184 is believed to have the best chance of striking Earth. The 420-foot-wide object is said to have a 1 in 2700 chance of making contact with the planet in 2048. It is the only other asteroid to have a 1 rating on the Torino Scale.","Ukrainian astronomers claim giant asteroid could strike Earth in 2032 .

"A man who helped break up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last week found out just what it's like to be famous when video of his heroic deed went viral. The only problem is that many people thought that the man in question, Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was actually actor Paul Rudd. That is until Rudd's publicist revealed it was not the actor in the video, and someone who knows Kravit revealed his identity to the website Jezebel, leading to what Kravit describes as a 'pretty crazy day.' Scroll down for video . Hero: Ben Kravit (above) broke up an anti-gay assault at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday . Mistaken identity: When a video of his heroic deed went viral, many started to believe it was Paul Rudd seen in a plaid shirt (above circled in red) breaking up the fight . No help: Kravit (above circled in red) has said workers at the airport and TSA agents were no help and seemed to do little to stop the fight from happening . Now, everyone wants to know more about Kravit, a brand manager who works for Dr. Pepper Snapple and is engaged to a woman who is no doubt the envy of many these past few days. It all began last Thursday when video surfaced of a man berating a fellow traveler at the airport for wearing a pink shirt. Then, when the anti-gay attacker was approached by someone in a cowboy hat asking what was wrong, he screamed, 'Queers! That’s what I’m upset about. This fa**ot right here.' Seconds later he started to kick the man in the pink shirt, while also grabbing his hair and slapping at him. That is when Kravit, the man in the cowboy hat and a few other model citizens stepped in to subdue the aggressor and stop the assault. The whole time, a passenger named Andrew Kennedy was filming the melee, which has now been viewed close to four million times on YouTube. It wasn't me: A publicist for Rudd (above) revealed on Monday that it was not the actor in the video . America's sweetheart: Kravit (above with his fiancee) is a 28-year-old brand manager for Dr. Pepper Snapple . Good sport: Said Kravit (above with his fiancee) of the experience, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years' And that is when people watching the video started to wonder if Rudd, the star of films including Clueless, Anchorman and This Is 40 was responsible for taking down the homophobe. 'It seemed like every blog and website out there was running with it,' said Kravit. 'I have gotten the doppelgänger about [Rudd] before, but nothing like today. It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.' As for why he jumped to action, the young man said, 'I know people can get agitated at airports, but the incendiary and ignorant comments he was making were out of control. I was really surprised no police or security was there to separate the two, but then when it got physical my instinct was to stop and protect the victim.' He added, 'It was really unfortunate that people think such discriminatory things, let alone verbally and physically assault someone over it. I'm glad I, along with the others who helped out, were there to help the victim and nothing worse came of it.' Paul Rudd would be proud.","Ben Kravit was one of the men who took down a homophobic passenger at a Dallas airport during an anti-gay assault last Thursday .

"Charlotte Hornets forward Jeffery Taylor pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a domestic violence charge and admitted he pushed his girlfriend at a hotel in Michigan. The news came just hours before the Hornets were set to open the regular season against the Milwaukee Bucks. Taylor, 25, pleaded guilty in East Lansing District Court in Michigan to domestic abuse and malicious destruction of property charges. He faces up to 93 days in jail, but prosecutors say they won't oppose a diversion program that could clear Taylor's record if he complies with probation rules. Jeffery Taylor, who plays for the Charlotte Hornets, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a domestic violence charge and admitted he pushed his girlfriend at a hotel in Michigan . In exchange for the plea, prosecutors dropped an assault and battery charge involving an employee at a Marriot hotel in East Lansing. Authorities have said that Taylor attacked his girlfriend, a Michigan State University student, and the employee on September 25. In court on Wednesday, Taylor acknowledged that he pushed his girlfriend and damaged a wall at the hotel. Taylor, pictured in his mugshot last month, acknowledged in court on Wednesday he pushed his girlfriend and damaged a wall at the hotel . Taylor is from Norrkoping, Sweden, and lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. After his arrest, the Hornets banned Taylor from all team-related activities. The team declined comment about the plea on Wednesday afternoon. Hornets general manager Rich Cho said in September that the team would await the outcome of an NBA-led investigation before making a decision on Taylor's potential return to the team. Cho said on September 29 that it was 'appropriate' for the organization to act 'decisively and swiftly' in banning Taylor from all team-related activities. 'We take domestic violence as a very serious matter,' Cho said at the time. It's unclear if Taylor will face any punishment from the NBA. The Hornets went 43-39 last season and are hoping to make a deeper run in the playoffs. Taylor figured into the team's rotation as a backup. The 6-foot-7, 225-pound Taylor has been competing for the past two seasons with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for a starting spot at small forward. He played in 26 games with eight starts last season before suffering his injury in late December. As a rookie in 2012, he played in 77 games with 29 starts. He has averaged 6.6 points and 2.0 rebounds for his career. A flurry of cases, most notably those of NFL running backs Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice, has put a spotlight on athletes accused of domestic abuse and how sports leagues respond to such allegations and incidents.","Taylor, who plays for the Charlotte Hornets pleaded guilty in a Michigan court to domestic abuse and malicious destruction of property charges .

"It has been referred to as the black dog, the blues, or hitting rock bottom. However it is described, depression and anxiety affects between one and two million Australians in any given year. Often it is unexpected and can be severe, leaving those affected unprepared to cope with its onset. This was the case for ex-military and ex-intelligence officer Hayden Bradford, whose experience with depression has shown that it can affect anyone. In 2008, Hayden came home from work, staggered out of his car, and collapsed into the arms of his wife, who drove him immediately to the hospital. Ex-military and ex-intelligence officer Hayden Bradford, whose experience with depression has shown that it can affect anyone . 'I’d had the blues before, who hasn’t?,' said Hayden. 'They were no biggie. They would come and go, but this time they didn’t go. This time they stayed and bubbled in my blood, scorching parts of my brain, turning a part of it to ash, and messing with it in ways I can’t explain.' Hayden said he was thankful that his wife gave him no choice but to see a doctor. 'He diagnosed me with some form of head trauma,' said Hayden. 'I was given a script for valium and anti-depression medication plus a referral to a psychologist. From memory I took a couple of days off work as recommended by the GP – I spent those first days in bed not eating and mostly crying and trying to see my way of a black hole.' Hayden spent the next two months battling his depression, trialing medications and other coping mechanisms while working. In 2008, Hayden came home from work, staggered out of his car, and collapsed into the arms of his wife, who drove him immediately to the hospital. 'I’d had the blues before, who hasn’t?,' said Hayden. When he informed his company that he had been diagnosed, his commission-based work dwindled, and efforts he had invested into obtaining contracts was disregarded, as were interstate trips that he was scheduled to go on. After being advised by medical professionals that he needed to take leave from work, his situation was made all the worse by his employers reaction to the diagnosis. His employers flew a HR representative over to break the news that he would be let go. 'They said, we don't want someone with depression working for us,' Hayden said. 'That did wonders for my head,' he said sarcastically. 'Then they actually denied that I had told them about my condition.' Since that time, Hayden has discovered that he has a particularly acute form of depression known as 'severe chronic recurrent depressive disorder', and despite undergoing various treatments and receiving high dosages of medication has been diagnosed as treatment resistant. 'Basically, my neurons stopped talking to each other,' said Hayden. 'I dealt with specialist after specialist, all credible and highly regarded in their chosen field of medical expertise in the science of the brain. We changed medication, changed dosages, and still my brain remained confused, and messed up.' 'My brain has been CAT scanned, MRI scanned, poked, prodded, and there are so many drugs running through it - I should be declared illegal,' he said. His body's inability to respond positively to any form of treatment or medication left Hayden in a very precarious situation, who described his depression as leaving him suicidal at points. 'It isolates me, it comes with a loneliness, a darkness, a frightening pain, and unless you’re a sufferer, it is very hard to understand it,' Hayden said. But the ex-military man refused to give up and give in to the disease. 'In amongst dealing with psychiatrists, psychologists, and neurobehavioral specialists, I’ve had to reinvent myself.' 'It isolates me, it comes with a loneliness, a darkness, a frightening pain, and unless you’re a sufferer, it is very hard to understand it,' Hayden said. 'We all feel down in the dumps but if it's getting you really bad, just bite the bullet just get in front of the doctor. It doesn't matter how tough you might think you are, get help.' 'I didn’t want to be a couch potato type of person who does the old, “oh woe is me, please feel sorry for me, please have sympathy for me, because I’ve got depression,’ and so on,' said Hayden. 'I simply had to man up, and survive the best I could. I also have wife and two children to consider,' 'So my life just couldn’t be stopped or put on hold.' Hayden decided to think laterally, and use unusual methods to engage his brain in order to force it into activity. This included writing, as 'the forced thinking that comes with writing, helps you to focus on issues apart from your state of mind'. 'Writing exercises the the creative side of my brain, in that it keeps me thinking,' Hayden said. 'This process stimulates brain activity, which assists in retraining my memory cells.' The result of this writing is Hayden's book Travesty, a comical novel about an atheist who dies and is sent to Heaven. ‘Travesty’, is not a self-help book, nor does it have anything to do with depression,' said Hayden. 'It is simply a funny story. It's all I did it for, purely to make my head laugh.' While Hayden still suffers from depression, and experiencing low days, he is determined to put the conversation around depression into the public eye. 'I'll never be cured. I can go into really lowly places,' said Hayden. 'Anyone that suffers from this kind of thing has to be prepared to lose friends, and some people will look at you like you're not whole anymore.' 'There is still a lot of stigma attached to it, but it's really important if you are experiencing depression or anxiety to try and do something about it.' 'I manage as best I can with my strategies, but there are other people out there who might not have sought help. They might think  that there's no way out, and if they're not on medication and dont understand strategies they might commit suicide.' 'I feel sorry for these people, and it's so important to seek help,' Hayden said. Now, the ex-military man is urging all Australians to consider their mental health a priority. 'We all feel down in the dumps but if it's getting you really bad, just bite the bullet just get in front of the doctor. It doesn't matter how tough you might think you are, get help.' Mental Health Awareness Week runs from October 5-12 and is encouraging Australians to take ownership of their mental health and wellbeing.

"Murder victim: Kieran McGrath was shot at several times and hit once in the chest as he left the pub . Detectives investigating the murder of a 26-year-old man who collapsed outside a police station released a CCTV image today of the 'killers' on a stolen motorbike moments before he was shot. Kieran McGrath, of Clayton, Manchester, was shot at several times and hit once in the chest as he left the Sheldon Arms pub in nearby Ashton-under-Lyne on Saturday night. Mr McGrath managed to stagger into a white Audi A3 and drive about a mile to a police station in Ashton. He collapsed and died outside the front door despite efforts to revive him there. Greater Manchester Police have now arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of murder, and detectives have released an image of the motorbike used by the alleged hitmen. It was captured on CCTV at the rear of the pub where it allegedly parked up for about five minutes before riding to the front to carry out the hit. It shows a rider and a pillion passenger. After the shooting, the Suzuki sped towards the M60 and then two junctions clockwise before heading towards Blackley. It was later found burned out at Boggart Hole Clough park. Police are now trying to trace the driver and/or rider’s movements after abandoning the bike. Dectective Chief Inspector Terry Crompton said: ‘From our inquiries, we know the motorbike was stolen from the Stockport area in June, 2013, and believe it was used in the shooting. ‘The bike was found burnt out near to a pathway in Boggart Hole Clough on Tuesday afternoon and after studying CCTV, we have found images of two people riding the bike near to Charlestown Investigation: Road.

Come the conclusion to the opening 90-minute session, Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat underlined his emergence as a growing talent with the third quickest time, finishing just under a second off Rosberg. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was the only other driver who managed to get within a second of Rosberg with a time of 1:13.742secs. A former team-mate in Williams' Felipe Massa was fifth quickest, with the Brazilian on home soil ending up 1.047secs adrift. A fast-rising star in 17-year-old Max Verstappen, on his latest practice outing for Toro Rosso ahead of his debut campaign next year, was an impressive sixth on the timesheet, 1.063secs down. Pastor Maldonado, who has endured a wretched campaign for Lotus this year, was surprisingly next up ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari and McLaren's Kevin Magnussen. Lewis Hamilton was second in opening practice. He leads the championship as he bids to win his second title . Fernando Alonso is pictured on the phone during the first practice session.

Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo completed the top 10, with the Australian almost 1.5secs off the pace. Williams' reserve Felipe Nasr, this week confirmed as a Sauber driver for next year, was 12th in replacing Valtteri Bottas, finishing 0.7secs behind compatriot Massa. Force India gave an outing to their reserve Daniel Juncadella, with the Spaniard 16th and last of those who set a time, finishing 3.2secs back. Jenson Button suffered a complete failure of his ERS (energy recovery system) at the end of what proved to be his one-and-only installation lap very early in the session. Despite frantic efforts by his mechanics to get him back on track, they proved in vain, similarly with Sauber's Esteban Gutierrez. The Mexican also suffered electrical issues and, despite completing six installation laps, like Button he failed to set a time.","Rosberg was two tenths faster than Mercedes team-mate Hamilton .

"The husband of a Delaware state senator turned himself in and was arrested after being caught pulling down Republican Party campaign signs, police said Thursday. Dana Armon Long, 54, husband of Democrat State Senator Bethany Hall-Long of Middletown where the incident took place, was filmed taking down signs labeled Republican Party of Delaware. Walking along the road around 4am, Long attempts to hide behind the signs he's carrying as a voice off camera says 'We got you stealing those signs. You're stealing those signs, put them back.' Scroll down for video . Video: A camera caught Dana Armon Long, 54, husband of Democrat State Senator Bethany Hall-Long, pulling signs down by the side of the highway . 'We gotcha, brother,' the cameraman tells Long in the video. 'We got your license plate, your face and everything.' The video was posted to YouTube, with the uploader writing that he joined the local Republican Party chairman to tape after a series of signs were taken down. Police were shown the video and issued an arrest warrant for Long, said Middletown Police Chief Daniel Yeager. 'The tape doesn't tell a lie,' he said. Long surrendered Thursday morning for arrest on a charge of theft and released on bond. The charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine up to $2,300. 'Sadly, this race has become tough and personal,' Hall-Long said in a statement released on Wednesday that said the signs had been handed over to the Democratic Party to be returned. State Senator: Democrat Bethany Hall-Long says that her husband let his frustrations with the campaign 'get the better of him' Caught: Long surrendered to police after an arrest warrant was issued for the theft and was later released on bond . 'My husband is my high school sweetheart and he loves me very much. I was not aware that he had allowed his frustration over the campaign attacks to get the better of him.' The area where Long was filmed borders the same road along which 28 signs bearing Republican Party messages were put up Sunday before being stolen. Replacement signs were stolen Tuesday. A police report stated that there had been another set of signs stolen earlier. Delaware Department of Transportation prohibits posting of signs 10 feet from the edge of highways, but signs posted 30 days before or 30 days after an election are exempt. Hall-Long is running against Republican John Marino for the District 10 seat.","Dana Armon Long, husband of State Senator Bethany Hall-Long, was filmed taking down campaign signs in Middletown .

"The bosses of taxi phone app Uber are being pressured by taxi regulators to cancel its unaccredited driver service Uber X. Uber, a smartphone application that connects passengers with hire-car drivers, was founded in San Francisco in 2009. Since then, it has been valued at a whopping $US15 billion. Uber X is a variation of the original service that allows members of the public to transport people around for a lower cost. The Passenger Transport Act states that drivers being paid for driving services must be accredited, a law which has led State Governments to threaten drivers with fines of up to $110,000 . Uber is being pressured by Taxi regulators to cancel its unaccredited driver service Uber X, which they argue is dangerous and unlawful . In Victoria, the Taxi Service Commission has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the company, demanding they terminate the Uber X service. A spokesperson for the Taxi Service Commission in Victoria told Mashable: 'The cease and desist letter requires Uber to immediately cease and desist offering the UberX product in Victoria. Unaccredited drivers are not subject to the same ongoing criminal checks that accredited drivers are, and this poses a safety risk to passengers and drivers.'

"He’s either woefully ignorant about the dangers of military-grade explosives – or he’s got nerves of steel. Video footage has emerged of a pro-separatist soldier in Ukraine remaining totally at ease as missiles rain down just yards away. His show of remarkable fearlessness comes during an interview about the war with government forces and the struggle to control Donetsk airport. Scroll down for video . This is one rebel soldier's reaction to a nearby missile strike in Ukraine . His show of remarkable fearlessness comes during an interview about the war with government forces and the struggle to control Donetsk airport . At first it’s accompanied by the sound of dogs barking and birds singing, but the serenity is interrupted by the terrifying sound of missiles screaming towards targets nearby. A handful of men watching the interview scurry for cover in a building a few yards away – but the soldier listens without moving, seemingly completely unconcerned. ‘At the moment you can hear Grad [a missile system] working at us,’ he says. He doesn’t even flinch at the frightening sound of the missiles exploding. He just takes a few puffs on his cigarette and says ‘you’ve heard this, you saw this’. The proximity of the strike was such that bits of shrapnel landed at the soldier’s feet. He says: ‘Here are fragments flying at us… watch your head.’ The men who hid in the building (right) emerge and ask him if he’s looking at shrapnel from the missile strike. ‘Yes, yes. They’ve fired it just now,’ the soldier replies . With an air of staggering nonchalance he then bends down and picks up a piece. He says: ‘Damn, it’s still hot. Little b*****d.’ The men who hid in the building emerge and ask him if he’s looking at shrapnel from the missile strike. ‘It fell just now?’ one asks. ‘Yes, yes.

"Playing on public paranoia ignited by movies like The Exorcist, British military intelligence agents spread rumours of demonic possessions, black masses and witchcraft to scare emerging armed groups in the Troubles in the 1970s, it has been revealed. The head of the army's 'black operations', in Northern Ireland, Captain Colin Wallace, was said to have stoked satanic panic between 1972-1974, going so far as to place black candles and upside down crucifixes in abandoned buildings in Belfast war zones. The move was all part of a propaganda spreading plan to link the true-to-life horrors happening at the hands of  paramilitary groups with supernatural evil depicted in horror films. British military intelligence agents spread rumours of demonic possessions, black masses and witchcraft to scare emerging armed groups in the Troubles in the 1970s, and played on public paranoid sparked by movies like The Exorcist, seen above . Intelligence agents leaked stories to newspapers about black masses and satanic rituals taking place from the north of Belfast to the east, and played on paranoid sparked by movies like The Devil Rides Out, above . Professor Richard Jenkins, of Sheffield University, has revealed the use of the dark arts as part of a physiological war in his book, Black Magic and Bogeyman: fear, Rumour and Popular Belief in the North of Ireland 1972-1974. He wrote that intelligence agents leaked stories to newspapers about black masses and satanic rituals taking place from the north of Belfast to the east. The agents stoked public fears, ignited by films like The Exorcist and The Devil Rides Out. Mr Wallace told Mr Jenkins by fanning devil-worshipping paranoia among the public, agents made people believe emerging forces and their murderous campaigns were fueled by evil forces, and were possibly interlinked. Mr Wallace said promoting the idea that the devil was at play was a good way to discredit paramilitary organisations. It also helped keep children inside at night, and away from buildings they were using to conduct surveillance. The bloodiest years of the Troubles were between 1972-1974, when Northern Ireland almost erupted into civil war  and when Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups began ritualistic-style torture killings . He told The Guardian: 'It was quite clear that the church, both the Roman Catholic church and the Protestant church, even for the paramilitaries, held a fair degree of influence. 'So we were looking for something that would be regarded with abhorrence really by the two communities, and at the same time would be something that paramilitaries couldn't justify, and also would be in many ways seen as a reason why some of the outrages were taking place. 'That sort of degree of activity was lowering the value of human life. And so eventually it came to the point where we looked at witchcraft … Ireland was very superstitious and all we had to do was bring it up to date.' Jenkins, a professor of sociology, said Mr Wallace's own religious upbringing and cultural background were behind the ideas. The bloodiest years of the Troubles were between 1972-1974, when Northern Ireland almost erupted into civil war. And when Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups began ritualistic-style torture killings of Catholics and political opponents.

"A New York Man rowing across the Atlantic Ocean for the fourth time to raise money for AIDS was left stranded without food or water after pirates from Haiti robbed him. Victor Mooney was not physically harmed when pirates near the island of Tortuga nabbed his food supply and survival equipment, said a statement released on Thursday by Rubenstein Public Relations. 'Although the pirates left the boat in his possession, Mooney was left with only the clothes on his back,' the statement said, and he 'is currently in an extreme state of distress.' Robbed: New Yorker Victor Mooney tried for the fourth time to row across the Atlantic Ocean was raided by pirates who left him stranded without food or water near Haiti, according to his publicist . 'Local authorities have been alerted of the ordeal and are thoroughly investigating the situation.' The U.S. Coast Guard says the incident occurred when Victor Mooney began having trouble with his boat on Thursday near Tortuga Island. The Brooklyn native was headed back to the U.S. from his trans-Atlantic journey but had diverted toward Haiti on advice of his U.S. weather router. Mooney said he saw several fishing boats approach and that people aboard them began yelling in a language he did not understand as they tied his boat to theirs. The Huffington Post reports that Mooney was rowing by himself towards Miami with an end goal of reaching New York City. Fourth time's no charm:Victor Mooney made failed attempts at the same journey in 2006, 2007, 2011, and his most recent one this year that left him without food or water after being robbed . His location: Victor Mooney was allegedly robbed near the Tortugas Island, Gulf of California, Mexico . Stranded: The U.S. Coast Guard says the incident occurred when Victor Mooney began having trouble with his boat on Thursday near Tortuga Island . He braved a 5,000 mile crossing beginning in the Canary Islands in February. Two weeks prior to the alleged incident, Mooney left a port from the north coast of the Dominican Republic around 140 miles to the east of Tortuga. This isn't Mooney's first attempt at rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. In 2006 his boat leaked just hours after leaving from Senegal in Africa. In 2007 he only made it 15 days before he had to be rescued after his desalination system was non-functional. In 2011 he nearly met his bitter end, drifting 15 days in a life raft after his boat overflowed with water. Mooney has not been in the condition to say whether or not he will attempt the perilous journey once again.

"Honey Boo Boo's Anna Cardwell claimed Monday that Mama June siphoned off her $30,000 trust fun to buy the man who molested her a car. Chickadee, as she's called by family, told E! News in a revealing interview that she checked with the bank on a hunch and discovered the money had somehow dwindled to just $17.90. 'I have a feeling mama used that to buy a car and buy him what he wants,' 20-year-old Cardwell said, referring to Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sat down with E! News Monday (pictured) for an interview in which she revealed her belief her mother Mama June took her $30,000 trust fund to buy Mark McDaniel, who molested Cardwell for months in 2002, a car . Shocking reveal: Cardwell also claimed that Mama June's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear is just a ruse to take the heat off her amid public outcry over her allegedly rekindled relationship with her daughter's abuser . Cardwell also claimed Monday that the 'united front,' as TMZ calls it, that Mama June and ex Sugar Bear are putting on in the face of claims they could lose custody of star Alana is just that: a front. 'Mama's using sugar bear to cover her ass,' claimed Cardwell. Meanwhile, Mama June denied claims about the car completely to E! News, saying, 'I never bought him a car.' Abuser: Mama June's ex Mark McDaniel, 53, served 10 years after repeatedly molesting Anna Cardwell in 2002 . With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin stated. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' However, TMZ reported October 26 that Mama June was spotted at a Georgia car dealer, where she plunked down $25,000 cash to purchase two used Nissan Altimas. One was for a family member, while the other was delivered to a 'friend' in Decatur--to the very address McDaniel listed on his sex offender registry, TMZ claimed. Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago. She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. Living the single life? Cardwell claims her mother's recent outing with ex Sugar Bear was just to keep up appearances . TMZ claimed in late October that Mama June had plunked down $25,000 for two Nissan Altimas (file photo pictured), one for a family member and another for a 'friend.' The site claimed that friend is Mark McDaniel . Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with Alana. After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons. Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch. Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'. The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell.

The multi-award winning ironman who grew up in Queensland has added another trophy to his shelf . He beat the previous record of 4183 pull-ups in 24-hours . The muscle man finished the challenge in 12 hours, also inadvertently beating that record . He sat at 1440 after four hours, and 1800 by the time five had passed. Eckstein had pumped out 2520 by the time seven hours were up and after eight had gone by he had knocked over 2880. By the time ten hours had rolled past the athlete had slowed to just five pull-ups a minute, making sure he was giving himself enough rest so he could get across the line. After half a day of lifting his chin over the bar, Eckstein had tallied up 4210. His hands were ripped and blistered but he had broken two Guinness World Records. The athlete's hands were shredded and ripped after the thousands of chin-ups . Eckstein's family was there to cheer him on and congratulated him after the feat .

"It appears like any other racing car - taking the perfect lines, making spilt second decisions and navigating a track at 150mph.

This GPS data is transmitted to the vehicle via WiFi according to the automotive standard and redundantly via high-frequency radio. In parallel to this, 3D cameras in the car film the track, and a computer program compares the cameras' image information against a data set stored on board. This is what makes it possible for the technology pioneer to orient itself on the track within centimeters - and decide on the perfect race line. The Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept completed a lap on the Grand Prix track in Hockenheim – at racing speed, without a driver. Audi scored yet another major success in the development of piloted driving: Before the season finale of the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), the latest technology pioneer was running up to its physical limit, with no driver. It took the Audi RS 7 piloted driving concept just slightly over two minutes to complete a lap on the Grand Prix track in Hockenheim – piloted with high precision and accuracy to within centimeters. 'The top performance by the Audi RS 7 today substantiates the skills of our development team with regard to piloted driving at Audi,' said Prof. Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Board Member for Technical Development at AUDI AG. 'The derivations from series production, particularly in terms of precision and performance, are of great value for our further development steps.'

"A woman who struggled with body image throughout her childhood has proven once and for all that size does not matter when it comes to busting a move. Radio producer Whitney Way Thore's series of videos called A Fat Girl Dancing went viral in recent months thanks to her impressive skills on the dance floor. What began as a YouTube video, has exploded into a worldwide movement that aims to fight body shame and promote the idea of self-love and acceptance as a step toward total wellness. Scroll down for video . Video star: Whitney Way Thore's series of video called A Fat Girl Dancing went viral in recent months thanks to her impressive skills on the dance floor and now she's the star of a brand new fitness video . And now, Whitney, who hails from North Carolina, has been snapped up to star in a new  video packed with all her signature moves. When offered the opportunity to play the lead role in Muffin Top, a new  video by fitness instructor Fitty Smallz, Whitney jumped at the opportunity. Shake it! The  video called Muffin Top, a new offering from fitness instructor Fitty Smallz, sees Whitney busting her signature moves . Spreading the word: She believes her partnership with Fitty Smallz will take her entire No Body Shame platform to the next level . She said: 'Once I understood the platform, heard the song and learned that he was a serious professional with over 30 years of experience, I know it was a perfect match. My partnership with Fitty Smallz and our Muffin Top project will take my entire No Body Shame platform to the next level.' The No Body Shame campaign recognises body shame as a complex, multi-faceted issue that is best dealt with by first unapologetically loving yourself as you are, without being shamed out of a gym or off a dance floor, explains Whitney. Fitty Smallz said: 'Most people don’t realise that my platform is all about fitness. The typical fitness professional goes at people with “eat right and exercise,” but people aren’t listening to that. They are also bombarded with messages of weight loss and images of perfect bodies that make them feel bad about their own bodies. Promotion: The No Body Shame campaign recognises body shame as a complex, multi-faceted issue that is best dealt with by unapologetically loving yourself as you are, explains Whitney . 'We try to give them something they can relate to and laugh about. Then it makes them think and hopefully inspires them. No one likes to be lectured.' Whitney has struggled with her body image since childhood. The lifelong dancer was teaching others the skill as early as 16, but weight gain took a serious toll on her confidence. 'Unable to face my reflection, I failed out of dance class my first semester,' she told the Huffington Post. 'By the time I had graduated college, been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, moved to Korea, and gained 200 pounds, I was finally able to dance socially, at a club or party, but never dreamed I would take a class or perform publicly ever again.' But thanks to some soul searching and the redemptive powers of dance and viral internet fame, Thore is back and better than ever. 'I am learning to practice aggressive self-love. I have lived my life as a 130-pound woman and as a 350-pound woman in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. Cultural norms, societal pressures, and the whims of the fashion industry do not define my worth as woman or a human being,' proclaims Thore . At age 29, after years of living with eating disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome, weight fluctuations, self-doubt and depression, she made a life-changing decision to love and accept herself as she is, to rise above the negativity that society forces upon anyone who is different, to live her life to the fullest, regardless of what the scale says, and, most importantly, to dance. 'I am learning to practice aggressive self-love,' she writes on her website. 'I have lived my life as a 130-pound woman and as a 350-pound woman in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. Cultural norms, societal pressures, and the whims of the fashion industry do not define my worth as woman or a human being.' With the support of tens of thousands of men and women all over the world, the No Body Shame Campaign has grown into a full-fledged movement and she's accrued thousands of fans. She added: 'It's a movement that knows positive change can’t start or be sustained until you are truly kind to yourself from the inside out. A movement that reaches even further - and aims to show that your body doesn’t have to limit you, whether it be deemed “too skinny,” “too fat,” or “too broken.” 'A movement that asserts that you don’t need society’s permission to seek your right to happiness.'","Whitney Way Thore released series of videos called A Fat Girl Dancing .

"Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, said countries in receipt of British aid should be forced to improve their prisons . British aid should be spent building prisons in developing countries so more foreign criminals can be deported, MPs have heard. Foreigners held in English and Welsh prisons cannot be returned if jails in their home country do not comply with human rights legislation. But Conservative backbenchers have called for cash from the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Justice to develop prisons overseas to ensure they do comply. Philip Hollobone, MP for Kettering, insisted Britain should make it conditional to certain countries that aid would only be given if they accepted a prison building programme in order to cooperate with prisoner transfers. The Tory MP flagged up concerns about Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, which were included on what he described as a ‘list of shame’. He said they received £973million in British aid each year, according to 2012 figures, and had 2,900 of their nationals in English and Welsh prisons, costing taxpayers £100million. MPs were told there were 10,834 foreign nationals among a prison population of around 85,000 inmates in England and Wales, which cost taxpayers around £300 million a year. Inmates from 160 countries were held in the jails, with HMP Maidstone and HMP Huntercombe used solely for foreign nationals, the Westminster Hall debate heard. Opening the debate, Mr Hollobone said he welcomed the fact criminals were serving longer prison sentences, but said there were huge problems as 13 per cent of inmates were foreign nationals in a prison system that ‘is basically full’. He said 6,174 of the foreign prison population - around 57% - came from 12 nations, referring to a ‘list of shame’ led by Poland and including Ireland, Jamaica and Vietnam. Conservative Guy Opperman, MP for Hexham, asked Mr Hollobone: ‘Do you agree with me that one way to resolve this problem is to utilise the Dfid and MoJ (Ministry of Justice) budgets to improve the prisons in individual countries like Jamaica ... thereby allowing prisoners to be returned to a human rights compliant jail in their actual homeland?’ Mr Hollobone replied: ‘I think you make an extremely sensible suggestion. ‘I have to say, I don't think my constituents in Kettering are that fussed particularly about the human rights of foreign nationals who commit crimes in this country but understand, as it stands at the moment, we operate under human rights legislation introduced by the previous government and we are not allowed in law to deport criminals to non-human right complaint prisons. ‘I think it does make sense to use the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries who provide us with a very large number of prisoners and I think that is a good idea.’ Thousands of foreign criminals are locked in British prisons, but cannot be deported because jails in their own countries do not meet international standards . Mr Hollobone, in reference to the money received by Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh, added: ‘I believe it would be a good idea to use some of that £973 million on building prisons in those six countries.’ He added: ‘I would go so far as to say I think we should make our international aid to these countries conditional on their acceptance of a prison building programme. ‘I don't think we should give these countries international aid if they are not going to cooperate with us in this regard.’ In his reply, Mr Penning vowed to put ‘whatever rocket’ he could in other Whitehall departments to make progress on Jamaica taking its nationals back if they have committed crimes in the UK. Mr Penning, also policing minister, said the number of foreign nationals had decreased from 11,153 to 10,843 but it was not right to say ‘all of those would disappear’ should measures in place be implemented, noting as foreign offenders were deported others were arrested.","Criminals cannot be deported if jails in home countries fail human rights test .

"A statue that shows a Soviet soldier raping a pregnant woman as he holds a gun to her head has been removed and the artist arrested by authorities in northern Poland. The statue, entitled Komm Frau (Come Here Woman), appeared on Gdansk's Avenue of Victory on Saturday evening. Artist Jerzy Szumczyk told Polish Radio he had researched the subject of rape by the Red Army as it made its way across Eastern Europe between 1944 and 1945 towards Berlin. Controversial: The statue of a Soviet soldier raping a pregnant woman was removed in Poland's Gdansk . The fifth-year student at Gdansk's Academy of Fine Arts was so emotionally affected by what he read he felt compelled to express his feelings through art and created the sculpture. But the Polish artist's attempt to pay tribute to the victims was short lived and the statue was removed this morning. Police spokeswoman Aleksandra Siewert said: 'The artist was detained and released after questioning. 'The matter will now be taken up on Monday by the prosecutor's office.' Before . Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Gdansk was a free city and more than 95 . per cent of people living in Gdansk at the time were German. But millions of German women were raped by Red Army soldiers between 1944 and 1945 during the dying days of Nazis Germany. Polish women and even Russian women released from captivity were also raped with numbers reaching 100,000. Artist Jerzy Szumczyk said he felt compelled to make the statue after he researched the rape of women by the Red Army between 1944 and 1945 . Gdansk's old town where women were raped as the Red Army made its way towards Berlin . The Nazis invasion of Russia, . Operation Barbarossa, resulted in 30 million inhabitants of the Soviet . Union losing their lives while more than three million starved in German . prisoner of war camps. Rape and murder were common elements of the Nazi advance through Russia . However, the Germans also suffered a similar fate when Russian troops retook their land and swarmed into Germany. During the Battle of Berlin more than a million German soldiers were killed, or later died in captivity. The rape began as soon as the Red Army entered East Prussia in 1944. In many towns, every female between 10 and 89 was attacked. Soviet soldiers often carried out the assaults in front of their husbands and family as an added humiliation. A Red Army War Memorial in Berlin became known as the 'tomb of the unknown rapist'. It is believed that as many as 2 million women were raped by Red army officers, many of them several times over. Many had to have abortions or be treated for the syphilis they caught from being raped by different men. Children born out of the abuses were called Russenbabies and most were abandoned and left to die. Stalin explicitly condoned rape as a method of rewarding the soldiers and terrorising German civilians. His Police chief Lavrenti Beria was himself a serial rapist, a number of testimonies exist detailing how women and girls were grabbed off the streets and bundled into his limousine. It is believed that more than 100 school-aged girls and young women were drugged and raped by Beria who ran the NKVD, the feared forerunner to the KGB. The Red Army's atrocities against women in Dresden in the spring of 1945, a city that had already suffered heavily from Allied bombing, were carried out in a particularly sickening and systematic manner. Women were dragged out of their homes and raped in the street in front of their husbands who were forced to watch. Then more often than not the men were shot. As well as the estimated two million rapes in Germany, there were between 70,000 and 100,000 in Vienna and anywhere from 50,000 to 200,000 in Hungary, as well as thousands more in Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. There are even accounts of women who had been liberated from concentration camps, emaciated and still wearing prison uniforms, being raped by Russian soldiers. Richard Evans, Professor of Modern History at Cambridge, wrote a book on the topic in which he recounts the extreme violence of many of the encounters. He wrote: 'Rape was often accompanied by torture and mutilation and frequently ends in the victim being shot or bludgeoned to death. The raging violence was undiscriminating.'","Statue called Komm Frau appeared in Gdansk on Saturday .

"Director Michael Bay is reportedly in the running to make a movie about the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. The man who brought the world The Transformers franchise, Armageddon and Bad Boys, is now in talks to direct 13 Hours - a big-screen adaptation from a book on the attack which killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three others. The film will tell the story of the six security team members who fought to protect the compound, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Scroll down for video . Director Michael Bay, the man behind The Transformers franchise, is allegedly in talks to make a movie about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012 . The book has been adapted by Chuck Hogan, the writer behind books The Town, Prince Of Thieves and Devils In Exile. 13 Hours was written by bestselling author Mitchell Zuckoff. According to Hollywood Reporter, 13 Hours will have a budget of no more than $40 million - a big change from the average $200million that it cost to make each Transformer movie. Earlier this month Bay released new, explosive images from summer smash Transformers: Age of Extinction showing in great detail what went on behind the scenes of the blockbuster starring Mark Wahlberg. Bay is also the 'star' of several images, as he appears in several shots looking right at home in his wild and fiery element. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Bay's representatives at William Morris Endeavor. It is not the first time that Bay will have taken on a major moment in U.S. military and political history.

The films that Bay has directed and produced have grossed $6.5 billion worldwide, according to his own website. His other projects this year have included Transformers: Age of Extinction, The Purge: Anarchy, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija.

"Three British cabin crew managers are set to become the aviation world’s first flying butlers when Etihad Airways' The Residence takes to the skies in December. Richard Burrows from Manchester, Eren Wirizlay from Telford and Georgina Henderson from Southport are part of a handpicked team of 13 to complete a specially tailored training course in London led by the Savoy Hotel’s Head Butler. The flying butlers will look after VIP guests booked in Etihad Airways’ new three-room cabin, which costs a staggering £12,500 per flight. Service in the sky: A team of Etihad cabin crew have undergone special training by Savoy Hotel's head butler . Up in the air: The flying butlers will take care of VIP guests in The Residence, which costs £12,500 per flight . A series of master classes  focused on etiquette and protocol, valet skills and concierge services, to boost the cabin crew’s existing high level customer service experience. The five-star hotel's head butler Sean Davoren says: 'They all now possess the skills required to provide the highest standard of hospitality for the airline's premium customers, by blending the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant.' The newly qualified flying butlers, who all currently work as in-flight chefs or food and beverage managers on board Etihad Airways’ long-haul fleet of aircraft, were given the special training at the London School of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of West London, as well as on-the-job training at the Savoy Hotel. Flying butlers: Three British crewmembers are among the team, pictured with The Savoy's Sean Davoren . Newly-trained butler Georgina Henderson, 28, said she was 'thrilled' to have the chance of working on the enormous Airbus A380 aircraft. 'The thought of being the world's first flying butler is amazing and obviously all of us who qualified would love to have that honour. 'But if it's not to be on the inaugural flight I won't be disappointed as my time will come soon enough and I really believe that I'm going to be playing a part in aviation history.' Taking to the skies: The three-room suite will feature on the airline's new A380, taking off in December . The Residence, which features a living room, private shower and double bedroom, is on board the airlines first Airbus A380 aircraft. The A380 will be deployed on Etihad Airways’ Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow route. The newly qualified flying butlers, who all currently work as in-flight chefs or food and beverage managers on board Etihad Airways’ long-haul fleet of aircraft, were given the special training at the London School of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of West London, as well as on-the-job training at the Savoy Hotel. The Savoy was chosen by Etihad Airways’ management as the location for the tailored training course, as the hotel was the first in the world to establish its own academy to teach professional butlers. World first: The butlers are all eager to be the first flying butler on the inaugural flight . Aubrey Tiedt, Etihad Airways’ Vice President Guest Services said: 'I am extremely proud of the team’s achievements and they all qualified with flying colours to become the world’s first ever butlers in the sky. 'They are really enthusiastic and cannot wait to board the A380 aircraft and put into practice all that they have learned. 'Etihad Airways aims to be the best in everything we set out to do and the flying butlers will provide a level of service that no traveller has ever experienced in commercial aviation.' Expertise: The Savoy trained crew to have 'the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant' Sean Davoren, the Savoy’s Head Butler, added: 'The Etihad Airways trainees have been an absolute joy to work with and they all now possess the skills required to provide the highest standard of hospitality for the airline’s premium customers, by blending the discretion of a traditional English butler with the efficiency of a 21st century personal assistant.'

"Britain has been told to pay more than £10 million in unemployment benefit to eastern European migrants who have left Britain, returned home and now cannot find a job. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have demanded that Iain Duncan Smith’s department funds their jobless citizens because they once worked and paid national insurance in the UK. His department has refused because the migrants had not worked in the UK long enough to claim, but the three countries have threatened to issue a diplomatic protest. Czech labour minister Michaela Marksova-Tominova (right) said Britain owed her country £3million in  benefits under EU rules but Iain Duncan Smith (left) has refused to pay because the migrants didn't work long enough . Czech labour minister Michaela Marksova-Tominova said Britain owed her country £3million in these benefits under European Union rules. Britain has already paid £800,000 under these rules, but she is writing to Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, demanding another £2.2million. Barbora Petrova of the Slovakian labour ministry said her government was seeking £4.9million from Britain in outstanding unemployment benefits, while Poland is making a multi-million-pound claim but has not revealed the exact figure. It is understood the three countries’ ambassadors have demanded a meeting with Sir Ivan Rogers, the British permanent representative to the EU, to issue an official diplomatic protest. Mrs Marksova-Tominova said: ‘I expect this meeting to resolve the situation.’ If not, the situation could escalate when Mr Duncan Smith attends a meeting of EU employment ministers next month. An EU agreement means that citizens of one country who work in another are entitled to out-of-work benefits if they have paid national insurance for a certain period. In the UK the threshold is two years, but in other European countries it is as low as six months. The three countries claim the situation began two years ago when the rules in the UK changed. If they succeed in getting the money, it could open the doors to claims from other European countries – many of which have high unemployment rates. An EU agreement means  citizens of one country who work in another are entitled to out-of-work benefits if they have paid national insurance for a certain period. The threshold is two years in the UK, but  lower elsewhere . A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This Government does not pay benefits to someone in another country when they would not have been eligible for them in the UK. We are working with our counterparts across Europe on this issue.’ Andrew Rosindell, the Tory MP for Romford said: ‘I find this astonishing. People who come here to work should only be paid benefits if they have fully paid into the system for a long time. ‘If they are entitled to go home and then claim more than British citizens can, then the system needs looking at.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Britain must of course meet legal requirements, but the Government needs to push Brussels to address this ludicrous situation before any more taxpayers’ money is wasted. ‘Taxpayers here will be baffled that it’s apparently their responsibility to pay benefit bills in foreign countries.’ Officials said the Government does reimburse other countries when migrants have paid enough in natural insurance that they would be eligible for unemployment benefit in the UK. Jobseekers Allowance at up to £72.40 a week is just one of the benefits which can be claimed abroad. Child benefit is paid to the children of migrants from the European Union, even if they do not live in the UK. British citizens who live abroad can also claim some benefits including the winter fuel payment, even if they live in a hot climate. The Czech Republic was the first to ask for unpaid unemployment benefits. Employment ministry spokesman Petr Sulek said: ‘Great Britain is the only European union country which does not accept the European regulation and its attitude to the unemployment benefits refund has been very restrictive. This is not a problem only between the Czech Republic and Great Britain. Great Britain’s debts to Poland and Slovakia are even higher.’ Magdalena Gorska, from the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, said: ‘Poland has asked the UK for a partial refund of the benefits ... to date, the United Kingdom has paid off to Poland for more than half of the requested amounts.’ She said Poland had asked the European Commission to ask the UK to ‘reconsider their position’. Earlier this year the European Commission ruled against the UK on this issue but Mr Duncan Smith refused to pay.

"A millionaire couple claim their parties in the celebrity-filled suburb of Primrose Hill - which have caused six council noise complaints - are simply a case of 'middle-aged ravers getting out of control'. Irate neighbours have lodged noise complaints with Camden Council after Erin and Jeremy Morris, who run the upmarket jewellers David Morris, hosted a series of loud parties over the past 12 months at their £5.2million home. Primrose Hill, where houses regularly sell for tens of million of pounds, is an area which has long been popular with the rich and famous. Those who live or own homes in the area include Labour leader Ed Miliband, media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s daughter Elisabeth, singer Gwen Stefani and celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. And the house belonging to the Morrises was the childhood home of London Mayor Boris Johnson before it was sold by his parents. Scroll down for video .

However, some say the area is being spoiled by the late night parties of some residents. Stock image used . The stunning view overlooking London from Primrose Hill, in Camden . Courtesy of Monumental Adventure . The Morris' recent parties have been so loud Channel 5 presenter and neighbour Matthew Wright has claimed he is forced to wear ear plugs when going to sleep. Despite this, Mrs Morris has defended their actions. She said the couple were middle-aged so it was nice to have friends visit them at home, rather than going to a club, the Evening Standard reported. She said: 'We have a really big family and we have lots of friends and maybe had too many glasses of wine and didn't realise the level of the bass. 'I think it was a case of middle-aged ravers getting out of control.' When contacted by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr and Mrs Morris said they had no further comment to make. Last month Mr Wright publicly stated his disappointment with a new wave of residents in Primrose Hill who he claimed showed less regard for their neighbours. Matthew Wright (pictured right) said he could not get to sleep during the parties despite wearing ear plugs. Pictured left is Jeremy Morris, who lives at the home with his wife Erin . Chef Jamie Oliver (who has not complained about the parties) is also believed to own a home in the area . He told the Daily Express: 'I'm three gardens down with double glazing and I can't sleep with earplugs in.' 'I don't remember anyone holding parties mid-week with bouncers when I first moved here. 'Now there's one every other week and it seems owners of bigger houses are the worst offenders.' The issue of noisy parties in the celebrity-filled suburb appears to be becoming a long-term problem. In December, Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth and her husband Matthew Freud were told to keep the noise down after a noisy bash at their £24million home - which was reportedly attended by celebrities such as Russell Brand, Jemima Khan, Justin Timberlake and Samuel L. Jackson. At the time, a neighbour said: ‘It used to be a quiet area but it’s become like little Beverly Hills. They should at the very least let the neighbours know when the parties are going to be held and agree a finishing time.’ Mr Freud later apologised to anyone disturbed by the parties. He said: ‘We are genuinely sorry to hear that some of our neighbours were disturbed by guests leaving our family home on a couple of occasions earlier this year. We love Primrose Hill and would never wish to inconvenience any of our fellow residents. ‘We have a young family ourselves and these were irregular events. Our apologies go to anyone who was disturbed on those evenings.'","Erin and Jeremy Morris's noisy late night parties prompt council complaints .

"It's seems that many of the fashion choices at last night's MOBO awards were dominated by black, sheer and sparkle, which either worked for some or really didn't for others. Two of the best dressed stars from the red carpet were Nicole Scherzinger and Myleene Klass who both opted for figure hugging numbers. Nicole, 36, wore a black leather dress with sheer cut outs in a lace effect with a plunging neckline. Scroll down for video . Nicole wowed in leather and lace but kept it classy and below the knee. Not sure about the shoes though . Nicole Scherzinger performs onstage at the MOBO Awards at SSE Arena in a two piece last night . But the Big Fat Lie singer managed to keep the look very classy with a below-the-knee hemline, simple make-up and jewellery. Her boots, though, were an odd choice. She later changed into a cool sports luxe cream and black two piece and strappy sandals. The former X Factor judge showed off her sculpted abs in the outfit during her performance of her latest ballad, On The Rocks. Myleene, meanwhile, opted for a leopard effect gold sequin dress from her own collection at Littlewoods, retailing at just £150, which exemplified her curvy frame. The classically trained pianist, also 36, kept her tousled highlighted swept to one side while her bronzed make-up enhanced her olive skin tone. During the ceremony shared a table with handsome TV personality Rob Evans - with whom she later presented an award. Myleene opted for a leopard effect gold sequin dress from her own collection at Littlewoods, just £150 . Singer Tori Kelly showed off her sensational legs in a cute black jumpsuit and killer shoe boots. She styled her curly hair to the side and wore natural make-up.

She paired a voluminous white mini skirt with oversize metallic vest and crimped her hair. TOWIE's Lauren Pope went for the plunge effect and dressed her slim frame in a thigh skimming black and diamanté detailed dress with a deep V effect on the chest. The outfit had a wrap detail on the skirt and lovely long sleeves with peek-a-boo detail showing off her sculpted shoulders. The DJ, 32, wore her long blonde hair half in a perfect, sleek style and went for a thick black eyeliner on the eyes, adding colour with a peach blusher.

"Garden thieves  have forced managers at Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens to install plant-cages and CCTV cameras in an attempt to protect the world's rarest plants. While most of the 3.5 million people who visit Sydney's  iconic inner-city gardens are primarily interested in the array of exotic flora and it's panoramic harbour views, an alarming amount of green thumbs are knocking off plants. Now, workers at the Royal Botanic Gardens fear the extinction of some rare species, as thieves are walking out with plants hidden in their backpacks or sports bags. An exotic plant caged in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens. Unfortunately the Royal Botanic Gardens would not provide the name of the plant, for fear it's rarity could be targeted for garden thieves . Dr Brett Summerell, deputy executive director at the Royal Botanic Gardens explained to Daily Mail Australia his concern if plant robberies continue to occur. 'It is quite problematic,' he said. 'I don't think people understand that in the Botanic Gardens there are plants collected for scientific purposes, which tell us a lot of detail about the species and where they are from. 'It is very difficult to recollect some of these plant species and it is becoming more and more difficult to display them, especially if we are losing them - we won't want to put the important ones out.' In an attempt to conserve the existing plants, extra security has been set up throughout the garden to monitor  any unusual activity among the visitors. Small plants have been locked in zoo-like cages, while surveillance cameras and park rangers troll the grounds for plant thieves . While most of the 3.5 million people who visit Sydney's iconic inner-city gardens are primarily interested in the array of exotic flora and it's panoramic harbour views, an alarming amount of green thumbs are knocking off plants . Small plants have been locked in zoo-like cages, while surveillance cameras and park rangers troll the grounds for plant thieves. 'It is just one of those things where we have to put cages around the smaller ones until they are big enough - which make it harder for people to steal them,' Dr Summerell said. Each year, the Royal Botanic Gardens lose around five exotic plants from theft, leaving them at a loss of thousands of dollars. 'The plants have a significant value - approximately several hundreds to a thousands dollars - some of them aren't even on the market. 'But it isn't the commercial value that is important, it is the cost of travelling to a region that is difficult to get to - it could cost thousands to actually get the plant. 'When you think of travelling to Cambodia for a specific species, well that isn't cheap.' High on the list for thieves are cacti, orchards, cycas and general palms which are easy to pull out . High on the list for thieves are cacti, orchards, cycas and general palms which are easy to pull out. Dr Summerell said usually garden staff tend to be understanding when confronting robbers. 'One of the horticulturists saw someone pulling out some plants - we had to have hard words with them and it turned out they just wanted to bring a bit of the plant home - they didn’t think it would impact the plant,' he said. 'In cases where people are stealing whole plants with criminal intent they are typically handed over to police'. Dr Summerell described the plant thieves as garden enthusiasts who are looking to compliment their homes with exotic plants. 'A lot of them are keen to have it in their garden collection but in other cases, which are more concerning, it is because the plants are rare and endangered and almost impossible to get get.' Although it is 'difficult to sell plants on the black market', Dr Summerell believes a few of the stolen plants are sold illegally. Dr Summerell said the phenomenon of stealing plants have been going on for years, however, thanks to technology it is now easier to monitor. 'This has been an ongoing problem... it is something you have to be concerned about and take into account whenever you are planting.' Sydney's  Royal Botanical Gardens urge anyone who witness visitors stealing plants to report it to staff.

"Britain is to propose an ‘emergency brake’ that could be applied to prevent large numbers of immigrants arriving from Europe. A system that would allow the UK to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by senior ministers. Initial negotiations are already under way over what would be a fundamental reform of the EU’s founding principle of free movement of people between countries, Government sources say. Proposals: Britain is to propose an ‘emergency brake’ that could be applied to prevent large numbers of immigrants arriving from Europe . The idea is winning support in Germany and France, which have also seen large influxes of migrant workers from poorer states that have joined the EU. Senior figures in some of the newer EU states are also said to be open to reform, having seen their economies ‘hollowed out’ by the departure of better educated workers to richer countries. The ‘emergency brake’ on inflows from European countries would be applied if numbers exceeded expectations. The proposal will be a central demand of David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU if he wins next year’s general election. It would allow the UK or other countries to bar any further arrivals for a fixed period. Plan: The proposal will be a central demand of David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU if he wins next year’s general election . This could prevent a repeat of what happened in 2004, when Labour opted not to impose transitional controls on EU migrants from countries, including Poland, which had joined the EU. The Home Office predicted the decision would lead to around 13,000 additional immigrants a year coming to Britain. But that year, net migration leapt by nearly 130,000. More recently, the UK has seen a surge in arrivals from southern European countries still mired in economic misery. Conservative ministers are understood to be prepared to use Britain’s veto to prevent any further expansion of the EU bloc unless free movement is reformed. They also want new rules to apply to all new member states stipulating their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed. Suggestion: Home Secretary Theresa May said she and Mr Cameron have suggested that new EU countries should not enjoy full free movement rights until their economy is at a certain level . This is designed to prevent the overwhelming incentive for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. Home Secretary Theresa May, speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, said: ‘We can control far more of the immigration from outside the EU than inside it. ‘But this is an area where David Cameron and I have said we need to look to the future to talk about the rules, particularly for countries coming into the EU in the future, and putting some sort of brake on their access to full free movement. ‘For example, one idea we’ve suggested is they shouldn’t have full free movement rights until their GDP, their economy, is at a certain level compared to other economies within the EU.’","Negotiations said to be underway over reform of  free movement principle .

"Promising Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Macey continued his sharp rise up the ranks, after taking his place on the substitutes bench for the visit to West Brom on Saturday. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger continues to battle through an injury crisis for the Gunners and his options in goal have taken a hit in recently. 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez has taken over the gloves with No 1 choice Wojciech Szczesny out with a hip injury whereas summer signing David Ospina is still a long term absentee. 20-year-old Macey takes his seat on the substitutes bench on Saturday alongside Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Macey, in action for Arsenal's Under 21 side last season, has made a quick impact at the Gunners . Where has Macey come from? The 6ft 6in agreed a three-year deal with Arsenal after a trial last summer, snapping him from Bristol Rovers. What's his first-team experience? Macey only made his squad debut as an unused substitute for Bristol Rovers against Torquay in March 2012 but never made a professional appearance for the Conference side. Has he represented Arsenal yet? The Englishman started 15 games for the Under 21 side last season and managed to hold down the starting spot. However his appearance on the Arsenal bench at West Brom on Saturday was a first. Macey, in training with the first-team, has quickly risen through the ranks at Arsenal due to injuries . Was he destined to be a Gunner? Perhaps a coincidence but this is not the first time Macey has played for a team called Arsenal. The 20-year-old played for a local side in Bath called Avon Arsenal Comets when he was a kid, who even had a cannon in their emblem. Has it always been so promising? Arsenal's promising keeper was originally rejected by the Bristol Rovers' Centre of Excellence in 2007. However he didn't give up and turned out for Bath City and Yate Town before eventually joined the centre in 2009. he then became a full-time scholar in May 2011.","20-year-old signed for the Gunners last summer after a successful trial .

"A coalition split emerged today over the imminent release from prison of notorious police killer Harry Roberts. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg defended the decision by the Parole Board, insisting the justice system cannot be run according to 'the latest emotion you feel'. But Home Secretary Theresa May made clear she believes anyone who kills a police officer belongs 'behind bars for life'. MPs warned that the public will be 'absolutely furious' about the decision to release the 'evil' killer. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today refused to condemn the decision to release Harry Roberts from jail, despite a public outcry 48 years after he killed three police officers . Mr Clegg today repeatedly refused to condemn the decision by the parole board to allow the 78-year-old to walk free, despite a judge during his trial for murdering three officers insisting he should die behind bars. He suggested that as Home Secretary Mrs May has the power to intervene but has chosen not to. But in a statement issued this afternoon, Mrs May insisted: 'Policemen and women go out to work every day knowing that they might face great danger and they carry out their duties with great courage. 'I strongly believe that anyone who murders a police officer belongs behind bars – and behind bars for life. That is why I have made sure the Government will change the law so life will mean life for anyone who murders a police officer. Under pressure during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg conceded the case would provoke 'controversy' but defended the justice system which allows Parole Board's to take the decision. He told LBC: 'It's not about my feelings. It's not about my feelings. It's about how the justice system, works and if you want to run our justice system according to whatever the latest emotion you feel, fine. 'But that would be an absolute disaster for the kind of principles of justice I believe in.' Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on unarmed police in Shepherd's Bush in west London in 1966 when they approached a van he was in with two others ahead of an armed robbery. Detective Sergeant Christopher Head, 30, Detective Constable David Wombwell, 25, and Pc Geoffrey Fox, 41, were all killed in the attack on August 12 1966 . His accomplices were caught but former soldier Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days – sparking Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. He was found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches. At his trial, Old Bailey judge Mr Justice Glyn-Jones jailed him for a minimum of 30 years for what he called the 'most heinous crime for a generation or more'. He added: 'I think it likely that no Home Secretary, regarding the enormity of your crime, will ever think fit to show mercy by releasing you on licence.' Notorious police killer Harry Roberts (pictured right with a prison guard) is to walk free 48 years after being told by a judge he should never be released . However, the Parole Board has decided he should be released and he is expected to leave Littlehey Prison in Cambridge within days. In the Commons, ministers were urged to keep the 'evil' killer 'behind bars where he belongs'. Labour former minister Ian Austin warned the public are 'absolutely furious' that Roberts will be released from prison within days, despite being warned he faced dying in jail. He told Commons Leader William Hague: 'People out there are absolutely furious at today's news that the notorious police killer Harry Roberts is due to be released. 'The police are saying it's a betrayal, (Home Secretary Theresa May) herself promised the country that life should mean life for anybody convicted of killing a police officer. 'I want to know what's the Government going to do to ensure this evil criminal is kept behind bars where he belongs.' Mr Hague replied: 'There will be a great deal of sympathy with what you have just said. 'This is, as I understand, a decision by the Parole Board but of course there will be concern about it and a great deal of public agreement with what you said. 'I will certainly draw the Home Secretary's attention to your raising of this and the concern in the House about it.' London Mayor Boris Johnson said people would be 'absolutely sickened' by the release. He added: 'They will find it hard to understand how a man who shot dead three police officers in this city in the most horrific fashion can now enjoy the freedom he denied his victims. 'To my mind, in the case of the murder of a police officer, life should mean life.' Roberts murdered three officers in 1966 in Shepherd's Bush before going on the run for 96 days . Mr Clegg stressed that it was 'a decision not by Theresa… it's by the Probation Board'. He added: 'I understand that this provokes a lot of controversy, of course I do. 'But one of the founding principles of the way that we do justice in this country is that you have an independent bunch of people who look at the behaviour of offenders who are behind bars and make a judgement about whether someone can be released or not. And of course there's a role for the Home Secretary as well.' He admitted there 'are circumstances' in which Mrs May could block the release, but refused to say whether she should use the powers in the Roberts case. London Mayor Boris Johnson said people would be 'absolutely sickened' by the release . 'You quite understandably want to invite me to second guess judges, to second guess probation officers, to second guess Home Secretaries, taking decisions. Do you know what? On this occasion I'm not. 'I think I want to vigorously protect the system which allows decisions like this to take place, however controversial and unpopular they are. 'Because we have to have a system in which people for a whole range of grounds, whatever it can be compassionate grounds, grounds to do with rehabilitation, can be released from prison. 'The decision has been taken for this character to be released after 48 years in prison. 'You have to protect the integrity of people being able to decide whether someone is released in this case after 48 years. However unpopular it might be with some people. 'He is coming out of jail because that's what the probation panel board have decided.' Pressed again on whether Mrs May should use her powers as Home Secretary to intervene, Mr Clegg added: 'She has clearly decided not to.' Downing Street insisted it was a decision for the Parole Board. David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister will very much understand the strength of feeling that this case will provoke. 'Of course there is very rightly and understandably a widely held view among the British public that the murder of policemen and women is a particularly heinous act. 'He very much understands the strength of feeling.' A spokesman for the Parole Board said: 'We can confirm that a three member panel of the Board has directed the release of Harry Roberts. 'The decision to release is a matter for the Board, which is independent - arrangements and the date of the release are a matter for the Secretary of State for Justice. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individuals. 'The release of life sentence prisoners is directed by the independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely managed in the community. 'Once released, they are subject to strict controls for as long as their risk requires them. If they fail to comply with these conditions, they can be immediately returned to prison. 'Offenders managed through multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPAs) are monitored and supervised by probation, police and other agencies.'","Deputy PM insists the Parole Board's decision must be respected .

"Linda and John Pruvedenti who are from Bridgwater, Somerset, send out cards, money and letters abroad to hardened criminals, including  murderers, child abusers and robbers, at America's toughest prisons . A middle-aged couple from Britain have developed a rather unusual hobby to occupy their time: writing to killers on death row. Linda and John Pruvedenti from Bridgwater, Somerset, have spent the last six years writing to hardened criminals at some of America's toughest prisons. The couple began writing to death row inmates in 2008, after John, 53, gave up work to look after Linda, 51, who suffers from a debilitating bowel condition called diverticulitis. Now the former American Air Force soldier and his wife, who have been married for 31 years, dedicate their time to sending cards, money and hand-written letters to prisoners convicted of heinous crimes including murder, child abuse and robbery. Mr Pruvedenti said: 'We are big believers in forgiveness, and we think that if people are remorseful for their crimes then they should be punished under the law but also be forgiven. 'Somehow we have always picked up the waifs and strays, and writing to death row inmates allows us to reach out to those who have gone down the wrong path in life - often through no fault of their own. 'People may think that what we do is strange, but for us it is a way to help people who need it.' Devout Christians, Linda and John married in 1983 after a mutual friend set them up on a blind date. They soon realised they both had a passion for helping the disadvantaged, which Linda accredits to surviving a difficult childhood. After spotting an internet advert for death row pen pals in 2008, Linda started writing letters to American prisoners - with the full support of John. Now the mother-of-two estimates she has built friendships with at least 10 inmates. Ms Pruvedenti said: 'I have a natural empathy for people who have haven't had the best start in life, as I believe we all could so easily have been born into a different family and chosen an alternative path. 'I use my own experience of a difficult childhood to help others who haven't been so fortunate. 'It doesn't bother me that these people have been convicted of terrible crimes - as long as they are remorseful, they deserve forgiveness.' One of the couple's most notorious pen pals is child-killer Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, who was executed by lethal injection in September after serving eight years on Texas death row for starving her girlfriend's son to death in July 2004. At the time of his death, her victim, nine-year-old Devontae Williams, had more than 250 scars on his body and weighed just 35lbs. Scroll down for video . Linda and John's pen pals included child-killer Lisa Ann Coleman (left) who was executed by lethal injection in September after serving eight years on Texas death row for starving Devontae Williams, 9 (right), to death . Dressed in only bandages and a nappy, he had been beaten and bound - with police estimating he had been dead for several hours before paramedics were called to the scene. The couple befriended Ms Ann Coleman during her time on death row and wrote to her for six years, sending Easter and Christmas cards, along with money and personal letters about their lives. Describing her as a 'true friend' and 'loving mother', the couple say they developed a special bond with Ms Ann Coleman, whose last words were 'God bless you all'. Linda said: 'Her letters were always lovely to read. She was so caring, and would always be asking how our children were and writing about how her own children were getting on. 'Over the years, we became close friends and I'd confide in her about my marriage and personal things that I felt perhaps I couldn't confide even in my friends back home. 'People might say that Lisa was a child-killer, but to me she was my friend.' Linda and John hold up a selection of the letters written between them and the executed child-killer Lisa Ann Coleman, and Linda says 'it's not nice not nice to be writing to someone and then for them to suddenly be dead' Ms Ann Coleman's letters, which were signed off with 'Always, Lisa', document her son's struggles with the law and his spells in and out of prison. She also wrote of her hopes to appeal her sentence, and included uplifting quotes and poems, including one titled 'God's Love'. In one letter, she writes: 'Our children need our prayers'. In another, she expresses concern over cysts found on her ovaries. Ms Ann Coleman also spoke of the devil, stating: 'The devil has came to steal, kill and destroy' (sic). Shortly before her execution, Ms Ann Coleman expressed her wish to finally meet John and Linda, writing: 'I pray one day God will bless us to meet face to face'. Lisa Ann Coleman was executed by lethal injection . They name prisoners convicted of heinous crimes including murder, child abuse and robbery as their ‘friends’, and among Linda and John Pruvedenti’s pen pals is a notorious child killer. Lisa Ann Coleman, 38, was jailed for starving her girlfriend's son to death in July 2004. At the time of his death, her victim, nine-year-old Devontae Williams, had more than 250 scars on his body and weighed just 35lbs. Dressed in only bandages and a nappy, he had been beaten and bound - with police estimating he had been dead for several hours before paramedics were called to the scene. Ms Coleman, of Arlington, Texas, was found guilty of the capital murder of little Williams, . She was executed by lethal injection in September after serving eight years on Texas death row. Her last words were directed at her fellow inmate, Darlie Routier. Ms Coleman said: 'Tell them I finished strong.’ She then smiled and blew kisses at the supporters at her execution, and added: 'God bless you all.' No one showed up to represent the victim, nine-year-old Davontae. Whilst Mr and Ms Pruvedenti believe that more people should write to death row inmates, they do admit that it has its disadvantages. Ms Pruvedenti said: 'It's not nice to be writing to someone and then for them to suddenly be dead. 'We hadn't heard from Lisa for a while, and then I saw an article on the internet that said she had been executed - which explained why. 'It would have been lovely to meet Lisa, but unfortunately we just couldn't afford the plane tickets to Texas. 'I truly believe that if we had met in different circumstances, we would have still been friends. She was a kind, loving person and wasn't the monster that people made her out to be. 'Although what she did was wrong, and she fully deserved to be punished, I don't think she deserved to die. 'Lisa wasn't just a convicted murderer, she was our friend - and we will always keep her letters close to our hearts.'","Linda and John Pruvedenti began writing to hardened killers back in 2008 .

"For the first time, water ice has been spotted in images of craters on the planet Mercury by Nasa’s Messenger spacecraft. The groundbreaking discovery reveals the shape and size of the ice in the planet’s polar regions. It might also help us discover how water was transported to other planets in the solar system such as Mars and Earth. Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory have spotted ice in visible image of Mercury for the first time. One area was Kandinsky crater, near Mercury's north pole. On the right is a higher contrast image of the crater, revealing an expanse of ice on its floor . Water ice was speculated to exist on Mercury by Messenger back in 2012. However, this is the first time ice has been seen in visible images of the surface. Found in permanently shadowed craters, it is thought to be tens of metres thick but may extend over vast regions of the crater floors. In addition the ice may be relatively young, on the order of just ten or 100 million years. For all its bland 'dead' appearance, Mercury is a very interesting place . It is the smallest planet in our solar system - only slightly larger than the Earth's moon. On its sunward half, the planet sizzles at a temperature of 427°C (800°F) while its night side maintains –173°C (–280°F). This means that while one side is cold enough to freeze water, the other quickly boils anything on the surface. It is the closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 36 million miles (58 million km) or 0.39 AU (one AU is the Earth-sun distance). Mercury has a solid iron core that measures more than half the planet's diameter. Earth, by contrast, has a solid core that's just 9.5 per cent of its overall girth. One day on Mercury takes 58 Earth days and 15 hours. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days. Why the ice can only exist in these craters, and not elsewhere on the surface, is due to Mercury's position in the solar system. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, at an average distance of just 36 million miles (58 million kilometres). It completes a rotation about once every 58 Earth days, meaning that its entire surface is subjected to the full brunt of the sun. Without an atmosphere to protect the surface the temperatures reach a scorching 427°C (800°F) in the day this drops to -173°C (-280°F) at night. These huge fluctuations make it impossible for ice or water to form on most of the surface. However, in the polar regions of Mercury, some of the crater floors stay in endless shadow. As the planet rotates it tilts in such a way that sunlight can never enter some of the craters at these extreme regions, so they stay eternally dark. This means that ice can survive, as it is never heated to a high temperature by the sun and instead stays far below zero. Back in 2012, Nasa spotted water ice in its permanently shadowed craters through a number of indirect methods. But with these new images the ice has now been directly imaged, something Dr Nancy Chabot, the Instrument Scientist for Messenger, tells MailOnline is ‘very exciting’. This close-up of the Kandinsky crater image shows the ice in more detail. Dr Chabot tells MailOnline it is likely tens of metres thick but may extend across almost the entirety of the crater floor. How the ice came to be there though is somewhat of a mystery. It may have been carried by a comet . This image reveals the permanently shadowed surface within Prokofiev crater, the largest crater in Mercury's north polar region. The area in yellow, a zoomed in segment of the pink rectangle, is thought to be water ice residing inside the crater . ‘The main implications, aside from it being cool to see ice on Mercury, is that these cold traps are cold enough to have had ice for billions of years,’ says Dr Chabot. However it’s thought that some of the ice was deposited fairly recently in cosmic terms, perhaps just ten or 100 million years ago. ‘Even though you have water ice, we don’t think there’s the other things you need to have life,’ she explains. ‘We might not have life there, but understanding the delivery of water from the early solar system to Earth, Mars and other places that might have life. Understanding how water was distributed has implications for the solar system.’ To find the ice the researchers zeroed in on craters that had previously been identified to have bright material that could be ice. This included Prokofiev, the largest crater in Mercury’s north polar region. By increasing the contrast in images, the ice in the crater floor was revealed. Dr Chabot adds that the discovery may indicate ice formation on Mercury is something that is still continuing today. But, most importantly, ice was likely taken to the planet by comets. It is thought that other planets in the solar system, including Earth, had water and possibly life delivered in this way. Discovering how this ice came to be on Mercury could, in turn, reveal the origins of our own water and ice on Earth, and even ourselves. Messenger (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is a Nasa-sponsored scientific investigation of the planet Mercury and the first space mission designed to orbit the planet closest to the Sun. It entered orbit around Mercury on 17 March 2011 .","Scientists  have spotted ice in visible image of Mercury for the first time .

"Jose Canseco has broken down in a TV interview over the gun accident that saw him accidentally blow off his own finger and almost shoot his fiancee . The overcome former Major League Baseball star was told he will never regain full use of his left hand after the weapon discharged while he was cleaning it at his Las Vegas home on Tuesday . But it's a price he's willing to pay for the safety on his future wife, swimsuit model Leila Knight. Now recuperating after doctors reattached the digit in an emergency surgery, the 51-year-old burst into tears as he explained what happened to Inside Edition on Thursday. 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table,' Canseco said in the interview. Scroll down for video . Accident: Jose Canseco explains how he shot his own finger off in a TV interview on Thursday. He was supported by his fiance, Leila Knight, who called 911 following the incident . Overcome: Canseco bursts into tears as he traces back what happened inside his Las Vegas home . '(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed Knight, who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid. 'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition. Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911. 'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said. 'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.'

The incident occurred in the kitchen of the Vegas house at about 3pm Tuesday. In an interview with The New York Daily News, Knight said her husband had been at a shooting range a few days earlier. He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded. 'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper. 'The doctors said they would either have to amputate or do reconstructive surgery. 'But if they do surgery, he won’t be able to use it again. 'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.' Knight reiterated the situation could have been much worse, and that she could have been shot. Canseco was injured at his Las Vegas home Tuesday afternoon.

"The Colorado Supreme Court starts hearing arguments Tuesday in a case that may determine how employers handle hiring and firing of marijuana users. In spite of pot being legal in Colorado, employers can still fire employees for their toking habits, as being a pot smoker is not yet a protected class. The case was brought to the court by Brendan Coats, 35, a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish Network in 2010 after marijuana was found in his system. Scroll down for video . Fired: Brendan Coats, 35, was let go from Dish Network after failing a random drug test in 2010, in spite of medical marijuana being legal . Coats began using medical marijuana at a doctor's urging to calm violent muscle spasms that interfered with his ability to work. The spasms were due to Coats's being paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager. The firing came after a random drug test was administered to Coats after he had been employed with Dish Network for three years. Coats apparently informed his supervisors ahead of time he would fail the test, since THC, the active ingredient in pot, stays in the system for weeks after it enters the body. The Associated Press reports that Coats's lawyers are challenging his firing using a rule meant to ensure cigarette smokers cannot be targeted for smoking off the job. ;Attitudes are changing toward marijuana. Laws are going to have to change, too,' said Coats, who has not been able to find an employer who would hire him after Dish Network. 'I'd like for this to enable people like me to find employment without being looked down upon.' Dish Network has argued in complaints that companies like it in Colorado would have to keep employees with 'marijuana-induced performance problems,' and could lose federal contracts if Coats wins. Currently, Dish Network is using federal employment law, which bans marijuana use, to argue that their firing was legal. Colorado has led the fight for legalizing marijuana, with voters approving an initiative allowing medical marijuana use in 2000, followed by the approval of recreational marijuana in 2013.","Brendan Coats, 35, was fired by Dish Network, his employer of three years after a random drug test turned up signs of THC .

"State capitols across the country will be more Republican than at any point since the Roaring '20s when victorious legislators and governors take office next year. That could result in lower taxes and perhaps fewer dollars flowing to social safety net programs. A day after a big election, newly emboldened Republican state leaders already were making plans Wednesday to pursue deeper tax cuts, relax business regulations, expand private school vouchers and impose new limits on public welfare programs. In some states, such as Kansas, Republicans will be able to do as they want, because they control both chambers of the legislature and the governor's office. In others, such as neighboring Missouri, the Republicans' legislative supermajorities will be so large that they can essentially disregard the objections of a Democratic governor. In this photo taken on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2014, Republican Russ Diamond (left) celebrates his victory in the state House District 102 race at the Batdorf in Annville, Pa., by making confetti out of negative ads and tossing them in to the air . Elsewhere, like in New York, the Republican takeover of one legislative chamber simply means a stronger say in a state still otherwise led by Democrats. Nowhere in the entire nation did Democrats take over a legislative chamber previously held by Republicans. And Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett was the only Republican chief executive to fall to a Democratic challenger. For statehouse Republicans, 'it's their strongest position in nearly a century,' said Tim Storey, an analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Republicans will have full control of at least 29 state legislatures, according to the conference, the party's largest total since 1928, perhaps earlier. The GOP will hold at least 32 governorships, including newly won offices in traditionally Democratic Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts. In many cases, the Republican victories expanded majorities won in previous elections, such as the 2010 GOP sweep. Over the past several years, Republicans already have used those majorities to cut taxes, restrict abortions, expand gun rights and limit the powers of public employee unions. Those all remain high on the Republican agenda. 'We're going to focus on legislation that helps small businesses, whether that's taxes, labor or the regulatory environment,' said Missouri House Speaker-nominee John Diehl, whose Republican caucus now holds its highest-ever number of seats. The challenge for Republicans may be to constrain their enthusiasm, lest they go further than some voters had anticipated and complicate their chances of re-election in the future. After large GOP majorities in Kansas enacted widespread income tax cuts in recent years, the resulting budget difficulties turned Tuesday's election into a referendum on Republican Gov. Sam Brownback's financial policies. He narrowly won, as Republicans added to their ranks in the House. Brownback acknowledged at a victory party that 'it's a difficult time for many Kansas families' and 'jobs are scarce,' but he pledged to keep the state on the route he had charted. 'Our way is holding down taxes, holding down regulations, controlling spending,' Brownback said. Republican governors or legislative leaders in Maryland, Maine, New York, Texas and West Virginia also are already talking of tax cuts. Republican Eddie Smith, left, kisses his wife, Lana Keck Smith, after defeating Rep. Gloria Johnson in the 13th District of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2014, in Knoxville, Tenn. At right is their daughter Lauren . Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott has promised to make an expansion of school vouchers and charter schools a priority for his new Republican administration that will be paired with an even larger GOP majority in the House and Senate. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who won re-election along with an expanded GOP legislative majority, also wants to expand enrollment in a private school voucher program. His agenda includes drug tests for people seeking food stamps or unemployment benefits and more tax cuts on top of the $2 billion enacted during his first term. In Maine, Assistant Republican Senate Leader Roger Katz said that the new GOP-led Senate hopes to team with a Republican governor to implement 'sensible' changes to welfare programs, cut government spending, lower taxes and eliminate bureaucracy for businesses. The Republican victory in Arkansas was the largest since Reconstruction, with GOP candidates sweeping the statewide offices and building upon its legislative majorities. Republicans will have to decide whether to continue a program enacted under Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe that expanded health coverage to more than 200,000 people by using Medicaid money to buy private insurance. 'With these victories by the new Republicans — many of whom have voiced opposition to that — it really puts it in some real danger,' said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. 'The big test initially is what happens to the private option.'","Some majorities are so large that Republican state lawmakers can ignore objections from Democratic governors .

"A mother who police said was trying to avoid a fourth drink-driving offence was arrested after she was seen running beside a major motorway with her nine-month-old baby in a carrier, officials said. Kimberly Schumacher, 27, was taken into custody by a state trooper after she was spotted with her child next to the Interstate 94 near DeForest, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, police said in a statement. The Janesville woman was taken into custody by a Wisconsin State Patrol trooper who found her not far from her car with a strong smell of alcohol on her breath, the state patrol said. Kimberly Schumacher was arrested next to the Interstate 94 in Wisconsin after she had failed an alcohol test . Her baby was not injured and was turned over to the father, the statement added. Wisconsin state trooper Jana Schmudlach went to the scene along eastbound I-39/90/94 near DeForest after getting a call about a woman running along the highway, officers said. 'The baby had already been secured inside of an ambulance that had stopped to check on their welfare,' the release said. 'They were coming back from a call, ended up passing her and stopped to check on her,' Ms Schmudlach said. Ms Schumacher had returned to her pickup truck about 500 feet from the ambulance by the time Ms Schmudlach arrived. It wasn't clear why Ms Schumacher had stopped her pickup along the Interstate, but she admitted she had been driving, Ms Schmudlach added. Ms Schumacher failed a drink-driving test and was arrested and booked into the Dane County Jail. Her child was released to its father, who drove away in the pickup truck. A Wisconsin state trooper said Ms Schumacher's baby was unharmed and the girl's father later left with her . The woman was expected to be charged in Dane County Circuit Court with driving a car while drunk with a child under age 16.

"A single Dutch ship is scooping up a quarter of England’s fishing quota every year and landing it in Holland, it has emerged. Government statistics reveal the Cornelis Vrolijk, a giant 370ft trawler, holds 23 per cent of the limited fishing permits allocated to England by the EU. Campaigners last night called for loopholes to be closed so that domestic boats have more access to Britain’s tightly controlled fishing stocks. Government statistics reveal the Cornelis Vrolijk, a giant 370ft trawler, holds 23 per cent of the limited fishing permits allocated to England by the EU . Some 43 per cent of England’s fishing quota is held by foreign fishing businesses, according to figures published by Defra, the environment department. And an astonishing 32 per cent is held by five huge ships, the list reveals. European rules dating back to 1999 means that foreign-owned boats are allowed to access the UK quota - as long as half the crew is domiciled in Britain or half the catch is landed in a UK port. The firm which owns the 6,000-tonne Cornelis Vrolijk last night defended their position, insisting they run two British offices, pay UK corporation tax and employ 55 British fisherman. But campaigners say the fact the boat’s entire catch of mackerel, herring and blue whiting is unloaded in the Dutch port of IJmuiden and taken to a storage facility in Amsterdam makes a mockery of the quota system. Small British fishing vessels make up 80 per cent of the English fleet - but have just 4 per cent of the quota. Kirk Stribling, a fisherman from Aldeburgh, Suffolk, said: ‘The Government is not giving a fair share of quota to local fishermen who look after the sea and our communities.’ Sarah North, head of oceans campaign at Greenpeace, added: ‘The Government must reclaim our quota from the vice-like grip of big business and give more of it to local low impact fishers to rebuild fish stocks and revitalise our crumbling coastal communities.’ European rules dating back to 1999 means that foreign-owned boats are allowed to access the UK quota - as long as half the crew is domiciled in Britain or half the catch is landed in a UK port (File photo) But Stewart Harper, managing director of the North Atlantic Fishing Company, the English subsidiary of the Dutch firm which owns the Cornelis Vrolijk, insisted there is no British market for the low-value fish he is selling abroad. He added: ‘Although we are part of a Dutch-owned European group we operate two offices in the UK and we provide work for 55 British fishermen domiciled in the UK and eight people in our offices and have an annual wage bill in excess of £2million. We pay UK corporation tax on any profits we make and all of the other costs of UK establishment.’ A Defra spokesman said: ‘We value our local inshore fishing communities - in 2014 we increased their potential catch by 720 tonnes and continue to take steps to maximise use of the UK’s quota. ‘Any company applying to fish our quota must demonstrate a clear economic link to this country and all large UK flagged vessels, the great majority of which are UK crewed, make their catches in offshore waters that cannot be reached by local inshore fishermen. ‘We are currently working with devolved administrations on reviewing the economic value of all UK flagged vessels to ensure we get best value for our economy.’","Cornelis Vrolijk, a giant 370ft trawler, holds almost a quarter of limited fishing permits allocated to England by EU .
