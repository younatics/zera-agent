"Making mistakes while learning can benefit your ability to remember facts (stock image) and lead to the correct answer, but only if the guesses are close, researchers claim . Making mistakes while learning can boost your ability to remember facts and lead to the correct answer, but only if the guesses are close, researchers claim. A new study suggests that random guesses can actually harm people’s ability to remember a correct answer. But overall, it provides evidence that trial-and-error learning can benefit memory in both young and old. ‘Making random guesses does not appear to benefit later memory for the right answer , but near-miss guesses act as stepping stones for retrieval of the correct information – and this benefit is seen in younger and older adults,’ said Andrée-Ann Cyr, a graduate student at Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute and the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto. The research, which is published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, builds upon her previous work that found learning information by making mistakes is the best method for older people when trying to remember facts. Her first study raised eyebrows because scientific literature has traditionally recommended that older adults avoid making mistakes, unlike their younger peers who benefit from them. The latest study provides evidence that trial-and-error learning can benefit memory in both young and old when errors are meaningfully related to the right answer. But they can harm memory when they are not. In her experiment, 65 healthy younger adults with an average age of 22, and 64 healthy older adults with an average age of 72, learned target words such as ‘rose’ based either on the semantic category it belongs to – flower – or its word stem – a word that begins with the letters ‘ro’. For half of the words, participants were given the answer right away and for the other half, they were asked to guess at it before seeing the answer. They were asked, for example, ‘is it a tulip’ or for ro…, ‘is it a rope?’ The latest study provides evidence that trial-and-error learning can benefit memory in both young and old when errors are meaningfully related to the right answer, based on an experiment involving the world 'rose' - a rose is pictured. But they can harm memory when they are not . In a later memory test, participants were shown the categories or word stems and were asked for the correct answer. The researchers were interested in whether the participants were better at remembering a word if they had made close, but wrong, guess, rather than getting the answer correct on their first attempt. They discovered that guessing made memory worse when words were learned based on word stems in both younger and older adults. Ms Cyr and her colleagues think this is because our memory organises information based on how it is conceptually rather than lexically related to other information. For example, when you think of the word pear, your mind is more likely to jump to another fruit, such as apple, than to a word that looks similar, such as peer. Therefore, wrong guesses are only useful when they have something meaningful in common with right answers. The guess tulip may be wrong, but it is still conceptually close to the right answer of rose, because they are both flowers. They discovered that guessing made memory worse when words were learned based on word stems in both  older and younger adults (stock image). Ms Cyr and her colleagues think this is because our memory organises information based on how it is conceptually rather than lexically related to other information . Ms Cyr said that by guessing first as opposed to just reading the answer, people have to think harder about the information and make useful connections that can help memory. The study revealed that younger and older participants were more likely to remember the answer if they also remembered their wrong guesses - suggesting that these acted as stepping stones. By contrast, when guesses only had letters in common with answers, they cluttered a person’s memory because they could not cannot link them meaningfully. The word rope is nowhere close to rose in our memory. ‘The fact that this pattern was found for older adults as well shows that ageing does not influence how we learn from mistakes,’ Ms Cyr said. Dr Nicole Anderson, senior scientist with Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute and a co-author of the study, said: ‘These results have profound clinical and practical implications. They turn traditional views of best practices in memory rehabilitation for healthy seniors on their head by demonstrating that making the right kind of errors can be beneficial. ‘They also provide great hope for lifelong learning and guidance for how seniors should study.’","Researchers from Baycrest's Rotman Research Institute, Toronto, proved older and younger people learn facts better by making near-miss mistakes .

"Revolutionary: The Flow boiler looks much like any other, but it will generate electricity . A new boiler could slash energy bills for families by turning their homes into mini power stations. The gas boiler – designed by a British firm – provides heating and hot water, while also fuelling an electricity generator to power household appliances. Its maker claims that as well as making electricity bills cheaper, the boiler may eventually allow conventional power stations to be closed. The company, Flow Energy, said it will provide the boilers – the first of which are due to be installed early next year – without householders paying for them up-front. Instead the firm will be paid over five years through a monthly supplement on bills. Crucially, this supplement should be cancelled out by savings on electricity as households generate their own power. This means energy bills will be no cheaper to begin with – but once the initial five-year contract is up, families will start to see considerable savings. They will use some of the electricity themselves, while any excess can be put into the National Grid. Flow claims households could eventually save £500 a year through a combination of lower electricity bills and selling excess energy. If homeowners agree to split the benefits with the company, it will continue to provide a warranty on the generator after the five-year contract is up. In a conventional boiler, gas is burned to heat water, which then passes through the home’s pipes and radiators. By contrast, gas in a Flow boiler heats another liquid – a coolant similar to that used in refrigerators – until it evaporates. The vapour then moves through a device called a scroll expander, which starts to spin, acting as a mini electricity generator. Scroll down for video . How it works: The boiler works much like a conventional one - except that it contains a generator that produces electricity as well as helping to heat the home . The heat from the vapour is then transferred to water in the boiler, which flows into the home’s taps and radiators. Adding this extra stage in the process does use slightly more gas. But Flow estimates the cost of this to be no more than £50 a year, which it says is easily cancelled out by the savings on electricity bills. Initially, although the equipment itself is free, customers will need to pay to have the boiler installed. At the same time, they must sign up with Flow for a minimum of five years, accepting its tariffs without the option of shopping around for a cheaper deal. The boiler also only generates electricity when the heating is on, so its output will be greatly reduced during the summer. Testing testing: The Flow boilers are currently being prepared for a launch in January 2015 . But Flow said it can still generate around 1800kWh of electricity a year – about half of what a typical household needs. Flow’s chief executive Tony Stiff said it is much more efficient to generate electricity close to the point of use than in a power station. The company claims that if 20million Flow boilers were installed across the UK, consumers would save more than £4billion a year on bills. It also says the reduction in carbon emissions would be equivalent to shutting 30 coal-fired power stations.","Flow Energy say their boilers could lead to normal power stations closing .

"A grandmother has defender her toyboy lover who was jailed for beating a stranger unconscious - and wants to marry him behind bars. Christopher Bradbury, 25, was drunk when he punched, kicked and stamped on Simon Bloor in Stoke in August last year. Bradbury, 25, pleaded guilty to actual bodily harm and three counts of dealing heroin, but his fiancee Wendy Hulme, who is twice his age, says she wants to marry her 'teddy bear' before he is released from prison. Christopher Bradbury, 25, was jailed for beating a man unconscious and for dealing heroin, but his fiancee Wendy Hulme, who is twice his age, says she wants to marry him in prison . Bradbury admitted three charges of supplying heroin, as well as the vicious attack, at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday. He was caught dealing the class A drugs by an undercover police officer. Jailing Bradbury for three years and four months, Judge David Fletcher said: 'This was a sustained and serious assault on a vulnerable victim where you used your foot as a weapon. 'The assault was an assault that you have little memory of because of your abuse of alcohol. You were unable to know what sparked this confrontation but it was prolonged attack. 'The reason you stopped was because members of the public felt they needed to intervene and quite rightly called the police. 'The injuries were not as serious as they might have been but there are ongoing effects of this assault.' But Miss Hulme, who has two children and two grandchildren, today defended her toyboy lover, saying that he is a 'little teddy bear really'. Toyboy lover: Bradbury, who drunkenly assaulted a stranger, is a 'little teddy bear really', Miss Hulme said . The couple met at a pub 15 months ago and plan to marry at HMP Dovegate, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. Miss Hulme said: 'I know Christopher better than anybody. I am not saying he is sweet and innocent but he has got feelings, he has got a very big heart and he is not the cold blooded person he has been made out to be. 'He has really calmed down. I know how it makes him look but he is a little teddy bear really. It was just a drunken mistake. 'I don't see that side of him, he is so good to me and so caring. 'He is having flashbacks and when he sees the pictures of the man he is absolutely sickened to the stomach by what he did. 'I was really upset but we were expecting the jail sentence. I am standing by him and we are hoping to get married. 'I would love all the nice things for the big day, it's every woman's dream, but I love him. It's not about the fanciness, I would just love to be his wife and I don't care where it happens. 'It isn't the best place but I have thought about it and I will marry him in there if it can go ahead.' Bradbury was jailed for three years and four months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Friday (file picture) During Bradbury's court case, prosecutor Joanne Barker said he had been shouting abuse at drivers before turning on Mr Bloor, 51, who was walking home after a night out on August 10 last year. She added: 'Simon Bloor was walking along Waterloo Road when he saw Bradbury shouting and screaming in the middle of the road. 'Mr Bloor walked past him and the defendant walked up to him and asked him what he was looking at. 'Mr Bloor started to walk away but he felt a heavy blow to his head. The defendant proceeded to punch, kick and stamp on him repeatedly, many of the blows were aimed at his head. 'Passers-by called out for the defendant to stop, some of them ran over to intervene, but Bradbury continued. 'Mr Bloor was unconscious on the ground and was helped up by members of the public. The defendant was still trying to get at him. 'Mr Bloor was helped into a nearby house before being taken to hospital. It was suspected he had sustained a fractured jaw and eye socket but fortunately he was found to have a multiple bruises and swelling. 'The defendant was arrested and he denied being part of the assault, but he was later identified in an identity parade.' Defending, Andrew Turnock said: 'Christopher Bradbury is 25 and has a number of previous convictions as a petty offender. 'He accepts responsibility for this incident, the injuries mercifully, weren't as serious as they could be. But this was a sustained attack and the victim was vulnerable. 'He feels remorse. He's embarrassed and ashamed by the injuries he's caused to this gentleman. 'He has been in a relationship with a lady who has been a mature and stabilising influence for him. 'He has a wedding arranged at Dovegate Prison for next month. He looks forward to engaging in his marriage upon his release.'","Christopher Bradbury admitted dealing heroin and assaulting a stranger .

"Ex-Team Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke's two-year ban from cycling was upheld after UK Anti-Doping rejected his claim that irregular blood samples were the result of an alcohol binge. Tiernan-Locke's ban was confirmed by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) on Monday, a month after it was announced by the International Cycling Union (UCI). Sky terminated his contract after the UCI's announcement on July 17. The 29-year-old was found to have breached anti-doping rules when anomalies were found in his biological passport based on samples taken in September 2012. Banned: Former Sky rider Jonathan Tiernan-Locke has had his two-year ban for irregular blood samples upheld . He was asked to explain those anomalies at a hearing last month, where he claimed he had gone on a drinking binge with his girlfriend to celebrate securing a two-year deal with Team Sky. According to a doctor presenting evidence on behalf of Tiernan-Locke, he consumed around 33 units of alcohol in a period of six hours on the evening of September 20, which then resulted in dehydration ahead of the sample being taken on the morning of September 22. Thrown out: Tiernan-Locke claimed that his results were because of an alcohol binge with his girlfriend . The UKAD statement said 'the explanation provided by the rider...did not sufficiently explain the abnormal values obtained from the sample'. Tiernan-Locke's ban, which runs until December 31 2015 was therefore upheld, while he has been stripped of his 2012 Tour of Britain victory and his 19th place at the 2012 UCI Road World Championships.","Tiernan-Locke was banned on July 17 after anomalies were found in his biological passport .

"A wave of suicide bombings carried out by Islamic State militants inside Iraq has left scores of people dead, including a police chief responsible for organizing tribal opposition to the terror group. Brigadier General Ahmed al-Dulaimi was killed by a road bomb while traveling in a convoy near Ramadi in the western Anbar province yesterday in an attack that dealt a major blow to Iraqi security forces struggling to combat ISIS extremists. His death occurred as a triple suicide bombing in Qara Tappah in eastern Iraq 58 people, while three car bombs and a suicide blast in the capital Baghdad left a further 45 people dead on Saturday.

Fear: Women look at vehicles destroyed in two car bomb attacks in the Shaoula neighbourhood of Baghdad . Yesterday's triple suicide bombing took place in Qara Tappah in ethnically mixed Diyala province, an official from the Kurdish Asayish security forces said. He said the first bomber detonated an explosives vest at the gateway to a security compound that also houses the office of a main Kurdish political party. Minutes later, two suicide bombers plowed cars filled with explosives into the compound, causing heavy damage. The Islamic State extremist group claimed the attack, saying it was carried out by three foreign jihadists. The authenticity of the online statement could not be independently verified, but it was posted on a Twitter account frequently used by the militant group. The group has seized towns in volatile Diyala province and has clashed with Kurdish forces there. Hospital officials confirmed the casualties. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Remains: Cars destroyed by Saturday's attacks in Baghdad are seen abandoned by the side of the road . Bashir al-Dalawi, a member of the Qara Tappah municipal council, where the attacks took place, said that the bombs detonated near a government building, leading to the higher death toll. He says at least 107 people were wounded in the attack, adding that some of the wounded were sent to hospital in the Kurdish self-ruled region for treatment. Meanwhile in Anbar, police chief al-Dulaimi was killed while traveling in a convoy north of the provincial capital Ramadi through an area cleared by Iraqi security forces just one day earlier. Anbar councilman Faleh al-Issawi said. It was not immediately clear if others were killed or wounded. ISIS and their Sunni allies seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year. The loss of Fallujah - where American troops engaged in some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S.-led war in the country - foreshadowed the later loss of Mosul and much of northern Iraq.

Iraq's Interior Ministry confirmed al-Dulaimi's death, calling him a 'hero who set a good example for self-sacrifice.' It praised his role in reorganizing the provincial police force and leading major fighting that caused heavy casualties among the militants. The attack in Anbar followed a bloody day in the capital, Baghdad, where a series of car bomb attacks killed at least 45 people in Shiite-majority areas. The Islamic State group also claimed responsibility for those attacks. On Saturday the U.S. military said it launched airstrikes north and west of Baghdad, hitting a small Islamic State fighting unit and destroying armed vehicles.The UK participated in the airstrikes.

"Acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people, experts said today. Their new study found real acupuncture using needles and lasers was no more helpful than sham acupuncture. It specifically looked at the effects of acupuncture on chronic knee pain in people aged 50 or over. Rana Hinman, lead author from the University of Melbourne, said the team of researchers were surprised at their results. She said: 'It is surprising that our study showed acupuncture was not effective compared to sham acupuncture, because many people with chronic knee pain report that treatment with acupuncture is beneficial for their symptoms.' Scientists in Australia found acupuncture does not improve chronic knee pain in middle-aged people. File photo . Previous studies has found acupuncture is effective, although the benefits compared to mock acupuncture have been generally small and of questionable benefit, she said. Her team found many people over the age of 50 are plagued with chronic knee pain, and many turn to alternative treatments, including acupuncture. Acupuncturists often use a combination of traditional Chinese and Western techniques with needles and low-intensity lasers. But the effectiveness of laser acupuncture has been questioned, the researchers said. To test whether needle or laser acupuncture is more effective than no acupuncture, the scientists divided 282 patients over the age of 50 with chronic knee pain and morning stiffness into four groups. The knee pain targeted in the study is common with osteoarthritis - the result of normal joint wear and tear over the years. One group received no acupuncture at all. Another received needle acupuncture, another laser acupuncture, while the last group received sham laser acupuncture. Patients received eight to 12 treatments over three months. Each treatment session lasted about 20 minutes. The laser and sham laser treatments looked the same to both patients and acupuncturists, but the laser was not turned on for the sham group. The patients rated their average knee pain and physical function on questionnaires at the beginning of the study, after three months of treatment and again at one year. There were 'modest improvements' in pain at three months in the needle and laser acupuncture groups compared to the no-treatment group, but not compared to the sham group. Researchers looked at the effects of laser acupuncture, pictured, and needle treatment on 282 patients. File picture . And there were no differences between any of the groups on measures of knee pain and function after one year. This suggests that there were no 'real' or 'direct' effects of needle or laser acupuncture, Dr Hinman said. The improvements patients felt were likely due to the placebo effect. 'Acupuncture tends to be more effective for people who believe in the benefits of acupuncture,' she said. 'In our study, people did not know that were signing up for an acupuncture study, so our participants were less likely to be 'believers' in acupuncture, which probably explains why acupuncture was ineffective in our study.' The new results are very similar to those of a review of individual patient data in 2012, said Andrew Vickers. Dr Vickers, who led the previous review, is an attending research methodologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and was not involved in the new study. The new review may have found a benefit from real acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture if the study included more people, he said. 'About three million Americans try acupuncture per year, and chronic pain is the most common indication,' he said. People with chronic pain should see a pain specialist, as there are many options for treatment, including acupuncture, he said. 'As the authors suggest, the findings of this study are applicable to patients with moderate to severe persistent knee pain, and acupuncture may be effective in some people with neuropathic (nerve related) pain,' said Dr. Abhishek Abhishek, an arthritis researcher and associate professor at the University of Nottingham. The UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence and Health does not recommend acupuncture for treating knee osteoarthritis, but does recommend it for persistent low back pain as it can be effective in that scenario, Dr Abhishek, who was not part of the new study, said. As alternatives to acupuncture, Dr Hinman said physical therapy, knee braces and exercise can all help alleviate chronic knee pain. The new study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.","New study found needle and laser acupuncture was no more helpful than sham acupuncture in middle-aged patients with chronic knee pain .

"Representatives from Barcelona are in London in the hope of thrashing out a deal for Thomas Vermaelen as they face a straight with Manchester United to sign the defender. The 28-year-old has been the subject of bids from both the Catalans and United this summer, with Arsene Wenger confirming that the latter have lodged a formal bid. Barcelona have sent director Raul Senlleh to London for talks in the hope of signing the player and Arsenal are receptive to selling to Spain. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Vermaelen absent as Bould takes defensive session at Emirates' On his way? Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen could be moving to Barcelona . Nowhere to be seen! Vermaelen wasn't training with Arsenal on Thursday because of a hamstring injury . As with the transfer of Robin van Persie in 2012, they do not wish to strengthen their rivals in spite of Vermaelen's indifferent form in recent seasons. United are mindful of the real figures Barcelona present as opposed to some that are being leaked; they will pay a reasonable value but believe the player will, like Van Persie, ask to join them ahead of Luis Enrique's Barca. Vermaelen's days at the Emirates Stadium are numbered after he played just 14 times in the Premier League for Wenger's side last season. He isn't training with the Gunners at the moment because of a niggling hamstring injury and it remains unclear as to where he'll be playing his football this year. In to the final year of his contract, Vermaelen is almost certain to leave the club. Barcelona have lodged a bid of around £10million. Who are you texting, Thomas? The Arsenal defender was out with his girlfriend Polly Parsons on Thursday . Wenger said: 'Manchester United are part of the group (of bidders). 'Vermaelen could leave us because he needs to play now. We're in a position where it's difficult to stand in his way. 'We would prefer to sell him aboard. That is an option. We have offers from abroad as well. We have bids. You will know very soon.' One player who could replace Vermaelen is Calum Chambers, who Arsenal signed for £16million from Southampton. The 19-year-old played at right-back last season in his debut campaign in the Premier League but Wenger believes the youngster is ready to make an impact at the heart of his defence. 'Can he play every week? Maybe not, he is 19 years old but he can play a major role,' Wenger said. 'He has the qualities to impose his quality in this part of the team (central defence) and I believe he can play in defensive midfield as well. 'I believe he is good value for money. He is 19 and a promising talent . Decisions: Vermaelen moved to Arsenal from Dutch side Ajax in 2009 and was once a crucial cog . 'As a manager you believe in the players when you buy them - we spent a lot of money on him but overall, in the long-term, it is money well spent. 'When the players play at the top for a long period you can never say it's expensive. It is expensive now but I don't regret it.' Meanwhile, Arsenal remain keen on Manchester City's Matija Nastasic and a £15m bid will get the player. United have not made an offer for Juan Cuadrado of Fiorentina and are not talking to Borussia Dortmund over Mats Hummels. No offer has been made for Marco Reus either.","Barcelona officials in London to talk to defender's representatives .

"Former . Rangers owner Sir David Murray was satisfied but far from triumphant . after further legal victory in the so-called 'big tax case'. A . judge largely dismissed Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' appeal . against a first-tier tribunal (FTT) majority verdict which decreed in . November 2012 that a £46.2million tax demand on Murray's company, most . of which referred to oldco Rangers, be 'reduced substantially'. The . victory was qualified as Lord Doherty referred an unknown number of . termination payments and five 'guaranteed bonus' payments back to the . original tribunal but Murray International Holdings (MIH) scored another . win. Reaction: Former Rangers owner Sir David Murray said there 'were no winners' in tax case . The judge agreed with the argument put forward at the upper-tier tribunal (UTT), that several other payments, including to Murray himself, were not special cases and fell under the FTT's contention that they were loans and not earnings. But, like the earlier ruling, the latest decision has no bearing on the Rangers of today, the club having been relaunched in June 2012 following the destructive reign of Craig Whyte. MIH stated that the investigation into the near-decade use of Employee Benefit Trusts, which stopped before they were outlawed in 2010, had effectively put off respected potential buyers as the firm called for an ongoing police probe into Whyte's takeover to be stepped up. Murray, apparently under pressure from his bankers to recoup a club overdraft of about £18million amid huge debts in his own business empire, sold Rangers to Whyte in May 2011 in what turned out to be the most disastrous transaction in the history of Scottish football. Whyte mortgaged future season-ticket sales to pay off the bank debt and accrued new tax debts which forced the club into administration and ultimately liquidation, after HMRC rejected an £8.5million rescue deal. In a statement a spokesman for MIH said the firm was pleased with a judgement that leaves 'negligible tax liability', although HMRC is considering a fresh challenge. Victory: A judge largely dismissed Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs' appeal over 'big tax case' The spokesman added: 'The decision substantially reduces HMRC's claim in the liquidation of the old Rangers Football Club. 'While we have been successful in both the FTT and UTT, there are, as we have stated previously, no victors. 'This . has been an exceptionally long, difficult and expensive process . involving not just the FTT and UTT but also several approaches to . resolve the matter with senior HMRC officials on a commercially sensible . basis for all parties which were rejected. 'MIH has, at all times, . recognised that the tax tribunal proceedings stemmed from arrangements . put in place during its ownership. They were introduced before . legislative changes removed the tax efficiency of such arrangements from . the end of 2010. 'However, it is obvious that the much publicised . existence of these proceedings overshadowed Rangers Football Club for . many years and tarnished the external perception of its value. 'There . can be little doubt that despite favourable legal opinion, potential . acquirers were therefore dissuaded from pursuing their interest during a . period in which we were marketing the sale of MIH's shareholding. 'The . case has also stimulated extensive press and social media comment, . discussion and speculation, a significant quantity of which has been ill . informed. Exempt: The court ruling had no bearing on current Rangers set-up . 'During proceedings, it would have been entirely . inappropriate for us to highlight fundamental misunderstandings or . contribute to this public debate. 'Notwithstanding all of this, it is . abundantly clear that Rangers Football Club would not have gone into . administration or liquidation had the purchaser fulfilled its . contractual obligations and responsibilities. 'Similar to the . resolution of the UTT appeal, we hope that the relevant authorities . conclude their investigations and commence proceedings at the earliest . opportunity.' As well as making a huge impact on the ownership of . Rangers, the EBT issue also raised the prospect of the club being . stripped of titles over their use of 'side letters' detailing . extra-contractual payments to players that were not registered with the . football authorities. Oldco Rangers were ultimately handed a . meaningless £250,000 fine by a Scottish Premier League-appointed . commission for failing to declare payments but this issue was ruled . irrelevant by the tribunal. Lord Doherty's ruling read: 'The appeal is dismissed except in so far as it relates to the termination payments. 'I . shall remit the case to the FTT (i) with a direction to allow the . taxpayers' appeals against the assessments relating to the payments to . the sub-trusts of Sir David Murray, his sons, Mr McClelland and Mr . MacMillan; (ii) to proceed as accords in relation to the termination . payments, the payments in respect of guaranteed bonuses, and any related . questions of grossing up.' A statement from HMRC read: 'We are . naturally disappointed with today's decision and are considering an . appeal. We win around 80 per cent of cases taken to litigation by . taxpayers. 'The company, Rangers Football Club PLC, did not go into . liquidation because of this tax case. It's a matter of public record . that Rangers was placed in administration by its principal shareholder . and director because it was unable to pay its creditors, including HMRC. 'HMRC . voted against the Company Voluntary Arrangement issued by the . administration. Liquidation allows a full investigation into the conduct . of the owners and financial officers which would not be possible in a . CVA. 'At the time of liquidation, published court papers show that . the undisputed tax that was owed by the company was approximately . £21million. 'This is an entirely separate issue from the amount in dispute due to the former owner's use of the EBT scheme.'","Murray said there were 'no victors' after court ruling .

"The US has space for just nine Ebola patients at specialized hospitals, according to officials. Once these spots run out, patients who contract the deadly virus will be treated where they are. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be sent to help care for them and ensure precautions are taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The US has space for just nine Ebola patients at specialized hospitals, according to officials . Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan and both have been diagnosed with Ebola - they have been moved to specialized hospitals with biocontainment units in the past few days . The US has four hospitals that have specially-designed bio-containment units, with a total of about a dozen places for highly-infectious or dangerous cases, USA Today reported. Once those spaces are filled, any new Ebola patients would have to be treated in regular hospitals, which help from CDC specialists. The virus has killed more than 4,000 people, almost all of them in West Africa, but infections are increasing in the West. Thomas Eric Duncan died on October 8, a week after he became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, and two weeks since he first sought treatment at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Two nurses involved in his care – Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 – have since been diagnosed with the virus, raising serious questions about the hospital's procedures. Ms Vinson, in a yellow hazmat suit, boarded a plane bound for Emory  on Wednesday . Ms Vinson was then seen being loaded into an ambulance (pictured) to be taken to Emory University Hospital, which has three beds in its biocontainment unit . Avoid direct contact with sick patients as the virus is spread through contaminated body fluids . Wear goggles to protect eyes . Clothing and clinical waste should be incinerated and any medical equipment that needs to be kept should be decontaminated . People who recover from Ebola should abstain from sex or use condoms for three months . The two nurses have been moved from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to specialized hospitals with biocontainment units in the past few days. Dallas nurse Ms Pham was diagnosed with Ebola on Sunday and is expected to be moved to the Special Clinical Studies Unit of the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, which has two specialized beds. Ms Vinson,  the other Dallas nurse to contract Ebola from Duncan, was diagnosed with Ebola on Wednesday and moved to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, later that night. Emory has one or two beds in its biocontainment unit. Freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is currently being treated at Nebraska Medical Center, which has 10 specialized beds. But hospital officials told ABC News that it has the capacity to handle only two or three patients at a time. The final hospital with a specialized biocontainment unit is St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana, which has the capacity to handle three patients. At present it is not treating any Ebola patients. US President Barack Obama is considering appointing an Ebola 'czar' to help tackle the deadly virus . CDC Director Thomas Frieden faced hard questions from members of Congress yesterday about how the nurses became infected while caring for Duncan. He has since admitted he should have sent a bigger team to Dallas after the initial diagnosis. This was despite him making a prediction in August that major hospitals would be equipped to tackle the disease. He also confessed it was a mistake to allow Ms Vinson to board a commercial flight despite her alarmingly high temperature. US President Barack Obama has said the risk of Americans getting the virus is 'extremely low', although he has ordered a 'much more aggressive response'. Obama has said he is considering appointing an Ebola 'czar' as the lead U.S. coordinator in the effort to contain the virus.","The US only has space for nine Ebola patients at specialized hospitals .

"Jesse Lingard's chances of impressing Louis van Gaal in the coming weeks have suffered a blow after the Manchester United midfielder was pictured leaving hospital on crutches and with his right leg in a brace. The 21-year-old made his Premier League debut against Swansea on Saturday but lasted just 24 minutes after being injured in a challenge with Ashley Williams. Lingard received treatment on his leg while on the pitch but was unable to continue. He eventually limped off and was replaced by Adnan Januzaj.

Chance: Lingard was injured in a challenge with Swansea's Ashley Williams on his first Premier League start . The severity of Lingard's injury remains unclear, but he looks certain to miss Sunday's trip to Sunderland. The former Birmingham and Brighton loanee, who needed crutches to leave Bridgewater Hospital in Manchester on Sunday, becomes the latest name to join Van Gaal's list of injured players. Jonny Evans, Rafael, Luke Shaw, Antonio Valencia, Danny Welbeck, Anderson and Michael Carrick all missed the 2-1 defeat by Garry Monk's side at Old Trafford. Lingard was employed in an unfamiliar right wing back role as United's new boss implemented his preferred 3-5-2 formation in his first Premier League match in charge.

"Ryan Reid, 27, terrorised his victims by turning up at their homes and workplaces and sent them dozens of sexual messages online . A police officer is facing jail after admitting stalking and harassing a string of young women. Ryan Reid, 27, terrorised his victims by turning up at their homes and workplaces and sent them dozens of sexual messages online. He also used his position to access confidential data about people who were not under investigation using police computers and disclosed it to others. The special constable sent naked pictures of himself to one of the women along with grossly offensive messages on Facebook. Reid, of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, who was stationed at Carluke Police Office, pleaded guilty to seven charges involving five women when he appeared at Lanark Sheriff Court. He carried out the offences between October, 2010, and March, 2013 and one of his victims was just 15 when he began contacting her. One of the women worked in a petrol station and Reid repeatedly turned up there while she was working alone over an eight-month period. He repeatedly loitered outside the home of another young women, sent her messages, approached her outside a pub and tried to arrange to meet her over a six-month period. After he was charged, Reid took to his Facebook page to complain that he had just been trying to be a 'nice guy'. He wrote: 'I am willing to explain things to people if they ask me. 'If anyone has formed an opinion of me without actually speaking to me about things fair enough that's their problem, and if you don't want me on your Facebook anymore just f****** delete me. Too hard to be a nice guy anymore.' He added: 'Every time a woman drops their trousers - promotion. 'Every time a man drops theirs - disciplinary action. 'Where's the equality in that?' He later posted: 'It's not until I sit and think about it, I realise how much of a mess I have made of my life.'

Unmarried Reid, who is originally from Penicuik, Midlothian, lives alone in a small flat in the village of Lesmahagow. He admitted two charges of stalking women, three under the Communications Act and one under the Sexual Offences Act. He also pleaded guilty to an offence under the Data Protection Act that he did 'knowingly or recklessly and without the consent of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Scotland obtain and disclose personal data by repeatedly accessing various police systems with no operational reason for doing so.' Reid had not guilty pleas accepted to a further six charges of causing annoyance or needless anxiety to six separate women by repeatedly sending them messages.

"A team of Manchester United legends managed to do what the Old Trafford club's current crop failed in doing - securing a draw against a Bayern Munich XI at the Allianz Arena. The two European powerhouses have enjoyed some great Champions League clashes down the years - and past heroes from both clubs were present in a 3-3 draw in a charity game at Bayern's home - with Andrew Cole starring with two goals including a brilliant backheel. The former Reds frontman was reunited with his familiar striker partner Dwight Yorke - and it seemed to pay dividends with Paul Scholes feeding the strike pair from midfield. VIDEO Scroll down to see Andy Cole's cheeky backheel find the Bayern Munich net at the Allianz Arena for Manchester United Legends .

Bayern Munich: Butt, Babbel, Kreuzer, Kovac, Pflugler, Van Bommel, Thon, Sergio, Breitner, Zickler, Elber. Lee Martin set up Cole's opener with just nine minutes gone - putting in a low cross that the 42-year-old was able to instinctively backheel past Hans-Joerg Butt in the Bayern goal. Paulo Sergio then scored an equaliser two minutes later, slotting past Tomasz Kuszczak as he sent the Polish 'keeper the wrong way as he was bearing down on goal. Former Brazilian forward Giovane Elber then made it 2-1 to the home side, evading Dion Dublin's tackle in the area before providing the simplest of finishes and celebrating by rolling around in a sponsor's sign behind the goal. Scholes slotted home Yorke's cutback to draw United level again before Alexander Zickler beat the Reds offside trap to make it 3-2 to the home side. That set it up perfectly for Cole to seal the draw with another smart finish with just seven minutes remaining as the game ended 3-3.

"Martin Olsson lost his head, while Dave Edwards used his as Wolves suggested this season in the Championship will be happier than their last. Sweden defender Olsson was sent off for a second bookable offence after pulling down Rajiv van La Parra and then pushed referee Simon Hooper in the chest as he raised the red card. It could mean an extended ban for the left back, who kicked a water bottle as he stormed down the tunnel to complete a hat-trick of stupid moves.

Delighted: Edwards celebrates scoring the opening goal after being set up by Rajiv van la Parra .

Subs not used: Rudd, Loza, Josh Murphy, R Bennett . Booked: Hoolahan 54, Garrido 82, Martin 90+1 . Red card: Olsson 60 . Four minutes after his dismissal Wolves scored the only goal of the game as Van La Parra sent over a cross from the space vacated by Olsson and Edwards rose higher than Russell Martin to nod into the far corner beyond John Ruddy. The last match Wolves had at this level was a watershed 2-0 loss to Brighton that confirmed a second successive drop and sparked angry scenes between fans and players. Manager Kenny Jackett detoxified the atmosphere by casting aside the expensive flops and installing a hungry, young team and yesterday entrusted the same group to make the step up. Van La Parra was the only debutant in Jackett’s selection and he already looks like a bargain find. Signed free from Heerenveen, the 23-year-old winger troubled Norwich time and again with his pace and delivery and he easily outstripped Olsson as the pair raced for a long ball in the 60th minute, provoking the defender’s desperate action when he angled his run towards the area. Olsson had already been booked for mistiming a sliding tackle on Nouha Dicko in the first half. Marching orders: Martin Olsson, far right, is dismissed during Norwich's 1-0 defeat at Molineux . Dejected: Martin Olsson bows his head as he trudges off after being sent off by referee Simon Hooper . Soon after Van La Parra showed his crossing ability with a ball that met Edwards’ dart from deep perfectly, sending Molineux delirious. Norwich had been in the ascendancy at that stage, with Andrew Surman and Lewis Grabban going close, but with 10 men they were always chasing and Wolves could have extended their lead. Had Dicko been smarter on a breakaway Bakary Sako would have had a simple finish but the pass was slow and Ruddy made the stop. Winning start: Wolves grabbed three points on their return to the Championship following last year's promotion . Support: The club put flags on seats at Molineux which said: This is our love and it knows no division . Norwich boss Neil Adams said he did not see Olsson put his hands on the referee but did question his defending for the foul. ‘You think could he have made a better decision to avoid getting into that situation,’ he said. For Jackett, it was an 11th game without defeat. ‘To get a win on the first day is a big thing for us coming into a new division,’ he said. ‘It was an excellent goal that won the game, a late run and a very, very good header into the corner.’ Meanwhile, Norwich confirmed on Sunday night they are investigating allegations of racist abuse coming from their own fans at Wolves.

"As a textbook example of how not to handle a scandal, it would be hard to beat the Dustin Johnson affair. No-one has emerged from it with any credit, with the result Johnson’s request for privacy and obvious need for it as he deals with his ‘personal challenges’ has been rudely violated. Just imagine if last Thursday, Johnson’s statement explaining he was taking an indefinite leave from the game gave a proper insight into his problems. Nothing salacious, just the barest facts. Is there one among us who would have felt the need to cast the first stone? Instead, there was a rush to fill the vacuum, with Golf.com publishing a story online that was positively cruel in its lurid allegations of Johnson’s party lifestyle. Talk about kicking a man when he’s down. The central claim made, though, was a serious one: Johnson had been given a six-month suspension for violating the tour’s anti-doping policy concerning recreational drugs. Hiatus: Dustin Johnson is to take an immediate break from golf . Getaway: Johnson revealed his decision in a statement on Thursday night and will miss the Ryder Cup . All smiles: Johnson (right) got engaged to Paulina Gretzky (left) earlier this year . Now say this is true, despite the PGA’s insistence that he is not banned but on voluntary leave, would it have been the end of the world to own up to it? It wouldn’t be like he would have taken steroids, would it? There’s clearly a path to redemption. And wouldn’t he have been left in peace to deal with his demons? He could have come back when he was ready a new man. Instead we’ve had a lamentable apparent lack of transparency from the tour and Johnson’s hapless management company that has just allowed the sorry mess to rumble on and on. If the Golf.com story is wrong, why isn’t his agent expressing his fury and taking legal action? Perhaps this is yet to happen. If not imagine what it will be like when Johnson does come back. You can picture the first question right now. ‘Did you test positive for drugs?’ And so on. All they have done is suspend the questions for another day. Late on Friday night the tour issued a statement in the wake of the Golf.com story. It read: ‘This is to clarify that Mr Johnson has taken a voluntary leave of absence and is not under suspension from the PGA Tour.’ Party boy: Johnson poses for a photo with Gretzky on Instagran . In fact, it clarified nothing and smacked of more opacity. Many within the game believe it nothing more than an exercise in lawyerly semantics, akin to the man resigning before he is sacked. Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley summed it up perfectly on Sky. ‘The PGA Tour policy is a very risky one because now they are reacting to events as they happen, which is not where you want to be,’ he said. Let’s hope lessons are learned.","Golf.com published story accusing Johnson of taking recreational drugs .

"They left it late again, very late, but Arsenal took more than they arguably deserved from a Premier League game for the second week running, Olivier Giroud in this case scoring the 90th minute goal that earned them a point. Everton’s Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith had put the hosts 2-0 ahead in the first half, a score that stayed that way until the 83rd minute, when Aaron Ramsey pulled one back and set up this unlikely comeback. It will feel like a defeat to Everton and their supporters for a few days yet. Rescue point: Substitute Olivier Giroud scores a last-gasp equaliser for Arsenal against Everton . Everton: Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, McCarthy, Barry, Mirallas (Atsu 85),Naismith,Pienaar (Osman 10), Lukaku (McGeady 76). Subs Not Used: Robles, Besic, Stones, Alcaraz. Booked: Baines. Goals: Coleman 19, Naismith 45. Arsenal: Szczesny, Debuchy, Chambers, Mertesacker, Monreal, Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain (Campbell 74), Ramsey, Wilshere (Cazorla 74), Ozil,Sanchez (Giroud 46). Subs Not Used: Koscielny, Rosicky, Martinez, Bellerin. Booked: Mertesacker, Wilshere, Chambers, Flamini. Goals: Ramsey 83, Giroud 90. Att: 39,490 . Ref: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). To Arsenal and their travelling fans, who celebrated lustily at the end, it will feel like a win. Certainly this demonstrated backbone, and that, allied with Arsenal taking their unbeaten run in all competitions to 11 games, can do nothing but boost confidence. ‘We gave a great response with complete desire to come back, and the spirit was fantastic … we got a point and it was deserved,’ said Arsenal’s manager Arsene Wenger. He added that Everton’s goal - which replays showed to be offside, just - was ‘difficult to swallow. But we took it on the chin.’ The key tactical change that ultimately made the difference was replacing Alexis Sanchez, up front in the first half, with Giroud in the second. Wenger admitted Arsenal ‘looked more dangerous’ with the Frenchman instead of his Chilean team-mate but insisted Sanchez will find his form when fully fit. ‘He’s not completely ready physically,’ Wenger said. ‘But I’m not worried for him … when he’s at his best physically he’ll come back [to form].’ Wenger’s counterpart Roberto Martinez said: ‘For 75 minutes we gave a perfect performance … dynamic going forward, defending well … scoring two should have been enough … the disappointment was the result.’ The Spaniard, who said much the same last week after Everton drew 2-2 at Leicester, added: ‘How we can get our performances to be 90 minutes long [is crucial] … the performance overall against a very good Arsenal side was good.’ Arsenal last lost a competitive match on 6 April on this ground, 3-0 to Everton. Between then and Saturday, they won six straight Premier League games, an FA Cup semi-final and final, the Community Shield, and also drew away in midweek in the Champions League. Martinez made two changes from Leicester last week. Coleman, fully fit after injury, returned at right-back in place of John Stones. Kevin Mirallas returned in place of Aiden McGeady and played in an advanced left-sided berth in a three-man attack with Naismith to his right and Romelu Lukaku right of that. It is no secret among Everton fans that to make a sustained challenge on the top four they need to improve considerably against the ‘bigger’ teams in general, home and away. But Arsenal have grave concerns of their own when playing against top-five teams. As well as losing 3-0 in this fixture last season, they were thrashed 6-0 and 6-3 at Chelsea and Manchester City respectively and were caned 5-1 in [italics] that [off] drubbing across Stanley Park at Liverpool that set the red team from Merseyside on their tilt at the title. Arsenal did not win an away game against any of the teams finishing in the top five in the 2012-13 season, or in the season before that. It was a long ago as October 2010 that Arsenal last beat a team who finished in the top five, when they beat City 3-0.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Against their serious rivals, road trips have become simply bad trips. At least Saturday's had a pleasant comedown. Wenger made five changes to the starting XI who squeaked past Crystal Palace 2-1 in added time last week. They lined up ostensibly 4-1-4-1 with Mathieu Flamini the defensive shield, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mesut Ozil on the right and left flanks of the midfield four, and Jack Wilshere and Ramsey dropping back to assist Flamini or pushing on in support of lone forward Sanchez as the situation required. Everton’s opener started with a set piece that went via Barry, Osman and Leighton Baines back to Barry, whose diagonal cross was headed home at the far post by Coleman, who breezed far to easily past his ‘marker’, Ozil. The hosts could easily have been further ahead three minutes later, Naismith feeding the ball to Mirallas, who punched it down with his chest and ran clear on goal. Just as he was about to shoot his left leg slipped enough to unbalance him significantly and his miscued his effort, which went wide. The manner in which the hosts extended their lead summed up the first half, Lukaku breaking forward and getting past Mertesacker far too easily before sliding the ball to the central Naismith. Replays showed him to be offside, but not by much and evidently not enough for the referee or his assistant to spot it, and the Scot finished the move through Wojciech Szczesny’s legs. Wenger took Sanchez off at half time, replacing him with Olivier Giroud in search of a focal point up front. His first contribution was to lash a volley over from Ramsey’s chipped supply and he had further shots wide and saved. Arsenal scored what looked like a consolation with seven minutes remaining, Ozil passing to Cazorla on the left, who weaved forward and crossed for Ramsey to convert. A long ball and a Monreal cross then set up Giroud at the end. That's pants: Giroud pulls down his shorts after missing a chance but he was to make amends late on .

"A red brick late-Victorian manor, which stands grandly atop a hill, may look like a pleasant place to live but it actually holds the title of Australia’s Most Haunted House. Built in 1885 in Junee, in NSW, by local pioneer Christopher William Crawley, the Monte Cristo homestead first reportedly began eliciting signs of paranormal activity in 1963. Reg and Olive Ryan had just bought the home when they were returning one foggy night and saw an alarming bright light pouring from every window and door of the house. Scroll down for video . The Monte Cristo homestead in Junee, NSW, is often called the most haunted house in Australia and is thought to be plagued by the spirits of a young child, a maid and a stable boy . When Port Arthur opened in 1833 it was the destination for the hardest of British criminals. One of the most sighted ghosts is the Lady in Blue who reportedly wails for the child she lost during labour . But when they got to their front door the light was gone and the home was again plunged into darkness. As the years have gone on, things have only got weirder. As well as ghostly figures and phantom sounds, Olive once found mutilated cats in her kitchen. The house’s paranormal activity is blamed on the death of a caretaker in the property in 1961 and the imprisonment of a mentally ill man in the house. Also, when the first family, the Crawleys, lived there a young child was reportedly dropped down the stairs, a maid fell from the balcony and a stable boy burned to death. Aradale Mental hospital in Victoria opened in 1867 and was once home to some of the most controversial psychiatric treatments in Australia. The treatments would now be described as torture . The North Head Quarantine Station, near the Sydney suburb of Manly, is reportedly haunted by the hundreds of diseased passengers who were stowed there after arriving in Australia by boat . Also in NSW, the North Head Quarantine Station, near the Sydney suburb of Manly, operated from 1832 to  1984 and is supposedly haunted by the ghosts of former staff and patients. Paranormal activities have been reported in the disused showers where passengers would be forced to strip and in the hospital, where migrant ships arriving in Sydney with suspected contagious diseases off-loaded passengers and crew. The Rocks in Syndey's CBD were a place for prostitutes and convicts to mingle in the 19th century and thus the cobbled streets tell many stories. Visitors to the area can now hear the tales of local murders, suicides, unusual happenings and ghost stories on tours around the historic area. Up in the South of Cairns in Far North Queensland, at Babinda Creek, a sinister-sounding Devil’s Pool can be found. Since 1959, 17 young people have lost their lives in the waters of Devil’s Pool but not all the victims were actually swimming at the time of their untimely demise. At the sacred Aboriginal site, a young couple were once reportedly submerged by water as they stood together on the rock platform admiring the view when. She survived but the boy did not. According to local folklore, the pool is haunted by the spirit of a young woman who drowned herself there after being separated from her lover. The historic area in Sydney's city centre named The Rocks was once a ghetto for the poor around 200 years ago . Adelaide Gaol (left) is one of the oldest buildings in Adelaide and is the site of some of the state's most grisly history. In the Monte Cristo homestead in Junee, NSW, a stable boy reportedly haunts the outbuilding (right) South of Cairns in Far North Queensland, at Babinda Creek, a sinister-sounding Devil’s Pool is haunted by the spirit of a young woman who drowned herself there after being separated from her lover . Beechworth Lunatic Asylum, originally known as the haunted Mayday Hills Lunatic Asylum, is a decommissioned hospital in Victoria. Ghost tours now run in the building as visitors are regaled with terrifying tales, including the story of James Kelly - uncle of the notorious bush ranger Ned Kelly. In 1868, James Kelly set fire to the house of his sister in law where a 14 year old Ned was sleeping. Charged with attempted murder he was originally sentenced to death in June 1868, his sentence however was downgraded to 10 years hard labour. But when he was released from jail he was then sent to Ararat Lunatic Asylum and later transferred to the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum, where he died on August 26 1903. Beechworth Lunatic asylum was once home to James Kelly, a criminally insane man who set fire to the house of his sister in law . In the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum in Victoria you can see the freaky looking chairs where people were treated and the old beds . If you'd rather meet a friendly ghost than a screaming one, the St James Theatre in Wellington is home to the spirit of a dead Russian performer who reportedly saves lives . One guard stationed at Adelaide Goal between 1986-88 claimed he was once called to an area of the Gaol, as a prisoner was thought to be escaping. A figure was seen on security cameras but when he got there no body was to be found . Also in Victoria is Aradale Mental Hospital, located in Ararat, which opened in 1867. It’s now Australia's largest abandoned lunatic asylum and is supremely eerie. It was home to some of the most controversial psychiatric treatments in Australia and around 13,000 people died there in its 130 years. Meanwhile, Travel Insurance Direct pointed out that in New Zealand, the St James Theatre, in Wellington, has a ‘friendly ghost’. His name is Yuri and he was a Russian performer who fell to his death several metres above the stage. Yuri is believed to still call the theatre home, with a projectionist claiming that Yuri has saved his life twice. One of the most famous of Australia's historic sites is the former convict haven of Port Arthur in Tasmania. When Port Arthur was first opened from 1833, until 1853, it was the destination for the hardest of  British criminals. Hundreds were forced to do their time at the high-security jail and now haunting stories of prisoners whirl around the disused cells. Often spotted is the ghost of the Lady in Blue, who reportedly wails for the child she lost during labour. A jail in Adelaide is also a place of spooky sightings. It is one of the oldest remaining  buildings in the city and is the site of some of the state's most grisly history after it opened in 1841. If you're planning a visit to any of these spooky locations, make sure you'e full insured with Travel Insurance Direct.","The Monte Cristo homestead, built in 1885, in Junee, NSW, is reportedly the most haunted house in Australia .

"A married couple were tied up and the husband pistol-whipped during a robbery on Long Island on Halloween, police said today. The 34-year-old mother opened her door in Farmingdale, Long Island on Friday around 8.45pm expecting trick-or-treaters out for candy. Instead she was confronted by three masked robbers, two of them armed with guns, who barged inside the home. A mother of two-year-old boy opened her door to give candy to trick-or-treaters on Friday night on this street in Farmingdale, Long Island (pictured) only to have five armed men barge in and rob the home . The robbers pistol-whipped the husband, 48, after he refused an order to sit down before the couple  were bound at the hands and feet with duct tape. The couple's two-year-old son was not tied up and was not harmed. Two additional subjects joined the group and all began to ransack the home. Police said the woman freed herself and ran next door with her son where she called 911 while the robbers were still in the home. A total of five robbers fled the scene. The husband was treated for head lacerations at a local hospital. According to detectives at Nassau County Police Department, the value of items stolen from the house are undetermined at this time.

"An Illinois man is serving 26 years in prison for the historical murder of a 17-year-old boy, but the star witness in the case has admitted he lied to prosecutors. Mario Casciaro was convicted of killing Brian Carrick in a grocery store cooler room in 2002 - he has always insisted he is innocent. He was jailed in 2010 after Shane Lamb told police that he had hit Carrick over a drug debt and Casciaro has told him he would sort out Carrick's unconscious body. Mario Casciaro (left) was convicted of killing Brian Carrick (right) in a grocery store cooler room in Illinois in 2002 - he has always insisted he is innocent . But now Lamb has recanted his testimony, saying he lied to prosecutors and lied under oath. 'All of it was false. Every single thing…. The state's attorney set it up,' Lamb told ABC News' '20/20'. 'Mario is in there for 26 years for something he didn't do.' Carrick disappeared December 20, 2002 in the evening. Both Carrick and Casciaro worked as stock boys at Val's Grocery, the Johnsburg, Illinois, grocery store co-owned by Casciaro's father. Mario Casciaro was jailed in 2010 after Shane Lamb (pictured) told police that he had hit Carrick over a drug debt and Casciaro has told him he would 'sort out' Carrick's unconscious body . Carrick (seen both left and right) disappeared December 20, 2002. His body has never been found and his mother died in 2009 . 'I saw Brian once at the beginning of my shift,' Casciaro told ABC News. 'Brian was looking for Rob Render [another stock boy] and had asked me if I'd seen him, and I paged him, and that was the last time I seen him. That's it.' Casciaro said he then went to a party at a friend's house and stayed the night. That was the last sighting of Carrick - he was reported by missing his family and the grocery store put up a $25,000 reward to to find him. His body has never been found and his mother died in 2009. Casciaro went to Illinois State University and got a received his degree in finance before returning to help his father expand the family business. But then, in 2010, when Lamb was facing 12 years in prison on cocaine charges in 2009, he made a deal with prosecutors. Lamb, now 30, had also worked as a stock boy with the Carricks and Casciaro at Val's Grocery in 2002. Casciaro in photos taken before he was jailed on April 2, 2013. The then-29-year-old Casciaro was found guilty of first-degree murder with intimidation . He told authorities and jurors that he punched Carrick in the producer cooler because Casciaro sent him to collect on a drug debt from the missing teen and that Casciaro was a drug dealer. Casciaro has admitted he would sometimes sell weed, but insists it was from his private collection. Lamb told police in a video tape that he had punched Carrick several times, leaving him unconscious in the produce cooler. He claimed that Casciaro told him to leave and that he would take care of Carrick. Technicians testified they were 99.9 percent positive that blood collected around the cooler and a trash compactor was from a child born to the Carricks. In exchange for his confession, Lamb was granted immunity on all charges related to Carrick's death and a reduced sentence on the cocaine conviction. Following the revelation Casciaro was arrested and charged with first-degree murder with intimidation and unlawful restraint in Carrick's disappearance. Casciaro pleaded not guilty, but on April 2, 2013, the then-29-year-old  was found guilty of first-degree murder with intimidation. After the sentencing William Carrick said he was glad the case in his son's death was finally over, reports the Daily Herald. 'I'm pleased with the sentence. This has been a tragic, tragic case and I certainly don't have any words of wisdom,' he said. 'I don't know if there can be justice in a case like this. It's just too crazy.' 'I sit every day in a five-by-ten concrete box thinking ... 'How did this happen?' said Casciaro to ABC News. In a sworn statement on Friday, Lamb, 30, recanted earlier accounts of what happened the night. 'I want to make it clear that I had nothing to do with attacking Brian,' Lamb's statement reads reports NorthWest Herald. 'If he is dead, I have no knowledge where his body is located. 'I also want to make it clear that I have no knowledge suggesting in any way that Mario was involved in attacking Brian or disposing of his body.' The affidavit filed in McHenry County  alleges that Assistant State's Attorney Michael Combs fed him details of the case in order to implicate Casciaro for the murder. 'Prior to receiving my immunity deal, Prosecutor [Michael] Combs, knew that I was going to accuse Mario of involvement in the killing because he told me what to say and I agreed to it,' Lamb says in court documents. 'Prosecutor Combs knew my statements accusing Mario were false.' Combs and State's Attorney Lou Bianchi rejected Lamb's claims, noting that his statements to authorities were made in the presence of his attorney, were video recorded, and that the video was turned over to Casciaro's defense attorney. Based on the recantation and other evidence, his attorneys are asking the court to vacate his conviction and order a new trial.","Mario Casciaro was convicted of 2002 murder of Brian Carrick in Illinois .

"Samir Nasri has given the clearest indication yet that he will quit international football following his World Cup snub at the hands of France coach Didier Deschamps. Nasri was left out of the squad this summer because Deschamps claimed that he did not play as well for his country as he does for Manchester City. The player’s Spanish girlfriend Anara Atanes responded on Twitter saying: ‘F*** france and f*** deschamps! What a s*** manager!’ It was the latest international disappointment for Nasri who was left out of France’s 2010 World Cup squad and then banned for three-games for verbally abusing a reporter at Euro 2012. VIDEO Scroll down to see Didier Deschamps say Samir Nasri doesn't play as well for France . Man in the middle: Samir Nasri is set to announce his retirement from international football . Raring to go: Nasri has enjoyed an extended summer holiday after missing the World Cup with France . Now the 27-year-old former Arsenal midfielder is ready to end his France career after winning 41 caps for his country and focus on achieving more success with City. ‘Yes, I’ve made the decision,’ said Nasri. ‘I took it a while ago but I’ll say it when the time is right. It’s not something you can just announce on Twitter. ‘I didn’t win anything with the national team so it’s more easy to take this decision than if we’d just won something. When you play for a big club and you play lots of games, it’s easy to come to this decision. ‘Maybe during the international breaks I can stay and work a little bit more. All the players who played the World Cup and have lots of games during the season with their national teams can get tired and pick up injuries, that kind of stuff. So I think I will be fresh. ‘Even before the summer, during Euro 2012 I had a lot going on. Personally it doesn’t affect me but it affects my family. They live in France, they read the press and stuff like that. By your side: Nasri's girlfriend stuck up for him when the midfielder was left out of the France squad . ‘I live in England. I’m fine with everything they said and I’m used to it. But for my parents it’s really hard. I want to make them happy and the national team doesn’t make me happy.’ Asked if he would rather have been at the World Cup in Brazil this summer than having a rest after helping City to win a Premier League and Capital One Cup double last season, Nasri replied: ‘No, I’m quite happy with my holidays. ‘It’s always good to have a long summer break but you have to find a good balance – too long is not good. When I came back I suffered a little injury but I’m quite fresh and I just need more games to be ready for the start of the new season. ‘I’m excited about the new season. The Premier League will be really hard because every team has bought quality players. So it’s really exciting and we are looking forward to the start of the season.’ Last eight: France reached the World Cup quarter-finals without Nasri before they were beaten by Germany .

"This, ultimately, will be a day that Louis van Gaal wishes to forget but for Tyler Blackett, it will be a day that he will always remember. Blackett, 20-years-old, made his Barclays Premier League debut for Manchester United on Saturday, producing an assured performance at the heart of the back four that belied his tender age. A local boy, Blackett has been on United's books since the age of 8 and Saturday lunchtime marked the culmination of twelve years of dedication as he was handed a start by Louis van Gaal in the absence of Jonny Evans.

Defensive steel: Blackett ushers Swansea's Wilfried Bony away from the Manchester United goal . United disappointment: Blackett couldn't stop his side slumping to an opening defeat against Swansea . This defeat by Swansea City is likely to accelerate United's pursuit of defensive reinforcements but it would be wrong to single out Blackett for criticism, whose performance in the defence was arguably more polished than more senior men such as Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Ashley Young. Blackett began the match with confidence, switching the ball 50 yards onto the toe of Jesse Lingard and his composure in possession proved to be one of the hallmarks of an impressive showing. Blackett executed more passes than any of his team-mates - 90 in total - and also had the best accuracy, with 93.3% of his attempts successfully reaching a United player. He also won all three of his aerial duels. Young talent: Jesse Lingard also started for Manchester United before he was hauled off injured in the first half . A crunching tackle late on, perhaps out of frustration, earned him a yellow card but that was the only blot on his copybook in a remarkable individual showing at Old Trafford. United are expected to seal the signature of Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and would like to add Daley Blind from Ajax. That may stiffen the competition but in Blackett, Van Gaal will know that he possesses a young, English defender who could yet play a significant role this season.","Tyler Blackett made his Manchester United debut against Swansea .

"A mother-of-three fell victim to a rare flesh-eating bug twice, leaving her fighting for her life after giving birth to two of her children three years apart. In December, shortly after giving birth to her daughter Krystal, Maggie Ashe fell into a coma. The bacterial infection Necrotising fasciitis (NF) was ravaging the 33-year-old's body, eating away at her body. 'The bug ate away at the fat and muscle in my stomach and hip,' she said. 'It looked like a shark bite.' Scroll down for video . Maggie Ashe, 33, has suffered a deadly flesh-eating bug twice, after giving birth to her youngest two children, Krystal, centre, and Lucas, right . Ms Ashe, who suffers flashbacks from her ordeal, has been left with crater-like depressions . It is the second time the mother-of-three has developed the life-threatening disease, which can be triggered by minor ailments including chicken pox. Ms Ashe’s first pregnancy passed without incident. But in September 2010, while 34 weeks pregnant with her second baby, she developed a pea-sized lump on her thigh. 'I didn’t know what it was,' she said. 'But two days on it was dark and was the size of a melon. 'I was taken to hospital and was so delirious I asked doctors to chop my leg off. The bacterial infection necrotising fasciitis ate away at her stomach and legs, pictured, leaving crater-like depressions . Ms Ashe, a full-time mum, was given painkillers and antibiotics but slipped into unconsciousness. She woke up 10 days later to find a huge area of infected flesh had been removed from her thigh. Her baby, Lucas had been delivered by emergency caesarean – though she was initially so delirious that thought he had died. It was another three days before Ms Ashe was allowed to see her baby - as doctors warned she was still infectious. And even then she was unable to hold her son. She said: 'I just said, ""hello my baby boy"" and stared at him.' Lucas' traumatic arrival meant it took some time for Ms Ashe to bond with her son. The ordeal left her needing a 12-inch skin graft to repair the crater left in her leg. Having recovered, the 33-year-old thought everything had gone smoothly when she gave birth to her youngest child, Krystal, in December. But just days after her birth, Ms Ashe's stomach began to blister and she was rushed to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital. 'It looked like something from a horror film,' she said. 'I don’t remember anything else – I fell into a coma.' Following further surgery, Ms Ashe was discharged from hospital at the end of January and is now recovering at home in Blackpool, Lancashire. She said the whole experience has left her fearing the extensive cosmetic surgery she needs to repair her badly damaged skin. Doctors say they are baffled as to why she developed the disease twice. Public Health England said: 'Necrotising . fasciitis (NF) is a bacterial infection that affects the soft tissue . and fascia (a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue separating or . binding together muscles and organs). Ms Ashe first developed the infection after giving birth to her son Lucas in 2010. At 34 weeks pregnant she noticed a pea-sized lump on her thigh, which spread to the size of a melon within two days. She fell into a coma, waking 10 days later thinking her baby had died . 'It can occur following a cut or some other opportunity for the bacteria to enter the body, such as surgery. 'The bacteria can also enter through weakened skin, like a blister. Sometimes there is no obvious entry point . 'NF is a rare but serious condition. 'One of the early signs is intense and severe pain which may seem out of proportion to any external signs of infection on the skin. 'There may be a small cut or scratch on the skin, for example, but the pain will be very bad. 'As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can develop, with the person eventually falling unconscious as the infection overcomes them.' 'The bug ate away at the fat and muscle in my stomach and hip,' MS Ashe said. 'It looked like a shark bite.'","Maggie Ashe developed necrotising fasciitis (NF) after giving birth .

"Manager Arsene Wenger has challenged his Arsenal team to raise their game against direct title rivals and deliver a first Barclays Premier League crown for a decade. The Gunners host managerless Crystal Palace on Saturday, and are out to make a flying start to the new campaign, with morale high following last weekend's 3-0 win over a makeshift Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley. After ending their nine-year barren run with an FA Cup final victory in May, Wenger is confident Arsenal - boosted by the £30million summer signing of Chile forward Alexis Sanchez - have the platform on which to mount a sustained assault on the championship.

'It is difficult to know how much better the other teams will be. We have some challenges we have of course to face that we did not face well last year, and that means we have to take more points from the top teams. 'That will be our real challenge this year and also to keep the consistency against the teams who do not fight for the championship. 'We finished fourth last year and made 79 points. Man City won it with 86, so it was very tight in the top four, that is one or two games. 'If you win against them, they have three points less and you have three points more, that means it is down to one game. 'So it is very difficult to predict.

Arsenal are, of course, not the only side to have brought in more firepower this season. Wenger feels 'six or seven teams' could offer a genuine challenge. He said: 'The favourites you have again Chelsea, Man City, Liverpool, Man United and us. Then you have Everton, they were very dangerous last year as well and could be candidates.

Wenger remains pleased with the transfer business done so far, much of it early with France international Mathieu Debuchy, promising young defender Calum Chambers and Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina all now on board. Arsenal have been linked with Real Madrid's German midfielder Sami Khedira, whose wage demands are thought to be a stumbling block, as well as Greece defender Kostas Manolas. 'Number wise we are maybe a little short in some areas of the game, but the depth of the squad is very good,' said Wenger, who would like Joel Campbell and Serge Gnabry to remain at the club rather than go out on loan. 'We are not destabilised and I feel it's a strong reinforcement of our squad. Will I still do something? I don't rule it out.' The Arsenal boss added: 'For me a big signing is a good player and for you (the media) it is linked with the amount of money you spend.

Wenger is confident Arsenal can get the better of the Palace, who will have Keith Millen in charge following Tony Pulis' shock departure, before turning attentions to the trip to Istanbul.

"Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was at Wembley to see his former side collect some silverware in the traditional curtain raiser to the Premier League season. Here is what he learned from Arsenal's 3-0 victory over Manchester City in the Community Shield... 1. Joe Hart or Willy Caballero? Caballero showed nothing at Wembley to suggest he should start ahead of Hart next season. Scroll down for videos... Glove and war: Willy Caballero is unlikely to replace Joe Hart when the Premier League season starts . VIDEO My team weren't ready - Pellegrini . Caballero maybe should have done better for Santi Cazorla's opener, and he didn't have much chance with Olivier Giroud's goal. Manuel Pellergrini may feel Hart will operate better when he is under severe pressure. Things will become much clearer when Pellegrini names his team for Newcastle next week. 2. Arsenal's new £30million man didn't stop running . Alexis Sanchez showed brilliant intelligence coming of the right wing and he will terrorise defenders with his pace this year. He was hugely impressive, but it wasn't any more than I expected. He is a guy who isn't frightened of hard work. Speed demon: Alexis Sanchez non-stop running will cause defenders a problem this season . 3. City different team without Kompany . Vincent Kompany is one of the world's best defenders, he'll go down as one of the best in Premier League history, so it's no surprise City missed on Sunday. They aren't the same without him. They seriously missed his pace on the break yesterday . 'I'm glad you weren't playing!': Manchester City struggle in the absence of captain Vincent Kompany (L) 4. Chambers makes case for the defence . As a centre-back I thought it was another huge step in the right direction for the youngster Calum Chambers. I was particularly impressed with his tenacity and intelligence. When he made interceptions he didn't just look to clear it, he would look to pick someone out. He's made an excellent start to his Arsenal career. First impressions count: Calum Chambers was impressive on his competitive debut for the Gunners . 5. Arsenal need a holding midfielder . Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini will fill Arsenal's midfield lynchpin role next season, but the club should start looking at a long term successor in that position.

"Adam Gemili roared with wide-eyed delight as the clock at Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium showed he had become European 200 metres champion in 19.98 seconds, making him the first Briton in history to legally break 20 seconds on two occasions. Take into account a track dampened by sporadic torrential downpours here yesterday and a 1.6m-per-second headwind and it becomes apparent how much more the 20-year-old has to offer. A prominent athletics statistician suggested it would be worth 19.90 in still conditions and 19.82 with a 1.6mps tailwind. VIDEO Scroll down for behind-the-scenes access on one of Gemili's training camps . Party time: Adam Gemili holds up a Union Jack flag after winning gold at the European Championships . Ahead of the rest: Gemili dips at the line to make sure that he finishes ahead of his fellow competitors . The British record of 19.87 set by John Regis when Gemili was less than a year old will surely not stand for long. ‘I’m so happy to be European champion, it was a big target for me,’ Gemili said. ‘It’s really cold and late but I saved my energy from the rounds and to run sub-20 is great. ‘It’s also really nice to beat Christophe Lemaitre. It’s a great feeling and the Brits now have the 100m and 200m title here. I’ll be singing my heart out on the podium. Athletics is so much fun and it’s an honour to be here.’ Gemili ran an almost perfect race, exploding out of the blocks and accelerating round the bend. He remained strong down the home straight, leaving France’s Lemaitre, a 19.80 runner at his best, to scrap it out for silver. As well as enhancing his reputation on the track, Gemili proved he is a gentleman off it when a woman in the crowd asked for his race number as a souvenir. He dutifully got an official to unpin the sheet on his back and hand it over. Victory: Gemili celebrates as he finishes ahead of Frenchman Christophe Lemaitre (right) Man of the moment: Gemili raises his arms in celebration after winning European gold at the age of 20 . In the men’s 400m final the teacher gave a lesson to the pupil as Martyn Rooney, a veteran of the British team despite only being 27, beat prodigious teenager Matt Hudson-Smith as Britain claimed a one-two. Rooney has been offering advice and ‘having a laugh in the call room’ with the 19-year-old as they advanced through the rounds. But all friendly feeling was left in the blocks as he held on to win gold in 44.71, the fastest time in Europe this year. Hudson-Smith finished strongly but did not have enough track left to overhaul Rooney, taking silver in a personal best of 44.75. The two warmly embraced on the finish line and did a lap of honour together. Hudson-Smith, from Birmingham, was formerly a 100m sprinter and only properly turned to one-lap running at the start of the year. He has since shaved an incredible one minute off his personal best. On the podium: Rooney (centre) and Hudson-Smith (left) receive their medals with third-placed Donald Sanford . Out in front: Rooney (right) edges out compatriot Hudson-Smith to claim gold at the European Championships . This was Britain’s first one-two in the 400m at the Europeans since Du’ane Ladejo beat Roger Black in 1994. ‘He’s a fantastic kid,’ said Rooney. ‘We were a little bit more subdued before the final but still having fun. From a selfish point of view I’m glad he’s around because I think he’s going to push me to run fast.’ Rooney was also 19 when he came to prominence by breaking Roger Black’s 21-year-old British junior 400m record at the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Since then Rooney admits he has failed to live up to expectations and had not won a major title until last night. ‘I asked myself 100 times where that form had gone,’ said Rooney. ‘The pressure put on me by others is nothing compared to what I’ve done to myself. ‘It’s nice to be a champion now, I’ve never won anything in my life.’ Laura Weightman held on to add a European 1500m bronze medal to her Commonwealth silver. The 23-year-old, coached by Steve Cram, held off Poland’s Renata Plis down the home straight to clock a time of 4min 06.32sec. Christine Ohuruogu missed out on a medal, finishing fourth in her 400m final. The former world and Olympic champion was bidding to add an elusive European title to her enviable collection.

"An ex-principal and former Australian of the Year finalist who fraudulently claimed millions of taxpayers' dollars for a top Indigenous school will not spend anymore time behind bars. In an 11th-hour plea last Monday, Jean Illingworth admitted defrauding the state and Commonwealth by inflating student numbers to get $3.4 million in extra funding for Djarragun College, near Cairns, between 2010 and 2011. On Friday, the 67-year-old appeared in the Cairns District Court where she was sentenced to three years' jail on one charge of obtaining property by deception, and two and half years' on one charge of fraud. Jean Illingworth, a former Queensland principal, has been released from serving any more time in jail for defrauding millions . However, Judge Terry Martin ordered she only serve 351 days in prison for both charges - the exact number of days she has already served in pre-sentence custody. ""I accept you're fundamentally a decent person,"" Judge Martin said, adding that he acknowledged she had dedicated most of her life to helping indigenous and disadvantaged children. He described her convictions as a major stain on an enviable career but added that she had abandoned honesty and integrity and ""committed blatant fraud"". Judge Martin acknowledged her motivation was the improvement of the school and the benefit of the students rather than personal gain. Supporters of the disgraced teacher, 66, are standing by her and have already helped raise $31,829 towards her legal fees for the trial. She will face one charge each of fraud and obtaining financial advantage by deception. Her backers have so far donated 40 per cent of the target amount reportedly needed to defend her against the fraud claims. The fundraising website 'Defend Jean' claims: 'Jean Illingworth worked tirelessly at Djarragun College for ten years, turning a small dysfunctional school into a flagship example of successful indigenous education.' Supporters of the disgraced teacher, 66, are standing by her and have already helped raise $31,829 towards her legal fees for the trial. It claims: 'The very least Jean deserves is a fair trial. The legal costs involved in achieving this are almost prohibitive.' Ms Illingworth, once described by Noel Pearson as a true social entrepreneur, wept throughout her sentencing. Prosecutor Michael Cowan said Illingworth claimed funding for hundreds of students who weren't eligible because they hadn't attended school for a minimum period. He read a number of emails to the court that he said proved she knew what she had done. Mr Cowan said Illingworth had cost taxpayers millions that would never be recovered while receiving a $283,000 salary until at least July this year. The school: She was the former principal of Djarragun College, a top indigenous education centre, near Cairns . Role model: Ms Illingworth was named Queensland's Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 . Her barrister, Ken Fleming, argued his client shouldn't spend anymore time behind bars, pointing to Illingworth's impressive work history in which she'd spent most of her life working with remote, indigenous and disadvantaged children in Australia and Africa. Illingworth, who worked at the college for about a decade, was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 for her work in transforming the once dysfunctional college into a much admired model of success. Mr Fleming said Illingworth worked 15 hours a day to turn the school - her grand passion - into a place where some of the country's most disadvantaged children were given hope of a brighter future. He also outlined the extraordinary challenges the school and its students faced, including foetal alcohol syndrome, truancy problems and a lack of parental support. ""The school has been an enormous success and principally because of the untiring work of Ms Illingworth,"" he said. Djarragun College is a private school that has two campuses - north and south of Cairns - and caters mainly to indigenous students from Cape York and the Torres Strait. Ms Illingworth's lawyers still have the option to apply for a judge-only trial or request jurors be polled to see if they are biased due to publicity surrounding the case. The 66-year-old has been in custody in a Townsville women's prison for almost a year. She was released on bail after being charged early last year but was then taken into custody in July after allegedly contacting witnesses in the trial. A separate trial relating to these alleged offences - she has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice - may take place in November.","Jean Illingworth defrauded millions of dollars in funding from Federal government for Djarragun College near Cairns .

The young left-back has been linked with a move to Merseyside all summer as Brendan Rodgers looks to strengthen his defensive options, but with the start of the Premier League fast approaching, a completed move seems to still be some way away. 'There have been negotiations [for Moreno], eight or 10 days ago, but there has been no agreement and nor is there today,' Castro told the club's official website on Monday.

"Efe Ambrose will fly out to join his Celtic team-mates in Maribor on Wednesday – after Parkhead chiefs omitted the defender from their Champions League squad for fear of a Legia Warsaw-style administration blunder. The Nigerian international had been sent-off in the 4-1 first leg defeat to the Polish champions in the last qualifying round and was suspended for the return at Murrayfield. But with Legia’s 2-0 win wiped out for fielding a suspended player, Celtic had been concerned that Ambrose’s punishment had therefore not been served. VIDEO Scroll down to see Deila preview the Champions League qualifier against Maribor . Late arrival: Celtic defender Efe Ambrose will join up with the rest of the team in Slovenia on Wednesday . First taste: Celtic train at the Ljudski VRT Stadium in Maribor on Tuesday evening for the first time . Incoming: Celtic manager Ronny Deila checks his phone as he prepares his side to take on Maribor . Working hard: Anthony Stokes was among those training ahead of the Champions League play-off . Getting down to business: Celtic captain Scott Brown ties his laces during the training session . There also appears to have been confusion as to whether the player had been served with a one or two-match ban. The central defender was absent from the Celtic party which left Glasgow airport for Slovenia on Tuesday morning but a belated call to UEFA headquarters in Nyon has confirmed the defender is eligible to play. Blaming ‘communication problems’ for the mix-up, coach Ronny Deila said: ‘Efe didn’t travel today, he is coming tomorrow morning. ‘In the beginning there were some communication problems, if he was ready or not. We didn’t think he was ready because he got two matches but in the end it was one match. ‘So he is coming now and I am very happy because we need defenders.’ Deila admitted Celtic are unlikely to secure the signature of Ghana winger Wakaso Mubarak in time for tonight’s crucial tie. The champions were hoping a 12-month loan deal could be done ahead of Tuesday night’s 11pm signing deadline but the former Stromsgodset boss said: ‘It is going on but it doesn’t seem like there is going to be anything today. It is hard to get the paperwork together. Addressing the media: Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks to journalists at a press conference on Tuesday . Taking their seats: Deila (left) and Stokes arrive for the pre-match press conference in Maribor . ‘I am not 100 per cent sure but I think it is going to be hard to have him ready for the game against Maribor.’ Deila has challenged his Celtic side to prove they are more than Champions League lucky losers. Well beaten over two legs against Legia, an improbable reprieve has dovetailed with convincing league wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United. And the Norwegian told his side to show they deserve to stay in the Champions League. ‘I think everybody wants to prove that,’ said Deila. ‘They want to still be in the Champions League and I think the players really want it. ‘I think against Legia there were a lot of players who wanted it too much. And I have to say there were a lot of new things going on which took their energy. ‘But we played a good game on Saturday and they look good in training as well. ‘If we perform well we will get our results, if we don’t then we will not reach the next stage. So the performance has to be much better than it was against Legia. ‘If we come away from here with a good result then we’ll have the crowd behind us at Celtic Park for the next game and everyone knows how much that means.’ Mubarak’s likely absence follows injuries to James Forrest, Adam Matthews and Aleksander Tonev, denying Deila options in wide areas. But the Parkhead boss said of the impending arrival: ‘He will be an important player to have in the squad as well because James (Forrest) is out and we will need him. Top team: Deila (centre) speak to the rest of the Celtic management team, including John Collins (2nd left) Quick stretch: Celtic defender Mikael Lustig warms up ahead of the training session . ‘He can play both sides and can also play as a No8 in a 4-3-3.’ The recipient of 18 yellow cards and two reds while with Espanyol before he joined Rubin Kazan, the 24-year-old’s temperament has been called into question. ‘I haven’t thought about that but I know African players,’ added Deila. ‘They adapt when they live in Europe – he is not coming straight from Africa. ‘He played for a time in Russia. ‘African players sometimes come from tough backgrounds. The first year or two in Europe can be difficult for them.’ Celtic are also in the market for a striker but Deila said there is no panic over the likely failure to secure a £1.8million deal for Stoke’s Cameron Jerome. ‘We have been trying hard to sign one but I don’t sign players if I’m not sure about them. I have to be sure,’ he insisted. ‘The worst thing is to sign a player now and find out later that he’s not as good as we hoped. When you go into the last two weeks of the transfer window suddenly something very good can happen. ‘The biggest clubs with the biggest budgets are still not finished signing players. At the end they have to get rid of people. ‘So I will keep my money and make sure we spend it right. The last 14 days is the most important part of the window. I have a good feeling we are doing the right things. It feels right in my stomach.’","Ambrose will fly out to join his team mates on Wednesday morning after being left behind in Glasgow .

"Whether you're aware of it or not, airport security staff scrutinise your body language every time you step through the gates. But this isn't the best way to catch criminals, according to a new study, which suggests airports should judge passengers based on what they say instead. Analysing speech patterns rather than movement is 20 times more effective at catching someone out in a lie, according to a British government-funded study. Analysing speech patterns rather than movement is 20 times more effective at catching someone out in a lie, according to a British government-funded study . In experiments over eight months, security agents at eight airports in Europe detected dishonesty in 66 per cent of the deceptive mock passengers using a new screening method. This compared to just three per cent for agents who saw signs thought to be associated with deception, including lack of eye contact, fidgeting and nervousness. 'The suspicious-signs method almost completely fails in detecting deception,' said Dr Thomas Ormerod, head of the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex. 'In addition, it costs a lot of money, absorbs a lot of time and gives people a false sense of security.' The new Controlled Cognitive Engagement method (CCE) had the highest rate of deception detection. In experiments over eight months, security agents at eight airports in Europe detected dishonesty in 66 per cent of the deceptive mock passengers using a new screening method. This compared to just three per cent for agents who saw body language signs thought to be associated with deception . The researchers said this could have important implications for thwarting terrorist attacks and catching other criminals. 'The UK government gave us a challenge that if we didn't think the current airport screening method worked well, then we should come up with a better one,' said Dr Ormerod. Passengers could soon see the end of liquid limits at airports thanks to an new scanner. The technology is currently on trial at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London and 63 airports in Europe and Australia. Dubbed Insight100, it uses a laser to determine the chemical composition of liquids in containers up to three litres in size. It uses a technique called Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical make-up of a liquid by analysing scattered light and recognising patterns made by different materials. It then subtracts data about the container from the overall reading to leave it with a faint signal from the liquid. It cross-checks the remaining information with a library of dangerous liquids. The machine is able to separate harmless ingredients from those like hydrogen peroxide that can be used to make bombs. It was developed by Oxfordshire-based company Cobalt Light Systems, which is in discussions with the US government about the technology. In the CCE method, security agents engage in friendly, informal conversation by asking passengers seemingly unrelated and unpredictable questions about knowledge the passenger should possess. The agent then gauges whether a passenger's responses become more evasive or erratic. 'If you're a regular passenger, you're just chatting about the thing you know the best - yourself,' Dr Ormerod said. 'It shouldn't feel like an interrogation.' It didn't matter if the agents knew the truthful answers to the questions because they were examining verbal cues from the passenger, such as shorter and more evasive responses to straightforward questions, Dr Ormerod said. In the study, 79 security agents received one week of classroom training in the CCE method, followed by a week of on-the-job training. Researchers recruited 204 mock passengers, including college acting students and undercover police detectives. Participants were paid £60 ($97) to participate, along with an additional £60 if they avoided detection by security agents. Each mock passenger had a week to research a different deceptive cover story so he or she would be more convincing when questioned. If a mock passenger was caught, he or she was flagged in a computer system for further questioning at the gate. Researchers say the risk of racial profiling is also reduced with the CCE method because it is applied in the same way to all passengers, unlike the suspicious-signs method. Mock passengers were found to gradually speak less and reveal less information as they were asked more questions that might reveal their deception . Mock passengers were found to gradually speak less and reveal less information as they were asked more questions that might reveal their deception. Screening agents trained in the CCE method improved in their ability to catch deceptive mock passengers during the study, increasing from 60 per cent during the first month to 72 per cent in the sixth month. The agents in the suspicious-signs group, however, performed worse over time, dropping from six percent in the first month to zero in the sixth month. Even though it isn't effective, the suspicious-signs method is frequently used because it is cheap to train, and it 'accords with people's folk beliefs about detecting deception,' Ormerod said. 'When we can tell when our kids or spouses are lying, we think that those sorts of signs are going to work with everyone, but people lie differently,' he said. 'You can't assign one particular behavioural sign as a sign of lying. It's how someone's behaviour changes during questioning that reveals deception.'","Controlled Cognitive Engagement involves asking unrelated questions .

"Wayne Rooney has been getting in the spirit of the 'ice bucket challenge' craze - by soaking wife Coleen. The Manchester United striker's wife was nominated by Rooney's former England team-mate Shaun Wright-Phillips for the challenge, and after being drenched called upon Piers Morgan and Sheree Murphy - Harry Kewell's wife - to step up next. After a short introductory message from his wife, Rooney lefts up the bucket of freezing water and tips it over Coleen, who let out a high-pitched scream. Freezing: Wayne Rooney delights in soaking his wife Coleen with a bucket of ice cold water . Coleen's fun didn't stop there, however, with Wayne completely letting go of the bucket which came crashing down on her head. The ice bucket challenge, social media’s latest craze, is designed to raise money and awareness for the neurodegenerative illness ALS - better known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Anyone taking on the challenge has to nominate someone else to do the same - who then must take it on within 24 hours. Some of football's top players - including Neymar, Lionel Messi and John Terry have already taken on the freezing feat. The ALS association has seen a huge raise in donations - £9.4million compared with £30,000 in the same period last year - since the campaign went viral. Wow, that's cold! Chelsea captain John Terry screams after taking on the Ice Bucket Challenge . No going back now: Terry drenches himself as part of the challenge, which is taking social media by storm . Rooney wasn't the only Old Trafford star to make an appearance in an ice bucket challenge video on Wednesday. Out-of-favour midfielder Anderson got soaked at the club's Carrington training ground - and nominated legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson to be next up. United's Mexican striker Javier Hernandez has also got in on the act, and he nominated team-mate Juan Mata and Espanyol's Hector Moreno. Over in Holland, the whole Ajax team took part in the challenge together, including the Red Devils' target Daley Blind. You can Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here. Anderson gets in on the act: The Brazilian gets ice poured over him and nominates Sir Alex Ferguson . The choice is very simple. You either stand or sit there while some very kind and willing assistants pour a big container of ice water over your head, or you make a donation to an ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) charity. The whole thing is filmed and once the 'victim' has recovered from the icy shock, they nominate someone else to take the challenge. Once nominated, the person has 24 hours to do the same thing and post the evidence on social media like Twitter, Facebook or YouTube to prove they've gone through with it. Most celebrities have gone through with the challenge but some, like Charlie Sheen, have chosen to donate money instead. What is ALS? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the term used in the United States to describe Motor Neurone Disease (MND), which affects a person's ability to move voluntarily. While the person continues to think and feel, they are often unable to walk, eat or talk, leaving them effectively 'locked in' to their body. It is estimated about 5,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from MND and half of those diagnosed will die within the first 14 months of knowing they have it. There is no known cure at present. How did the craze start? In the States, when Chris Kennedy, a golfer from Sarasota in Florida, was nominated by a friend to participate in an ice bucket challenge similar to the one screened live on-air by programme Golf Channel Morning. Kennedy was the first to associate the challenge with ALS because he has a relative suffering from the disease and his video was posted back on July 15. Soon his friends were all doing it and using the hashtag #StrikeOutALS and it started to go viral when former professional baseball player Pete Frates took part. By the end of July, the ALS Association reported a dramatic rise in donations and the campaign has been gaining more and more popularity ever since. What impact is the campaign having? A very positive one. The ALS Association has seen a huge rise in donations - £9.4m compared with £30,000 in the same period last year - since the campaign went viral. The Motor Neurone Disease Association reported on Tuesday that is had raised £4,000 from text message donations since the campaign took off in the UK. Smaller associated charities have also reported a surge in donations. Who has taken part? Celebrities the world over have volunteered to have the ice water thrown over them. Footballers including Neymar, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and John Terry have taken part, as have sports stars Usain Bolt, Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant and Rory McIlroy to name but a few. Among other famous folk to have taken part are Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Bieber. Many have injected an element of humour into their 'dunkings', helping rack up millions of views on YouTube and other sites. Thousands of ordinary people have also done their bit, including the 200 who met in Boston's Copley Sqaure to dump water on each other on August 7. SAMUEL MOORE AND ADAM SHERGOLD .

"Steffon Armitage, the European player of the season barred by England, has again let it be known that he might try to qualify to play for France in the 2015 World Cup. Supporters of the dynamic Toulon flanker, last capped by England in 2010, indicated in June that he was thinking along those lines and further reports yesterday suggest he is still considering the French option. A frustrated Armitage could be playing with fire, though. The slightest doubt over his allegiance and any sense that he is trying to force England’s hand will not amuse head coach Stuart Lancaster, who puts great store by old-fashioned patriotism and commitment to the squad. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Stuart Lancaster say he agrees in principle with  overseas rule . Powerhouse: Steffon Armitage fights off a challenge while playing for the World XV against South Africa . Lancaster has fully supported the RFU’s stance of not picking players who are based overseas unless there are ‘exceptional circumstances’, and the only glimmer for Armitage has been that the phrase has never been properly defined. A run of injuries to the likes of Chris Robshaw and Matt Kvesic might be considered exceptional. Armitage’s possible entry to the French squad would come via a loophole in the IRB qualifying regulations for the Olympic Sevens tournament which allows a player to play for another nation if they hold a passport for the new country and have not played international rugby for 18 months. If such a player appears in the forthcoming IRB World Sevens Series for that new country, he would be available for selection at fifteens. Armitage would have to be granted a French passport — not a given — while it is understood that the French Sevens squad, should they be minded to pick him, would require him to play in three or four of the Sevens tournaments around the world, involving considerable time away from Toulon during the season. Club duty: Armitage looks on during the Heineken Cup final for his club Toulon against Saracans in Cardiff . It is also thought that France legend Serge Blanco, who has been drafted in to help coach Philippe Saint-Andre, is against overseas players qualifying for France in such a way or through the three-year residency rule in the case of uncapped players. Meanwhile, Lancaster has confirmed he has reached agreement with the Premiership clubs to delay the selection and announcement of his senior England and Saxons squads until October, which will be a big help in assessing current form. An extended 55-man England squad began a three-day fitness testing camp in Loughborough last night, while a review of the 3-0 series defeat against New Zealand in June is also planned. Top class: The dynamic flanker won the European player of the season award but is not in the England frame . Among the notable inclusions were loose-head prop Alex Corbisiero and back row Tom Croft, both of whom have returned to the national set-up after lengthy spells out with knee injuries. Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani kept his place after returning to the England fold on the summer tour to New Zealand, while Saracens back row Jackson Wray is a new name. Lancaster said: ‘This camp will give us a chance to get the wider squad together and an opportunity to review the New Zealand tour. It will be an important few days. The next time we meet will be two weeks before we play New Zealand in the QBE Internationals, so this time together is vital.’ Loophole: Armitage could qualify for France through a loophole that would involve the Olympic Sevens .

"With the transfer window not closing until September 1, there is still plenty of time for some frenzied activity from clubs searching for talent to either strive for silverware or stave away relegation. And, with the curtain being raised on the Championship season on Saturday, there's an opportunity for Premier League clubs to run the rule over several players that are surely destined for the bigger stage.

"The days of spraying yourself with overpowering deodorant could be over. A ‘smart can’ has been created that tells you exactly how much deodorant to apply, and even reminds you when you've forgotten to put any on. Called ClickStick, the device uses a button to expel a certain amount of gel from its top, which is then rubbed into skin like a traditional stick deodorant. Scroll down for video . A New Jersey student has designed a smart deodarant application device. Called the ClickStick, it has a button that releases a set amount of gel. This is determined by an app that syncs with the stick . By using an included app, the user is told how much gel to release each time based on their activity levels, ensuring they don’t get too much or too little. Graduate student Gilad Arwatz from New Jersey is currently seeking funding for the gadget on Kickstarter. The bottle, which is about the size of a regular deodorant can, has a button on the side that is pressed to dispense gel. But the main ‘smart’ feature of the device is the ability to sync with a smartphone app. In the app users enter your height, weight, age, activity level and gender. The gadget will then determine how much deodorant to apply when the button is pressed, which can be altered with an adjustable slide button. The app tells you just the right amount of deodorant to apply (shown). This is also apparently the first refillable deodorant applicator . The gadget will then determine how much deodorant to apply when the button is pressed, which can be altered with an adjustable slide buttom. It costs £16 ($26) and will be released in May next year. Push-button deodorant delivery - Electronic dispensing claims to avoid stains and skin irritations. Refillable - ClickStick claims to be the first refillable deodorant applicator. Mobile app - The gadget has a mobile app included that provides insights on the amount of deodorant needed, based on your activity level. Light activated - The cap and application of the deodorant is illuminated with different colour LED lights. Cap activated power switch- ClickStick's says power switch prevents accidental operation when the cap is on the device. Each press of the button will only release one dosage, and users can set reminders for when to apply deodorant. The gadget is also refillable, so new gel cartridges can be bought to fit into the device. 'ClickStick is a smart reusable deodorant applicator, with eco-friendly refills that come with any deodorant,' the company writes on their Kickstarter page. Users can even set up automatic refills so that a new pack is ordered when the app detects they are running out. The product also has a light that can be activated to make seeing the gadget easier in dark rooms. The team expects to start delivering £16 ($26) ClickSticks to backers next May.

"Last week she released a catchy new song called Welcome to New York. And her enthusiasm for the Big Apple was cemented yesterday, when Taylor Swift was announced as Global Welcome Ambassador for New York City. Appearing on Good Morning America, the 24-year-old, who was born in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Nashville, said: 'I'm so enthusiastic about this city that I feel like, when I love something, I'm very vocal about it, I'm vocal about it with my music. Scroll down for video . Giving the thumbs up: Taylor Swift is excited about her new role as New York's Global Welcome Ambassador . 'I just go around like, ""Everybody! New York is amazing!"" So I think they just picked up on that and gave me a title.' As part of her role, the singer presented a series of videos for New York's official tourism agency, NYC Go, including one in which the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'. I heart NYC: Taylor Swift, pictured enjoying the sights  in August, is a passionate New York fan . 'A lot of heart': The singer explains that New Yorkers are friendly to tourists and the city is easy to get around . In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.' But it seems not everyone is quite so upbeat about her appointment. The singer, who recently bought a £12million apartment in the trendy Tribeca area, has lived in the city less than a year, and residents were shocked that she was selected to represent the city. No stranger to the bright lights: The singer performs on New Year's Eve 2013 in Times Square . Enjoying the Big Apple: The pop star recently bought a £12million property in the city's Tribeca neighbourhood . 'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world. 'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City. 'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.' Just moments after the announcement was made, the decision was attacked by New Yorkers, who felt the singer was not suitable for the role. 'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens. He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town. 'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added. 'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.' The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses. 'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers. 'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer. But NYC Go stood by their decision, saying: 'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City.' 'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals,' they told MailOnline Travel. 'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.'","Superstar, 24, was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Nashville .

"Eight months after she was found under a pile of clothes and books in a locked car, investigators have almost no clues about the death of Temple University pre-med student Nadia Malik. The 22-year-old mother of two was found in February after a citywide search by family and police, but an autopsy completed last month was inconclusive, reports the Philadelphia Daily News. The family wants to know how she ended up dead in a locked car to which her boyfriend allegedly had the only key. Tragic: Nadia Malik, 22, was attending Temple University as a pre-med student and had two daughters, ages 1 and 4, when she disappeared and turned up dead in a locked car registered to her boyfriend's parents . Her body was found at the end of February, lying on the passenger's seat inside a locked Nissan Altima registered in the name of her boyfriend, Bhupinder Singh, 25. On the day she disappeared and the day following, Malik had texted and called her brother Fuad Malik and a friend. Documents filed in her disappearance say that Malik told them she was with Singh and that she was being 'held against her will' and was 'trying to get away.' Police tracked her phone to the home of Singh's parents, and found Singh attempting to flee through the back door on their arrival. On Singh, they found Malik's driver's license and cellphone, which Singh admitted he had used to send texts to members of the family, telling them they wouldn't see Malik again. The Delco Times reported that Singh was arrested in Ohio on a probation violation related to a DUI conviction  and questioned by authorities. Parents: In addition to their two daughters, Malik and Bhupinder Singh, 25, had an infant that died in 2012 under 'suspicious circumstances' Get away: Malik called her brother and a friend, telling them she was being 'held against her will' by Singh, though police have no evidence to link Singh and have not arrested anyone in connection with her death . Singh told them that he had fought with Malik before leaving with his parents' Nissan and boarding a bus to Ohio. The two were the parents of two young daughters, a one-year-old who lives with Singh's parents and a four-year-old living with Malik's. The couple also had another infant that died in 2012 under 'suspect circumstances' that the police were also investigating. All this still doesn't explain how Malik's body was found with no signs of injury on February 20 in a car near Philadelphia's rail terminal. Police released a photo of the black 2007 Nissan being driven by Malik through an intersection between noon and 1 p.m. The next time it was seen, the car was covered in snow and had been ticketed at least eight times. The car had been towed to 30th Street Station as part of a snow removal plan, but the operators had not seen the body due to heavy snow covering the windows, officers said. Police say the investigation is continuing.","The body of Nadia Malik, 22, was found in a snow-covered car near Philadelphia's rail terminal, which had been towed and moved at least once .

"When Atlanta immigration attorney Stacy Ehrisman-Mickle filed a request last month to delay a hearing that fell during her six-week maternity leave, she was certain the judge would grant it without hesitation, but she was in for a shocking surprise. Earlier this month, Ehrisman-Mickle received an official letter form Judge J. Dan Pelletier Sr informing her that her adjournment request had been denied on the grounds that a maternity leave was not a good enough reason to postpone the hearing. With her truck driver husband working out of state and no nanny on hand, Mrs Ehrisman-Mickle was left with little choice but to strap her four-week-old baby daughter to her chest and trudge off to court. Day in court: In this October 7 photo released by Stacy Ehrisman-Mickle, the immigrant lawyer with her 4-week-old daughter, whom she was forced to bring to court after a judge denied her request to delay a hearing that fell during her maternity leave . Rejected: In the order denying the lawyer's request (pictured), Judge J. Dan Pelletier wrote: 'No good cause. Hearing date set prior to counsel accepting representation' But Ehrisman-Mickle said when she appeared before Judge Pelletier, he scolded her in front of a packed courtroom and questioned her parenting skills. Reached by phone Thursday, Pelletier said immigration judges can't make public comment and referred questions to the public affairs office of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the branch of the Department of Justice that oversees immigration courts. That office said in an email it couldn't comment on the judge's action and that a complaint had been filed and was being processed. Ehrisman-Mickle's clients came to her in early July for a consultation, but they couldn't afford to hire her right away, she said. They went to their first immigration court hearing on September 2 without a lawyer and then came to Ehrisman-Mickle's office with their mother four days later to hire her. Ehrisman-Mickle told them she would take their case but that their next hearing on October 7 fell during her maternity leave. Attorney at law: Ehrisman-Mickle took on a new case in September and filed a motion to delay a hearing scheduled for October 7 because it fell during her scheduled six-week maternity leave . Shocker: The lawyer was certain the judge would sign off on the delay and was stunned to receive a rejection letter just days before her hearing . She told them she'd have to file a motion to delay the hearing but that it shouldn't be a problem because two other immigration judges had already granted similar motions based on letters from her doctor, she said. She filed the motion September 8 and it was received by the court the following day, she said. Pelletier ruled on the motion October 2 and Ehrisman-Mickle's office received the decision the following day, the Friday before the Tuesday hearing, she said. In the order denying her request, Pelletier wrote: 'No good cause. Hearing date set prior to counsel accepting representation.' At home in bed, Ehrisman-Mickle was shocked when her secretary called to tell her the motion had been denied. Her husband, a retired US Marine working as a truck driver, was not home, her 4-week-old daughter was too young for day care and she has no family in Georgia, she said. 'I was in a state of panic. I didn't know what to do with my baby,' she told The Associated Press on Thursday. New parents: Ehrisman-Mickle said her husband, a retired US Marine (pictured here on their wedding day) working as a truck driver, was out of state and could not watch their baby during her court appearance . Humiliated: The new mother, pictured on her wedding day, said the judge questioned her parenting skills for exposing her newborn baby to germs in a packed courtroom . She called her daughter's pediatrician to ask if it would be safe to bring the baby with her to court. The doctor told her it would be OK as long as she kept the infant in a carrier on her chest facing her body and didn't let anyone touch the baby. During the hearing, her infant began to cry, and Judge Pelletier scolded her for inappropriate behavior and commented that her pediatrician must be appalled that she was exposing the baby to so many germs in court, she said. 'I was embarrassed. I felt humiliated,' she said. Another lawyer who was present in the courtroom confirmed the details of Ehrisman-Mickle's story. He asked that his name not be used because he doesn't want the judge to retaliate against his clients. Pelletier finally agreed to delay the hearing until after Ehrisman-Mickle is cleared by her doctor to return to work, she said. Lawyer strikes back: Ehrisman-Mickle filed a complaint against Judge Pelletier, accusing him of discrimination . Ehrisman-Mickle said she filed a formal complaint against Pelletier the same day as the hearing. An investigating judge called to get her side of the story after the complaint was filed but she hasn't heard anything further, she said. 'He questioned the fact that day care centers do not accept infants less than 6 weeks of age,' the attorney wrote in her complaint, cited by the blog Above the Law. 'He then questioned my mothering skills as he commented how my pediatrician must be appalled that I am exposing my daughter to so many germs in court. He humiliated me in open court.' Ehrisman-Mickle went on to accuse the judge of discriminating against her due to her 'condition,' calling such thinking 'absolutely reprehensible.' 'I am horrified that this occurred and that I had to bring my infant to court with me,' she stated, adding that child birth 'is not a minor inconvenience.' 'Furthermore, I am a qualified, experienced and ethical attorney that should not have to stop practicing law upon becoming pregnant to accommodate the backward thinking of certain judges,' the attorney concluded. Georgia State University College of Law associate professor Tanya Washington said it was reasonable of Ehrisman-Mickle to believe the judge would delay the hearing to accommodate her maternity leave. Furthermore, Ehrisman-Mickle demonstrated a real commitment to her clients by showing up with her baby, Washington said. 'I think the judge yelling at her for being unprofessional by appearing with her child is unreasonable, insensitive and unprofessional,' Washington said.","Atlanta immigration attorney Stacy Ehrisman-Mickle was forced to bring her 4-week-old daughter to court October 7 .

"Ticketek and Ticketmaster have been forced to change the way they display the price of concert tickets after a consumer watchdog investigation found customers were being hit with hidden charges. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said the ticketing companies must include unavoidable fees in the total price of tickets earlier in the booking process when customers buy online. ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said service and handling fees must be clearly advertised to avoid consumers being misled. Scroll down for video . Miley Cyrus performs her Bangerz Tour live at Perth Arena on Thursday. Tickets were sold via Ticketek . Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience show recently toured Australia with tickets sold through Ticketek . 'Drip feeding consumers with hidden charges has the potential to cause detriment to competition and to consumers,' Ms Rickard said. 'The steps taken by these ticketing companies should give consumers more clarity up front about the total cost of buying tickets for entertainment events.' As part of its drip pricing investigation, the ACCC came across three main ticketing fees charged by the companies. Both Ticketek and Ticketmaster both charge 'payment processing fees' for purchases made using debit or direct cards. Ticketek charges 1.95 percent. Ticketek also charges a 'service/delivery fee', the cost of which varies between events. Ticketmaster charges a 'handling fee'. Tickets to Kanye West's Yeezus tour were sold through Ticketek . The ACCC said the companies cooperated with the investigation and have changed their practices. 'To address the concerns raised the businesses now incorporate their minimum Payment Processing Fees into the per ticket prices they display on their websites,' the watchdog said in a statement. 'Ticketek also now incorporates its Service/Delivery Fee into the total price displayed as soon as it is calculable, which it considers to be once the customer has selected the number of tickets for purchase and the delivery method. 'Similarly, Ticketmaster now incorporates its Handling Fee into the total price displayed once the user has selected the total number of tickets for purchase.'","ACCC investigation targets the 'drip feeding' of prices by ticket sellers .

The reverse may be the case. Not least because the Pac-Man was actually deferring his retirement date. The last time I discussed the matter with Pacquiao he talked of going into full-time Philippines politics next year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Floyd Mayweather sing happy birthday to girlfriend Doralie . Bowing out: Pacquiao has deferred his retirement to 2016, raising possibility of a fight with Mayweather . Future plans: The Filipino boxer wants to go into politics in his homeland after he retires in 2016 . Now speculation is on the rise in the US that Floyd Mayweather may be preparing the ground for a spectacular climax to both his and the Pac-Man’s career. First, as he agreed to his September 13 rematch with Marcos Maidana, Mayweather went public with a teaser for us to expect a surprise announcement for his ensuing fight, scheduled for next May. Since Amir Khan is hoping that will be when he gets his overdue shot at the Money man, nobody got over-excited. But an alternative scenario has arisen from the fall-out following a huge promotional upheaval in American boxing. Golden Boy Oscar De La Hoya, after splitting with long-time partner Richard Schaefer, has brokered a peace with Bob Arum’s Top Rank outfit which should lead to big fights between boxers in each of those stables. Speculative: British boxer Amir Khan wants a run at Mayweather in May 2015 . Mayweather’s long-running feud with Arum, the Pac-Man’s promoter, and insistence he would never work with him again, has been considered the major obstacle to potentially the mother and father of fights in recent times. Mayweather, although a close ally of Schaefer, is having to honour a contract for Golden Boy to promote his second battle with Maidana. But he has applied successfully for promoter’s licenses for his own company in Nevada as well as New York. That has widened his options and reports are circulating in Las Vegas of Mayweather’s battle-bus – a luxury coach emblazoned with his image – being parked for several hours last week outside Arum’s Top Rank offices there. Furthermore, Mayweather’s $200 million-plus, six-fight contract with the Showtime cable TV network is due to come to an end in September 2015, by which time Pacquiao had originally planned to hang up the gloves. VIDEO Mayweather challenges Maidana to put his money where his mouth is . Undefeated: Mayweather has never lost a fight in his career, and would love to finish with a win over Pacquiao . If he wins those three fights, starting with Maidana, Mayweather will equal the 49–win, undefeated record which Rocky Marciano took with him into retirement. What better way to try to surpass that all-time mark than by going for 50 not out in what would be the last fight for both Pacquiao and himself? What better reason for the Filipino Congressman to wait just a few months longer before running for his country’s Senate? Put the television rights for that one in May 2016 and the pair of them would share a mind-boggling bonanza of at least $300 million from by far the richest fight in boxing history. Come on, boys, you know it makes sense.","Manny Pacquiao announced he will retire from the ring in 2016 .
The Filipino boxer has plans to go into politics after he hangs up his gloves .
Pacquiao is yet to fight Floyd Mayweather, with the world waiting to see what would be the richest bout in the sport's history .

"Jose Mourinho blamed the referee for turning Chelsea’s pre-season preparations into a ‘circus’ as the Blues lost 3-0 to Werder Bremen. Referee Harm Osmers, from Hannover, gave two soft penalties to the home side – one for a handball by John Terry and another for a Nathan Ake last-ditch tackle – and Mourinho was unimpressed, calling both decisions ‘nonsense’. The heavy loss on German soil ends this two-week leg of the Blues’ European pre-season tour with their first defeat and they fly back to London on Sunday night with Mourinho feeling disappointed with the way things have gone.

VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho . ‘I learned nothing from this game,’ Mourinho said. ‘Our expectations are not fulfilled because when we decided to have this match here in Bremen we thought about an evolution in difficulty. ‘We were expecting a fast game a competitive game but we come here and the referee thought this was a circus for Bremen fans – for them to have fun - and he killed the match. ‘This game for us would have been perfect. I like the Werder Bremen team - they are fast, intense and they defend with a lot of people. The opponent is perfect for is to compete today but we couldn't play.’ The Portuguese coach felt Osmers disrupted the game and made it a pointless exercise for his side. Tough call?

Tucked away nicely: Felix Kroos strokes home Bremen's second penalty of the afternoon late on . Run outs: Cesc Fabregas and Kurt Zouma both got valuable match time under their belts . Chelsea often found their attacks broken up by the referee’s whistle and struggled to create chances despite the likes of Cesc Fabregas – who played 90 minutes - and Eden Hazard – a second half substitute – being on the field. ‘Every foul, he gave a free kick against us to stop the game - and when we had advantage he stopped the game for a free kick which stopped us playing. ‘The penalties, especially the last one, were nonsense. ‘I am disappointed with that because we want to train and the referee didn't let us have a good session.' Mourinho later told Chelsea TV: 'The referee gave the penalty against Ake to finish his job in this beautiful party because it was a beautiful party for Werder Bremen.

"America’s Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson cut a despondent figure on Friday as he offered a downbeat assessment of his team of crocks. ‘We are dropping like flies, we really are,’ he said. Just over a month to the match at Gleneagles, and it is looking like the Americans will need a hospital ward rather than a team room.

Hurting: The one-great champion admits his physical condition is nowhere near where it needs to be . Jason Dufner’s sad defence of the US PGA Championship ended painfully after just eight holes on Thursday and he is adamant that he will not be seen anywhere near a golf course again until he sorts out two bulging discs in his neck. World No6 Matt Kuchar, the highest-rated American in the world rankings, is another who did not make the starting line-up at Valhalla because of a bad back. Just to put the tin lid on matters, Steve Stricker, who has been selected as a vice-captain but could still make the team, judging by his fine play at this tournament, is fighting a sore hip. No defence: Jason Duffner quit his US PGA Championship defence after just eight holes . Down and out: Dustin Johnson will also miss the Ryder Cup as he takes time away from the golf course . Indeed, the only man who looks fully fit is the captain himself, still sprightly at 64. For a proud man like Watson, of course, it is no laughing matter. ‘I’ll be honest, it’s anyone’s guess who will be playing for us right now,’ he said.

"Arsenal’s Champions League play off first leg against Besiktas will be refereed by a Serbian official accused of showing bias at the World Cup. Milorad Mazic takes charge of the Gunners’ tough trip to Istanbul – and fans will be worried about the his ability to take charge of a game in such an intense and high pressure atmosphere after taking flak from two international managers at this summer’s tournament in Brazil. Portugal coach Paulo Bento said that Mazic ‘showed bias’ in his side’s 4-0 defeat by Germany and Iran’s Carlos Queiroz judged the referee to not to be of the right ‘level’ to match the occasion in their 1-0 loss to Argentina. Bias? Serbian official Milorad Mazic was heavily criticised by managers during the World Cup in Brazil . Mazic was subsequently demoted to be a fourth official for the remainder of the tournament – but is back in action for Arsenal trip to take on Besiktas at the 76,000-seater Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul on Tuesday. ‘In these 90 minutes, we competed to honour the game,’ Queiroz said after the Iran-Argentina tie. ‘But the referee was not on the same level. I’m sorry to say that. ‘There’s nothing that can explain (why) this Serbian referee (did) not give the penalty. How can this guy sleep tonight, or for the rest of his life?’ Winner: Aaron Ramsey celebrates scoring Arsenal's late winner against Crystal Palace at the weekend . Bento was also unhappy with Mazic’s ability. ‘There were two occasions when the referee showed bias, first with the penalty and then with the sending off,’ he said. Mazic was also in charge of Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last season. He has been a FIFA referee since 2009 and has been quoted as having the motto: ‘You can’t please everyone.’ The intimidating atmosphere in istanbul will be nothing new for Mazic, however, who is used to taking charge of the highly-charged Belgrade derby between Red Star and Partizan back in Serbia.

"Manchester City are on the verge of announcing Eliaquim Mangala’s £32million move to the Etihad after confirming that Bruno Zuculini has officially joined the Premier League champions. The deals will coincide with Javi Garcia leaving City to join Zenit St Petersburg after the Russian club agreed to pay £12m up front for the Spaniard and a further £800,000 in add-ons based on their progress in Europe. Manager Manuel Pellegrini remained tight-lipped over Mangala’s arrival on Friday, saying: ‘When things are finished we can talk about that. For the moment, Mangala is not our player.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch City new boys Mangala and Zuculini scoring for  old clubs .

Calm customer: The 23-year-old's arrival will coincide with Javi Garcia's £12m move to Zenit St Petersburg . Composure: The centre-back, one of the most highly-rated young players in Europe, will sign at Etihad for £32m . The 23-year-old France defender passed his medical in Manchester and agreed personal terms nearly a month ago, but his transfer from FC Porto has been held up by complications over third-party ownership. However, it is understood that protracted negotiations have reached a conclusion and the Frenchman will finally complete his move, seven months after City first tried to sign him in the January transfer window. Mangala will team up with his former Porto teammate Fernando at City. The Brazilian midfielder said: ‘I’ve played with him for a long time, he’s a great player and a friend as well. ‘He’s very quick and strong, very competitive. He might bring a different element to the team that City doesn’t have, with his characteristics.’ Big fan: Mangala's former Porto team-mate Fernando, right, moved to Premier League champions this summer .

The Argentina Under-21 midfielder joined City from Racing Club for £3m in June and played on the club’s pre-season tour of America, but the deal was only confirmed on Friday night. He will go straight into the squad for Sunday’s Community Shield clash with Arsenal at Wembley. ‘I’m very excited about the future,’ said Zuculini, who becomes the fifth Argentine to join City after Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis and Willy Caballero. ‘I am looking forward to the experiences which this move will bring and to improving myself as a player.’ On the move? Javi Garcia looks set to seal a £12million move to Zenit St Petersburg after City signed Fernando . Meanwhile, Garcia flew to Russia on Friday to discuss personal terms after City agreed a fee with Zenit. The Spain midfielder signed from Benfica for £15.8m in August 2012 but struggled to win a regular first-team place and made just 31 Premier League starts in two years. The signings of Fernando and Caballero – and imminent arrival of Mangala – meant that City had to cut their quota of foreign players and were prepared to listen to offers for Garcia and Alvaro Negredo. When Negredo broke a bone in his foot last month, it became clear that Garcia was the odd man out.","Move for Mangala comes hot on the heels of Bruno Zuculini's arrival .

"England coach Peter Moores will return to Old Trafford for the fourth Test against India this week to find himself embroiled in Lancashire membership unrest on and off the pitch. The county’s poor form this season, coupled with major concern from members at their inadequate facilities in a ground revamped for the corporates to win back Test cricket, has led to calls for wholesale change. The rebel members, who have enough signatures from a rapidly dwindling membership to demand a special general meeting and a vote of no confidence motion, report that Lancashire’s management have blamed Moores for leaving the side in a poor shape when he took the England job for a second time in April. Trouble: England's Peter Moores (pictured with Jos Buttler) is at the centre of a Lancashire membership unrest . The fans’ concerns centre on a flawed structure in which director of cricket Mike Watkinson reports on playing matters to board member and close friend Paul Allott, with the club failing to appoint an overseas batsman at the start of the season while making poor signings and depending too much on young players. Ian Lomax, one of the action group leaders, said: ‘We have already voiced our serious worries to the club hierarchy but they fully support Watkinson as well as Allott’s role. They intimated that Moores was at fault for the playing policy and not doing enough to sign a top overseas batsman.’ Members’ grouses over Old Trafford involve their pavilion view being greatly obscured by a giant sightscreen that wasn’t see-through as first promised. Lancashire chairman Michael Cairns has said that if members were unhappy with what he had accomplished with the ground development he would consider resigning and taking his board with him.

"Dozens of angry Filipinos gathered outside a military base where a young American soldier is being held accused of murdering a transgender woman, in a protest which ended in the victim's family scaling the fence . The boyfriend and sister of Jennifer Laude, 26, climbed into the military base in Manila, demanding to see the teenage U.S. Marine accused of her murder. Earlier this week,  the U.S. military turned over Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, from New Bedford, Massachusetts, to the Philippine military's main camp. Protest: Marilou Laude, the sister of murdered Filipina Jennifer Laude, climbs the gate of the facility where PfC Joseph Scott Pemberton is detained at the Armed Forces of the Philippine (AFP) headquarters in Manila . However, Jennifer Laude's family have expressed their anger at Pemberton being guarded by U.S. forces at the base and yesterday gathered outside the base, demanding proof that the teenage marine was really kept there. Marilou Laude, the sister of Jennifer, who was born Jefferey, climbed over the fence and into the base and was swiftly captured by guards. Jennifer Laude's German boyfriend Marc Susselbeck also jumped over the fence, and was seen pushing an army guard. Laude, who was born Jeffrey, was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City, around two hours drive from Manila, on October 11. Anger: German Marc Susselbeck, Laude's boyfriend, follows over the gates as the family demands to see the teenage U.S. soldier accused of killing transgender Jennifer . Action: Susselbeck pushed past one of the Filipino guards in an attempt to get access to the base . Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met her in a nightclub and didn't know she was transgender until they were in a hotel room. Killed: Transgender Jennifer Laude, 26, was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City . Laude, who was said to have been unemployed and living off a monthly allowance from Susselbeck, was later found strangled to death there, her head in a toilet bowl. Pemberton was detained on board the USS Peleliu at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 50 miles northwest of Manila, after he was implicated in the death. Pemberton's transfer by helicopter to Manila early Wednesday was agreed by the U.S. and the Philippines, Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang told a news conference. He said that Pemberton will be detained in an air-conditioned van, directly guarded by U.S. Marines while Philippine military guards will be posted outside the compound, he said. 'They agreed to put him in a facility which will pass U.S. custodial standards,' Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said. 'We're happy with this because he's a suspect in a crime that was committed in our country.' Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who has described Laude's death as tragic, said that the arrangement showed 'mechanisms are in place so that justice can be served,' adding there was strong cooperation between the treaty allies. Philippine and U.S. authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another U.S. Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005, also at the Subic freeport. Accused: U.S. marine Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, from Massachusetts  is accused of strangling Laude, 26 . Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-U.S. protests. In the latest case, Philippine police and witnesses said Pemberton and Laude met at a bar in the city of Olongapo on October 11, then went to a hotelroom where Laude's body was later found in the bathroom. She had apparently been drowned in the toilet bowl, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo. U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended October 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed. Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members, but the U.S. has custody over them 'from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings.' Tragedy: Jennifer's mother Julita Laude cries in front of the coffin of her daughter during her funeral in Olongapo City, Zambales province north of Manila . Mourning: Relatives of  Jennifer Laude, including her sister and her German boyfriend, walk during her funeral march in Olongapo City . Protest: Students gather for a rally at the University of the Philippines campus at suburban Quezon city, northeast of Manila, to demand justice for Jennifer . The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted U.S. military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention. Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946. Left-wing groups have staged small protests at the U.S. Embassy in Manila and at the Subic wharf where the USS Peleliu is moored, demanding Washington to turn over Pemberton to Philippine authorities for prosecution and detention and calling for the 1998 agreement's abrogation. President Benigno Aquino III on Monday defended the agreement, saying a crime can happen anywhere and 'the sin of one person' should not reflect on the entire country. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that Washington seeks no special privilege for the suspect but only protection of his rights.

"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has had a complete change of heart by insisting he will embark on the first European campaign of his managerial career with a view to winning the Europa League. Unsurprisingly he likes the incentive of the invite to the Champions League that comes with the trophy and it will be interesting to see to what extent Tottenham’s priorities change after the New Year, if they are off the pace in the Barclays Premier League but still in this competition. VIDEO Scroll down to hear from Pochettino and see Tottenham train ahead of clash . Ready for action: Tottenham training at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium in Larnaca . Until then, there are caveats galore from Pochettino, who dismissed the Europa League as a competition that ‘kills you’ when he was at Southampton. ‘It’s not a competition that’s attractive to me,’ he had said in February. ‘I don’t see the appeal. It’s for teams not good enough to be playing with the best.’ His tune has changed, and who can blame him? It still takes 16 games to make it from this stage to the final in Warsaw in May, but UEFA have upped the ante with the Champions League place on offer and the Argentinian has moved to Spurs, where he has a stronger squad and greater expectation than at Southampton. ‘The Europa League is now a different competition,’ said Pochettino here last night. ‘Why? Well, if you won it last year you basically got nothing, just a trophy. Now the Europa League gives you the opportunity to play in the Champions League. That is a big challenge for us.’ Nevertheless, Tottenham travelled to Cyprus for the first leg of their play-off tie against AEL Limassol with a 21-man squad missing several senior players. Five of those who started at West Ham on Saturday have not travelled — Aaron Lennon, Younes Kaboul, Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Eriksen and Etienne Capoue — and there could be as many as nine changes. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris prefers to carry on playing as will Kyle Naughton, sent off at Upton Park and banned from Sunday’s home game against Queens Park Rangers. Both should start. Back-up keeper Michel Vorm has not been included in the squad for this round after an extended World Cup with Holland. Providing Spurs qualify, they will submit another squad before the group stage which starts next month after the transfer window has closed. Trophy target: Naughton (left), Chadli (centre) and Paulinho train on Wednesday . It is a calculated risk against AEL. The runners-up in the Cypriot League should not trouble Spurs but they gave Zenit St Petersburg, managed by Andre Villas-Boas, a fright in the Champions League qualifiers, beating the Russians 1-0 in Larnaca before losing 3-0 away. Tottenham are still capable of fielding a strong team, such is the depth available, and Pochettino intends to work closely with his medical team and the club’s sports scientists to monitor individual fitness levels as the season unfolds. ‘The year is very difficult because of the World Cup,’ he said. ‘The players came in to train at different times. We need to analyse each case and work to decide what is best for the player and the team. We need to be clear when we start a recovery, not only (a player’s) physical performance but his psychology, too.’ Temperatures are expected to reach 38˚C in Larnaca, where AEL Limassol play their European games in Anorthosis Famagusta’s Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium because their own does not meet UEFA’s floodlight standards. Change of tune: Mauricio Pochettino once dismissed the Europa League as a competition that ‘kills you’ ‘We travelled four-and-a-half hours from London,’ said Pochettino. ‘It is more than 30 degrees and it is tough for the players. It is a different environment. We need to be focused and ready. ‘We need to change our chip — our way of thinking — because AEL will be difficult opponents.’ AEL’s Bulgarian coach Ivaylo Petev is aware his side’s task is a tall one, but insisted: ‘There is belief.’ Pochettino will be satisfied if it all begins in the same way as his European debut as a player, also in Cyprus, when Espanyol beat APOEL Nicosia 3-2 on aggregate in the UEFA Cup in 1996.

"Manchester City touched down in London after catching a private jet ahead of the Community Shield final against Arsenal. Manuel Pellegrini's side go into the clash as heavy favourites at Wembley to compete for the first piece of silverware this season. Frank Lampard is already showing his commitment to his new club by travelling to London and staying with the team at the Landmark Hotel.  The former Chelsea midfielder, who is on a sixth month loan at City, will not be playing, however. WATCH Scroll down for 'Pellegrini: New signings won't be ready for Community Shield' All aboard! Manchester City caught a private jet ahead of their Community Shield clash against Arsenal . Sunshine: Vincent Kompany chilled with a pair of sunglasses before boarding the plane . It's good to talk: Yaya Toure was pictured on the phone as Alvaro Negredo hobbled on a pair of crutches . Moving on up: Frank Lampard embarked on the jet ahead of manager Manuel Pellegrini . Following him closely: Lampard walked on with City coach Brian Kidd before travelling to London . Alvaro Negredo also hopped aboard despite being on crutches, but it's Samir Nasri who is really causing a stir. The midfielder insists he is not affected by 'stupid' abuse from Arsenal fans - and has risked further stoking up the animosity by appearing to dismiss their title hopes. The midfielder moved from north London to the north-west in 2011 and has been a target of the Emirates Stadium boo-boys whenever the sides have met since. But having won two Barclays Premier League titles and a League Cup in that time, scoring in the final of the latter as City defeated Sunderland last season, he is comfortable the move was the best thing for his career. 'The abuse doesn't affect me on the pitch, I just think it's stupid,' Nasri said. ''I'm not an Arsenal fan, I am not from London. If we want to be honest, we are players who look at what is in the the best interests for us and our career. 'When Manchester City came, it was the best choice for me to come here. And today I have won trophies, I am really happy, I have everything and I have a better life.' Several former Arsenal colleagues have made the same move to City and Nasri continued: 'If the fans can't move on then it's too bad. They love their club, maybe they saw it as treason or that I betrayed them. But it's not that. I just look at for what's best for me; and that's what Bacary Sagna did, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure.' Nasri - who has all but confirmed his retirement from international football, having been left out of the World Cup squad by coach Didier Deschamps - does not appear concerned with building bridges with Arsenal fans either as he prepares to face them again in the Community Shield. New deal: Central defender Kompany is to be offered a contract worth £60million over the next six years . Looking back: Pellegrini gets on the plane alongside Samir Nasri, who has angered Arsenal fans recently . Assessing the new season's title race, he acknowledged the ability of Gunners signing Alexis Sanchez but feels the main threat to his side comes from elsewhere in London. 'I think Chelsea will be the biggest threat,' he said. 'For me, Arsenal still have a weakness in defensive mid(field) and at centre-back. 'Chelsea's signings have really caught my eye. Cesc Fabregas is a great replacement for Frank Lampard, I know that from playing with him at Arsenal. They had a weakness up front so they've signed Diego Costa who was great for Atletico Madrid last season. They lost Ashley Cole but bought in Filipe Luis. 'For Arsenal, Sanchez has the quality, but the Premier League is not La Liga. It is really, really hard. We saw that with Mesut Ozil last year. At the start of the season he was brilliant but he found out when every other league has a break in December, you carry on playing in England. We had the same with Stevan Jovetic at City.'

"Tony Pulis walked out on Crystal Palace on Thursday night, less than 48 hours before the start of the Premier League season. The 56-year-old manager spent hours in a crisis meeting with Palace chairman Steve Parish following a row over the club’s transfer policy, before it was revealed that he had left by mutual consent. However, it is understood that Pulis refused to carry on, in protest against the entire running of the club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger: Tony Pulis made a miracle at Palace .

Although former Stoke boss Pulis took training as usual on Thursday morning, Parish summoned him to their meeting at a central London location.

"Chris Wood came off the bench to earn a dramatic draw for Leicester on their return to the Premier League after 10 years away. The 22-year New Zealander striker slammed home late on to sent the home crowd wild and install a belief that perhaps this won’t be a campaign of struggle after all. Everton had threatened to burst the Foxes’ comeback bubble after taking two leads, first via Aiden McGeady and then Steven Naismith, either side of a Leicester goal on his debut from record £8m signing Leonardo Ulloa. But Wood’s strike gave the hosts a point - and a 12th draw with Everton in 17 Premier League meetings now, all-time. This was Leicester’s first Premier League match after 10 long years in the wilderness. Their last top-flight match was a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal. Their manager was Micky Adams, their scorer was Paul Dickov, netting against the ‘Invincibles’ Gunners team of Bergkamp, Henry, Vieira, Ljungberg et al.

Referee: Mike Jones (Cheshire) Since dropping at the end of that 2003-04 campaign, Leicester have been as low as League One, have changed owners to become part of a Thai Duty Free empire - and been through 15 different managerial teams, caretakers included. Nigel Pearson, in charge since late 2011, has been transformative and his team started brightly, not bowed by the occasion. The first chance, albeit speculative, came as Anthony Knockaert floated a long shot from the left. It shouldn’t have troubled Tim Howard but it was dipping just below the crossbar when he grabbed it shakily. Everton’s John Stones caught the eye at right-back with a decent understanding with McGeady on the flank ahead of him. McGeady’s 11th-minute shot was straight at Kasper Schmeichel but a sign of the danger ahead. The opener came in the 20th minute, impetus courtesy of Leighton Baines’ low driven shot, deflected out to Sylvain Distin, whose own shot was saved. The ball fell to McGeady on the left, and with one look up he curled a precision shot to the top right-hand corner, going in net off the post. Leicester were level within two minutes. Everton failed to deal with Knockaert’ s corner and Ulloa, a summer signing from Brighton, slammed home. The 28-year-old Argentine forward could make a huge difference to whether Leicester sink or swim this season. Certainly he he proved prolific one level down, scoring 23 league goals in 50 games for Brighton after moving from Ameria in Spain in January last year. Expectations for Leicester are high, among the ownership group at least, who are quite pleased with themselves for their work in getting their club to the Premier League. Chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha had a full-page photograph of himself on yesterday’s match programme cover. There was another one filling page four. And page seven. And page eight. There was also a three-page interview with him where he talked about it being especially fitting for Leicester to return to the Premier League in 2014 as it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the club’s Thai parent company, King Power International.

Srivaddhanaprabha’s son, who is Leicester’s vice-chairman, used his own programme notes to opine: ‘We’re a club that can compete in this league, we have a team that has the potential to achieve great things.’ It would be more prudent to have survival as a first priority, although that will become apparent as the season wears on. A tough start continues with league games next at Chelsea, against Arsenal, at Stoke and against Manchester United. Everton took the lead just before the interval, after threatening again via Stone and McGeady and being thwarted by lack of a finish from Romelu Lukaku. Steven Pienaar’s scuffed shot ended up with Naismith, who his a left-footed rising shot from 12 yards. Ulloa missed a header in the 54th half, wide, to spurn the host’s best chance to that point of getting back into this but then substitute Jeff Schlupp blazed over with a comic mis-hit to put that in perspective. The lively Riyad Mahrez had put Schlupp through and might have elicited a red card later from Gareth Barry for a tough block but referee Mike Jones did not hand out the second yellow necessary. With four minutes left, Wood picked up a loose ball after a Mahrez run and rushed forward to net. The KP went nuts.

This, . remember, is the same venue where England’s World Cup warm-up against . Honduras was held up for 20 minutes last month because of thunderstorms . and lightning; and the same stadium where Sterling and Valencia were . sent off for an ugly confrontation when Roy Hodgson’s side had met . Ecuador met three days earlier. Any . chance of another ding-dong between the two disappeared inside eight . minutes as Valencia went off injured – curiously he had been omitted . from the line-ups broadcast on TV beforehand – and replaced by Luke . Shaw. The change also meant . that Ashley Young switched from left to right. As well as he has played . on tour, Young does not offer the same defensive protection as Valencia . and United discovered that to their cost five minutes later. Can't believe it: Rooney walked off with an embarrassed look on his face after the 'goal' Out: The ball clearly hits the stanchion before bouncing out towards Rooney to slot home . Sterling . had already caused them enough problems down the left flank when he . pushed the ball past Phil Jones inside the penalty box. Jones is not the . quickest of centre-backs, nor can he always resist the temptation to . dive in, and on this occasion it cost his team a penalty. The . way he and his teammates protested showed just how much this game meant . to them, but it was the right decision by referee Mark Geiger even . though Jones got the slightest of touches. After that, there was never . any doubt Gerrard would beat David De Gea from the spot. In . fact, Liverpool should have had another penalty in the 34th minute when . Jones’s poor pass played Chris Smalling into trouble. Rickie Lambert . laid the ball to Sterling and the fact that Ander Herrera clearly fouled . him with his second attempt to tackle the winger was somehow missed by . the match officials. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . Judgement: Van Gaal looks on from the dugout as his first season with United nears . Curler: Rooney attempts a free-kick for United in the first-half in Miami, but it hits the wall . Popular tourists: United have been the main attraction in the US over the past two weeks . United’s . best chance in the first half arrived as early as the fifth minute when . Javier Hernandez slid in to turn Young’s outswinging pass back across . goal and Mamadou Sakho’s last-ditch clearance denied Rooney an almost . certain goal. Liverpool had . the best of it, though, and Jordan Henderson headed over from a great . position when Hernandez could only help Gerrard’s freekick into his path . before Phillipe Coutinho brought a fantastic save from De Gea down by . his near post. They continued to threaten after half-time and could have scored another two within five minutes of the restart. This . time it was Herrera’s turn to put Mata under pressure with a poor pass. He was easily dispossessed and Gerrard squared the ball to Lambert . whose finish from 10 yards lacked conviction. Piling in: Hernandez, who missed a sitter early on in Miami, loses out to Skrtel in the second-half . Focus: Ander Herrera passes the ball under pressure from Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson . In front: United midfielder Juan Mata looks to get to the ball ahead of defender Martin Skrtel . Moments . later, Coutinho again exposed Jones with a pass in behind the United . defender and Sterling cut inside only to see his effort deflect wide off . the heels of Smalling. So you could understand the sense of shock when United suddenly struck back with two goals in three minutes. It . was difficult to tell which was better, Hernandez’s cross or Rooney’s . finish, when they got the first. The Mexican picked out his teammate’s . run with a quite wonderful ball to the back post. There was still plenty . of work to do from a tight angle with Martin Skrtel in close . attendance, but Rooney watched the ball all the way before guiding it . back across Simon Mignolet and inside the far post with his left foot. Unfortunate: Antonio Valencia (right) came off early on after injury for United for Luke Shaw . Denied: Javier Hernandez sees his effort from distance blocked by Liverpool captain Gerrard . Pivot: United midfielder Ashley Young turns away from the attention of Glen Johnson . If . Liverpool could feel slightly aggrieved at being pegged back, they were . positively shocked to fall behind to Mata’s strike moments later. There . seemed little danger when Shaw played the ball into the Spaniard 20 . yards from goal but Mata took advantage of poor marking to turn and . shoot. Sakho spotted the danger too late and only succeeded in applying a . vital nick which left his goalkeeper wrong-footed. United . thought they had grabbed a bizarre third in the 65th minute when . Young’s booming effort from the left touchline had Mignolet backtracking . towards his own goal. In fact, the Belgian keeper was in the . side-netting by the time it landed inches over the bar but then . rebounded back off the frame of the goal. Hefty: Ashley Young goes in hard on Glen Johnson as United looked to get a foothold in the game . In behind: Raheem Sterling slips the ball past Phil Jones as the midfielder looks to build an attack . Clothes line: Jones then hands off Sterling to the face as the young winger looked to accelerate . Ever . the predator, Rooney was lurking to guide home the loose ball but the . furtive glance and wry smile gave something away long before the error . was spotted on television and the goal chalked off. There . was nothing wrong with Lingard’s effort in the 88th minute though. Again Young was involved, racing down the right and crossing into the . Liverpool box. Shinji Kagawa miscontrolled but it only teed the ball up . for Lingard who took one touch before rifling a shot past Mignolet. No doubt the scoreline flattered United.

"A two-year-old boy has been left paralysed from the chest down just hours after walking up the stairs for the first time in his life. John James Michalowski , known as JJ, will never walk again after suffering severe spinal injuries when Daniel Thrower crashed into his family's car on March 8. Thrower, 34, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court yesterday. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old John James Michalowski , known as JJ, (right) will never walk again after suffering severe spinal injuries and being paralysed from the chest down after Daniel Thrower, 34, (left) crashed into his family's car . He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking which involved him driving the Ford Mondeo dangerously on the A628 bypass in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, and causing the accident which injured the toddler and three others travelling in a Peugeot 407. The court heard that JJ's father Igor and sisters Llacia Michalowski and Leah Darley all suffered injury in the horror crash. JJ's mum, Katy Michalowski, said: 'Although JJ had been walking since he was nine-months-old, the morning of the accident he actually walked up and down the stairs for the first time like an adult would. It breaks my heart to know now he will never walk again. 'I just want him to be able to have his own independence and play like all the other children. 'He can't sit up by himself and he gets very frustrated at times that we have to do everything with him. He needs constant care and support for his back and we don't have the equipment we need to be able to give him that. 'I've still got hope for JJ. From the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep, all he does is smile.' JJ (pictured with his mother Katy) had walked up stairs for the first time unaided just hours prior to the crash . The youngster, along with his father Igor (pictured together right) and two sisters was injured when Thrower's stolen Ford Mondeo crashed into the family's Peugeot 407 on the A628 bypass in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire . Mrs Michalowski, who is a carer at a nursing home, said she can't remember much about the day of the crash but said it has changed her life completely. She said: 'The accident has torn our family apart. 'I had no idea what had happened because I was in work. I got a phone call at work and I thought it was just a bump but when I turned up at the hospital I saw a police car and I knew it was worse.' Doctors thought the toddler had suffered brain damage but later found that he had extensive damage to his spine. Thrower, 34, (pictured outside Wakefield Magistrates' Court at an earlier hearing) will be sentenced next month after admitting the offences . He will now be paralysed from the chest down for the rest of his life and needs to use a ventilator to help him breathe when sleeping. Mrs Michalowski: 'They knew JJ was ill at the crash because he was sick instantly. He was alert until he got to the hospital and then he stopped responding. He didn't respond for five hours and they thought he had brain problems. 'He had a CT scan but that didn't show anything so they then did the MRI scan. It showed that he had back injuries and at that time he didn't have use of his legs or arms. 'We've being doing a lot of rehab and JJ shouldn't have the use of his arms, but can now use them. He is very intelligent and fantastic with his hands which is why we want him to have an electric wheelchair. He likes to do things himself and is very determined. If he can do it, he will.' Richard Davies, defending, asked for sentencing to be adjourned until September 4 for a pre-sentence report to be prepared. Judge Guy Kearl QC, bailed Thrower, until his next appearance but warned him: 'It's almost inevitable that you will be sentenced to a custodial sentence and you know that.' Members of the youngster's family were in court to hear Thrower enter his guilty pleas. JJ's family are now aiming to raise money to buy specialist equipment, including a joystick-controlled wheelchair to give him back some independence.

"Juan Mata signed his first autograph when he was only 12. It had nothing to do with football, though. Part of a six-strong school quiz team that conquered all-comers in the Spanish Principality of Asturias, the young Mata returned from a subsequent competition in northern Europe to find himself unexpectedly popular. ‘It was just the younger children at school asking me to sign my name,’ recalled Mata bashfully. ‘It was the first time in my life. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal tell Wayne Rooney how to shoot . Main aim: Juan Mata insists Manchester United must get into the Champions League this season . Star in the making: The Manchester United midfielder signed his first autograph at the age of 12 . ‘The quizzes were about history, geography, maths - everything. But it wasn’t down to me. We had two children on the team who were very clever. I did my bit, but was more in the background. They were the reason we won.’ Fast forward 14 years and Mata has signed his share of autographs. Ahead of a new season at Manchester United, however, this is no time for the 26-year-old to be part of a supporting cast. If Louis van Gaal’s revolution at Old Trafford is to propel United back towards the top of the Barclays Premier League, players such as Mata really must be to the fore. Revolution: Mata must be at the fore of the Louis van Gaal revolution if United are to be successful this term . The headline on the last of his internet blogs last season was written the day United lost at Everton in April, two days before manager David Moyes was sacked. A Spanish saying, it reads: ‘Falling down is allowed. Getting back up is mandatory.’ As a phrase, it would appear to work perfectly as United seek recovery from the wreckage of last season. ‘Yes, I think it’s appropriate,’ says Mata in excellent English. ‘We are facing a new season with new goals. It’s a new era and we have a new manager and players. It’s a new chance to show that this club can fight for titles. So, yes, it’s time to get back up.’ During Van Gaal’s short time at the club, much has been made of the 62-year-old’s new tactical approach. Rarely has a switch of formation prompted so much chatter. But if anyone is to benefit from a move from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-1-2, it is Mata. New era: Spaniard Mata will benefit from the new role implemented by Van Gaal at Old Trafford . He will start the season in the ‘No 10’ position so loved by the Dutch. The Spaniard will be back in his favourite role - playing behind two strikers - after last season’s struggles to the left and right of Moyes’ formation. It is also a role he played with some success under another Dutch coach, Ronald Koeman, at Valencia in 2007-08. ‘I hope it will be (perfect) for me,’ he acknowledged. ‘I feel comfortable in that position. I can play as a midfielder defensively or as a striker offensively if that’s what I have to do. ‘But my mission is to assist and score. I can do that from this position and I hope I can have a great season. But more importantly it has to be a great season for the team. This system is difficult and it’s difficult to adapt. You have to be very fit, for example. Favourite role: Mata will play the 'No 10' for United and is determind to score more goals . ‘You have to be focused but, if you manage to master it, you can put lots of pressure on the opponent and you can hurt them with the ball. ‘I think everyone knows that Dutch football likes to play a good way, a way I like to play and watch. This manager wants passing and movement and triangles. It’s how I play my best.’ Last season presented only brief glimpses of Mata’s true self. He scored six league goals after his January transfer from the shadows at Chelsea but was rarely as influential as he would have liked. When Ryan Giggs - one of his childhood heroes - took over as interim manager for the final four league games, he picked Mata for only two of them. Hero: Ryan Giggs, a childhood hero of Juan Mata, picked the Spaniard in two of his four games in charge . ‘He spoke to me about it,’ said Mata. ‘He said to the whole team that he was going to use every player. He told me he wanted a different kind of player in that situation and that was it. It was okay. ‘When I arrived at the club he was very good to me and I don’t forget that. It was difficult at the start, after I arrived. The team was in a bad situation and I hadn’t been training at Chelsea and I wasn’t physically ready to play. The team didn’t play at our best level, none of us. I’m looking forward to this season to try to do my best and helping the team back to the level we know it should be at.’ Giggs, of course, is Van Gaal’s assistant manager now. In the weeks of pre-season, though, it has all been about the one they call the ‘Iron Tulip’. Assistant: United legend Ryan Giggs will act as Van Gaal's No 2 at Old Trafford next season . In America on tour, United trained twice a day, with Van Gaal so close to the action his players could all but hear him breathing. The phrase ‘hands on’ could have been invented for the former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach and it is tempting to wonder if his habit, for example, of telling players how to take penalties - as he did with Wayne Rooney in Denver - may grate after a while. There is, after all, no point hiring a great painter and telling him how to hold his brush. ‘Yeah, he told Wazza how to shoot, but it’s very good,’ he said. ‘He is a manager who feels every session. Not just a game but a training session. To him, it’s all important. He is very into it. ‘Sometimes he sees a striker or midfielder not make the right pass, he stops the session and tells them. He loves to do that. He is very temperamental. ‘I think the example with Wazza, he was right. If you face the goalkeeper you have to wait for him to go and then put the ball in the other side. Helping hand: Mata revealed new manager Van Gaal told Man United captain Wayne Rooney how to shoot . ‘It’s easy to say it but not so easy to do it when you are in the 88th minute of a game. So you must practise. Everything he says is meant to help. ‘You must have an open mind. If you are a professional player, that’s basic. I have had many managers during the past years and I can learn from all of them. Now with Louis van Gaal we have a new way of working and we are all trying to adapt. Even the goalkeeper has an important role in the game-play.’ Had some United players been more open-minded to Moyes’ approach last season, things might have been different. There is no doubt, however, the club feels as though it has a little more direction and momentum under Van Gaal. The club that was preparing to defend its title just 12 months ago still feels short of a couple of world-class players in key positions, while much will depend on not only Mata’s form and fitness but also that of Rooney and Robin van Persie. As we talk in a Cheshire hotel another Spaniard, Ander Herrera, is conducting an interview in an adjacent room. Mata feels he will bring something to a squad he firmly believes can undo most of last season’s damage. All smiles: Mata knows all about new signing Ander Herrera and believes the Spaniard can help Man United . ‘We played together at Under 21 and Under 20 level for Spain,’ recalled Mata. ‘I know how good Ander is and I know he can bring very good things to us. He is a very talented midfielder and the manager likes that way of playing. He can also defend very well. ‘Football has no memory. It’s non-stop. You can have a good result on Saturday and be a good team but then lose on Wednesday and be the worst team ever. ‘We would all love to win the league but the most important goal - what this club needs - is to play in the Champions League again. ‘I cannot imagine a Champions League two years in a row without United.’ Unimaginable: Mata can't picture United going two seasons in a row without playing Champions League football . As he leaves the room at the end of our meeting, Mata still cannot believe the story about his school quiz team is no longer a secret. Neither is the one about him and his sister Paula posing for a poster advert for the Spanish bank Banco Herrero. ‘My uncle worked there and he asked us,’ laughed Mata. ‘On the picture, my sister and I are pointing at the sky and looking through a telescope.’ Again the image is amusing but the imagery appropriate. It’s time for Juan Mata and Manchester United to look upwards once again. Fame at an early age: A young Mata and his sister on a poster for Banco Herrero .

"Dina Asher-Smith called it ‘the best day of my life’. The 18-year-old found out she had got the A-level results required to read history at King’s College. Then she broke the British 200m junior record to sail into tonight’s European Championships final, where a medal is a distinct possibility. The only downside was missing out on a dance in Tiger Tiger nightclub. ‘I really couldn’t have asked for much more,’ she said, ‘definitely the best day of my life and I’m going into the final fit and I feel I can go faster than I did as I slowed down at the end.’ Asher-Smith lowered her personal best by a stunning 0.13sec to 22.61sec, finishing second in the semi-final behind France’s Myriam Soumare, who is nine years her senior. Asher-Smith will be joined in the final by Bianca Williams and 20-year-old Jodie Williams, who eased down to win her heat in 22.90sec. Best day: Asher-Smith said it was the best day of her life after breaking the British 200m junior record . Personal best: Asher-Smith lowered her personal best by 0.13 seconds to 22.61sec . As her friends gathered at Newstead Wood School in Orpington, Kent, to collect their exam results, Asher-Smith spent a frustrating journey from the team hotel to Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium failing to check her own results online. ‘I couldn’t get logged on,’ she said, ‘so my mum texted me that I had got into King’s and I was like, “Yippee!” I don’t know exactly what I got but I needed three As so somewhere around there.’ Despite her exploits, Asher-Smith was confident she would get a good night’s sleep ahead of the final. Meanwhile, her friends in London were planning to celebrate their exam results with a night out. ‘I’m just going to have an early night,’ she said, ‘Most of my friends are going to Tiger Tiger, the nightclub. I know I’ll get loads of photos saying, “Oh my gosh, look what I was wearing?” and I’ll be like, “Great, remember to tune into TV this evening”.’ Finish: The 18-year-old crosses the line ahead of Hanna-Maari Latvala and Yekaterina Vukolova . Last month Asher-Smith became 100m world junior champion in Oregon. Now she is planning how to balance university life and training sessions with her coach John Blackie in Bromley. Another academic in the team, William Sharman, won Great Britain’s eighth medal with silver in the 110m hurdles. Sharman was unsure whether he had won a medal more than a minute after he crossed the line as officials deliberated over a four-way photo finish. The big screen finally revealed he had snatched second place by the length of his buzz cut. Sharman, a classically trained pianist, was leading until the penultimate hurdle when Russian Sergey Shubenkov produced a late surge to win in 13.13sec. Sharman, who has a degree in economics, timed his dip perfectly to take silver in 13.27sec. France’s Thomas Martinot-Lagarde took bronze in 13.38sec. ‘It’s mixed emotions because I knew I was in the lead,’ said Sharman. ‘I could have done more and that’s why I was gutted.’ Zurich: Asher-Smith crosses the finish line ahead of Hanna-Maari Latvala of Finland .

"Cooking is my thing. I’m a trained chef and it’s what I love doing most. But still, there are some things I just don’t have time to make. Jars of factory-made pesto and mayonnaise are regulars on my shopping list. And there are dishes that never seem to work out, such as my pavlovas, which often flop or crack. I’m sure I’m not the only busy mum who often wishes I had an extra pair of hands in the kitchen. My husband is too busy with Very Important Meetings to help with the cooking, and our daughters, aged nine and ten, are too young to be trusted with tasks much beyond making cupcakes. Scroll down for video . Anne Shooter says the Thermomix is expensive but worth every penny as it chops, stirs and blends dishes . But a new addition to my household could be the answer to my prayers. At £925, the Thermomix is expensive — but if it’s as adept as is claimed, it will be worth every penny. My new best friend is not so much a food processor as a mini robot. It was invented in 1971 by German company Vorwerk and is loved by Michelin-starred chefs from Heston Blumenthal to Raymond Blanc. Besides blending, it can heat, chop and stir, as well as taking the slog out of tricky dishes such as risotto and mayonnaise as well as whipping up an instant sorbet or ice cream. Now it has been overhauled for the 21st-century home kitchen. Most impressively, it has a touch screen that displays recipes and step-by-step guidance on making bread, cakes, soups, salads, mousses and more. As well as taking the slog out of tricky dishes such as risotto and mayonnaise it whips up an instant sorbet or ice cream . The grey and white machine looks like a medical testing kit — a metal jug on a white base with a few knobs and a small screen. The base contains scales, with the weight shown on the display, so you can add 200g of butter, reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen, then add 200g of flour and so on. The machine can also heat up the jug to 120c, so dishes can be warmed to specific temperatures. Inside the jug are four super-sharp blades attached to a motor which, at the highest setting, can pulverise fruit, vegetables, herbs and even dried beans in seconds. The base contains scales, with the weight shown on the display, so you can add 200g of butter, reset the scale to zero on the touchscreen, then add 200g of flour and so on. To start, you turn on the machine and select the cookery book option on the screen. There are 200 recipes to choose from and you get a step-by-step run-through of each. Once all ingredients have been added, the display states the speed required. The machine is programmed to know how long the motor must run and the temperature required. More complex dishes require ingredients to be added throughout the process, in which case the Thermomix stops and waits for you to do so. Once the new ingredient is added, you select ‘next’ again. When the recipe is completed, the display says ‘done’. Frankly, I thought the machine sounded too good to be true, so I decided to test out eight recipes including time-consuming risotto and the pesto I usually buy. Is it just another maddening gadget? Or the miracle aid busy mums have been waiting for? Mayonnaise . The egg mixture often splits when I make mayo, so this will surely put the machine to the test. I crack an egg into the machine and add lemon juice, mustard powder, salt and pepper, and run the motor for 90 seconds while drizzling 300g of sunflower oil through the hole in the top of the jug onto the egg mixture. At the end, the machine turns itself off, I look in the bowl and am amazed to find wonderfully glossy mayonnaise — perfect for my lunchtime sandwich. Verdict . This took less than two minutes and tastes far superior to anything you get in the supermarket. Rustic bread . There’s nothing like freshly baked bread, but it’s tricky to do well. The Thermomix prompts me to add pre-measured amounts of water, buttermilk and yeast to the jug. On a touch of the ‘next’ button, the jug heats to 32 degrees — the perfect heat for yeast — and I set the dial to a gentle ‘2’ so it stirs rather than whizzes. Then I am told to add 600g flour, plus salt, balsamic vinegar and malt extract, which I weigh into the jug as instructed. When I next start the machine it works in reverse, gently kneading the dough, rather than chopping it. Then I can tip out my soft, springy dough and leave it to rise, before baking in the oven. Verdict . The most delicious, wholesome bread I have ever tasted. Yoghurt cake . The Thermomix screen tells me to preheat the oven and grease my round bundt pan (for a cake with a hole in the middle). Then I follow the instructions to add lemon zest and sugar and turn the motor. Next, in go three eggs, which unfortunately I do have to crack myself. These are followed by flour, yogurt, sunflower oil, salt and baking powder, which I pour through the same hole into the jug. A minute of whizzing at speed six and my batter is ready to pour into the tin to bake in the oven. Verdict . A superb, light, fluffy cake made in less than half the time it would usually take me. Strawberry and banana sorbet . I measure 60g of sugar into the Thermomix and blitz it at speed seven for ten seconds to make it super-fine. Then I add 500g of frozen strawberries and some bananas, together with an egg white and a squeeze of lemon juice, then whizz for 90 seconds. That’s it. Stunning sorbet, ready to eat. Verdict . This is like magic and the sorbet is incredibly moreish. Beetroot salad . I’m cynical as I start making this. After all, salads are easy and I am the queen of chopping. Still, I add four scrubbed and trimmed beetroots, two carrots, an apple, shallot, a little oil, salt, sugar and lemon juice and whizz it for — wait for it — five seconds. I’m surprised to find perfect chopped salad (far smaller and neater than I could chop), dressed and ready to serve. Verdict . Delicious and possibly the easiest food I’ve ever made. Risotto . I find risotto a chore to make with all that stirring, so I can’t wait to see if the Thermomix makes it more quickly. First I add 80g of Parmesan, whizz it so it is grated finely and tip into a small bowl. Then I add a shallot, whizz that, then butter and olive oil, which the machine weighs for me. Next the machine stirs and heats everything — sauteeing my shallot perfectly. I add rice and white wine, which bubbles for one minute, followed by stock, seasoning and a pinch of saffron. The machine cooks and stirs the mixture for 13 minutes. When it’s done, I add the Parmesan. Verdict . This is as good as any I have had in an Italian restaurant. Pesto . I whizz the Parmesan in the machine for 15 seconds. I add pine nuts, garlic, basil leaves, salt and extra virgin olive oil, and blitz it for 20 seconds. Pesto, done in less than a minute. Verdict . I cannot believe that fresh pesto can be made in less than a minute and taste this good. I’ll never buy a jar again. Profiteroles . Choux pastry involves lots of bicep-busting stirring, so I rarely bother. To make choux in a Thermomix, you simply add water, butter and flour to the machine.

"The veins in Gareth Bale’s legs jumped out when he walked on to the pitch at the Cardiff City Stadium and the muscles in his biceps rippled when he caught a stray ball from the boot of Toni Kroos. This is Bale’s homecoming, back to the city where it all began for the Real Madrid star 25 years ago. The transformation is complete. He is ripped, down to just six per cent body fat after spending the summer working on a conditioning programme that has produced some spectacular results. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronaldo rattles one in off the underside of the bar in training . Hitman: Real Madrid's Gareth Bale practices free kicks during a training session on Monday . All smiles: Bale is back in Wales for the Super Cup against Seville on Tuesday night . ‘It is a pure conditioning thing,’ he admitted as he prepares for Tuesday evening’s UEFA Super Cup final against Europa League winners Sevilla. ‘I worked hard in the off-season and I’m ready for a good year. ‘I haven’t done anything (special), just some off-season running, but nothing in the gym.’ Bale has worked hard, as the pictures of his phenomenal physique, published last week, showed. He could go head to head with his press-up obsessive team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo now. Bale is a superstar, etching his name in the history of this incredible club after scoring in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid in Lisbon in May. The Incredible Bulk: Bale looked in fine shape as he trained on Monday . Quality: Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos (centre) and James Rodriguez (right) warm up at Cardiff City Stadium . VIDEO Ancelotti aware of expectation . He was greeted by a few hundred well-wishers when he stepped off Real Madrid’s team bus on Monday night, revered in these parts after establishing himself as one of the best players in the world. ‘Bale, Bale’ they shrieked as he emerged with his immaculate, slicked-back black hair — another noticeable difference from the moody teenager look he once had at Tottenham. ‘Gareth, leave your barnet (hair) alone,’ was Harry Redknapp’s assessment of the Wales flyer when he first worked with him at White Hart Lane. There are no issues with it now. ‘It is great to be back home, but that’s not the important thing,’ he added. ‘This is a title we want to win.’ He is a humble boy, a hard worker after listening to the advice of his mum Debbie and dad Frank when he was growing up in Whitchurch, just three miles away from Cardiff’s new stadium. Star appeal: Real Madrid forward Ronaldo celebrates after scoring during training in Monday . Main man: Cristiano Ronaldo has missed much of pre-season as he recovered from injury . They will be in the stands, watching their boy run out with the most expensively assembled team in the history of European club football. Real’s dressing room is bulging with big names and two more — Colombia’s James Rodriguez and Germany’s World Cup winner Kroos — arrived this summer. That pair and Bale will start for Real against Sevilla. Bale’s position in this team feels secure, with 22 goals in his debut season justifying the decision to spend a world-record £85million to sign him from Tottenham. ‘It is nice not being the new boy,’ he added. ‘I am settled, I have had a good pre-season; it was easier than the last one. I was sat at home last year waiting, but this time I’m in better shape and don’t feel any pressure.’ On the run: Toni Kroos (left) and Gareth Bale train with their team-mates at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . On Tuesday night, when he runs out in front of 20,000 supporters, he will be King of Cardiff. One day, Bale could rule the world. In October the nominations for the FIFA Ballon d’Or award will be announced and Bale is expected to be on the shortlist. His coach Carlo Ancelotti believes the forward has already established himself as one of the top stars. ‘As I said a lot of the time last year, Gareth is the best,’ admitted the Italian coach. ‘I’m not so interested in personal awards and what is important is that Gareth is here to help win titles. If I say Gareth deserves to win, then I could say the same about Sergio Ramos or Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is one of the best.’ He is a dedicated pro, a student of the game after his explosive speed and his match-winning abilities were first harnessed at Whitchurch High School a decade ago. Focused: Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) raises a smile during  training at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday . Now it is all about La Decima, the 10th European Cup that he helped secure and the pressures that being a Real Madrid player bring with it. Only the very best survive. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who has been at the Bernabeu throughout his career, claimed Bale had the constitution to become one of the Real Madrid greats. ‘You need to be able to live with the pressure of being a Real Madrid player because you are always exposed to criticism, but Gareth has shown he can do that,’ he admitted. ‘Even if you have won the Champions League they demand even more from you. With the history of the club, if you have a season without a title it is a failure. On the ball: New signing James Rodriguez (left) takes on Pepe during a training session at Cardiff City Stadium . ‘At Real Madrid we have an obligation to go to the Plaza de Cibeles every year to celebrate everything we have achieved.’ On Tuesday evening they will come to salute one of their own, bulging muscles and all.","Gareth Bale back in Cardiff for Super Cup .

"James Rivers (pictured), told the technician he wanted the content wiped from his MacBook Pro so his wife 'did not divorce him' A man trying to hide child pornography from his wife was turned in by the computer technician he hired to delete it. James Rivers, from Kent, Washington, told the technician he wanted the content wiped from his MacBook Pro so his wife 'did not divorce him.' But the technician was so disturbed by what he allegedly saw on the computer he contacted the FBI. Rivers, an audio engineer, has been charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. The 57-year-old 'went to great lengths to destroy evidence of his exploitation and possession of depictions of images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct,' Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson said in charging papers. The technician told police he had been told not to view the photos 'under any circumstances,' but he did and that is when he found the two deeply disturbing videos . According to charging papers, both showed Rivers setting up a camera that then recorded a young girl using the bathroom. Rivers' wife told investigators she had a 'gut feeling that something was not right,' the detective said in court papers, reports SeattlePi. During a fight four days before, she threatened to have his computer searched for child pornography, according to charging papers. Rivers arriving at his home. The audio engineer has been charged with sexual exploitation of a minor. He was released from jail after posting bond on a  $300,000 bail . Police contend Rivers admitted to making the recordings and he also admitted to sexually assaulting a child. 'He maintained that he was on medication and had drunk wine, causing him to black out during the incident,' the detective said in charging papers. He was released from jail after posting bond on a $300,000 bail. Rivers has toured with rock groups as well teaching audio classes at the Art Institute of Seattle for more than 26 years, according to his LinkedIn page. Drew Newman, a student at the Arts Institute of Seattle said Rivers was a quiet teacher. 'Instead of, this is how you do it from the book's perspective, he would tell us about his experiences, where he's been,' Newman told KIRO 7. Newman was surprised to hear about Rivers' arrest but said, 'We don't know the whole story.'","James Rivers, 57, charged with sexual exploitation of a minor .

"Celtic will remain in the Champions League after Legia Warsaw lost their appeal to have their ban overturned on Thursday. The Polish side had hoped UEFA's appeals body would reinstate them after they were demoted to the Europa League for fielding an ineligible player during the second leg of their Champions League qualifying game against the Scottish champions. But Legia co-owner Dariusz Mioduski has confirmed that the club will now take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, tweeting: 'Unfortunately for now football is not winning… We are going to CAS.' Warsaw: Dariusz Mioduski, Legia Warsaw's chairman, speaks to his lawyers at the UEFA hearing . Registration: Celtic may progress, despite losing, as Warsaw fielded an ineligible player . Legia president Boguslaw Lesnodorski echoed Mioduski's pledge to take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He wrote on Twitter: 'Negative decision, it's hard even to comment, we are using the CAS (we plan to tomorrow) and otherwise we are focused only on the games.' Legia believed Bartosz Bereszynski suspension had been served after he missed both legs of the previous qualifier against St Patrick's Athletic as well as the first leg against Celtic, but their failure to register him for the game against St Patrick's proved costly. Mioduski released a statement through the club's official website which stressed Legia's determination to keep fighting for Champions League reinstatement. The statement read: 'Till the last moment we hoped that the spirit of sport wins, we find the decision extremely unfair. However we expected that decision and were prepared for it. We are to appeal to the CAS promptly. 'We will use the full appeal procedure, in order to get back our result that was fairly gained on the pitch. We will certainly fully subordinate to the final verdict. But I still hope that football will win, as well as the values it is based on: fair-play and respect to the on-the-pitch result.' Lesnodorski added: 'We hope that CAS will judge our case as soon as possible.We don't give up and keep fighting. Our lawyers are now working hard on the case, while the team prepares for the forthcoming matches. We aim high as always.' Celtic will now face Slovenian side Maribor in the play-off round, leaving Legia to take on Aktobe of Kazakhstan in the Europa League play-off. Celebration: Legia celebrate after Miroslav Radovic scores in their 4-1 home victory over Celtic . Goal: Michail Kucharczyk scores at Celtic park as the visitors win again, this time 2-0 . The verdict was confirmed in a UEFA statement which read: 'The UEFA Appeals Body met (on Wednesday) following an appeal by Legia Warsaw against the decision taken by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on 8 August. 'The appeal lodged by the Polish club was rejected and, therefore, the original decision of the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body is confirmed. 'The Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body had sanctioned Legia for fielding a suspended player (Article 18 of the Regulations of the UEFA Champions League, 2014/15 competition, and Article 21 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations, 2014 edition) in the 2014/15 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round return leg against Celtic FC in Edinburgh on 6 August.

"Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger insists it would have been an 'insane risk' for the club to keep a core of disgruntled players and remains steadfast in his determination to retain Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez. In just a matter of a few months, Saints have gone from the envy of English football to the butt of jokes. Soon after manager Mauricio Pochettino and his staff left for Tottenham, the sales at St Mary's began as Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren departed for pastures new. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Southampton fan beg Arsene Wenger not to buy Schneiderlin . Domino effect: The departure of Mauricio Pochettino (above) to Spurs led to player sales . The exits swelled the coffers, but led to serious questions over the direction of Southampton and the ownership structure, resulting in the odds on their relegation dramatically shortening. However, club chairman Krueger believes the exits will actually benefit Saints and highlighted their importance in allowing manager Ronald Koeman the chance to succeed. 'Contracts should be respected, first of all,' Krueger said. 'You sign contracts and both sides need to respect contracts. I am a person who still believes a handshake should be enough. 'There was a situation when there was so much change with the manager leaving and you theoretically ended up with a dressing room with half of your starters not really committed to being there. 'That is an insane risk for any club and especially a club which was already quite thin last year. Shaw thing: Left back Luke (left) made a big-money move to Manchester United earlier this summer . Moving on: Defender Calum Chambers left Southampton last week for Arsenal . VIDEO Saints could have won Champions League - Wenger . 'Of actual centrepieces of the club, a few have gone. Not all five were centrepieces or irreplaceable, but you know there were a couple. 'For me, if in the end a few players are disgruntled or maybe not sure about it, you can swallow that up. You can handle that, but you can't have half the team. You can't have a brand new manager (dealing with that). 'Whether that happened out of the past or whether it happened because of the success of the Saints last year or whether it happened because players were suddenly in the national team, I don't know and it doesn't really matter. 'But something happened and I don't need to do research on it. The fact was it was there and we needed to deal with it professionally, be in control of every deal. 'In the end, that's something we couldn't do to Ronald, to have a dressing room like that.' Centre stage: Ex-Saints captain Adam Lallana left for Liverpool just before playing for England at the World Cup . Krueger now wants to focus on those coming in, with Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle and Ryan Bertrand set to be followed into the club on Wednesday by Inter Milan's Saphir Taider. Speculation, though, continues over whether Schneiderlin and Rodriguez could be next to leave as they continue to attract strong interest from, amongst others, Tottenham. Last week Krueger insisted in a series of interviews that the pair were not for sale and continued that stance on Tuesday, despite Schneiderlin's remarkable Tweet in which he declared his Southampton career had been ""destroyed"". 'We're not the kind of club that right off the bat is going to overreact,' he said. Hitting out: Morgan Schneiderlin reacted angrily when Southampton decided not to sell to Spurs . 'The fact of the matter is there is a strategy in place and that we clearly have Morgan and Jay in the centre, as a core players of building this squad going forwards. That is our strategy and we're going to stick with it. We are now on a building and not in a reducing phase. 'Very clearly we don't communicate with our players in the public, so he was clearly informed of the fact we were not going to sell him. Immediately after that I communicated with the media about that and that is how we did it. Then he reacted (on Twitter). 'I think whoever reacts in certain ways, there is passion involved here and circumstances.' Asked if Schneiderlin had been reprimanded for his Twitter post, Krueger said: 'No, he wasn't. I think that there's situations that evolve where people can be emotional. 'You shouldn't, as a club, take everything personally and we didn't take that personally.'","Southampton finished eighth in the Premier League last season .

"Britain's iconic red telephone boxes have been given a modern makeover - as mobile phone chargers. Painted green and given a trendy logo, this is the UK's first landmark to be transformed into a solar-powered device. While many phone boxes in Britain's capital fall into disrepair, the Solarbox is giving them a much-needed boost. Green: The old telephone boxes are also being painted green to emphasise the greener economy . Placed outside exit three outside Tottenham Court Road Station in London, the Solarbox is the work of two geography graduates from London's School of Economics who started the project in 2013. With the help of funding from a variety of schemes, they've created this new addition to London's streets. Kirsty Kenney, co-founder of Solarbox, said: 'Solarbox is turning London's disused telephone boxes into solar-powered charging points for mobile phones. The Solarbox was created by transforming a traditional London telephone box into a solar powered charger . 'The idea for Solarbox came about through three reasons really. 'The first is that phone boxes aren't used anymore. The second is modern phone battery life can't keep up the pace with our lives. And the third is there is nowhere really to charge your phones in the public realm. 'So we did some research, we held some focus groups and brought these three things together and this is the end product.' Red telephone boxes first began appearing on London's streets during the 1920s. Since then, they've become as much a part of Britain as Big Ben and fish and chips - particularly to the capital's tourists. Despite British Telecom - who make the phone boxes - discontinuing the traditional design during the 1980s, they've still remained symbolic to this day. Divisive: Kirstey Kenney, co-founder of Solarbox said some people love the green while others hate it . According to Kenney, there are around 67,000 phone boxes in the UK and 8,000 in London. So how have people been reacting to the drastic change in colour? She says: 'I think the verdict is still out on the green.' As some smart phones take hours to charge rather than minutes, Kenney says the Solarbox wasn't built with a long stay in mind. Instead, it's intended for phone users desperate for a quick charge to make an important call. 'The whole of this in all our research was based on people who need that bit of extra juice to make an emergency phone call,' she says. Chargers: There are numerous charge points in each box and they need just three hours of sunlight per day . 'Or people who are in this busy area - which is a big through-way - who just want to take the opportunity to top up.' And despite the box's reliance on solar power, London's wet weather isn't set to put a dampener on any desperately-needed charging. According to Kenney, the Solarbox only needs three hours of sunlight a day to keep its inbuilt battery pumping out power. 'We need three hours of sunlight a day to operate all year round,' she says. Idea: Ms Kenney said the idea was initiated as modern phone battery life 'can't keep up the pace with our lives' 'And the reason that we only need so little sunlight is cause we've got an integrated battery. So, through the summer months or on the sunnier days that battery is storing all excess energy to be used throughout the year.' What does London's phone-using public make of the new addition to their streets? Engineer, Bhavesh Morar, has plugged in, but does he think it's a winner? 'Definitely, because I work as an engineer I'm always looking for charging points, so this is really a fantastic idea,' he says. 'A lot of these phone boxes, they're not used anyway. Everyone's got a mobile so it's a really good idea.' Solarbox hopes to launch a further six boxes around London in early 2015.","Telephone box is first ever be changed into a solar-powered phone charger .

"Huddersfield Town have parted company with manager Mark Robins just one game into the new Championship season. Robins and his players were jeered by angry fans at the John Smith’s Stadium after Saturday’s 4-0 thrashing by Bournemouth and, following a meeting with the board, the 44-year-old left the club by mutual consent. The former Manchester United forward (below) took charge of the Terriers in February last year, helping them avoid relegation before guiding them to 17th-place last season.

A club statement read: ‘Following yesterday’s (Saturday's) first-day defeat, Mark met with the board of directors. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mark and the directors all agreed it would be in the interests of all parties to part company. Accordingly, Mark’s contract was ended amicably and by mutual consent.’ Chairman Dean Hoyle said: ‘Mark has put his all into the job over the past 16 months and made a big contribution to the club. He’s arrived at the club at a difficult time and immediately impacted to keep us in the Championship. ‘Mark’s approach has been refreshing. He has always put the club before himself and worked tirelessly to change our way of playing and we have seen that come to fruition.’ Joint decision: A club statement claimed all parties agreed that it was best to 'part company' Assistant manager Steve Thompson and first-team coach Steve Eyre will be in charge for tomorrow’s Capital One Cup tie at Chesterfield. Robins had previously managed at Rotherham, Barnsley and Coventry before joining Huddersfield. After goals from Marc Pugh, Callum Wilson (two) and Yann Kermorgant had sunk Huddersfield, Robins had vowed to continue, saying: ‘I will fight but it’s disappointing because we have worked hard over pre-season. ‘The players must take responsibility. The system we play only works when the players put a shift in and too many decided to take a day off. It’s still early days and we dump this result in the waste bin and move on.’","Mark Robins parts company with Huddersfield Town .

"A bedroom was destroyed when light reflected from a mirror onto a set of curtains setting them on fire. Emergency services were called to the home in Saffron Walden, Essex, following reports of black smoke filling the property. There, they extinguished the bedroom fire which damaged the window, wall, ceiling and carpet. A fire was started in the bedroom by the vanity mirror, ruining the cream walls, ceiling and carpet with smoke . While the incident was unusual, fire fighters said it was not unheard of for certain mirrors to set fire to fabric by reflecting light. Essex County Fire and Rescue Service station officer Paul Curtis said: 'It’s not the first time I have been called to a fire which started like this. 'It’s not something most people would think about but these magnifying mirrors can create a hot and focused beam of light and in this case it set fire to the curtains. 'Anyone who has one of these mirrors should seriously consider making sure it is kept away from windows and direct sunlight, especially on sunny days like today. Earlier this year a woman's vanity mirror burned holes in her curtains when. Fire fighters noticed the singed rings during a home visit. A spokesman from East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The sun's rays can be magnified by a lens or magnifying mirror and become focused on a nearby object such as curtains, clothing or even wooden or plastic furniture, fixtures or fittings. 'This can cause scorching, or charring potentially leading to smouldering or flaming ignition of the object. The ceiling in the bedroom and its carpets were destroyed by the smoke which filled the bedroom after the fire . 'In the evening, morning and during the winter, when the sun is lower on the horizon, the shallower angle at which the sun's rays hit the earth means that it is particularly important to be aware of objects, such as magnifying vanity mirrors and glass ornaments, which may be left exposed to direct sunlight. 'While this type of fire may seem like one of the more unusual cases, in principle it is the same as focussing the sun's rays with a magnifying glass and, as this case clearly demonstrates, sunlight being focussed by everyday objects can indeed set light to things in the home.'","Vanity mirror reflected beams of light onto the set of curtains in bedroom .

"Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal are 'desperate' to qualify for the lucrative group stages of the Champions League - and challenged his side to beat Besiktas 'no matter what it costs'. The Gunners will fly to Istanbul on Monday following a dramatic stoppage-time 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on the first day of the new Barclays Premier League season. There is, however, little opportunity for Wenger's squad to regroup before focus turns to extending the record of reaching Europe's elite club competition for each of the last 16 campaigns. No matter what the cost:  Arsene Wenger is adamant the club needs Champions League football . Trophy: Wenger won the FA Cup with Arsenal in May, defeating Hull City 3-2, their first trophy since 2005 . Big occasion: Wenger guided the Gunners to the Community Shield with a 3-0 win over Manchester City . Qualification would bring with it some 8.6 million euros (£7million) in prize money, with each subsequent group home match worth around £3m of additional match-day revenue. Wenger knows all too well what is on the line against Slaven Bilic's side, who defeated Feyenoord 5-2 on aggregate in the third round of qualifying when former Chelsea striker Demba Ba scored a hat-trick in the second leg. 'We are desperate to do it because we want to play in the Champions League and we know how big these games are,' said Wenger. Difficult: The Arsenal boss admits Turkish side Besiktas are a tough qualifying opponent  for the Gunners . Winning start: Arsenal head to Turkey having won their opening league fixture 2-1 against Crystal Palace . 'We are desperate to go through. No matter what it costs we want to go through. 'We always have a difficult draw, we had Fenerbahce last year, this time we have Besiktas, so it is difficult.' Wenger added: 'The preparation for us was a Premier League game we had absolutely to win, that's the best preparation for confidence. 'Now the preparation will be mainly to recover and to study Besiktas.' With Besiktas' Vodafone Arena ground being redeveloped, Tuesday night's match will take place at the 72,000-seater Ataturk Olympic Stadium, where Liverpool famously beat AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League. Reports in Turkey suggest the home fans are preparing a hot reception for Wenger, whom they feel was critical of the club following their 8-0 defeat at Liverpool during the 2007/08 group stages. 'They are specialists at doing that. I never said that. They always create things like that. I am used to playing Turkish teams and I never said that,' Wenger replied. Leader: Club captain Mikel Arteta will hope new signing Alexis Sanchez (right) can inspire Arsenal to victory . Captain Mikel Arteta believes the players will relish the intimidating atmosphere. 'They will be in our face, but I like playing in atmospheres like that,' he said. 'It is different to what we are used to here in England and it's attractive to the players. 'The pressure is on us to get through because they are expecting us to get through but we are facing a tough opponent with good players and experience in the Champions League, so it won't be easy there.' Arsenal will assess both defenders Kieran Gibbs (hamstring) and Laurent Koscielny (Achilles), which could mean an earlier than expected recall for German World Cup winner Per Mertesacker. Wenger confirmed: 'It was our plan to bring the Germans back in contention for Everton, but in case of emergency I will take Mertesacker. 'It is a bit early for him. Ideally we would need one more week preparation, but he is willing to play, no problem.'

"The best thing about the 19 wickets Moeen Ali has picked up in four Tests against India is the speed with which he has improved. No newcomer to Test cricket already has the perfect game, otherwise they’d have been picked years ago. It’s why we need to give a bit more leeway to the likes of Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan. Of course there’s a gap between them and the experienced new-ball pairing of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. That’s how it works! But what is so exciting about Moeen is that he has taken on board some of the criticisms of the way he was bowling in the first half of the summer, and now looks much more settled at Test level. Much-improved: Moeen Ali wheels away in celebration after taking the wicker of India captain MS Dhoni . VIDEO Cook salutes victorious England effort . A lot has been made of the chat he had with Ian Bell during a practice session before the third Test at the Ageas Bowl — and rightly so. Bell basically told him he felt Moeen was bowling in Test matches like he was in the nets, mixing up his variations and not finding a consistent pace. He suggested Moeen bowl a little more quickly out in the middle, and that seems to have made a lot of difference. We saw on Saturday in Manchester, for example, that Mooen is now harder to get down the pitch to because the ball is arriving that little bit earlier; when MS Dhoni tried to hit him over the top, he ended up dragging one to midwicket. Moeen’s gone from bowling around 50mph at the start of the season to over 55mph. It’s been a crucial change of gear. But it’s one thing to listen to a piece of advice — it’s another to implement it successfully. It shows the lad has a great capacity to learn and improve, as well as all the elements you need to be a good off-spinner; he spins the ball, he gets drift and he can beat the bat on both sides. In the spotlight: Ali, centre, takes another wicket at Old Trafford much to the delight of his team-mates . And he’s eradicating the one bad ball an over that we saw in his first couple of games. That said, let’s not go over the top. Yes, Moeen has shed the part-time tag. But he’s still not the next Graeme Swann. I would still prefer to see him as a batsman who bowls, and I hope this doesn’t make English cricket lazy as they try to produce more spin bowlers. There are still problems out there. The moment a county pitch turns, the pitch inspectors perk up, whereas if a team are skittled on a greentop, no-one bats an eyelid. We need more spinning pitches and maybe more cricket needs to be played at outgrounds, which have traditionally turned more than pitches at county HQs. What Moeen has done is buy English cricket breathing space, but it would still be great to unearth a Test-class left-arm spinner now the Monty Panesar era seems to have come and gone. Moeen of the moment: Ali poses with fans after wreaking havoc for England in the fourth Test . As for the way India have played Moeen, they’ve been abysmal. I was amazed to see some stats the other day about their batsmen’s record over the past couple of years against off-spin; only Dhoni and Ravichandran Ashwin had decent stats. This is supposed to be a country that produces wonderful players of slow bowling, but one of the theories I’ve heard while doing commentary with the Indian broadcasters is that these big-name stars spend all their time being bombed by opposition fast bowlers and no time at all playing spinners back home in domestic four-day cricket. It seems weird to be sitting here and lecturing Indian batsmen on how to play an English ‘offie’, but it looks as if they’ve resorted to hit or block, with nothing in between. Taking things on board: Ian Bell gave Ali advice before the third Test and the impact has been remarkable . They should sit down and watch some videos of how Rahul Dravid played Swann in 2011. He would go right forward or right back, and use his hands and feet to combat the turn and manoeuvre both the ball and the field. I also think they play a pre-DRS brand of cricket, with the bat close to the pad. As Cheteshwar Pujara found out on Saturday, umpires are now giving those out on the front foot — even if he was a touch unlucky. But hats off to Moeen. He has learned quickly and forced errors out of them. Watching his progress has been one of the joys of the summer.","Moeen Ali has taken 19 wickets over the course of four Tests against India .

Both managers admitted they needed to bring in more players after a dire goalless draw. Here were two teams who have gone through some serious rebuilding over the summer and they are still clearly not the finished product. This game was stilted, stuttering and starved of chances. Neither Ronald Koeman, in charge at Southampton, and West Bromwich boss Alan Irvine were at the helm of their respective clubs at the end of last season.

Subs not used: Myhill, Baird, Yacob, McAuley, . Bookings: Gardner, Brunt . Manager: Alan Irvine 6.5 . Ratings from SAM CUNNINGHAM at ST MARY'S . For much of pre-season, West Brom had only 11 first-team players available. ‘This is a side that’s only been together for the last two weeks,’ said Irvine. ‘Meaningful work was only done in the last few weeks. We want to bring in another couple of players before the transfer window shuts, and they’re at the top end of the pitch, creative players.’ Koeman, who had the heart ripped out of his squad, was of a similar view. ‘The board know what we need and we’re working to bring in one or two players,’ he said. ‘We know that it will be a long season in England. With that you need enough players in quality to bring competition in the squad.’ Irvine was the happier of the two managers with his point away from home, but it is a long season ahead. The passages of play were disjointed and passes went astray. Strikers were not on the same wavelength as the wingers who were providing crosses. It was not until the 37th minute that there was a real chance of note. Dusan Tadic, one of the Saints’ new faces, blocked Saido Berahino’s clearance on the left of the area. The ball spilled to Steven Davis who nodded it back to Tadic. From a tight angle on the left, the Serbian tested West Brom keeper Ben Foster with a low shot with the outside of his boot which was pushed wide by the diving goalkeeper. Just after the half-hour mark, the hosts really should have opened the scoring. A mix-up between Andre Wisdom, brought in by Irvine on loan from Liverpool, and Foster allowed Tadic to nick the ball. The West Brom goalkeeper was stranded on the left but when Tadic swung in a cross it was too high for Southampton’s 6ft 4ins new striker, Graziano Pelle, with the goal gaping. Put former Saints Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert into that scenario and it would surely have resulted in a goal. Italian Pelle, signed from Koeman’s former club Feyenoord for £8million, has some way to go to fill the boots of Lambert. While the England striker is known for his cool finishing and bullet headers, Pelle headed a chance wildly off target in the opening 10 minutes and then failed to connect properly with a low ball from Ryan Bertrand, yet another loan player.

Southampton fans will have been disappointed their side could not capitalise on a strong performance on the opening day against Liverpool, but if it is any consolation it took Koeman until the fourth league game of the last campaign for his first win at Feyenoord — they lost the other three — and they finished runners-up in the Dutch league. Albion finally came alive when Irvine brought on new boy Brown Ideye in the 52nd minute. He had only been on for 60 seconds when Sebastien Pocognoli sent in a deep, looping cross from the left and the striker rose highest at the back post but, from two yards, he headed wide. This was a player Irvine admitted he had not seen play in the flesh when Albion signed him from Dynamo Kiev for £10m. He would not have enjoyed seeing him squander that chance but he must have been pleased with his later lively contributions. On 73 minutes the Nigerian skilfully took the ball on the turn to free himself one-on-one, but Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster rushed out to block. Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse clipped in a good free kick from just outside the area that hit the outside of a post, but still neither side could break the deadlock.

"Jose Mourinho took a thinly veiled swipe at two of his biggest title rivals — Manchester City and Arsenal — ahead of the first day of the Barclays Premier League season. The Chelsea manager failed to win any trophies in his first season back at the club last year, while Arsene Wenger ended nine years without silverware at Arsenal by winning the FA Cup. When asked if he felt under pressure to deliver, Mourinho replied: ‘Why? Some managers have 10 years to win something.’ City’s Manuel Pellegrini won the Premier League and League Cup double last year with a squad inherited from Roberto Mancini. Under the Italian they won the title, the FA Cup and the Community Shield. Mourinho added: ‘I don’t like to get clubs developed by other managers before me, I don’t like to arrive on time to collect the fruit off their trees. I like to work. I like to build. I don’t like easy jobs.’ On the attack: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho took a thinly veiled swipe at two of his biggest title rivals . Content: Mourinho doesn't feel under pressure despite failing to win a trophy last season . Upbeat: After talking down their chances last season, Mourinho admits Chelsea are now title contenders . Last season, Mourinho branded Wenger a ‘specialist in failure’ and rowed with Pellegrini about which clubs had spent the most money. The Portuguese considers that he has been in the process of building his own squad at Stamford Bridge, not using the one handed down by Rafael Benitez. This summer Chelsea have brought in Diego Costa for £32million and spent £16m on Filipe Luis, both from Atletico Madrid, signed Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona for £30m and added Didier Drogba on a free transfer. In total he has brought in 11 other players on permanent deals and spent close to £200m since he arrived in 2013. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Mourinho's biggest wind-ups from last season . Highlight: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger ended nine-year wait for trophy by winning FA Cup in May . Success: Arsenal followed FA Cup triumph by lifting Community Shield but Mourinho is not impressed . ‘This is the second year of my project and I am so happy with that,’ said Mourinho. ‘At the end of the season you, the supporters and the players will judge my work. And most importantly my boss, my owner, my board will judge.’ After talking down their chances last season, Mourinho, who starts his campaign against newly- promoted Burnley on Monday, admits Chelsea are title contenders. But he claims some managers are given an easier ride than others when it comes to rating success. ‘You don’t look with the same eyes on different people, don’t measure people by the same dimensions,’ he explained. ‘For some to reach success is to achieve this and for others to achieve success is to achieve that. Because of my last 10 years and Chelsea’s last 10 years I understand why you always put the level high for myself and Chelsea. ‘I really don’t care about it. I just care about being myself, to work hard every day, to have ambition to win the next game, it doesn’t matter which competition or which opponent. I want to win against Burnley, that’s the first step.’ In charge: Mourinho oversees a training session at Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday . Wait: Mourinho's Chelsea will begin their Premier League campaign at Burnley on Monday night . Splash the cash: The Chelsea boss has brought in the likes of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Felipe Luis . Perhaps the toughest decision Mourinho faced ahead of this new campaign was who to pick as his No 1 goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois, who has spent three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid, or Petr Cech, who has made the position his own since he joined the club in June 2004, a day before Mourinho was announced as manager for his first spell. Mourinho considers both to be in the top three goalkeepers in the world. He appears to believe the 22-year-old Belgian is finally ready to take over the mantle from Cech, a decade his senior. But Mourinho will not disrespect Cech by playing him with second-string sides in games of less importance and suggests there is a still a role for him to play at the club. ‘I must support the keeper who is not first choice,’ he said. ‘Supporting him is not to give him a Capital One Cup game. It is to show him my trust when no one is expecting that he plays. I did that with Cech and Carlo Cudicini. I played Cudicini against Real Betis in the Champions League in the first game of the group, not in the sixth when we had already qualified. ‘I also played him in one league match when we were not champions, not after being champions. The best way to show a player you trust him is to play him when no one expects it and in games where there are responsibilities. With these two I can do that.’ Swipe: Mourinho claims Manuel Pellegrini inherited success at Manchester City .","Wenger ended nine years without silverware at Arsenal by winning the FA Cup last season .

"A Malaysian bank officer and her husband have been arrested in Malaysia after allegedly stealing more than $30,000 from four passengers aboard the doomed MH370 flight. Five months after the Malaysia Airlines flight went missing, mysterious withdrawals totaling 110,643 ringgit (AU$37,464) were taken from the accounts of two Malaysian and two Chinese MH370 victims. The couple have been held in police custody since Thursday and police are also looking for another suspect, a Pakistani man, who is believed to have received part of the money through an online transfer into his account. District police chief in Kuala Lumpur Zainuddin Ahmad said they believe the man is still in the country and declined to name the bank, where the woman in custody reportedly worked at for the last 10 years, according to news.com.au. 'But as to the full particulars of the case — it’s all still under investigation,' Mr Zainuddin told AFP. The Mirror reports the 33-year-old works at HSBC and her husband were held after a manager noticed suspicious activity at a Kuala Lumpur branch. A bank in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, reported the apparent discrepancies in their accounts on July 18, before lodging a police complaint, Assistant Commissioner to the crime investigation department Izany Abdul Ghany revealed. Scroll down for video . Mystery: £20,916 cash has been reported missing from the accounts of four MH370 passengers . It comes as the search team prepares to conduct a deep-water search across 60,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean. According to reports, the transactions were made on July 18 when money from the accounts of three passengers was transferred to the account of a fourth passenger before it was removed. 'We are investigating the case as unauthorised access with intent to commit an offence,' Izany said, according to the Mirror. 'We are getting CCTV footage from the bank to identify the suspects involved.' A source told the New Straits Times: 'We believe the suspect withdrew the money through the fourth victim's account via several automated teller machines (ATMs) in the Klang Valley.' Search continues: Officials claim they are 'making progress' as they continue to scour 60,000 sq km of sea for the plane. The orange line indicates 'high priority' search areas; the yellow has been searched already . International effort: Australia's deputy prime minister Warren Truss unveiled the latest search plan at a press conference in Canberra last Wednesday. The government has contracted a new firm to take up the search . Efforts to locate Flight MH370 have spanned more than five months, making it one of the most expensive searches for a plane in aviation history. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre claims the rescue operation is making 'good progress'. Teams are still scanned a 60,000-square-kilometre area in the Indian Ocean, with a deep-water search planned for September. Flight 370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people on board after diverging from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. No trace: The flight carrying 239 people diverted off its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing without trace . Confusion: The search started near Thailand but has since moved south. Hopes were ignited after satellite images from the new search area appeared to show parts of a plane in the water, but it turned out to be debris . The airline was widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. In a desperate bid to save face following two major disasters within months, bosses are now considering rebranding the airline. Officials said they are looking at a number of options to restructure the business which could include changing its name. Under fire: Malaysia Airlines' commercial director Hugh Dunleavy (centre) speaks to journalists about information on flight MH370 in Beijing, China, the day after it disappeared . Among the other changes the Malaysian flag carrier is considering are new routes and expanding out-sourcing to increase profitability. It follows the death of 298 passengers after flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine on July 17 and the disappearance of flight MH370 on March 8, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew. The Malaysian flag carrier will also seek new investors to rebuild its business.","Bank officer and her husband arrested in Malaysia after allegations they have stolen more than $30,000 from MH370 victims .

"Motorists are being ‘held to ransom’ by petrol prices of up to 16p a litre more on motorways. Fuel at motorway service stations can be up to 10p per litre more than the national average price, and up to 16p higher than the cheapest prices at local supermarkets, research from the RAC found. This adds up to £8 to the cost of filling up an average family vehicle. High prices meant drivers risked ‘running on fumes’ while trying to avoid paying over the odds, the RAC said . The high prices also risked drivers ‘running on fumes’ and breaking down while trying to avoid paying over the odds, the report said. Calling for prices to be capped to prevent profiteering, the RAC report said drivers ‘should not have to experience this 21st century form of highway robbery’. Their spot check revealed the worst offender for high fuel prices was the Reading services on the M4 – which was selling BP petrol at 137.9p, while six miles away in Shinfield it cost 121.9p – a difference of 16p per litre. Buying diesel on the M4 costs an average of 138.9p – 13p more than at the filling station. Fuel at motorway service stations (such as this one on the M25) can be up to 10p per litre more than the national average price, and up to 16p higher than the cheapest prices at local supermarkets . RAC spokesman Simon Williams pointed out that the price of fuel at the pumps has fallen to its lowest since January 2011. ‘It’s no wonder that motorists feel held to ransom with prices on the motorways inflated to such an extent. 'We can see no reason why motorway fuel should be so much more expensive,’ he said. ‘Prices have come down significantly in recent weeks and we are currently at levels not seen since 2010, but motorway service stations still remain much more expensive.’","Fuel at motorway service stations can be up to 16p per litre more than at the cheapest prices at local supermarkets, research from the RAC has revealed .

"Andy Murray somehow turned what looked like being a victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga into a Rodgers Cup quarter-final defeat on Friday. The Scot lost a tight opener on the tie-break and appeared set to bow out at the quarter-final stage when he offered up two break points at 4-4 in the second. He hung tough to save his serve, though, and then broke the Frenchman - conqueror of Novak Djokovic on Thursday - before running away into a 3-0 lead in the decider. But he inexplicably crumbled, losing five games in a row before slumping to a 7-6 4-6 6-4 loss. Looking up: Murray had looked to be in control after winning the second set but he let his third-set lead slip . Powering on: Tsonga was eventually able to beat the Scot in three sets in a pulsating clash in Toronto . He was visibly frustrated as his chances disappeared in front of him, with Tsonga deserving immense credit for his fightback. The see-saw nature of the second and third sets was entirely out of keeping with the opener which Tsonga won on a tie-break after 12 consecutive holds of serve. He got ahead in the breaker when Murray hit a forehand long. The pair traded breaks early in the second set and Murray then looked set for straight-sets exit when he offered up two more break points. He found a way to save them, however, and then broke himself before winning the set to love. He carried that confidence into the decider and was soon 3-0 ahead as Tsonga got erratic, before the tables turned dramatically. Getting into the swing: Murray has played well at times in the tournament as he gears up for the US Open . 'I had to play around my return position quite a lot, and I started to get into more service games in the second and third set,' Murray told atp.com after the match. 'I thought it was a high-level match with a few games by both of us in the second and third sets that were a bit scrappy. 'Jo is a top player. He's a fantastic athlete.

"Nicklas Bendtner has joined Bundesliga club VfL Wolfsburg to end a nine-year association with English football. The striker, who has scored 24 goals in 58 internationals for Denmark, has signed a three-year deal with an option for a further year at Wolfsburg, who finished fifth in last season's Bundesliga to qualify for the group stages of the Europa League. A free agent since his contract with Arsenal expired this summer, Bendtner also played for Birmingham City and Sunderland as well as spending a season on loan at Serie A side Juventus during their title-winning campaign in 2012-13.

Finally settled: Bendtner has been linked to several clubs across Europe over the summer . The 26-year-old scored 24 goals in 106 appearances for Arsenal during a nine-year stint in England. Bendtner attracted interest from Aston Villa and Eintracht Frankfurt this summer, and has been training on his own and with friends in a bid to keep fit ahead of the new campaign. Bendtner will wear the No 3 shirt at Wolfsburg, and admitted the reason for the low number, saying: ‘My mother chose the number for me.' Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking said: 'We want to play a good role in all three competitions this season, and to do this we need players who already know what this kind of challenge is all about. Shop window: Bendtner trained alone during the summer to keep up his fitness . 'Nicklas embodies precisely the kind of striker we were looking for. He fits the profile and is going to strengthen our squad.' Wolfsburg director of sport Klaus Allofs has every faith that Bendtner, who scored 32 goals in 136 Premier League appearances, will make the German club even stronger this term. 'He's in his prime and, although his career has not always gone smoothly, he's still been able to gain plenty of international experience,' he said. 'With his ability, he's going to raise the quality of our attack.' Hecking had said on Thursday before signing Bendtner that they couldn't sign the top calibre of players. ‘We dared to touch the top shelf of players. It’s empty now though, so we need to look a bit further down.’ Flop: Bendtner failed to set the heather alight at Arsenal and was released on a free transfer this summer .

"The SAS is dead, long live the SAS. If there were fears Liverpool would lose their potency with the dissolving of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge’s partnership, a new double act may have emerged. Sturridge and Raheem Sterling is not a partnership in the sense of the original SAS – that phrase was coined for Blackburn’s Chris Sutton and Alan Shearer in the 1990s – nor are they going to have an alliance like the one Sturridge and Suarez formed so thrillingly during the last 101-goal season. But there have been glimpses this summer that Sturridge and Sterling, the men whose strikes gave Liverpool a crucial opening weekend win against Southampton, may yet develop a rapport that keeps Brendan Rodgers’ side in the thick of the top four. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raheem Sterling freestyle with Wayne Rooney . Club record: Daniel Sturridge has managed 36 goals in his first 50 Liverpool appearances . New SAS? Raheem Sterling and Sturridge will be pivotal in attack for Liverpool this season . Hot prospect: Sterling showed huge potential last season but must back it up this year alongside Sturridge . This is a big season for both players. Sturridge has to show he can handle the responsibility of being the main man at a big club – his numbers certainly suggest he is up to the task – whereas Sterling must prove he can making another significant, stylish leap forward. Judging on the evidence of this summer, and against Southampton, Sterling is primed to leave the form of his breakthrough campaign behind and establish himself not only as the number one young player in the country but one of the most exciting talents in Europe. Sterling was the subject of much chatter before the game and one stalwart of the press room, a man who know knows what it means to pull on a red shirt, revealed his hopes for the 19-year-old when saying he had backed him to PFA Young Player of the Year – and for the top prize, too. Attacking threat: Steven Gerrard will hope he can provide the service for Sterling and Sturridge up front . Given the way Sterling played in the game itself, it was easy to see why such a bold investment had been made. He took his goal with great aplomb, scampering onto a precise pass from Jordan Henderson, to slip his effort beyond Fraser Forster. It is likely to be the first of many this season. ‘When you’re so young, it’s important to understand exactly what your role is,’ Rodgers said last week. ‘It’s not just about looking good, you have to be efficient and effective. His development has gone to a new level. He’s way above the level from when he first came in. The work rate and strength was as redoubtable as always but what really impressed in Sterling’s performance was his awareness and composure, late in the game, to jump up and head a ball into the path of Sturridge to score the winning goal. Lethal: Luis Suarez and Sturridge formed a devastating partnership before the Uruguayan left for Barcelona . Rodgers, caught up in the moment, sped on to the pitch and punched the air. This was a crucial victory, make no mistake, and while Suarez’s absence will be keenly felt, a significant amount of solace can be taken from the fact that Sturridge has a habit of producing at a rapid frequency. ‘That is 36 goals in 50 appearances, which is the best of any striker in Liverpool’s history,’ Rodgers pointed out. ‘That shows the level he is at. He always looks like he will score. It was a poacher’s goal, one of those where you anticipate a knockdown. It is now a continuation for him.’ When you consider some of the names he has eclipsed – Hunt, Dalglish, Rush, Fowler, Torres and Suarez – it is a remarkable achievement and shows the consistency he has achieved since his £12million move from Chelsea in January 2013. Liverpool may need a new striker before the transfer window closes, with Radamel Falcao and Samuel Eto’o among the options being discussed, but their current first choice has built an impressive foundation for himself. Gone: Liverpool sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million this summer but have a new SAS partnership . The next target would be surpass Fernando Torres, who reached 50 Barclays Premier League goals in 72 appearances, and with Sturridge - the top goalscorer in the top flight in 2014 - having bagged 32 in 44 matches, he must be odds-on to break that record, too, given the chances Liverpool can create when at their best. Having Sterling providing pace, guile and another headache for opposing defenders to deal with might also help Sturridge’s cause and, if that is to be the case, the SAS would again become a recurring theme of Liverpool’s campaign. Rodgers, for one, will be hoping that is the case. ‘We will get better,’ he beamed afterwards. The men who scored Liverpool’s goals could also say the same.

"Louis van Gaal admitted that Manchester United 'did not play as a team' and bemoaned Manchester United's lack of top quality defenders following the shock defeat against Swansea on his competitive debut at Old Trafford. Van Gaal became the first United manager to lose a home Premier League match on the opening day of the season after goals from Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson stunned a home crowd expecting life under the Dutchman to be a big improvement on last season's woes. The 63-year-old former Ajax and Barcelona boss was even forced to ditch his much-hyped 3-5-2 formation at half-time with United struggling to create any chances. The team switched to a flat back four which included Tyler Blackett and Chris Smalling in central defence, Ashley Young at left back and Phil Jones at right back.

Padding out: Van Gaal wrote plenty of notes on his iPad as Manchester United couldn't keep up with Swansea . That switch resulted in an equaliser for Wayne Rooney but Swansea nicked the victory and Van Gaal was quick to point out that his team had to address their severe weaknesses in defence. 'We need defenders,' Van Gaal told BT Sport after the match. 'You cannot say because of one game we lost that it (the problem) is the defence - it is the team. We didn't play as a team. 'We don't reach our level what we have shown in pre-season. We are disappointing in defence. Debut despair: Tyler Blackett made his first Premier League start for Manchester United against Swansea . Van Gaal added: 'We are not reaching our level in our first home match and that is disappointing because this is the most important match, we must evaluate.' 'They have done their utmost best and you can see in the second half they have run the miles. 'We must keep our head up and use the second step in our process better than today. 'We were disappointing in defence and we are disappointed with ourselves and that's why we lost today.' Tall order: Chris Smalling was unable to prevent Manchester United losing and conceding two goals . Van Gaal would not divulge which players he wants to move on before the transfer window closes at the end of August. Instead he challenged his squad to prove they deserve a place in his regime at Old Trafford. 'I have not made a decision on who goes - it is up to the players to decide too. I will never say to the players that you have to go.'Explaining his decision to change from his favoured 3-5-2 shape, Van Gaal said: 'I had decided to change formation in the first half because Swansea made the pitch big and 4-3-3 is a better formation to press with.' The Dutch boss, who has won league titles with every club side he has managed so far in his career, quickly batted away suggestions that the opening-day performance will have a big impact on his transfer plans. Swansea delight: Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates after scoring from close range . 'No, because that is a short term assault I think, but of course we need defenders but I have already said that in former press conferences,' he added. 'You cannot say because of one game that we lost, and all the others we won, that it is the defence. It's the team. 'We never played as a team I think and that's our error and also we don't reach the required level and maybe because of that we haven't played like a team.'","Manchester United slump to defeat against Swansea at Old Trafford .

"Gary Neville believes Manchester United are several players short of having a squad capable of winning the Barclays Premier League this season. After a disastrous campaign in which United finished seventh under David Moyes, new manager Louis van Gaal has brought Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera to Old Trafford.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch United target Daley Blind score a 30 yard beauty against Utrecht . New additions: Manchester United have brought Luke Shaw (left) and Ander Herrera this summer . 'Unless two or three players come in I don't think it's realistic that he [Van Gaal] can win the league this year,' he told Sky Sports. 'Although there is a potential with what Liverpool did in the fact they had free weeks of Saturday to Saturday, continual perfect preparation. That's a big advantage for United if they get onto some momentum.

"Ledley King is flying out to China on Wednesday on a scouting mission to find players talented enough to make an impact on Tottenham Hotspur’s academy as he begins a new coaching career at the club. The 33-year-old has been an ambassador at White Hart Lane after an injury-induced early retirement two seasons ago and will now combine the two roles as he starts as assistant manager of the Under 18s. It is a position of responsibility for King, who is seen as someone with the potential to kick on at Enfield Training Centre. Part of the team: King is taking on a new role with Spurs to help them improve their youth system . Kidding around: The former England defnder will be working with children at Tottenham's academy this year . The former England international is giving himself a year to cut his teeth and will be in China for 10 days before embarking on his new job. ‘A hundred or so local kids take part and I’ll be whittling the numbers down to come and train at the academy,’ King told Sportsmail. ‘For me it’s just to pick based on what I see and who I think has the chance of really making a career out of the game.’ Lee Young-pyo and Kazuyuki Toda are the only Asians to have previously played for Spurs - the latter making just four appearances after Glenn Hoddle signed him in 2003. It is a market the club are trying to tap into and King is confident he’ll find a cluster of ‘five or so’ ready to train with the youth teams. ‘As a young player you’re used to being in pressure situations. Good players will perform,’ he added. On his way: King's first task will be to travel to China and discover new talent for Tottenham . ‘This will be going on throughout the year. I’m over that side of the world a fair bit at the moment. I come back for a week and then I’m off to Malaysia before going back again out in October.’ King himself will make a decision as to whether he wants to pursue a career on the training ground, be it as a coach or manager, next summer after a year working under Keiran McKenna with the Under 18s. ‘This is an opportunity for me to get a foot in the door,’ he added. ‘His skill will be putting on the sessions but I’ll be able to speak to the kids during that and point out things they can try doing. ‘Hopefully the combination works well. I would’ve loved to have a former player trying to help me at that age. Blighted: The centre-back's career was ended prematurely after he failed to recover from continuous injuries . National star: King won 21 caps for England in his career, and wants to help pass that experience on . ‘It’s not for everyone. Paul Scholes has just come out and said it isn’t for him. This is why I’m taking on this new role, because it’s something I’m intrigued about and we’ll see if I’m good at it. I feel I’ve got something to offer. ‘Coming out of the game you have to try different things. This is my first option so to speak. I have to try it. It’s down to me while I’m there and I’ll know whether it’s something I can take on after the season.’ Ledley King is an ambassador for Barclays.

"Petr Cech has been warned by Jose Mourinho that he expects him to ‘fight against my decision’ if the manager opts to make Thibaut Courtois his first-choice goalkeeper for the forthcoming season. Courtois, 22, has joined Chelsea on their pre-season tour with the rest of the Belgian contingent following their post-World Cup rest and he is set to start in Sunday's friendly at Werder Bremen.

Petr says the obvious, Courtois says the same.

"In the aftermath of a fine victory, Hearts left Rangers to ponder an old truth. In football, as in life, you reap what you Sow. Rebuilt and remoulded in the post-script to relegation and administration, Hearts laid down a marker for the Championship season with a display of composure and menace. They may have lost their keeper Neil Alexander for a month with a fractured cheekbone sustained in a clash with his own player. Delight: Osman Sow celebrates his last-gasp winner while Nicky Law wheels away in delight after making it 1-1 . But in defence their central defenders Danny Wilson and Alim Ozturk dominated Kris Boyd and Kenny Miller while, in attack Osman Sow, a 6ft 4in Swedish striker starting his first competitive match in over a year, struck a deserved injury-time winner. ‘Osman has come in and shown his qualities,’ said head coach Robbie Neilson afterwards with marked understatement. ‘He needs more fitness but he has pace, strength, good technique and an eye for goal and I think he’ll scare a lot of defenders this season.’ He certainly frightened the life out of Lee McCulloch and Marius Zaliukas. Ally McCoist was critical of the defending for both Hearts goals, the first a meat and drink header from skipper Danny Wilson from a corner in 52 minutes. The home team believed they had claimed a late point when Nicky Law responded to howls of derision over his sponsors’ man of the match award by hooking an equaliser as the board went up for six minutes of added time. Yet, incredibly, Hearts scored straight from kick-off by exploiting the departure of Rangers right-back Ricky Foster to attack the area where his replacement Darren McGregor should have been. Sow took a couple of touches and slotted a composed finish low in the net for 2-1. ‘Of course it’s unacceptable,’ said McCoist afterwards. ‘They always say you are at your most vulnerable after you score but, to be honest, I’ve never been on the receiving end of that. ‘To have got back into what was a hard game against a team who will be one of our main rivals for the league this year, it was really disappointing.’ Concentration: Hearts skipper Danny Wilson gestures to members of his team during the game at Ibrox . Asked if McGregor should have been quicker taking up position, McCoist opted to spread the blame. ‘If you see Darren, he’s coming across and maybe he’s not had much time to react to it, but we had plenty in our team who could have got back and the whole process of losing that goal was very disappointing.’ For Sow, all of this was remarkable stuff. After joining Crystal Palace last summer he failed to start a single game. Yet his performance and goal here showed signs of real promise. Laid back so as to be almost horizontal, he was completely unconcerned when Rangers equalised and Ibrox roused itself for an anticipated Rangers winner. ‘I just thought: “This is our three points,” he said. ‘I still believed. The atmosphere was great, but all three points are the same in the end. ‘I’m just happy we got them here, it was good to get a win as early as possible.’ Clinical: Law fires home from close range to give Rangers a foothold back into the game . Almost the prototype Craig Levein striker – tall, powerful – Sow didn’t need much persuading to join Hearts. Rangers supporters, by contrast, were left to ponder if this is the kind of imaginative signing they might make if they had a scouting network. ‘I was a free agent and had some other opportunities to go back to Sweden. But I want to make my career here in the UK,’ said Sow. ‘My last competitive game was maybe a year ago last summer for Syrianska in the Swedish league before I joined Palace. This was my first start in a while.’ The afternoon began with a warm tribute to the late Sandy Jardine as Rangers honoured the man who played over 800 games for the club by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour. Former team-mates from the club’s European Cup Winners’ Cup triumph of 1972 gathered around the centre circle. For only the second time since his resignation from the Rangers board in protest at Craig Whyte’s stewardship of the club, John Greig attended a match at Ibrox. Deserved: Hearts took a 1-0 lead courtesy of Wilson early on in the second half . The gesture was a one-off to honour Jardine albeit he declined the invitation to join the Barcelona Bears on the pitch. After 27 minutes he did make an appearance on the large Ibrox screens to unanimous acclaim. By then Rangers had wasted chances to take the lead. In 18 minutes David Templeton, one of four former Hearts players in the Rangers starting 11, blew the best one by far. Lewis MacLeod, one of the brighter players for Rangers, did well to create a shooting chance for Miller. The former Scotland man’s prodded shot spun up towards the back post after an Alim Ozturk block, falling perfectly for Templeton to head inexplicably over the bar from eight yards. He only had to hit the target. Provocatively, Hearts coach Neilson had spoken pre-match of training with 10 men against 11, because in his view ‘that’s how it is’ against Rangers at Ibrox. It looked for a time as if his mind games might become a prescient prediction. Respect: Rangers fans hold up cards to make a mosaic in the newly renamed Sandy Jardine stand . Jordan McGhee was booked early in the game and before 35 minutes were played the dangerous Sow and Kevin McHattie had joined him in the book. Around the same time, however, the visitors began to settle and play some football. Sow’s lofted cross from the left in 41 minutes deserved more than a weak downward header from Billy King. And Hearts had loud calls for a penalty before half-time after some fine passing ended in King crumpling to the deck under a challenge from Law. Referee Craig Thomson said no penalty. But Hearts were growing in stature. They began the second half boldly and claimed the lead in 52 minutes with a simple goal. King’s corner in front of the Bill Struth Main Stand looped into the area, picking out the leaping figure of Hearts skipper Wilson. The defender’s downward header took a nick off Lee Wallace, but silenced Ibrox as it nestled in the back of the net. Downbeat: Ally McCoist shakes hands with counterpart Robbie Neilson after a disappointing start to the season . Hearts lived dangerously thereafter, but nowhere near as perilously as McCoist might have liked. Rangers, frankly, created precious little. Neilson’s side survived a desperate penalty box scramble in 57 minutes when MacLeod’s corner was turned towards goal by Lee McCulloch, then Kris Boyd, before Hearts somehow managed to whack the ball clear through a forest of flailing legs in desperate circumstances. They weren’t out of the woods yet. In 66 minutes goalkeeper Neil Alexander was stretchered from the field following a clash of heads with Ozturk, his own defender. Scott Gallacher, the replacement who left Rangers by mutual consent last season, was hastily summoned from the bench. He probably expected a rougher ride than he got. He was finally beaten in injury time when Law hooked the home team level after Miller knocked down a long, raking, Wallace long ball. By allowing Sow to run free from the kick off, however, Rangers made a pig’s ear of the situation. The goalscorer’s display here suggested bad pig puns could be a feature of the Championship season.","Summer signing Osman Sow scored a last-gasp winner for Hearts at Ibrox .

"There is no doubt the perfect baby name is hard to pick, but a unique one is even harder to come by. Reddit user thebdizzle spawned a viral thread by asking: 'What are people naming their children that they really shouldn't be?', after a Facebook friend announced that they had named their child 'Dude Lorenzo'. And it seems thebdizzle was not alone in his shock over the newborn's name - which could be a tip of the hat to actor Jeff Bridges' character named 'The Dude' in cult hit, The Big Lebowski or a reference to the Ashton Kutcher movie, Dude Where's My Car?.

While theschizophreniac agreed: 'Poor kid. I can only imagine the hilarity of his teachers referring to him as dude.' While it seems some parents took inspiration from literature - including Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games - others left Redditors scratching their heads.

Redditors have also heard of parents calling their children, Katniss, from The Hunger Games book and TV series . thebdizzle posted a screen shot of the announcement for those who did not believe him at first . A Reddit thread was started after it emerged a baby was named Dude, which could be a nod to Jeff Bridges' (pictured) character The Dude in The Big Lebowski . 'I did a clinical rotation at a pediatric facility, and I had two patients named YrHyness & YrMagesty. It's really hard not to laugh when you're asking a 3 year old, ""Does your tummy hurt YrHyness?""' they said. While Exodia101 claimed to know someone named 'iMajesty' to which Animalgeologist replied: 'Is he a new Apple product?' Other baby names included Susej (pronounced 'Suzy'), Starblanket, Cviiitlyn (a version of Caitlin), Jew'lrii ('jewellery'), Yoonik ('eunuch'), Sharkeisha, Iysabeyl (a take on Isabel), Cevyn ('seven'), Ziggy, Sincerely Yours, Macaroni and Spaghetti. Meanwhile others took inspiration from fiction and made it there own form of reality with names like Katniss from The Hunger Games, Aragorn and Elrond from The Lord of the Rings, Khaleesi from Game of Thrones and Holden from The Catcher in the Rye. Of The Hunger Games reference, bastocrat said: 'You just know that all the other kids will call her ""catp***"".' And nfriel had a bone to pick with the nod to Game of Thrones: '""Khaleesi"" is the worst. It's not even the character's name! It's a title in a made-up fantasy language.' The latest celebrity to jump on board with the unique baby names trend is former British glamour model, Katie Price. She hit back at critics last week after she was mocked for naming her newborn daughter, Bunny. The new mum wrote in her column for Now magazine: 'Bunny is an old-fashioned name and I love it.

"Jimmy Anderson roared his approval, offered a little glare but resisted the urge to have words with  Ravindra Jadeja and then soaked up the adulation of his home crowd. It was the big moment of a huge bowling display from England. The man MS Dhoni tried to get banned from this fourth Test had just trapped his nemesis lbw after a superb demonstration of swing bowling and India were on the ropes at 63 for six after winning the toss and batting. They may have made something of a recovery to reach 152 all out and just about stayed in the game by dismissing Gary Ballance just before the close to leave England on 113 for three. But this was very much the home side’s day. In form: Stuart Broad salutes the crowd after taking six wickets during day on the fourth Test in Manchester . Great day at the office: Broad celebrates with team-mates after taking his sixth wicket, that of Pankaj Singh . De ja vu: The England bowler finished the day on remarkable figures having taken six wickets for 25 runs . No one more than Anderson, who was . this week cleared of all charges over his Trent Bridge spat with Jadeja, . even if he was ultimately overshadowed by strike partner Stuart Broad . as England ran riot under cloudy Manchester skies. Both . Dhoni and Alastair Cook would have batted first on an Old Trafford . pitch with pace and carry but it turned into an excellent toss to lose . because of the excellence of one of the most prolific partnerships in . English Test history. It was . Anderson and Broad who squandered perfect bowling conditions on the . first morning at Lord’s where England went on to crash to a second Test . defeat. Yet since then the . senior pair have displayed class and character to hit back at the Ageas . Bowl and then gloriously on Thursday when, particularly in the first hour, . they bowled with a pace, hostility and skill that was almost . unplayable. The sun-baked . summer has not exactly made England feel at home but the arrival of this . series in Manchester was always likely to bring the weather they have . craved. Brave stand: India captain MS Dhoni hit a defiant 71 as his team crumbled in their first innings . Looking up: Ravichandran Ashwin sends a ball high towards the boundary at Old Trafford . It was perfect weather for ducks on Thursday — a Test record six in one innings, in fact. Half a dozen Pakistan batsmen failed to trouble the scorers against West Indies in 1980, while six South Africans (v India in 1996) and six Bangladeshis (v West Indies in 2002) suffered the same fate. The record for a Test is 11 — most recently set by England and Sri Lanka at Leeds in July. 1. Vijay waddles off after nicking Anderson to Cook. 2. Kohli falls to Anderson. 3. Broad gets the plaudits after having Pujara caught at slip. 4. Anderson is jubilant after trapping Jadeja in front. 5. Kumar is castled after leaving a Broad delivery that nipped back. 6. Broad wraps things up by bowling Pankaj. The stage may have . been set but Anderson and Broad had to make the most of it, as they did . in reducing India to a scarcely believable eight for four, all four . wickets falling in 13 balls on the same score. Anderson’s . third over was a double wicket maiden as Murali Vijay and then Virat . Kohli, again failing to live up to his lofty reputation, both fell . without scoring with England’s slip fielding matching the brilliance of . their bowling. Gautam . Gambhir, thrown in here at the expense of Shikhar Dhawan, and Cheteshwar . Pujara were the other early victims, both falling to Broad, as India’s . lowest score against England, 42 in 1974 at Lord’s, looked under threat. That . they did not plumb those depths was almost totally down to their . captain, Dhoni displaying considerable guts to overcome the limitations . of his technique against the moving ball and the numerous blows to his . body. Dhoni had seen India’s . best batsman in this series, Ajinkya Rahane, fall to Chris Jordan . before the moment that Anderson will cherish more than most of his 374 . Test victims. Appeal: MS Dhoni runs between the wickets as England's James Anderson turns to the umpire in Manchester . Flying high: Chris Jordan jumps for joy after taking the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane at Old Trafford . He may have been exonerated by judge Gordon Lewis and the . decision of ICC chief executive Dave Richardson not to contest the not . guilty verdict but Anderson’s aggressive approach was still under the . microscope here. Cook had . told him to carry on cursing but Anderson was noticeably quieter, even . after trapping Jadeja with the perfect inswinger to the left-hander . after setting him up with three outswingers. Exceptional, highly skilled . bowling. That left Anderson . just nine wickets behind Sir Ian Botham’s English Test wicket-taking . record but he was unable to add to it because of Dhoni’s defiance and . the fact that Broad then blew India away. Broad . needs an operation on his right knee but he did not look  hindered here . as he recorded four wicket maidens and ended up with six for 25, his . third-best Test haul. By the time Dhoni became the fifth of his six . victims, India’s captain had scored 71, with only Ravichandran Ashwin . offering much support with a hard-hitting 40 on his return to the side. India might have failed to reach three figures had Jordan and Chris . Woakes been able to offer more penetrative support but they are making . their way in Test cricket and it was understandable that England were . unchanged. India were just . about able to hang on in there, with Sam Robson  failing to convince . before losing his off stump to Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Cook giving it away . with a poor pull shot against the lively newcomer Varun Aaron. Ballance . and Ian Bell were taking the Test away from India until Aaron struck in . the last over — eight of the day’s allocation were lost because of . woeful over-rates — to gain an lbw shout from Marais Erasmus who, along . with Rod Tucker, had an excellent day. Not . nearly as good, though, as that of Broad and Anderson who have given . England the perfect chance to dictate terms in this decisive Test. England's turn: Captain Alastair Cook takes to the field for his first innings during the fourth Test . Ray of hope: India bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar high-fives a team-mate after bowling Sam Robson .

"England manager Roy Hodgson was in the stands at Villa Park but he will have left impressed by a save from an American goalkeeper late on that ensured a goalless draw which ultimately satisfied both teams. Brad Guzan reacted quickly to block a powerful shot from Newcastle substitute Siem de Jong, put clear by Remy Cabella, and preserve a second successive clean sheet for the first time since last November. Only six players eligible for Hodgson started this match and none are England regulars. Of those, Fabian Delph impressed most, and it was he who burst forward to launch a counter-attack in the final minute before being crudely blocked by Mike Williamson.

The central defender was shown a second yellow card by Mike Dean and as he trudged off Alan Pardew brought off forward Ayoze Perez 13 minutes after he had been sent on so Steven Taylor could help see out the game. In truth, two moments on the touchline did most to entertain. In the first half Pardew tried to rouse misfiring winger Cabella, who did well on his debut against Manchester City, by dancing a jig and pulling a toothy smile with his fingers. A short clip of Pardew’s performance became a hit on Twitter. ‘My girls will be laughing at me tonight,’ said Pardew. ‘I just felt he was trying too hard. He had a lot of publicity last week and he was a bit tense to start here. He had a couple of great situations that he didn’t deliver, and that’s not like him. I was trying to get him to play with a smile.’ There was black humour when opposing manager Paul Lambert was struck in a sensitive area by a water bottle flung from the hand of No 2 Roy Keane during a fiery reaction to a foul by Daryl Janmaat on Alan Hutton. Lambert had booted the ball down the line in anger and as he turned back he was inadvertently caught by Keane’s missile. The pair shared a hug and the Irishman growled his displeasure at Janmaat. ‘You try and tell him not to throw a water bottle,’ joked Lambert. Last season Lambert’s team struggled at home, losing a record 10 matches. But the mood was positive here after an opening-day win at Stoke and with a revamped defence, Villa should prove robust this season.

Hutton, making his first appearance here since May 2012, was excellent at right-back — covering across the back line and bringing the ball out with assurance — while Aly Cissokho, signed for £2m, was equally strong on the other flank. Ron Vlaar is continuing his fine form from the World Cup and Philippe Senderos looks more composed than during his troubled spell at Fulham. There were no shots on target for Villa — Charles N’Zogbia’s first-half free-kick which whistled past the post was their closest effort — but once Christian Benteke is back from achilles injury a genuine striking thrust should emerge. ‘After everybody’s doom and gloom about the football club last season we’ve certainly took the challenge on,’ said Lambert. ‘We were resolute.’ Newcastle had the majority of possession and Cabella should have at least tested Guzan when the ball fell to him at the far post in the 26th minute after Yoan Gouffran’s deflected shot. But he side-footed wide. The visitors’ best period came soon after the interval when three chances came and went. First Cabella’s deep free-kick was headed back across the six-yard box by Williamson and Janmaat connected well to force a fine save from Guzan. Minutes later Janmaat went close again when he cut in from the right and hit crisp left-foot shot narrowly over the bar. Then Cabella dinked a pass to Williamson, but he slashed wildly and missed the ball. ‘I thought we deserved to win,’ said Pardew. ‘I felt we controlled 75 per cent of that game.’ After Guzan’s heroics and Williamson’s marching orders, the heavens opened and Villa pushed forward but failed to find the breakthrough.

"A message claiming Celtic were 'raped' in a Champions League tie and should not have been reinstated into the competition has appeared on the Twitter account of former Rangers player Vladimir Weiss. Celtic were reprieved by UEFA on Friday morning after it emerged their third qualifying round opponents Legia Warsaw fielded a suspended player in the second leg at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. The tweet, which was sent out to 81,000 followers on Slovakia international Weiss' official account, read: 'Un f***** believable... Got raped 6:1!!! Should never be allowed to play champions league after that.. Embarrassing #f***celtic #watp'. VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic's reaction to being reinstated in to the Champions League . Controversial: This message relating to the decision to reinstate Celtic to the Champions League after third qualifying round opponents Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player appeared on the Twitter account of former Rangers player Vladimir Weiss . Blue blood: Weiss in action for Rangers against bitter rivals Celtic during his loan spell at the club in the 2010-2011 season. He is still pictured in Rangers colours on his Twitter profile background . Suspended: Bartosz Bereszynski, who was banned for three games following a red card, played three minutes for Legia Warsaw in the second leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie with Celtic . The tweet prompted a backlash against the choice of words and was retweeted over 3,000 times. Winger Weiss played for Rangers on loan from Manchester City during the 2010-2011 season, making 35 appearances for the Ibrox club and scoring five times. A UEFA disciplinary panel took the decision to reinstate Celtic after their Polish opponents Legia fielded a suspended player, Bartosz Bereszynski, for three minutes of their third qualifying round, second leg tie at Murrayfield on Wednesday night. Legia won both legs of the tie - 4-1 at home and 2-0 away - to win 6-1 on aggregate. But a UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the European draws in Nyon decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - and advance on away goals - after Legia fielded suspended defender Bereszynski. Red carded against Cypriots Apollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season Bereszynski was supposed to serve his suspension in UEFA competition this season.

His late appearance as a substitute in the second leg was reported to the governing body by the UEFA match delegate leading to his eligibility being investigated. After being reinstated into the competition, Celtic were drawn against Maribor in the play-off round. Weiss, who now plays for Lekhwiya in the Qatar Stars League, still has a picture of himself in a Rangers kit on his Twitter profile.

REALLY?' Another responded: 'Not really comfortable with your use of the word ""rape"" here.' Alan Pardew, now manager of Newcastle United, was heavily criticised after using the word 'rape' on an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day 2 programme back in 2009. Describing an ineffective challenge by Manchester City player Ched Evans on Chelsea's Michael Essien, Pardew said: 'Ched Evans is a strong boy but Essien knocked him off the ball. He absolutely rapes him there.' He was condemned by women's groups and was forced to issue an 'unconditional apology' through the BBC. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"Catch him if you can. Unfortunately for the entire MotoGP field in 2014, keeping pace with Marc Marquez has proved totally impossible this season. The world champion made it 10 wins from as many races this year after triumphing at Indianapolis on Sunday. The defending world champ shattered the series’ previous record for the youngest driver to win 10 in a row. Mike Hailwood was 24 years and 86 days old when he did it in 1964. Marquez is 21 years, 174 days. With his dominance so great, questions of whether he will retain the title have long since passed - replaced with whether the Spaniard can clean sweep all 18 races this term. Marquez is the first rider since Mick Doohan in 1997 to win 10 successive premier class races. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the incredible highlights of the 'rookie' Marc Marquez . High five: Marc Marquez celebrates in the Indianapolis paddock after winning his tenth straight race to keep him on course of winning every grand prix this term . Familiar feeling: Marquez has dominated MotoGP since stepping up from Moto2 in 2013 - finishing on the podium in 26 of his 28 races . Center of attention: Honda's Marquez celebrates winning the grand prix in Indianapolis alongside Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo (left) and Valentino Rossi . If you thought Sebastian Vettel's iron grip over Formula One for the past four years was impressive, then Marquez's achievements are just as remarkable - if not better. For instance, Marquez is in just his second year of MotoGP - winning the title in his rookie season. And while he rides a factory Honda - arguably the best bike in the field - he is consistently leaving team-mate, Dani Pedrosa for dust at every grand prix. Pedrosa isn't the only one struggling to keep pace with the 21-year-old. Seven-time premier class world champion Valentino Rossi and team-mate Jorge Lorenzo also can't beat Marquez this year and the Yamaha pair, as well as Pedrosa, are among the finest riders the sport has seen - at least in recent times. Clear the way: Marquez won the MotoGP championship in his rookie season in 2013 and is set to dominate the sport in the future with his aggressive riding style . Coming through: Marquez (93) shows little fear when overtaking as he scythes past Lorenzo (99) and Rossi to take the lead at Indianapolis . First choice: Marquez is tied down to ride with Honda for the foreseeable future, with rivals including Lorenzo (right) struggling to match his pace on track . VIDEO Marc Marquez: 2013 Moto GP highlights . World Championships: Three (2010 - 125 cc), (2012 - Moto 2), 2013 - MotoGP) Youngest pole position in MotoGP: 20 years, 62 days .

Youngest Rider to win 10 races in a row in Premier Class: 21 years, 174 days . Most Pole Positions from start of season in 4 Stroke MotoGP (2002–) era: 6 . Most consecutive race wins in premier class (1949–) era: 10 (Shared with Mick Doohan and Giacomo Agostini) Only rider MotoGP era to win 6 successive premier class races from pole . Since making his debut, last year, Marquez has finished on the podium in 26 of his 28 races - the two anomalies include a rare crash at Mugello last season, as well as a team mix-up resulting in his disqualification at Phillip Island, Australia. It's a level of dominance that should on paper be boring, but Marquez's riding this year has not been simple lights to flags victories - he really has had to work for some of his wins. His poor race starts need attention for instance, and it often leads to the Spaniard falling well out the top three on the first lap, whether he qualifies on pole or not. But he has proven time and again this term he is more than capable of fighting through the field. Among the highlights of his victories include Le Mans where he came from 10th to pass Rossi and sprint off into the distance with half the race still to go.. My time is now: Marquez has built up a large fan following in MotoGP as he bids to take the sport into a new era . Still got it: Rossi has won just one race in the last four seasons but is still among the top riders in the sport at 35-years-old . Top dog: Rossi is still the most popular rider in the paddock having won an impressive seven premier class titles since 2001 . While at the Sachsenring in Germany, he pitted before the race to switch on to dry tyres, but still scythed through the field unchallenged to claim victory. His biggest test came at Mugello where late on he exchange in a highly entertaining duel with Lorenzo, beating his Spanish compatriot by just 0.1 of a second. Since the start of the century, MotoGP's golden boy has been Rossi who still is by far the most popular rider even if his best days are coming to an end. The Italian is a global 'fan favourite' but despite signing a new two-year deals with Yamaha, talks of who will lead the sport in the future have been asked for some time. Casey Stoner has come and gone, Pedrosa and Lorenzo have led a challenge but Marquez's total dominance which has seen him smash records left, right and centre surely pave the way for the start of an exciting new era in the premier class of motor cycle racing.","Marc Marquez continued perfect start to the MotoGP season after winning tenth straight race at Indianapolis .

"Despite only taking control of North Korea in 2012, Kim Jong-Un has wasted no time exerting his authority with an iron fist and terrifying brutality. While it's obvious such methods are influenced by his father Kim Jong-Il's reign of terror, this new picture reveals the lengths he goes to in an attempt to emulate his father's legacy. A picture taken at the Jongsong Pharmaceutical General Factory in Pyongyang shows him dictating orders to his subordinates as they eagerly scribble down notes while listening to the young despot. In the background, a photo on the wall shows Jong-Il conducting an identical tour some years previous, with his entourage following his every move just like those surrounding his son. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong-Un dictates orders to a set of eager subordinates while a photo of his father doing exactly the same hangs in the background . Jong-Un wearing a doctor's lab coat during a visit to Jongsong Pharmaceutical General Factory . The undated photo was released by North Korea's Central News Agency. It is believed that Jong-Un's reign in power is far more bloody and dangerous than that of his father's. Jong-Il's former bodyguard recently said that the Kims required absolute loyalty and any suspicion of treachery was dealt with incredibly harshly. After Jong-Il's death in 2012, people who were deemed not to have mourned intensely enough, were sent to a labour camp for six months. In October 2013, it was reported that Jong-Un ordered the execution of his ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-Wol, who had a popular hit song in North Korea. However, she appeared on North Korean state television in May delivering a speech. The tyrant questions one of his advisors during one of his inspections across the country .

Days after she reappeared in public, Kim ordered the execution of engineers and architects involved in the construction of a Pyongyang tower block which collapsed days earlier. More than 500 people died in the collapse which was blamed on 'shoddy workmanship'. Jong-Un ordered the executions because he was 'unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy'. He himself went missing from public view in early September, prompting claims that he may have been overthrown. However, it is understood he underwent ankle surgery and reappeared in public after six weeks carrying a black cane. Upon his return, it is believed he ordered the execution of six senior officials.","North Korean leader pictured dictating to subordinates during factory tour .

"For all the noise surrounding the red half of Manchester this summer, you could be forgiven for forgetting that this country's pre-eminent football club are Manchester City, Premier League title winners in two of the past three seasons. From Manchester City, there have been no grand proclamations. No talk of an unlimited budget. No new signings ordered to train alone in public view. No round of rumours over who will wear the captain's armband. Under the leadership of Manuel Pellegrini - and directed from above by Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain - it is a calm and confident approach.

Five trophies in four years, winning everything there is to win in the domestic game, and the signals are that Manchester City are only going to get stronger. This summer, they have added sensibly, strengthening the midfield with the commanding Brazilian Fernando, providing competition for the excellent Pablo Zabaleta with a move for Bacary Sagna and they will, most probably this week, finally place a centre-half of elite standing alongside Vincent Kompany with the £32million signing of Eliaquim Mangala. City's anxieties to conform to Financial Fair Play regulations may deny them one final venture into the market to sprinkle some further stardust into Pellegrini's attacking pool but the Chilean will make do with glittering options that vary from David Silva and Stevan Jovetic to Sergio Aguero, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko.

For much of last season, Pellegrini spoke of his desire not to have a fixed starting line-up but a fluid system of play that would allow any of his players to come in and perform to the same level, regardless of personnel. With a squad that is now blessed with two top-drawer players in every position, his ambitions are now coming to fruition. Very few players are now assured a starting place, perhaps only Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Sergio Aguero. Joe Hart will be under threat from Willy Caballero whose precise distribution appeals to Pellegrini and indeed the system of play that is being adopted at all levels of the club, from the youth teams at age 11 to the first team. Transfer: Manchester City are hopeful of tying up a £32m deal for Porto's centre back Eliaquim Mangala . VIDEO Mangala seen in Manchester CIty . At full-back, Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov are at a similar level to Zabaleta and Clichy. Martin Demichelis has overcome his teething problems to enjoy a remarkable renaissance. In the midfield, Fernandinho and James Milner offer smart cover for Toure and Fernando. You get the drift. City are inundated with gifted footballers. They could quite easily field two teams of the highest quality. On the weekend, it could be: Hart, Sagna, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Fernando, Toure, Silva, Nasri, Aguero, Dzeko. For a midweek cup game, Pellegrini can shuffle his pack and the standard would barely dip: Caballero, Zabaleta, Nastasic, Mangala, Kolarov, Lampard, Fernandinho, Navas, Milner, Jovetic, Negredo. City have plenty to prove this season. At home, these players must demonstrate that they have the mentality to defend a Premier League title, after releasing their grip so meekly the season before last. On the continent, City must finally arrive on the European stage and start providing the kind of unforgettable nights that have been the norm over the years at Anfield, Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford. There, is, though a feeling that this football club is beginning to mature into a consistent force and their rivals will know that City, once again, will be the team to beat this season. Double trouble: The two possible teams Manchester City could line up with next season . Options: Stevan Jovetic has been impressing in pre-season and gives ellegrini yet another option up front .","Machester City have signed Frank Lampard, Bacary Sagna, Willy Caballero and Fernando .

"She shot to fame with her rave review of Olive Garden in 2012. Now, Marilyn Hagerty, 88, has cast her critical eye on her next fast food restaurant: Applebee's. And it survived - but only just. Scroll down for video . Strike two: Marilyn Hagerty, 88, reviewed Olive Garden and has now given her account of Applebee's . Hagerty branded Olive Garden the 'largest and most beautiful restaurant in town' when the casual Italian outlet arrived in the small town of Grand Forks, North Dakota. The article for the Grank Forks Herald went viral, landing the grandmother a book deal and numerous TV appearances. In her latest piece, Applebees: A Salad To Remember, Hagerty described a more sedate eating experience at the bar and grill which has 2,019 restaurants globally. She describes the Chicken Oriental Salad as 'one of those things you remember' - but that is where the praise ends. Readers wishing to try the dish, she warns, should opt for the $8.59 half-size version: 'The regular size is $9.99, but you don't need that.' She also turned up the chance to try their Blue Ribbon Brownies - which she 'could do without'. Instead, she opted for a 'small, gooey' Dessert Shooter, which she praised as: 'just right'. 'Neighborhood feel': She is sparing with adjectives but seems to commend the atmosphere of the eatery . 'One of those things you remember': Hagerty enjoyed and remembered the half-sized Chicken Oriental Salad . Special mention goes to her waitress, Miguela: 'None of this, “Hi, I’m Nick, and I will be your server.” 'She was there when we needed her. She did not intrude.' And Mary Lou Kurtyka, who greets diners at the door, 'fits the neighborhood theme promoted by the restaurant'. An astute investigator, Hagerty gleaned some inside knowledge on how staff are trained at the eatery. She was - as ever - sparing with adjectives, but her tone suggested she approved. 'They don’t come around asking if everything is all right,' she wrote, 'instead, one of the managers said they are encouraged to show their own personalities.' Finally, Hagerty issues the restaurant with a report card: . 'Seating usually is quick in booths or at tables with windows all around. Service is good. 'Menu is extensive and takes study if you are not a regular here. Rest rooms are good.' It retains the same pensive tone of Hagerty's renowned Olive Garden review, but falls short of receiving her praise. 'Just right': The 'small and gooey' Dessert Shooter hit the spot for Hagerty and her companion . Shunned: She decided they could 'do without' the Blue Ribbon Brownies on offer at the restaurant . She started off her Olive Garden review by calling the eatery 'impressive', so impressive people were queuing around the block to eat there last month. But no need for diners to worry, the 85-year-old matter-of-factly points out: 'There is seating for those who are waiting.' She describes the decor as being 'fashioned in Tuscan farmhouse style with a welcoming entryway'. After asking the server 'at length' what she would recommend Mrs Hagerty decided to take her advice on the Chicken Alfredo, though chose a glass of water rather than the recommended raspberry lemonade. Though she later told readers: 'On a hot summer day, I will try the raspberry lemonade that was recommended.' While waiting for her food, the writer took the time to absorb her surroundings, describing the staff's standard white-shirt, black pants uniform and accompanying 'gold-coloured towels' that 'adorned their aprons'. As for the food: 'The server first brought me the familiar Olive Garden salad bowl with crisp greens, peppers, onion rings and yes — several black olives. 'Along with it came a plate with two long, warm breadsticks. 'The chicken Alfredo ($10.95) was warm and comforting on a cold day. The portion was generous. My server was ready with Parmesan cheese.' After acknowledging that the restaurant had a fully-licensed bar, a fireplace that 'added warmth' and that vases with permanent flower displays, i.e. plastic, sat on the ledges, she concludes that Olive Garden is 'the largest and most beautiful restaurant now operating in Grand Forks'. The pinnacle: Hagerty branded Olive Garden 'the lagrest and most beautiful restaurant' in Grand Forks . Praise: The meal was 'warm and comforting on a cold day', Hagerty gushed to readers in North Dakota . The restaurant does not need to rely on the town of 55,000 people for business as Mrs Hagerty points out: 'It attracts visitors from out of town as well as people who live here.' Speaking to ABC about her new-found fame, Mrs Hagerty said: 'Yesterday morning the phone started ringing and messages started going up, and I had no clue what it was all about. 'These people were making fun of me…and then I thought, so what? My son told me that it had gone viral but I didn’t know what that meant. 'It’s been like a three ring circus over here ever since.' When one blogger asked a former Grand Forks Herald editor if Mrs Hagerty was sincere in her earnest review, he said: 'Oh, that's for real. Marilyn has been reviewing restaurants for the Herald for decades. She also writes a sort of celebrity column and has a sewage lift station named for her, as does Dave Barry. 'By the way, her readers will recognize that as a fairly negative reviewsince she spent a lot more time on the ambiance than the food.' Even outspoken chef Anthony Bourdain is a fan, tweeting to his followers today: 'Very much enjoying watching Internet sensation Marilyn Hagerty triumph over the snarkologists (myself included).'","Marilyn Hagerty, 88, shot to fame with review of Olive Garden in 2012 .

"Uninspired Paris Saint-Germain sorely missed star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the defending champion drew 0-0 with lowly Evian in the French league on Friday. Edinson Cavani usually plays on the wings when Ibrahimovic is in the starting lineup. But the Sweden striker's absence because of a left oblique muscle injury allowed Cavani to play as a center forward, his favored position. Cavani had two clear-cut chances. He collected a through ball from Lucas Moura in the 27th and cut inside two defenders but was denied by Evian goalkeeper Jesper Hansen. Lucas fed Cavani again in the 71st but Hansen stopped the powerful attempt from the Uruguay striker .

Challenge: Serge Aurier (left) is tackled by Evian's Jonathan Mensah (right) during the match in Annecy . The hosts could have won the match in stoppage time. PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu tipped Evian substitute Nicolas Benezet's drive over the bar. From the subsequent corner, a block from David Luiz prevented Evian defender Jonathan Mensah from finding the net. PSG was reduced to 10 men in the 63rd when Yohan Cabaye was sent off. The France midfielder was booked for a cynical foul on Evian forward Nicki Nielsen in the 17th before receiving a second yellow card for tripping substitute Fabien Camus. 'When you receive a red card, you usually lose,' Sirigu told BeIn Sports television. 'We don't concede any goal and we take one point, so it's positive.' PSG has five points from its first three league games while Evian earned its first point this season after losing its two previous games and conceding a total of nine goals.

"A group of Brazilian convicts who tunnelled out of jail to freedom filmed the whole escape on a mobile phone ... before posting the videos online to taunt their hoodwinked guards. In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, 13 prisoners dug a small hole under the wall between their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness. But unlike the famous movie, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, which is set in the 1940s, their escape had very modern twist. Rather than focus purely on getting out of jail without detection, they felt compelled to record the whole experience on a mobile phone and post it on the internet for all to see. Scroll down for video . Brazen: The thirteen prisoners filmed their escape on mobile phones, laughing as they did so, before later posting the video online . Like a movie: In a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, the prisoners dug a small hole under the wall that separated their cell and the prison yard in Rio Verde, Goias State, before darting to freedom under cover of darkness . Police deputy Jacqueline Camargo Machado admitted that the prisoners' cells had not been inspected for two months, blaming staff shortages. She said: 'The guard that was there on the day was looking after other things most of the time. 'We now know that there had not been an inspection of the cell for almost 60 days. They were able to dig a tunnel and it was easy to escape after that.' Ezequias Gonçalves Miranda and William Pereira Da Mata were two of the crooks that tunnelled out of jail to freedom. It is unclear if they appeared in the video . More than Freeman: It was a daring breakout that echoed 1994 Hollywood blockbuster The Shawshank Redemption, starring Morgan Freeman (left) and Tim Robbins (right) - but with a very modern twist . The prison guard on duty has been suspended for not managing to foil the secret plot. A manhunt has been launched resulting in the capture of two men. The other 11 remain at large. It is not the first escape from Brazilian jail. A year ago 54 prisoners staged a mass escape after a riot at the Fundação Casa youth detentionfacility in Sao Paulo, which houses more than 100 detainees. Dozens of the under-age offenders set fire to their mattresses, sparking a blaze in the prison's central yard.  Helicopter images showed plumes of smoke rising from the detention centre. Video footage also showed prisoners climbing over the prison walls and escaping down trees. Nearly 30 staff members were held hostage during the riot and the facility's director was admitted to hospital with cuts to his head and bruised ribs.","13 prisoners escaped from Rio Grande prison after digging hole under wall .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is considering bringing defender Per Mertesacker back from his post-World Cup lay-off early as injury cover for Tuesday's Champions League first leg play-off against Besiktas. Mertesacker and his Germany team-mates Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski were given the extended break by Wenger after the World Cup triumph in Brazil last month with the trio scheduled to miss the first few weeks of the campaign. However, defenders Laurent Koscielny and Kieran Gibbs suffered knocks in Saturday's last-gasp 2-1 win over Crystal Palace meaning Mertesacker, who last week announced his international retirement, could be drafted in to play in Turkey. Scroll down for video . Late starters: (from left) Lukas Podolski, Per Mertesacker and Mesut Ozil had an extended break . 'We will assess Koscielny on Monday,' Wenger said. 'If he's fit and capable to play, we play him. It was our plan to bring the Germans back for Everton (on Saturday). But in case of emergency I will take Mertesacker. 'Ideally he would need one more week preparation but he's willing to play, no problem. We are a bit short.' Frenchman Koscielny drew the Gunners level on the stroke of half-time on Saturday after Brede Hangeland's glancing header gave Palace the lead at the Emirates Stadium. Storming summer: Mertesacker got his hands on the World Cup as Germany triumphed in Brazil . Koscielny played the full 90 minutes but suffered from pain in his foot, while Gibbs lasted little over an hour before succumbing to a hamstring injury. Arsenal are aiming to reach the Champions League group stage for the 17th consecutive season.

"A brave 8-year-old boy with Down Syndrome who successfully battled cancer got to fist bump all the players on the hockey team The Boston Bruins on Tuesday night. Footage of the adorable exchange between Liam Fitzgerald and the players on the Bruins went viral with nearly 1 million views and it's no surprise. Liam smiled over and over again as he reached out his tiny fist towards the Bruins  before their 2-1 win over the Florida Panthers after they finished their pre-game warmups. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fist Bump!: Lucky Liam Fitzgerald, 8, got to fist bump all of the players on the Bruins on Tuesday night . Bumped off cancer: Liam Fitzgerald is a brave boy with Down Syndrome who battled cancer for three years . The Obnoxious Boston Fan column on Boston.com reports that Liam was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia when he was just four-years-old. After three and a half years of battling the grueling illness he won the war and made some amazing friends along the way. Liam is a huge sports fan and the Bruins and the Red Sox were there for him during the best and the worst of his illness. Liam visited Fenway Park this past summer as a guest of starting pitcher Clay Buchholz, and joined Buchholz and company at the annual Buchholz Bowl in July. Boston.com reports that Liam's true love is for the Boston Bruins and he even dressed up as defenseman Adam McQuaid for Halloween last year.

The Massachusetts Down Syndrome Congress, who has a partnership with the Bruins Foundation for an annual charity fundraiser, told McQuaid that Liam is a big fan of his. When McQuaid learned about his biggest fan, he invited Liam and his family to a Bruins game last February. Liam was ecstatic when he met Milan Lucic, Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, and now-former Bruins Johnny Boychuk and Shawn Thornton. 'It not the attention, it’s the smile they bring to his face,' his mom, Christine Fitzgerald, told Boston.com. 'I watch what the Bruins do at Children’s Hospital. The athletes take the gift they have of their fame down to a personal level. It goes beyond their hockey skill set and shows they are human. Giving back. Sharing their gift with others,' she added. Liam  enjoys attending games and loves asking the players questions his mom told Boston.com. 'What are the keys to the game?’ That’s probably what he asked Bergeron,' Christine Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that the Bruins players have been nothing but kind to Liam who knows each of their names and all of their positions. 'He wishes he could skate,' Christine Fitzgerald said. Liam is small for his age and will soon be taking growth hormone every day until he turns 18, said his mother. 'He’s so small and cute,' his mom said. 'He recognizes the players.

"The family of Ebola patient Nina Pham has revealed how they pleaded with a judge to save her beloved spaniel Bentley, who is now in a secret location. Health officials do not yet know if dogs can transmit the deadly virus - although research done by the CDC in 2005 showed they can catch it and do not show symptoms. However, County Judge Clay Jenkins has agreed to let Pham's pet escape death, ordering Dallas Animal Services to take it to a secret quarantine for monitoring. The divisive move will draw criticism from parts of the medical industry as Spanish vets chose to euthanize and incinerate the dog belonging to Ebola patient Teresa Romero. Scroll down for video . Appeal: The 26-year-old's family made an emotional appeal to save Bentley as Pham is quarantined . Defending his decision, Judge Jenkins told USA Today: 'When I met with her parents, they said: 'This dog is important to her, judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog'. 'If that dog has to be The Boy In The Plastic Bubble, we're going to take good care of that dog.' The Boy In The Plastic Bubble is a 1976 made-for-TV movie starring John Travolta, which tells the story of a boy who has to live out of an incubator because he has such a poor immune system. A similar appeal was made to Spanish authorities by the family of Teresa Romero, but health officials refused to run the risk. The nurse's dog, Excalibur, was seized, euthanized and its remains incinerated on Wednesday sparking mass protests across Madrid. Research by the CDC found African dogs had caught the disease after scavenging from small dead animals in Ebola-hit villages. However, the report stated that dogs do not show symptoms - and today they still do not know if they can pass the virus on to humans or other animals. It is recognized as fact in the medical industry that humans can catch the disease by eating the meat of an infected animal. Transported: Dallas Animal Services officials wear normal clothes and no protection to remove the dog from Pham's Dallas apartment and take him to a secret location for monitoring as the mayor insists he will survive . Emergency: The World Health Organization has branded the outbreak the worst emergency of modern times . However, today Dallas spokesman Sana Syed today tweeted: 'Taking him [Bentley] to a safe place. 'Will share pics once we've shown the owner he's okay… He's adorable. Clearly a little puzzled by what's going on. But he's in good hands now and will be taken care of. Will update soon.' Pham, 26, is being monitored round the clock in an isolation ward after catching the deadly virus despite while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan – the man who brought the disease to America. Her diagnosis shocked the CDC as she had been wearing protective overalls while working at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital. The nurse, from Fort Worth, Texas, had been monitoring her condition following her contact with the Ebola patient and admitted herself to hospital on Friday after her temperature spiked – one of the first symptoms of the deadly virus. Her condition was described as 'clincally stable' on Monday. A blood test confirmed she had the disease and she is now being treated in an isolation ward. The Emergency Room where she was admitted was cleared and decontaminated. Controversial: There were protests across Spain after officials euthanized Excalibur, the dog belonging to Teresa Romero, a nurse who tested positive for the virus and is now being treated in Madrid . Outrage: Protesters marched the streets with signs reading, 'Excalibur - we won't forget, we won't forgive' Anger: The crowds shouted 'Assassins!' after the controversial slaying of the dog who may have been infected . Memorial: 'Excalibur, now you are free!!! Rest in peace,' a tribute read outside Romero's apartment building . Nina Pham's uncle confirmed to MailOnline that she is the nurse who has contracted Ebola while treating patient zero Thomas Eric Duncan. Jason Nguyen told MailOnline: 'Nina has contracted Ebola, she is my niece. Her mother called me on Saturday and told me; 'Nina has caught Ebola.' 'My sister is very upset, we all are. She said she was going up to the hospital in Dallas and I haven't heard from her since. I've tried to call but I can't get through. It's very shocking. I don't know any of the details, only what I hear on the news. It's frightening.' He added: 'Nina is very hard working. She is always up at the hospital in Dallas.' Kind-hearted: Pham graduated from Texas Christian University in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing . A friend added: 'You always hear it on the news, but you don't expect someone you know so well to have it.' HazChem teams spent the weekend fumigating her apartment in Dallas while health officials have ordered an investigation into how she contracted the disease. Her beloved King Charles Spaniel will not be destroyed and is being quarantined, Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings has assured. Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) Dr Thomas Frieden has blamed a 'breach in protocol' of infection control lead Miss Pham to catch Ebola. Mr Duncan arrived in Texas from Liberia on September 20. He began showing symptoms of Ebola three days after his arrival and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday 28.

"A pilot on Russian national airline Aeroflot is facing investigation after using a cockpit message to passengers to brand Ukrainians 'filth' while flying over the country. Despite admitting the captain had used the offensive language and 'violated our internal regulations', the state-run carrier did not apologise for the outburst. A Slovak diplomat tweeted a complaint on 9 August about the extraordinary language from the plane's unnamed pilot on a flight from Moscow to Vienna. Outrage: The pilot of an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Vienna sparked outrage with his incendiary comments . Controversial: He made a joke about the war-era activist Stepan Bandera - a Ukrainian hero; a Russian nemesis . 'En route by Aeroflot to VIE, captain to passengers: 'We fly over remnants of Ukraine, where Banderovtsi and other fifth lives,' wrote Martin Kaco, Counsellor at the political department of Slovak embassy in Moscow. The pilot's words referred to Stepan Bandera, seen as a fascist by many Russians for colluding with Nazi Germany but a hero by many Ukrainians for seeking an independent state not controlled by Moscow. In the current dispute in Ukraine, his name is often used by Russians to denigrate pro-Western Ukrainians seeking to ally the country with the EU. Aeroflot last night did not apologise for the words but admitted an investigation was underway. The airline tweeted five days after the complaint: 'We've studied your message. The fact was confirmed. 'The pilot had no right to express his personal opinion while on duty. 'In Aeroflot we have 'The standard for passengers information', which is obligatory to follow by all the pilots. Rival aid: The Russian convoy, left, has come to a stop not far from the Ukrainian border, while the government's own trucks, right, have started rolling towardss Luganks from Kiev and other cities . Powering ahead: This morning the convoy was 280 miles from the Ukrainian border, set to arrive later today . 'In this case the pilot has violated our internal regulations. 'We have started the internal investigation. Thank you for your information.' Meanwhile, controversy has ensued over a Russian convoy of trucks supposedly transporting aid to the Ukrainian border. Critics claim the vehicles could be containing weapons, and warn of a potential attack. The Kiev government today insisted on enforcing its own checks at the border on the cargo - threatening dire consequences if it could not. Chopper: A Russian attack helicopter was also seen patrolling the skies in a distant province of Russia today . On the march: Russian tanks also showed their power in Sergyevsky at the opposite end of the country . A spokesman for Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said last night that the only way to avoid a confrontation would be for the Russians to give over the whole contents of the convoy to Kiev inspectors. He said: 'We have three scenarios. The first - the direct invasion to the territory of Ukraine under the guise of the delivery of aid.' 'The second - a provocation in the Kharkiv region with a high degree of possibility of the use of force and military aggression of Russia. 'The third option - help for Lugansk passes through the checkpoint, which is closest to the city. We provide our customs control, scanning cargo, together with representatives of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - a monitoring organisation).'","Pilot made comments referring to Stepan Bandera, divisive war-era figure .

"LA Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena broke down in tears live on TV while talking about the retirement of star player Landon Donovan. Donovan, who was left out of Jurgen Klinsmann's Team USA squad for the World Cup in Brazil this summer, announced on Thursday that he is set to retire at the end of the current MLS season. After hearing the news Arena, who first worked with the 32-year-old at the 2002 World Cup, paid tribute to the man widely considered to be the USA's greatest ever footballer. Emotion: Arena is asked about Donovan's impact on him, both as a person and a coach, in a TV interview . Food for thought: The Galaxy head coach takes a long pause to think about Team USA's greatest ever player . Too much: The former American  coach is unable to hold back the tears as he recalls Donovan's career .

"Probe: Amazon's tax arrangements in Europe are set to be investigated by Brussels . Amazon is to be investigated over claims they were handed a 'sweetheart' deal by Luxembourg to help slash their tax bill for up to a decade. The European Commission in Brussels will begin a formal probe into allegations the Grand Duchy allowed the online giant to transfer profits through the country at a reduced tax rate. Investigators will consider whether this amounted to Amazon receiving state subsidies illegally and if they are found to have avoided tax it could face huge bills covering the past ten years. It is alleged that since 2003 its tax exposure in Luxembourg has been limited to less than one per cent of the company's European income, which amounts to illegal state aid. The new probe marks an escalation of attempts to stamp out tax avoidance by big companies. Apple, Starbucks and Fiat are already being investigated by Brussels over claims they have received similar deals. The European Commission is concerned that authorities in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively gave these companies preferential treatment in breach of EU rules. The Commission's investigations are centred around the  practice of spreading or reallocating the parent company's net profit to subsidiaries to help reduce the tax bill. According to the Financial Times if the charges against Amazon are proven the Commission can ask Luxembourg to recoup the substantial state subsidy from the firm. The former Prime Minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker will take over the presidency of the European Commission in a few weeks, but he was the country's premier during this period. Allegations: It is alleged that Luxembourg offered the online giant a tax deal capped at one per cent in 2003, which may have amounted to illegal state aid . Apple is among a number of US giants accused of avoiding tax for years through elaborate networks of subsidiaries, in their case in Ireland . A previous investigation by Reuters found that accounts filed by 25 Amazon units in six countries in 2012 showed how tax arrangements in Luxembourg  allowed the company to avoid paying more tax in the United States, where the company is based. Experts have said the small country has helped attract more than 40,000 holding companies and thousands of high-paying jobs for its population of nearly half a million. Representatives at the European Commission were not immediately available for comment today. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Previously it has said it has paid 'all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within'. Luxembourg's Ministry of Finance could not be immediately reached for comment.

"Quarter finals have been a sticking point for Andy Murray this season and last night's US Open draw did not spare him a difficult potential last eight match - against none other than Novak Djokovic. Seven times in 2014 Murray has bowed out of events at this stage, and now a showdown with the world number one awaits, providing the Serb can rediscover the form that has gone missing since winning Wimbledon. Djokovic has won just two matches in two months, seemingly distracted by his marriage and the impending birth of his first child. Yet he has the chance to play himself in next week, with the 27 year-old Scot having plenty to think about prior to that. Andy Murray is training at 100 percent after back problems . VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Murray is training at 100 percent after back problems . Big ask: Murray could have to face the likes of Verdasco and Tsonga if he is to reach the quarter-finals . Tricky: The Scott is up against it as he attempts to repeat his 2012 success in New York . Andy Murray has a tough task to reach the final. To do so, he'll probably have to beat the following: . First Round: R. Haase (Hol) Second Round: R. Stepanek (CZ) Third Round: F. Verdasco (SP) Fourth Round: JW Tsonga (FRA) Quarter Final: N. Djokovic (SER) Semi Final: S. Wawrinka (SWI) Final: R. Federer (SWI). His first round opponent is Robin Haase, the Dutchman ranked number 70 who almost knocked him out at Flushing Meadows three years ago in five sets. His third round could be against hard hitting Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, with Jo Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth. The Frenchman had a dreadful start to the year, but roared back to form this month by winning the Canadian Open - beating Murray en route in the quarter finals. This is a rough looking draw for Murray, now seeded eighth, as he tries to put behind him the last eight exit to Grigor Dimitrov at SW19, but then he looked to have a bad one at Wimbledon 2013 and everyone knows what happened after that. Formidable: Frenchman Tsonga is a difficult opponent to face as early as the fourth round at a Grand Slam . In form: Tsonga won the Rogers Cup in Toronto this month, where he beat Murray in the quarter-final . It seems ridiculous to look beyond Djokovic, but Murray's theoretical semi-final opponent is Stan Wawrinka. The man most favoured to reach the final from the opposite half is Roger Federer, who has amassed a 19-2 record since the French Open. The now 33 year-old looks to have a relatively benign draw. Overall both the men's and women's events look relatively unpredictable. British number one Heather Watson has a winnable first round against Sorana Cirstea of Romania, who has won just one match since Wimbledon. After that it could be Eugenie Bouchard, whose form has plummeted since the All England Club final. Britain's other guaranteed entrant, Jo Konta, faces Shahar Peer of Israel.

Replacements: Hanson, Cowan, Alexander, Skelton, McCalman, Higginbotham, Phipps, Foley. Pens: Beale (4) New Zealand: B. Smith, Jane, C. Smith, Nonu, Savea, Cruden, A. Smith, Crockett, Coles, O. Franks, Retallick, Whitelock, Kaino, McCaw, Read. Replacements: Mealamu, B. Franks, Moody, Luatua, Cane, Perenara, Barrett, Crotty. Pens: Cruden (4) Referee: Jaco Peyper (South Africa) Australia foiled New Zealand's bid to win an historic 18th consecutive Test as the Bledisloe Cup rivals played out a 12-12 stalemate at the ANZ Stadium. Steve Hansen's World Cup holders were heavy favourites to book their place in the history books and get their Rugby Championship campaign started with a win, but Australia maintained their recent resurgence to spoil the party. Under coach Ewen McKenzie the Wallabies were chasing an eighth consecutive win of their own and, although they rode their luck at times, they put consistent pressure on the All Blacks in slippery conditions. Kurtley Beale, given the nod at fly-half for the hosts, and Aaron Cruden kicked four penalties apiece to set up a tasty return clash next week. Things looked very different early on when the Wallabies, boasting seven players from Super Rugby champions the NSW Waratahs in their starting XV, were pushed on to the back foot almost immediately. It was hardly surprising when the early pressure led to a penalty and Scott Fardy was the guilty party at the breakdown as Cruden, who continued at fly-half despite calls for Beauden Barrett to start, slotted home to give the visitors a 3-0 lead after four minutes. Level best: Cruden's four penalties had the All Blacks in the lead for the majority of the game . Tough tackling: On a damp day there were plenty of big hits but not much running rugby . It could have been even worse for the Wallabies soon after as Aaron Smith pounced on a spill from Beale, but in greasy conditions Dan Coles fumbled his offload just short of the line. Beale kicked over a penalty of his own after a rare foray forward by the Wallabies, but Cruden then restored the All Blacks' three-point cushion before splitting the posts again to make it 9-3 as Australia's scrum began to creak. The maverick nature of Beale inspired a late first-half flurry from the hosts and a series of frenzied phases led to prop Wyatt Crockett being sent to the sin bin for repeated All Black infringing at the breakdown. Beale played for territory as the Wallabies pushed for a try, but he then hit the post with a subsequent penalty attempt as the visitors just about kept their six-point lead at the break. Friendly fire: Nic White and Israel Folau clash heads during the first half, leaving Folau with a bloodied nose . Intensity: The All Blacks dominated the first half after a rousing Haka in Sydney . Big hit: Richie McCaw stops Kurtley Beale, but the All Blacks were eventually undone by indiscipline . The Waratahs man did reduce the arrears to three shortly before Crockett returned in the second-half, and he and Cruden then traded penalties to make it 12-9 on the hour-mark. With 10 minutes left on the clock the momentum switched to the Wallabies and, with substitute Barrett sent to the bin for a professional foul, Beale kicked his side level with his final act of the day before being replaced by club team-mate Bernard Foley. Although the 14-men All Blacks desperately tried to find a way to get the win in the closing stages it was Australia, who have not won the Bledisloe Cup since 2002, fell just short of nicking it at the end themselves.","Honours even in opening 2014 Rugby Championship encounter .

"England’s bowling coach David Saker put it well when he described Jimmy Anderson as the most skilful bowler in the world. Some people objected to that: in their view, the best fast bowler in the game is Dale Steyn. But Saker chose his words carefully. In terms of skill, there is no one to match Anderson. I can’t think of any bowler I’ve played with or against, or have watched since I retired a decade ago, who can switch so easily from inswing to outswing — and without giving the batsman the slightest clue what he is doing. Performer: James Anderson is closing in on Sir Ian Botham's English Test wicket record . Some of the great swing bowlers — guys like Wasim Akram, Kapil Dev and Ian Botham — would probably tell you the way to bowl to a left-hander is to set him up for an lbw. But Anderson has often gone the other way, slanting the ball across. It’s an unusual approach for a swing bowler to take, but his record speaks for itself. The most amazing aspect of Anderson’s bowling is that he has never lost his wrist position while changing between inswing and outswing. Not only that, but he hides the change brilliantly. With most bowlers, you can read what’s going on. When he first came into the team, just before the 2003 World Cup, he would bowl full, swinging deliveries. But he changed over the years because he didn’t want to be one-dimensional. He learned to drag his length back on flatter pitches, and to hit the deck harder. His performance during the 3-1 win in Australia in 2010-11 was an outstanding example. Talks a good game: Bowling coach David Saker believes that Anderson is the best seamer in world cricket . Difference of the opinion: Many experts feel that South Africa's Dale Steyn is the best bowler in the world . Proud Lancastrian: Anderson uses any pent up aggression to snaffle plenty of Test wickets . The old Anderson would never have been able to do that. He was also a quiet lad — probably the quietest I’ve ever played with. But he’s grown in confidence and he’s realised that he has to make up for the fact that he doesn’t have the physical presence of guys like Courtney Walsh or Curtly Ambrose. So he’s had to make up for that with his body language and a few verbals. I don’t have a problem with that, as long as he doesn’t cross the line. Look at Steyn: he’s not shy of a word or two. If Anderson lost that aggression, I think he’d be half the bowler he is now. I rated him very highly right from the start — so highly, in fact, that I probably put him in a couple of situations I shouldn’t have. During our famous World Cup defeat by Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003, I should have handed the penultimate over to Andy Caddick, but I went with Anderson because of a gut feeling. Andy Bichel slapped him into the scoreboard, and later that evening I apologised to Anderson for putting him under so much pressure. Then, on his Test debut later that year against Zimbabwe, I set him a 7-2 off-side field, which forced him to bowl wider of off stump than he would have liked. I messed up. But in both cases, it was a show of my admiration for Jimmy. Look at the way he establishes holds over batsmen — be it Sri Lanka’s Lahiru Thirimanne earlier in the summer or Virat Kohli for India now. When he has it over you, he doesn’t let go. It’s remarkable to think how he’s progressed from the bloke who carried the drinks during the 2005 Ashes, when the Fab Four of Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones must have made him wonder whether he was ever going to crack it at Test level. Instead, he is on the verge of becoming the most successful England bowler of all time — and one of the most watchable operators in the world game.

"Manchester City aimed to put their Community Shield loss behind them as they trained ahead of their Premier League opener against Newcastle. Manuel Pellegrini's side were disappointing in their 3-0 defeat to Arsenal, but both the morale and the motivation appeared to have returned as they trained at Carrington. Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero were among a host of players unavailable to play on Sunday, but both were pictured training today and could play against Newcastle. The Chilean manager spoke about his squad, and what he thinks will be different this year. He told Sky Skports: 'Last year we were in a different position than now. Now maybe I know the players a little more. They know me, they know the way I want to play. VIDEO Scroll down for Manchester City stars suited and booted ahead of the new season . New boy: Pellegrini was pleased he had convinced Frank Lampard to join, calling him a 'very important player' Training: Pablo Zabaleta, David Silva, Frank Lampard and Micah Richards training at Carrington . 'I am happy with the squad because I think we are a stronger squad now than we were last year. 'Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Caballero, Frank Lampard and Eliaquim Mangala are five players that give us something very important in defence and I hope attacking-wise we will be the same as last year because we have four important strikers and good midfielders. 'Lampard is a very important player for us. He has a lot of experience, he is a very important English player. 'He had nothing to do until January with New York City – I proposed to him that he come here because I think he is a great player.' Pace: Jesus Navas played against Arsenal but Sergio Aguero was not considered fit enough . Meanwhile, Manager Pellegrini admitted he must trim his squad before adding any further recruits, as City fight to comply with Financial Fair Play constraints. Porto capture Eliaquim Mangala could be City's final summer signing unless the club can offload Sinclair and Guidetti, Pellegrini conceded. 'It's not finished, until the last day we can do different things,' said Pellegrini at the Premier League launch. 'But if you ask me at this moment if I am happy with the squad, yes I am very happy with my squad. Happy: There were rumours that Yaya Toure wanted to quit the champions but the Ivorian refuted them . 'We had a lot of problems also with Financial Fair Play with the restriction of the amount of players we can put in our squad. 'So maybe I don't think that we are going to sign another player because we cannot do it. 'We have maybe too many players in the squad at this moment, players that need to play, that's very important, especially for young players. 'John Guidetti or maybe Scott Sinclair, they may need to play in a different team, so we'll see from now until the end of the transfer window what happens with our squad. 'But at this moment, yes we have too many players.' Form: After Alvaro Negredo and Segio Aguero were injured last season, Edin Dzeko had a good run of form . Pellegrini has added Bacary Sagna, Fernando, Willy Caballero, Frank Lampard and Bruno Zuculini to the champions' squad, along with Mangala this summer. City expect to stay within the £49million spending limit imposed by UEFA for last term's FFP breaches, while Pellegrini is also mindful of sticking to the reduced 21-man squad cap. Feyenoord are understood to be keen on completing a permanent deal for 22-year-old Sweden forward Guidetti, who enjoyed a loan stint with the Dutch club in 2011-12. Sinclair joined Manchester City from Swansea in 2012, but has made just three starts in his two years at the Etihad Stadium. Competition: Joe Hart faces competition from Willy Caballero for his starting place this season . The 25-year-old admitted after Sunday's 3-0 Community Shield defeat to Arsenal that he would seek a move if he cannot secure regular first-team football. Refusing to prioritise the Champions League this term, Pellegrini said City cannot use FFP constraints as an excuse. 'It's easy to give excuses, but I don't like to do that,' he said. 'I'll always field the strongest team and we want to win every time we play, and in every competition. Retired: Samir Nasri, who has retired from international football, had a poor game against his former club . 'You don't have five or six teams in any other major league where any one of them can win the title. 'So the Premier League is still the most important league, and it's important for us also.' City start the defence of their Premier League title by facing Newcastle at St James' Park on Sunday. Pellegrini admitted he is yet to rule on whether to restore Joe Hart to his line-up after omitting the England goalkeeper from the Community Shield starting team. Argentinian keeper Caballero made his club debut in the Arsenal defeat at Wembley, after his summer move from Malaga. The City manager defended his rotation policy, claiming he has his players' best interest in mind rather than sheer ruthlessness. Action: Manchester City begin their title defence this weekend when they travel to Newcastle . 'The best way to have high performance is to have two competitive players in each position,' said Pellegrini. 'Nobody must be afraid of that: Joe Hart had a very good second part of the season last year. 'He's the best goalkeeper in England, but of course when he didn't play well last year we played (Costel) Pantilimon. 'It's impossible for a player to play 60 games in a year, to play 18 games during December and January as we did last season. 'It is sure that that player would be injured if that happened, so that's why it's so important to have two quality players in each position.

"Brendan Rodgers has said many British players fail at the top level because they are paid too much, too young in comparison to their peers from other countries. The Liverpool manager, whose side take on Southampton in their opening Premier League game on Sunday, thinks being part of the most high-profile league in the world, combined with the premium placed on British players by agents and clubs, is distorting young players’ expectations and killing their hunger. Rodgers made the points whilst discussing 19-year-old Raheem Sterling, insisting it is important the player is rewarded in a proportionate manner, to ensure he does not follow previous generations which have failed to develop after securing their first multi-million pound contract.

He got rewarded for that, and that will always be the case here with all the players. ‘But we just have to be careful because when you reward young players too quickly, you give them too much, too early, then that will be their downfall.

"Manchester United believe they have made a breakthrough in their attempts to land Holland international Daley Blind. Manager Louis van Gaal, who is also hot on the trail of Sporting Lisbon centre-back, Marcos Rojo, wants Blind to join his Old Trafford revolution. And United chiefs were last night growing increasingly confident of striking a deal with Ajax for the versatile Dutchman, who is valued at £20million. Presence: Blind impressed for Louis van Gaal's Holland during this summer's World Cup in brazil . The one that got away: Van Gaal had also been interested in Thomas Vermaelen, but Barcelona got their man . Van Gaal has been forced to look elsewhere in his pursuit of central defenders after Thomas Vermaelen chose Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund's refusal to consider selling Mats Hummels. Blind impressed in Holland's World Cup campaign under Van Gaal, and the new United manager wants the 24-year-old with him next season. Ajax manager Frank de Boer has admitted he is open to selling Blind this summer, saying: 'If he goes to a big club then he has definitely deserved it. 'But I think it would be better if he stays one year. Last year was a good year for him but I think he can improve a lot with us. Could move: Blind has admitted that a move to one of Europe's top clubs would be too good to turn down . Impressive: Blind, who scored against Brazil at the World Cup, could continue to improve at Ajax, said De Boer . Signing: Louis van Gaal wants to make Blind part of his Old Trafford revolution as soon as possible . 'If a club comes along with a lot of money it is almost impossible to say no. But we won’t let him go for free that is for sure. 'It is important for the player and the club that there is no tension or that it happens at the last minute.' Blind himself said: 'I am happy here in Amsterdam. But if there comes another club I will have to think about it and then we will see. I will think about my options. For now I will focus on Ajax and we will see what happens next week.'","Louis van Gaal wants to bring in Dutch midfielder .

"Manchester City want Vincent Kompany to finish his career at the club and will offer him a package totalling £60million for the privilege.

"Louis van Gaal admitted Manchester United’s confidence had been ‘smashed’ after his first Premier League game ended in a shock 2-1 defeat by Swansea. Gylfi Sigurdsson’s 72nd-minute strike inflicted Van Gaal’s first setback as United manager following six straight wins in pre-season as United lost a home opener for the first time in 42 years. ‘When you win everything in preparation time and lose your first match, that cannot be worse,’ he said. ‘We have built up a lot of confidence and then it will be smashed down because of this result.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with result . Falling short: Louis van Gaal trudges off the  pitch after Manchester United's defeat against Swansea . Disappointment: Ryan Giggs and Van Gaal look on frustrated as Manchester United struggled . Padding out: Van Gaal wrote plenty of notes on his iPad as Manchester United couldn't keep up with Swansea . The Dutchman was forced to give Premier League debuts to Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett, having made only two signings — Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw — all summer. Asked if the defeat highlighted the need for reinforcements, Van Gaal said: ‘I thought that before this match, so it’s no different. When we were playing in the United States I saw the same. Of course we need defenders. But you can’t say that, because we lost one game and we won all the others, that it’s the defence. It’s the team and how we played.’ In typical Van Gaal style, the Dutchman pulled no punches after the final whistle. The new United manager criticised his players for being nervous. He also said they lacked confidence and did not play as a team. In fact, the 63-year-old said his first official game in charge of the 20-time English champions was the stuff of nightmares. 'When you have preparation time and you win everything and your first match you lose, it cannot be worse, I believe,' Van Gaal said. 'It's a very bad day for us. It's very disappointing for the players, the fans, for me, and the staff.' Debut despair: Tyler Blackett made his first Premier League start for Manchester United against Swansea . Van Gaal swept into Old Trafford with a swagger after pre-season wins over a sextet of teams with 35 European trophies between them. But on a chilly afternoon in Manchester, United were brought back down to earth. Some of United's build-up play was slow, they lacked pace up front, and organisation at the back. Van Gaal's toughest task of his reign so far will be picking his men up for next week's trip to Sunderland. 'We have built up a lot of confidence and then it shall be smashed down because of this result,' Van Gaal said. 'We are not reaching our level. That's the main thing. Because of that we didn't play as a team.' Van Gaal claimed on Friday that Rooney struggled to handle the pressure of being Manchester United captain in Tuesday's friendly win over Valencia. Tall order: Chris Smalling was unable to prevent Manchester United losing and conceding two goals . The United manager thinks many more of his players buckled under the pressure of trying to make a positive start to the season following last year's dire showing under David Moyes. 'I saw a lot of players looking very nervous, making the wrong choices and that is a pity,' the former Barcelona coach said. 'These players have to forget that expectation because that is Manchester United. 'You have to cope with that pressure. That is also a process. 'But we have to know that it is only one game of many games. 'You shall not be the champion at this moment. You shall be the champion in May.' Swansea delight: Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates after scoring from close range . With nine players out through injury, Van Gaal handed debuts to Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard. The duo performed reasonably well, although Lingard had his afternoon cut short thanks to a tackle from Ashley Williams. The 21-year-old left the stadium on crutches and looks set for a spell on the sidelines. Van Gaal's men got off to the worst possible start when Ki turned home Sigurdsson square pass and the Icelandic international drove past David De Gea in the second half after accidentally being teed-up by Wayne Routledge's mis-placed shot. When asked whether he thought he needed to add new players to his squad, Van Gaal said: 'Yes, but I thought that before this match. 'I know in what positions we need better players. But you have to buy only when the player can fulfil the way of playing that I ask.' One plus-point for Van Gaal is that Robin van Persie is close to full fitness following his late return from the World Cup. 'We are now training with Robin for three weeks so the point that he can come in to the selection is closer now,' said Van Gaal, who left his compatriot out of his match day squad. Garry Monk was delighted to have led Swansea to their first league win at Old Trafford. The Swans are among the favourites to go down this year, but Monk thinks his team can go on to surprise a few more people. 'Nobody gave us a chance before the game, but we can be better than that,' the Swansea manager said. 'We can be sharper and improve in certain areas, but today we were right in many aspects, and we got the right result. 'I'm very pleased overall. We were very good today and showed a great attitude. Hopefully we can have more days like this.'","Manchester United slumped to defeat against Swansea at Old Trafford .

New report has found Australians are missing out on more than $2.5 billion in retirement savings because their employers are failing to comply with compulsory superannuation requirements. The Superannuation Guarantee Non-Compliance report, compiled by specialist management consulting firm Tria Investment Partners found workers who were affected by non-compliance, loss an average of $3750 per year. New report has found Australians are missing out on more than $2.5 billion in retirement savings . News.com.au reports the construction industry denies workers $341 million each year after failing to pay their employees 9.5 per cent each week.

Construction and building industry super fund, CBUS’s managing director David Atkin told news.com.au that the leakage problem with super being paid to employees would have catastrophic consequences on the nation’s economy. ‘It’s the cash economy, it’s sham contracting and it’s also a growing concern around insolvencies, leaking is able to occur,’ he said. ‘There is a growing problem and when those people move into retirement they will have less money to be able to fund their retirement. ‘That cost will fall back onto the public purse.’ Worst offender: The construction industry denies workers $341 million each year after failing to pay their employees 9.5 per cent each week . The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia is urging all Australians to take control of their own financial destiny and put in place the savings plans they need now, to deliver them financial freedom in retirement. While the current changes to super may be confusing, ASFA chief executive officer Pauline Vamos said now is the best time for workers to assess where they're at in terms of their retirement savings. ‘Despite the recent changes, the fact of the matter is superannuation remains the best deal in town when it comes to building your retirement savings,' she said. ‘Because it is a long-term investment, the earlier you start putting more into super, the more you will benefit from the effects of compounding interest. ‘Even just a few dollars extra a week could boost your retirement savings by thousands. ‘This is especially true for younger people, who could end up with up to seven dollars more in retirement for every dollar they put into super before the age of 30.’ *For a person aged 30 with a moderate investment option .

Ms Vamos added: ‘These small changes could give your super savings the boost they need to help you live your retirement with comfort and dignity.

"Fulham's woeful start to the season continued when they were thrashed 5-1 at Derby to pile the pressure on manager Felix Magath. His young side looked worryingly frail at the back and fell apart as Derby ran riot in the second half with Chris Martin scoring twice. Jamie Ward gave Derby a half-time lead and although Scott Parker equalised, Martin's double and strikes from Craig Bryson and Simon Dawkins made it a miserable day for relegated Fulham and Magath.

Ref: Oliver Langford (W Midlands) Despite losing the opening three games, Fulham made only one change while Derby made two with 34-year-old midfielder John Eustace coming in for his first appearance since March in place of Will Hughes. Given those poor results, it was not surprising that Fulham started nervously and Derby had a chance in the third minute when Cyrus Christie found Johnny Russell just inside the area but the Scot volleyed over. Parker's measured passing got the Londoners moving but Derby had another opening in the 13th minute when the ball dropped invitingly to Christie but he shot straight at Jesse Joronen from 15 yards. Fulham were being stretched by Derby's movement and in the 23rd minute, they were behind once again when Russell crossed from the right and Ward steered a volley from eight yards into the roof of the net. The visitors needed a spark of inspiration and Ross McCormack nearly supplied it in the 37th minute with a shot from just inside his own half which Lee Grant had to back-pedal to take under his crossbar. But Derby had been the better side and they came close to scoring again in the 51st minute when Ward crossed from the right touchline and Richard Keogh headed over from eight yards. Fulham had created little but they were level in the 54th minute when McCormack chipped the ball in and Ryan Williams laid it to Parker who placed a low shot from 15 yards inside Grant's right post.

"In the Barclays Premier League, the margins remain very fine. Here, Manchester City were not at their best but they won. Newcastle, on the other hand, began what may yet be a testing season competitively and earnestly but could not find way to bring a save from City goalkeeper Joe Hart. City's two goals were easy on the eye even if they were not generally in keeping with a performance that was more reliant on muscle than magic. VIDEO Scroll down for Pellegrini: This is a squad that can fight to win everything . Silva's goalden touch: Manchester City midfielder David Silva puts the champions in the lead with a cool finish .

Subs not used: Zabaleta, Caballero, Navas, Boyata. Goals: Silva 39, Aguero 90 . Booked: Silva, Demichelis, Kolarov, Kompany, Fernando . Man of the match: Vincent Kompany . Referee: Martin Atkinson . They were good enough, though, and that is the point. Many have tipped Chelsea to edge Manuel Pellegrini's team to the title. Certainly the London club will be stronger this season. Nevertheless, Pellegrini would appear to have bought astutely this summer leaving City stronger in two key positions, at the heart of their midfield and their defence. On Sunday they settled an interesting contest only in the second minute of added time and that period of play perhaps summed up the difference between the teams on this occasion. City looked rather short of complete fitness as the game wore on – something that Pellegrini alluded to later – and were under some pressure in the closing stages. When the lively Newcastle midfielder Remy Cabella provided an opportunity for Moussa Sissoko in the 90th minute, however, his team-mate could only direct a rather wild shot over the crossbar from 18 yards. A goal then and Newcastle would have had a point they probably deserved. As it was, City broke on Alan Pardew's team quickly and when the impressive debutant Fernando played Sergio Aguero in down the left, the substitute brought a parry from Tim Krul with his first shot and controlled the rebound well enough to find the far corner. Arguably, that chance was tougher than Sissoko's but it fell to one of the best goal scorers in the world and that, for managers trying to solve problems like Pardew, is the frustration. Up front for Newcastle was one of four starting debutants, the Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere. The 24-year-old ran hard and was game enough but looked limited. City, on the other hand, benefited from the expertise of Edin Dzeko – due to sign a new contract this week – and the gentle improvement of the gifted Stevan Jovetic. On occasions like this, it makes the difference. 'They have world class players everywhere,' said Pardew afterwards. 'At times they make it look like the world has stopped.' Early chance: Edin Dzeko connects with the ball in an attempt to give Manchester City the lead . Keeping it all square: Dzeko (No 10) is foiled by Tim Krul in the opening few minutes as St James' Park . Hand off: Samir Nasri (left) and Paul Dummett duel for the ball in the opening exchanges .

Getting used to new surroundings: Another Newcastle debutant, Remy Cabella (right), attempts to beat Gael Clichy . Certainly City produced an opening goal in the 39th minute that turned the Newcastle defence to stone. Prior to that the champions had played efficient football and Krul had saved competently from Dzeko in the third minute and from Samir Nasri's half volley soon after. In 23 season since the Premier League started, the title-holders have never lost and opening game - there have been 20 wins and three draws. The Dutch goalkeeper had little chance just before half-time, though. Yaya Toure's long pass found the Newcastle defence fractionally light on concentration but Dzeko's first time back heel in to the path of David Silva was testimony to perfect vision and technique and City's Spaniard found the corner comfortably. Up until this point, Newcastle had struggled to trouble City. Central players Vurnon Anita and Jack Colback were enjoying decent games and Cabella – another Frenchman – was already in to his stride, scampering across the dimensions of the field imaginatively. Newcastle couldn't find anything approaching a final pass, though, and as half-time arrived it already looked a long way back. City's intensity soon dropped, however. Physically, they were not the same team after the interval and Newcastle sough to profit. No stopping him: Silva goes clear of the Newcastle defence to slot home the opener for City .

As time passed, the home team certainly began to push City back. Cabella's influence increased and Pellegrini's team began to look for full-time if not desperately then certainly enthusiastically. Yoan Gouffran dallied over one chance from a corner before young left-back Paul Dummett beat Joe Hart to another cross only to head over the bar from seven yards. It was at the death, though, that City's defensive resolution was really tested and substitute Ayoze Perez looked certain to equalise after turning beautifully inside two defenders only for Fernando to apply a crucial defensive touch and divert the shot wide. Pardew called it an 'unbelievable tackle' and he wasn't wrong. Pellegrini, meanwhile, was happy to head in to next Monday's game at home to Liverpool with points already in the bag. 'I thought we played very well, especially in the first half,' said the City manager. 'In the second half, we did not have so much possession of our ball because seven of our ten outfield players were not really fit enough to last 90 minutes at the same pace. 'We only need to have the same attitude as we showed today and the same hunger for glory that we have started the season with to have a chance. 'I am sure this squad can fight for the title again.'

An impeccable and touching tribute was paid to the two Newcastle fans killed in the MH17 air disaster. Liam Sweeney and John Alder, who were on their way to watch their team in New Zealand, were remembered with a minute's silence, while captains Fabricio Coloccini and Vincent Kompany laid wreaths on the pitch and stood alongside family members during the tribute. Supporters then applauded for the duration of the 17th minute. It was only last season that Alan Pardew hurled an expletive-laden insult at Manuel Pellegrini. '****ing old ****' was his charming remark. This time, however, the pair shared a friendly handshake, kept their distance during the game and Pardew even invited Pellegrini for a glass of wine afterwards. Perhaps the best-timed run of the day came from a pitch invader who waited until the chaos of full-time before entering the field and making for Sergio Aguero. The City fan then enjoyed a 30-second conversation with his hero before security intervened. But whatever he said must have worked, for Aguero led the fan to the away dug-out where he was rewarded for his endeavour with a piece of training kit. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was at St James' Park having stayed away for the majority of matches last season. And it looked as if the billionaire was enjoying himself — TV pictures showed him laughing raucously with a pal despite his side trailing in the second half. Ashley  has been a target for fans in recent times, but he will be hoping their anger subsides this season after he provided Pardew with £40million to spend on new players.","Silva runs on to Edin Dzeko backheel to score the winner for City at St James' Park .

"The 12th Duke of Marlborough led mourners at the funeral of the 11th Duke, his father John Spencer-Churchill, at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire today. Jamie Blandford, 58, previously the Marquess of Blandford, walked arm in arm with his stepmother, his father's fourth wife Lily Mahtani, as they followed the 11th Duke's coffin carried by gamekeepers in plus fours into the church of St Mary Magdalene in Woodstock. Earlier, uniformed staff from the palace and estate workers bowed their heads as the horse-drawn carriage containing the Duke's coffin made its way through the parkland of the 11,500-acre estate to the private service. A flag bearing the family crest flew at half-mast over the palace, a Unesco World Heritage Site, and its formal gardens were closed today for the funeral, held just over a week after the 11th Duke died aged 88. Scroll down for video . Last journey: The horse-drawn carriage bearing the coffin of the 11th Duke of Marlborough left Blenheim Palace for the funeral today . Uniformed palace staff and estate workers bowed their heads as the funeral cortege passed on its way to the church in Woodstock . The 11th Duke's widow, Lily Mahtani, walked to the church arm in arm with his son and heir Jamie Spencer-Churchill, now the 12th Duke . After the service, the 12th Duke of Marlborough led the funeral procession as it followed the coffin back to Blenheim Palace on foot . The park remained open, however, and entrance charges were waived so that members of the public wishing to pay their respects could do so. Hundreds of people lined the streets of Woodstock to watch the funeral cortege pass by on its way to the church, where the new Duke of Marlborough gave a reading, as did his siblings Lady Alexandra, Lord Edward, and Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill. Sir Mark Weinberg also gave a tribute, and the Rector of the Benefice of Blenheim, Rev Canon Adrian Daffern, said the Duke was a 'man of authority, tempered by his humanity.' He added: 'He loved the estate and he loved this county.' After the service the coffin was carried out of the church to be taken back to the palace, followed by the funeral party on foot, with the 12th Duke at the front of the procession. The 11th Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani. His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.

The funeral procession passed lines of estate workers, local residents and tourists, who were allowed in free to pay their respects . Princess Margaret's 52-year-old son Viscount Linley, left, and billionaire Arpad Busson right, were among the mourners at Blenheim . The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born. During this time the 11th Duke and his son the Marquess of Blandford were estranged for more than 20 years, but in 2008, in a move largely credited to behind the scenes work by the Duke's fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, they were finally reunited after a reconciliation. Blandford and his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, who was said to have been a stabilising influence on him, moved into a farmhouse on the Blenheim estate and he was given a role developing the Blenheim farm shop. Today a spokesman at Blenheim Palace, which was was built in the 18th Century as a gift to the first duke, John Churchill, and was the birthplace of Winston Churchill, confirmed that the 12th Duke would also now inherit the estate. The Blenheim estate is one of Britain's most notable tourist attractions, and it was the Duke's life's work to preserve it for future generations. A gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, it was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession. Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke. The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year. Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it.

"John Wayne had a two-fisted image but heirs of the late movie star have lost a legal throw-down over use of his nickname, Duke. A federal judge in Southern California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that John Wayne Enterprises filed against Duke University in North Carolina. The two have squabbled since 2005 over use of the name. Duking it out: A federal judge in Southern California on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that John Wayne Enterprises filed against Duke University in North Carolina . The university objected last year when Wayne's heirs tried to register the name 'Duke' to market bourbon and other alcoholic beverages. Duke University said that could cause confusion and diminish its own trademark. Wayne Enterprises sued, calling the idea that consumers might confuse a top ten university with a bottle of booze 'ludicrous,' notes the Hollywood Reporter. The heir asked the judge to rule on the matter. Protracted battle: Wayne's heirs and the university have squabbled since 2005 over use of the name . Wayne Enterprises sued after Duke's trademark complaint over their application to call a bourbon 'Duke', calling the idea that consumers might confuse a top ten university with a bottle of booze 'ludicrous' But this week U.S. Judge David Carter in Orange County dismissed the suit. The judge determined that, since the university's filing did not specifically affect the state of California, his court had no jurisdiction. Now the Duke's heirs could potentially move their battle to Est Coast courts. However, John Wayne Enterprises had not spoken out about the dismissal as of Thursday morning.

"A variation on a virtual kidnapping scam that targeted immigrant families is now being tried against affluent parents in Texas and Oklahoma. Dr Clay Sigmon, a dentist from Del City, Oklahoma, told KFOR of receiving a phone call from a man claiming to be a Mexican cartel member who kidnapped his daughter. In a call like this, the gang member threatens to cut off the child's fingers and slit their throat unless they receive a cash ransom. Scared: A dramatization shows Dr Clay Sigmon receiving a call from supposed kidnappers who say they have his daughter . The next voice that is heard is that of a child crying, 'I don't know where I am. They've got me.' In all likelihood, though, these families' children safe and sound, and the voice on the other line belongs to a stranger. After he overcame the initial shock, Sigmon realized the voice of the girl crying on the other line was not his daughter and hung up on the hoaxer. Some have not been so quick, as the FBI in San Antonio say a dentist was taken for more than $1,000 recently, with another physician in Houston losing over $2,000. Red flags can signal the caller is not who they say they are. The FBI says calls come from a different area code and never from the victim's cell phone, and that scammers only take wire transfers. 'Virtual kidnappings' have their roots in Mexico, where scammers were able to play off the fear and paranoia caused by actual kidnappings taking place at the hands of cartels and corrupt police. Shocked: After overcoming the first few seconds of fear, Dr Sigmon realized the call was fake when he did not recognize the girl's voice on the other line . One investigation that led to arrests and criminal charges actually began as a real kidnapping, when a Fresno woman paid a $2,500 ransom to free her brother-in-law who had been abducted in Tijuana. Christian Science Monitor reports that after he had been freed, the kidnappers tried to go back to the well for more, and the woman reported the call knowing her brother-in-law was already safe. Police arrested a married couple at a 7-Eleven who were involved in the scheme, and later arrested four others for a scam that earned $500,000. In another variation in Washington, D.C., scammers told the families of Central American immigrants that their relatives had been kidnapped while crossing the border. Officials told the El Paso Times that  currently 'there is nothing to indicate' that the scams are tied to actual cartel activity.","Dr Clay Sigmon of Del City, Oklahoma, received a phone call from a supposed Mexican cartel member claiming he had kidnapped his daughter .

"Two Australian pilots have been arrested at gunpoint after being forced to land their light plane by two Indonesian fighter jets for allegedly 'violating' the country's airspace. Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when their light plane was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday. Military spokesperson, Major-General Fuad Basya, said the two men did not have permission to fly into Indonesian airspace and initially refused several requests to land, Fairfax Media reports. Graeme Paul Jacklin (front) and Richard Wayne MacLean (back) were taken into custody after being forced to land their light plane after allegedly 'violating' Indonesian airspace on Wednesday . Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time where they were met by snipers on the tarmac who had their rifles pointed towards the aircraft. Mr MacLean, from Burnside in South Australia, and Mr Jacklin from Brisbane were taken from the twin-propellor light aircraft - with the registration VH-RLS - and questioned. They remained in custody late on Wednesday for the alleged violation. Indonesian airforce spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said the plane came to their attention when it was flying over Timor-Leste - south of the Asian country. The pair were en route from Darwin to the Philippines to sell the plane when their aircraft was detected over Indonesian waters at 8am on Wednesday . 'The plane violated the official path around Saumlaki,' First Marshall Hadi told AAP, referring to a town in Maluku. 'Because they're civilians, the case will be under the authority of airport authorities. 'For now they can't fly, we're waiting until the results of this investigation.' Violating Indonesian airspace carries a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $200,000 fine, Fairfax Media reports. The pair, who are professional delivery pilots, were en route to Cebu in the Philippines to deliver the light plane after selling it. Mr MacLean had owned the aircraft since 2006. Mr MacLean and Mr Jacklin were taken from the twin-propellor light aircraft  and questioned . Richard MacLean's wife Kaye believes he would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job' His wife Kaye believes Mr MacLean would have known about obtaining the correct paperwork to fly over Indonesian waters as he 'ferries planes all around the world... it's his job'. 'I think there's a misunderstanding.' Colonel Hesly Paat, the Commander of Sam Ratulangi Military Air Base in Manado where their plane was forced to land, told News Corp he couldn't say what penalty the two Australians would face. Two Indonesian Air Force jets followed the plane and ordered the men to land in Manado shortly after 10.30am local time . He said Mr MacLean and Mr Jacklin were still under investigation, but they were not being detained as prisoners. Daily Mail Australia understands the Australian Embassy in Jakarta is in contact with Indonesian authorities to seek clarification on the circumstances. Consular officials have also made contact with the two Australians who were aboard the plane in order to offer consular assistance. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says she expects to get a briefing from Australian consular officials in Jakarta on Thursday. 'We are getting details from the mission in Jakarta,' she told Nine Network. 'We have no specific details of what the Indonesian authorities intend to do.'","Graeme Paul Jacklin and Richard Wayne MacLean were en route from Darwin to the Philippines when they were detected on Wednesday .

"The man suspected of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham will be considered for a psychiatric evaluation. Jesse Matthew, 32, appeared in Fairfax County Circuit Court today via video link for an unrelated rape case dating back to 2005. Addressing the prosecutor, his attorney James Camblos said he had reason to question Matthew's sanity. Scroll down for video . Psychiatric evaluation? Jesse Matthew will be considered for a sanity test as he faces sexual assault charges in a 2005 case. He is charged with intent to defile 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham . The judge took no immediate action on Camblos' request for a psychiatric evaluation at the arraignment on Friday morning but will address it at a later date. Matthew is charged in Fairfax with abduction with intent to defile, attempted capital murder and sexual penetration in connection with a September 2005 assault on a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax City. He is charged in Charlottesville with the abduction of Graham with the intent to defile, but is not yet facing murder charges. Authorities say they also have forensic evidence linking him to the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. Most of Friday's hearing, in which Matthew appeared via video hookup from the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, concerned who would represent Matthew. The judge appointed both the Fairfax County public defender and Camblos to represent Matthew as co-counsel, over the objections of Camblos and Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh. Matthew requested that Camblos, who is representing Matthew in the Graham case, be appointed to handle the Fairfax case as well. 'I would prefer Mr Camblos to be my attorney, if possible. I've built a relationship with him,' Matthew said, with Camblos at his side at the Charlottesville-area jail. Cases: Jesse Matthew is linked to the disappearances of Hannah Graham (left) and Morgan Harrington (right) Discovered: Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave in this abandoned property in mid-October . Camblos objected to the idea of serving as co-counsel with the Fairfax public defenders, saying it would amount to 'two chiefs, not enough Indians.' Morrogh objected on the basis that it would be a waste of taxpayers' money to have both appointed. But the judge, Dennis Smith, said the two ought to be able to work together, and bringing both onto the case should ensure that the trial is not delayed. He said the law requires the public defender be appointed except in unusual circumstances. There was clearly some tension between Camblos and the public defender's office — after both were appointed, Camblos told the judge Chief Public Defender Todd Petit had offered to allow Camblos to serve as lead counsel in the event both were appointed. Petit told the judge he had indeed made such an offer, but Camblos had rejected it and Petit now wanted his deputy, Dawn Butorac, to serve as lead counsel. The judge said he would leave the two of them to decide who would be lead. Search: The search for the 18-year-old went state-wide with multiple law enforcement agencies . Butorac declined comment after Friday's hearing. Another hearing was set for November 14 to set a trial date. After Friday's hearing, Morrogh said he will continue to consult with prosecutors in the Charlottesville area to determine which case should go to trial first, and that he is prepared to go first or last. He said that, ideally, he'd like the trial to be able to go forward within six months. He said the victim in the 2005 assault is no longer in the country, but is cooperating with investigators and will be available to testify at trial. Graham, an 18-year-old sophomore, went missing in Charlottesville September 13. After a month-long search, her remains were found in mid-October.

"Three quarters of men in Britain will be overweight or obese by 2030, a study has warned. The figures are slightly lower in women yet still of concern – nearly two thirds will be overweight or obese within the next 15 years. At present, 70 per cent of men and 59 per cent of women  are considered too fat, including 26 per cent in both sexes who are obese. In all countries, men tend to be fatter than women. Ireland has by far the worst projection - an alarming 58 per cent of men will be obese in 15 years' time . But this will steadily rise over the coming years as the population ages – from their forties adults gain an average of between 0.5 and 1 kilos (1.1 to 2.2 lb) a year. British researchers used a computer model to predict the percentage of men and women who will be overweight or obese across Europe in 2020 and 2030. Obesity prevalence was generally higher in men in all countries and Ireland had by far the worst projection - an alarming 58 per cent of men will be obese in 15 years’ time. This was closely followed by Greece, at 38 per cent, the Czech Republic, 35 per cent, and the UK, 33 per cent. But when the figures include those who . are classified as overweight, 90 per cent of Irish men - and 84 per cent of women - will be either . obese or overweight. In the UK, three quarters of all men will be either, as will eight out of ten Czech, Spanish and Polish men. The slimmest men in Europe will be in Belgium or The Netherlands, with 44 per cent and 47 per cent either obese or overweight. But in Romania, one of Europe’s poorest nations, only 10 per cent of women will be obese compared to Ireland’s 47 per cent. Ireland - 58 per cent . Greece - 38 per cent . Czech Republic - 35 per cent . UK - 33 per cent . Belgium - 15 per cent . Netherlands - 15 per cent . Lead researcher Dr Laura Webber, from the UK Heart Forum, an umbrella group of heart charities, said there was ‘little evidence’ of a plateau in obesity despite Government measures to tackle the problem. ‘Our study presents a worrying picture of rising obesity across Europe. Policies to reverse this trend are urgently needed.’ Dr Webber said her study – presented at the European Society of Cardiology’s Europrevent conference in Amsterdam – may underestimate the problem by not accounting for the increase in obesity in children. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum said: ‘The good news is that the United Kingdom yields to Ireland the title of being the fattest in Europe but obesity is a tragedy for both countries. ‘The policies that Dr Webber urgently demands are still nowhere in sight in our islands and, unfortunately for the UK. 'Though Westminster is fond of telling us that things are improving, it is only in certain areas. In the main, the fat are getting fatter and to stop the rise, we need regulated markets. ‘Obesity . will not be solved unless the root causes of the epidemic are addressed . and we're only just beginning to look for them. The projections for . 2030 look inevitable’ From their forties, adults gain an average of between 1.1 to 2.2 lb (0.5 to 1 kilo) a year, the researchers say . Earlier this week a think-tank warned that diseases caused by lifestyle such as obesity will ‘bankrupt’ the NHS within a decade. The report by Respublica estimated that the cost of treating heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers would leave the health service with a £19 billion annual funding gap. And in January, a major report by the National Obesity Forum warned that the problem could be far worse than previously thought as experts had not factored in how much fatter we get with age. It blamed blames junk food firms for confusing the public about healthy eating and accused ministers and GPs are failing to get a grip of the problem. The forum - which comprises doctors and other experts – also accused the Government of focusing too much on prevention rather than helping those who are obese lose weight.","Ireland will be the fattest nation in Europe, with 90% of the population an unhealthy weight - 58% of men will be obese and 32% overweight .

"Drug smuggler Kevin Hanley, 52, from Fulham, south west London, has been jailed for more than 17 years after he was caught in a sting in a pub in Athens . Britain's most wanted drugs baron who brought drugs into the country hidden in consignments of fruit has been jailed for more than 17 years. Kevin Hanley, 52, who was considered the 'top, top man' in the drugs world, was also the brains behind plots to deal kilos of cannabis and amphetamines and launder millions of pounds in cash, a court heard. The Old Bailey was told that Hanley, of Fulham, south west London, had been the key lieutenant of 'Mr Big' Brian Brendan Wright, an Irish gangster known as the Milkman because he always delivered. After Wright was brought down by a massive police operation, and sentenced to 30 years in jail in 2007, Hanley set up an international trafficking ring. He used a wholesale food business in London's Covent Garden market as a front for the transportation of Venezuelan cocaine by lorry from southern Europe to Britain, hiding £5million of cocaine inside watermelons and pomegranates. Hanley's new venture was finally broken up in 2012 after a surveillance operation led to the arrest of his gang and the seizure of £2.5m of cocaine and £2m in cash. His safe house in Chelsea was raided by police, but Hanley escaped and went on the run with his Greek television presenter lover, Chrysi Minadaki. But Hanley was caught in a sting eight months later when, in Greece last July he was lured to an Irish pub in Athens to watch the British and Irish Lions in their rugby triumph over Australia on television. Following his extradition back to Britain, Hanley pleaded guilty to the drug smuggling conspiracy and yesterday was sentenced to 17 years and four months in jail. Minadaki, 45, and grocer John Fowler, 58, who acted as his right-hand man, were jailed for 17 years and 16 years respectively. All three were convicted of plotting to supply heroin, amphetamines and cannabis, as well as money laundering. Associates Mathew Edward, 49, and Richard Harrison, 58, who plotted the distribution of cocaine to Scotland, were jailed for six years and ten months and five years and six months respectively. The court heard that Hanley had been jailed for drug smuggling before, but within months of his release licence expiring, he had tracked down a source of cocaine in Venezuela. He then used Fowler's fruit and veg business as a front to bring the drugs into Britain via Greece. Greek television presenter Chrysi Minadaki, 45, was Hanley's lover and she helped source the fruit and veg . Minadaki provided the lorries and the fruit as a cover for the drug smuggling, and the gang was working on plans to hide drugs in loads of strawberries, cauliflowers and broccoli when the police caught them. Acting on a tip off after a separate drug ring in Scotland was smashed, officers raided Fowler's flat in Chelsea in November 2012, and found £2.5million of cocaine, £200,000 of amphatemines, £61,000 of skunk cannabis, more than £2million in cash, and two cash counting machines. Judge Wendy Joseph QC told Hanley: 'You were known to be at the top of your illegal trade, and were described as a 'top, top man'. It is you who has drawn everybody together in this web of trafficking. 'The really seriously aggravating feature is you have been before the courts before for drug related matters. Grocer John Fowler, 58, left, was jailed for his part in the smuggling, while Hanley's former boss, 'Mr Big' Brian Brendan Wright, right, who is serving 30 years in jail, was known as the Milkman because he always delivered . She explained: 'Between June and September 2012 large quantities of watermelons were supplied by Greece, followed by pomegranates. This would have been followed by strawberries, cauliflower and broccoli. 'It was a continual stream of lorries coming into this country, very largely through the efforts of Chrysi Minadaki at the Greece end.' Judge Joseph told her: 'I am told you have had a glittering career in the Greek media. You described a high flying lifestyle in which you earned millions of Euros and mixed with the great and good of Greek life. 'What you did was to provide the Greek link by which Hanley covered his true activity.'","Kevin Hanley, 52, of Fulham, south west London, ran large smuggling gang .

"Kerry Bailey, 36, fell to her death from a colliery pit wheel after an eight-year alcohol addiction . A drunk mother-of-two fell to her death from a colliery pit wheel after she failed to give up alcohol despite a stint in the Priory. Kerry Bailey, 36, had called her husband at work to tell him she loved him before she vanished from the family home in Boothstown in Salford, Greater Manchester. Her body was found four days later by a visitor at the former Astley Green Colliery near Wigan, which is now a museum, an inquest heard. Mrs Bailey had temporarily moved out of her family home and checked into a rehabilitation unit in a bid to kick her eight year addiction to vodka. But after checking out in February this year, she secretly began drinking again and confided in a parent at her daughter’s school that she could ‘no longer go on’. The hearing at Bolton Coroner’s Court was told Mrs Bailey, a former kickboxer, had turned to drink after being taunted by a tough childhood. She had been taken out of school when she was 14 to help bring up her five brothers and a baby when their father walked out. She later married her childhood sweetheart Derek Bailey, 37, and had two children – Joe, 15 and Jade, 12. But the inquest heard she would hide her problems from her family due to her ‘not saying anuthing to anyone, you keep it in here’ upbringing. Mr Bailey said over the past eight years her drinking had worsened and she had tried self-harming on numerous occasions whilst intoxicated, including taking overdoses and throwing herself from a balcony at their home. She was later seen by a psychiatrist and was admitted to the Priory and moved away her husband and the children to ‘get herself back to square one’. When she returned earlier this year she appeared to be improving and stayed sober, throwing herself into her work as a carer and doing 12 hour shifts – with colleagues describing her as ‘the best carer they had ever had’. Her condition deteriorated in May when Mr Bailey went to Spain for a pre-arranged weekend, leaving his wife to look after their children whilst his parents checked on her. He phoned home to learn she had taken them to Blackpool and although Mrs Bailey insisted she was fine, her husband sensed something was wrong and when he spoke to his son put ‘two and two together’. When he got back he found a bottle of vodka and discovered his wife had ‘upset’ the children after taking the opportunity to drink while he was away. The following evening the couple attended an event at their daughter Jade’s school and whilst there Mrs Bailey had disclosed to fellow parent, Teresa Fitzgerald, that she had ‘had enough’. Mr Bailey told the hearing: ‘I had gone for a cup of coffee and Teresa was making chit chat, she said “Teresa I have just had enough of this life”. Teresa said: “You have got your children” but she said “Derek is more than capable of looking after them”. Kerry loved them more than anything in the world.’ When Mr Bailey confronted his wife about her drinking the next morning she denied it. ‘She upset us again, the trust again had gone and that was the argument,’ he added. Astley Green Colliery museum near Wigan where Mrs Bailey's body was found on May 25 this year . She had phoned her husband to say she loved him before she went missing and was found four days later . ‘She said “why are you being so cool with me”. I said “Kerry you are drinking again”. She denied it.’ Later he got a call from her whilst they were both at work where Mrs Bailey told her husband ‘you will be burying me next week.’ Mr Bailey told the hearing: ‘She said “Derek I have had enough of this life, I love you but this is the last time you are going to speak to me”.’ He immediately rushed home from his job as a garage boss but found she had already left where a neighbour said she spotted her leaving the house at about 2pm. The coroner recorded an open verdict and said it is not known how she came to fall from the wheel . Despite a police search and a public appeal for information about her whereabouts the care worker was not found until four days later on May 25, this year, when a visitor spotted her body lying face down in long grass. The inquest heard she bought a small bottle of vodka from the Costcutter store and less than an hour after she was seen leaving the house she was spotted climbing up to the colliery wheel. Tests showed Mrs Bailey was more than three times the drink driving limit at the time of her death. Her black rucksack along with a half bottle of vodka was found at the scene. Recording an open conclusion, Coroner Mr Alan Walsh told Mr Bailey it was likely his wife had consumed ‘much more’ alcohol than the half bottle of vodka and it would have impacted on her co-ordination. He said: ‘I believe she found that support in alcohol and tried to overcome some of her problems with alcohol and some of her thoughts by the use of alcohol. ‘All the attempts of self-harm occurred while under the influence of alcohol. ‘It’s not known how she came to fall. She may have jumped, she may have fallen. What we do know is that she was under the influence of drink and in a condition where co-ordination is reduced. ‘I’m not sure at that time she had sufficient capability to make a judgement to take her own life. It would be speculative. ‘I don’t believe you could have done any more than you did. Sadly she found some support in drink and sadly that drink was her destruction.’","Kerry Bailey, 36, called husband to say she loved him before she vanished .

"Liverpool is always very special to me because of John, and I love London, of course. But now I have added Folkestone to my list of special places. It's very surprising to me! I was invited to visit because I have artworks in the Folkestone Triennial 2014. I thought I was coming to a sleepy little town, but I found this amazing energy, so much activity - a kind of spiritual rising. It's not just a beautiful place; it also has an incredible history linked to the First World War.A . A new vision: Yoko Only gazes across the waterfront in Folkestone on her first visit to the Kent port-town . I went to pay my respects at the new Memorial Arch, and I think it's so powerful. It was dedicated by Prince Harry in August to the fallen soldiers and nurses who walked down Remembrance Road to the harbour to go to war. There are crocheted red poppies on the railings lining the road, and it's very moving. All the artworks from the Triennial are placed around the town, and they are part of daily life, instead of being a show in a museum. So you see them when you're shopping or walking on your way to work, it's very casual. Folkestone is a town that wants the world to know that it likes art, that it is sensitive to art, and I wanted to promote that idea. I am invited to art events around the world, but I wanted to go to Folkestone because I believe in localisation, and I wanted to wave the flags for them. Bright and beautiful: Folkestone shows its arty side in the studios, galleries and shops of its Creative Quarter . I made Earth Peace, one of my installations, to acknowledge the debt owed to those who died in the wars of the last century. The words are on a billboard by the railway station, and on a flag at the Grand hotel. There is also a light spelling out 'Earth Peace' in Morse code. I wanted to acknowledge the soldiers who died in the First World War. I saw old photos of them in a wonderful exhibition, Folkestone During The War, organised by the local History Society. I had gone to the Folkestone Library to see my other installation, Skyladder 2014, and when I went up the stairs I discovered the exhibition. I learned that, during the First World War, the people of Folkestone took in 115,000 Belgian refugees who arrived by boat and were welcomed and treated very well. It was much more than double the population - how did they manage? That was quite something in those days. I found it moving. In fact I was welcomed here myself once before, in 1966. It was the year I met John, and I came to the Metropole Arts Centre for what they now call performance art. It was very avant-garde and I didn't think anybody would understand it, but people here showed me smiles, and that was a sign for me. There is something special about a town by the water. The sea air is very good for your health. John's Aunt Mimi used to live at the seaside. When John became halfway successful, he bought a beautiful house for her at Poole in Dorset, overlooking the ocean. As a child in Japan, I had a very special situation, because my mother had a summer house at the seaside in Kamakura. Now I live in New York, but Manhattan is an island, surrounded by water. In Folkestone, there is a wonderful fish restaurant, Rocksalt, where I had a fabulous squid lunch. The setting by the harbour is amazing. Pretty persuasion: Yoko praises Folkestone for its 'amazing energy', and says it could 'cleanse your spirit' Over lunch we were discussing the fact that the guy who designed the CND peace sign, Gerald Holtom, is buried near here. He must have an incredibly strong vibe, and with all the vibrations of the other beautiful people I thought: 'No wonder!' I went there to give energy and it was the other way round! I got a lot back. It was a spiritual exchange, extremely positive, and it made me happy. Visit Folkestone… it could cleanse your spirit. Yoko Ono was talking to Nina Myskow. The Folkestone Triennial 2014 (www.folkestonetriennial.org.uk) runs until November 2.","Widow of John Lennon visited the town for the Folkestone Triennial event .

"Qantas is going ahead with plans to dump more than half of its life rafts from Boeing 737 planes to save money on fuel consumption. The airline, which will start making the changes this week, says 'it is about being smarter' and has denied the move will make the planes less safer. Half the planes in the 72 batch fleet will have the life rafts removed. They are flights which do not fly over long stretches of water and only go between Australian capital cities. Qantas fitted all their Boeing 737 with life rafts in the nineties but are now removing the rafts from the half the fleet which don't travel over water . Sharna Rhys-Jones, a spokesman for Qantas, explained that the airline had life rafts fitted to all the 737's in the 1990's to avoid the time and difficulty for engineers involved in loading rafts on and off planes. Before that the life rafts were put in manually depending on whether the planes were flying over water or not. She said the new approach was 'about being smarter' and it would help save money on fuel consumption as the planes would be lighter. Mike Plottel, Qantas’ Head of Safety, explained the planes that don't fly over water don't need the rafts . Mike Plottel, Qantas’ Head of Safety, said: 'The majority of our Boeing 737s operate between Australian mainland cities and don’t fly over long stretches of water, so rafts simply aren’t required even as a precaution. 'This approach is the midpoint between two policies we’ve had in the past, which saw us taking rafts on and off as needed or keeping them on every aircraft no matter where it was flying. 'Our 737s that fly over long stretches of water will continue to be fitted with life rafts – for example Trans-Tasman flights that go to New Zealand. 'The simple rule of thumb is that all Qantas aircraft that need to carry life rafts, which is all of our international aircraft and about half of our B737s, will have them onboard.' 'We would never implement any change that would compromise CASA’s and Qantas’ strict safety standards.' The move, which applies to planes that travel less than 400 nautical miles out to sea, has attracted criticism from ­independent senator Nick Xenophon and some Qantas pilots and crew. Qantas says the new move is about maintaining a 'high level of safety while being smarter' Senator Xenophon called for the airline to abandon the plan after hearing safety concerns from staff that people could die of hypothermia if a plane went down over water within the limit, reported The Australian. Mr Plottel added: 'This is about us maintaining Qantas’ high level of safety while being smarter with the way we operate our flights. 'In the past we installed life rafts on all our B737’s, even if they didn’t operate over water. 'Now, we are separating them into two categories –ones that fly over water and ones that don’t – and allocating them appropriately.' Similar plans are being implemented by competitor Virgin Australia and six Jetstar A321 aircraft. CASA said the Qantas decision was in accordance with international rules incorporated into Australia’s air-safety regulations. A spokesman told The Australian “These international stand­ards permit flights out to 400 nautical miles or 120 minutes’ flight time, whichever is less, from land without the carriage of life rafts for certain aircraft.'","Qantas will start removing half the life rafts from its fleet of Boeing 737 planes this week .

"The curse: The World Boxing Council has decided to shorten women's bouts... because of periods . The World Boxing Council, one of the four major organisations which sanctions championship boxing bouts, has decided to shorten women's bouts... because of periods. In a statement published on its website, the Mexico City-based non-profit said its first World Female Convention decided to shorten championship bouts from 12 rounds to just 10. At the same time the WBC decided individual rounds should last no longer than two minutes, as opposed to the three-minute rounds of men's competition. Menstruation was given as one of four key reasons why women's boxing matches should not last as long as men's, a list based on 'several facts ... reported during the convention which are of total concern.' The change from three-minute rounds to two-minute rounds brings the professional women's game in line with amateur boxing, including Olympic boxing, where both men and women fight shorter rounds. The WBC said that any promoter staging 12-round fights for women ran the risk of fighters suffering 'severe injuries' and that it would refuse to sanction any women's fight lasting more than 10 rounds. 'Several facts were reported during the convention which are of total concern regarding any changes of the 10 x 2 female boxing matches,' the WBC's statement said. 'Women are physically inclined to have concussions, much more than men. 'A female fighter used to fight 10 x 2 which is 20 minutes, would need tremendous effort to adjust to 12 x 3 which is 36 minutes. 'Menstrual cycle has tremendous impact on the body of a woman, including 12 hormones which act in the body system, creating radical changes in several areas. 'Women's endurance has been proven to be less than men. Marathon running time is much different between male and female.' Cancan Ren of China takes a hard right from Nicola Adams of Great Britain during the women's boxing Flyweight final of the 2012 London Olympic Games at the ExCel Arena in London, England . The organisation has come under fire online for failing to come up with any facts to back up its claims. D'Arcy Maine, a blogger for ESPNW, wrote: 'Actual evidence is overrated, right? For the record, the women’s marathon record (2:15:25) is less than 13 minutes slower than the men’s record (2:03:23), so I’m not sure that’s much of a reason to take such a drastic measure. 'But what do I know? I’m just a woman, who probably lacks the thinking skills to understand this due to all those pesky hormones.' London-based boxing trainer Winston Newton trains both men and women at his Gym London South. He called suggestions that women weren't capable of fighting as hard as men 'rubbish'. 'In my opinion, women train just as hard as men,' he said. 'They only getting punished by another female, they're not getting pummelled by a man. 'It's all relative if you are getting hit by another female that's jus t the same as you. Hopefully, at the end of the day, it just boils down to skill.'","WBC decides women should fight for only 10 two-minute rounds .

"Many of us will have suffered the disappointment that comes with discovering than an online date is not all they seemed. However some reactions can be more extreme than others. In a recent study it was revealed that the number one fear that women have about dating online is that they will meet a serial killer. For men, it is that their date will be fat. This shocking statistic prompted the men behind the dating website Simple Pickup to conduct a social experiment to see if men really are as shallow as the study claimed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A usually slim Sara dressed up in a fat suit and attended five Tinder dates as part of a social experiment . Jesse and Kong asked their slim blonde friend Sara to set up a few dates using her Tinder profile. Tinder is a dating app where strangers who are in close proximity can 'like' a profile by swiping right. If the person in the profile swipes right too then the couple are able to chat via the app. Sara, 24, whose profile contains images of her petite frame in a bikini, had no problem securing five dates for the experiment. Sara worked with dating website Simple Pickup to test her dates' reaction when she turned up to their date several stone heavier than they anticipated . In her Tinder profile images, Sara appeared slender showing off her svelte figure in a bikini . Sara's original tinder profile managed to fetch her five dates who were all keen to leave once they saw her in her fat suit . However, Sara looked completely different when she turned up to meet her potential suitors. Ahead of the date, with the help of make-up and prosthetics, Sara transformed her slender body into that of an overweight woman complete with bingo wings and a double chin. Sara then waited for her dates at the agreed location surrounded by secret cameras ready to video the reactions of her dates. Sara agreed to take part in the experiment after a study found that men's worst fear about online dating is that their date will turn out to be fat . While some of the men attempted to hide their disappointment and engage in polite conversation at first several weren't shy when it came to pointing out Sara's flaws. Every single man featured in the video remarked on Sara's appearance, ranging from the polite 'you look a little different than your photo' to one brazen man telling her she appeared more voluptuous and even asking if she was pregnant. One man asks Sara how long it has been since she had her picture taken and Sara remarks that it's 'not super old' and had been taken six months ago. The cheeky actress plays on the men's obvious confusion and when they remark on how different she appears she reacts with sarcastic remarks. Sara underwent a huge transformation using make-up and prothestics . She tells one date that he is the first person to point out how different she looks and says to another that her new lipstick might be the reason for her altered appearance. Certain men take her deception a little more personally than others with one particularly upset date telling Sara that 'he doesn't appreciate people lying to' him before leaving. In total four out of the five men come up with a reason for them to leave the date. Out of the five dates that Sara invited only one (pictured) lasted the date with others making excuses to leave such as being married or needing the toilet . They range from the reasonable, with one man saying that he 'can't do this' because it wasn't what he expected, to the sneaky -  with another date hot footing it to the bathroom and never returning, ending in the completely absurd with one man claiming that he overlooked that fact that he is actually married. Despite having several dates lined up Sara only manages to keep one at her table and he is the only one who discovers Sara's true identity. When the 24-year-old confesses that the entire date has been part of a social experiment he seems somewhat relieved if a little shocked. The polite date says 'well I try to be nice' before adding 'sucks to be them' when finding out that the four other men had abandoned Sara. NOW SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE ROLES ARE REVERSED . After the shocking results of their first experiment the men behind Simple Pickup couldn't resist trying it again with the genders swapped. And the results couldn't be more different . Operating under the same structure as the original set-up, this time Willy, 28 would take on the role of the fat date. As with Sara, when Willy's dates first meat him they are a little taken a back pointing out that he appears rather different from his profile. However, unlike the men who met Sara the women who meet Willy seem happy to go along with the date. One of his dates tells Willy that she 'loves all men' and she 'doesn't discriminate as it's like having a smorgasbord.' Only one of the women seems genuinely upset by Willy's deception refusing to believe that Willy could be the same man she had been talking to on Tinder, he explains his different appearance with the fact that his pictures are two to three years old. Unlike Sara, whose dates couldn't be keener to leave the uncomfortable situation, the women who meet Willy are happy to stay for a chat and Willy even manages to secure several second dates with one of the girls asking him to a farmers market. One particularly eager lady is so keen on Willy she ends their date with a kiss. Have you had a nightmare Tinder dating experience?

"In a bid to counter the soaring popularity of short term accommodation websites, the NSW council have started handing out over $1 million to those offering unregistered rooms on sites like Airbnb. Residents are reporting being contacted by the local council because the accommodation they offer is not a legitimate bed and breakfast. Others have requested home owners become meet these standards in order to continue renting rooms-a process which often includes expensive renovations like fitting commercial kitchens. Some of the rooms offered in Airbnb in Sydney: Since launching in 2008, Airbnb has since amassed over 500,000 listings in 33,000 cities and 192 countries . Councils in NSW are tightening up on sites like Airbnb by issuing hefty fines to those who offer unregistered rooms, pressuring them to register with their local council . Since launching in 2008, Airbnb has since amassed over 500,000 listings in 33,000 cities and 192 countries. But the rapid rise to prominence has seen a phenomenon that has been deemed as 'growth pains.' According to an American study from Skift, Airbnb has made 'local municipalities eager for tax revenue, either in the form of income tax from the owners who use the site or from Airbnb based on arguments that it acts more like a hotel offering inventory than a classified advertising site. This week, a study from Fairfax shows this phenomenon appears to have reached Australia, with local councils tightening up on unregistered rooms. Newton local Lynn Statton said her local council told her 'If we approve you as a bed and breakfast you can in the future serve hot breakfast and you'll be needing a hygienic commercial kitchen.' Statton typically offered fruit, muesli and bread for guests to help themselves-rather than a hot breakfast. She said her council said 'there's not much cooking involved there.' The registration costs and revenue tax varies from council to council. But the fines for continuing to rent unregistered short term accommodation are becoming ubiquitously severe. One resident called Shauna, who chose to keep her full name disclosed, told Fairfax she was contacted with a letter warning she has 10 days to say why her council should not take legal action against her, and that she is facing fines of f $1.1 million plus an additional $110,000 a day. Planning Minister Pru Goward said NSW council has 'not caught up with the rapid development of the collaborative consumption market led by companies like Airbnb' 'It was quite a shocking letter to get. I immediately saw $1.1 million and thought 'what am I going to do?' ' 'I feel like they're making the rules up as they go along because they have no clear guidelines yet,' Sam McDonagh, Airbnb's country manager for Australia and New Zealand, argued the framework in NSW  was not as clear as in other states. 'Queensland and Victoria both already have clear rules that allow people to rent out their homes for any period of time,' he said.

"Sacked: Mrs Haydr was unfairly dismissed by Tameside General Hospital, Greater Manchester, in 2013, following accusations from colleagues . A nurse who raised concerns over the standard of patient care at a  hospital was forced out of work after colleagues launched a smear campaign against her, a tribunal has found. Jean Haydr, 48, was set to be promoted to senior nurse at Tameside General Hospital, Greater Manchester when she was sacked in 2013 following false allegations by other nurses. 'Jealous' colleagues wrongly accused Mrs Haydr, who was described as a 'committed and competent' nurse, of turning up to work smelling of alcohol and of 'violating patients' dignity'. Mrs Haydr, from Dorylsden, Greater Manchester, claimed that she was dismissed for raising concerns over the standard of patient care at the hospital, where she had worked for 12 years. Now an employment tribunal has found that the mother-of-three had a 'difficult relationship' with her colleagues, who had 'professional jealousies' about her promotion. One colleague who claimed that Mrs Haydr had mocked a patient by putting a sticky note on their back that had 'loser' written on it later admitted that she never saw the word on the note. While an allegation that Mrs Haydr had taunted a patient by drawing fish and chips on a plate instead of giving him food was dismissed as 'light-hearted banter' with a patient with whom she enjoyed a 'good relationship'. The tribunal also found that accusations that Mrs Haydr arrived late for work while smelling of alcohol and that she made threats of physical violence were unfounded. However, it did find that Mrs Haydr breached social media policy by 'discussing trust business' on Facebook - but ruled that she should not have been dismissed without notice or payment in lieu. The hearing concluded that Mrs Haydr was unfairly dismissed because of accusations from colleagues who 'did not like' her. Mrs Haydr said that she was relieved her ordeal was over. 'Committed': Mrs Haydr had worked at Tameside General Hospital for 12 years and was set to be promoted to senior nurse when she was sacked. The tribunal found that other nurses had 'professional jealousies' But she said the ongoing tribunal had left her out of work, 'blacklisted' by the NHS and struggling to look after her three children. It is understood she wants to return to nursing. A spokesman for Tameside Hospital said the trust was 'disappointed' with the outcome. He said: 'We feel that we acted appropriately at the time of the incidents in 2013 and Mrs Haydr was dismissed in line with the trust's disciplinary policy. 'Since Mrs Haydr's dismissal in 2013 we have already reviewed our disciplinary policy and procedure and will take further learning from this case.'","Jean Haydr had worked at Tameside General Hospital for 12 years .

"Actor Stephen Collins could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007 according to the latest allegations made by his estranged wife. Collins famously starred as the Reverend Eric Camden in the TV series 7th Heaven and according to Faye Grant, her husband used the celebrity that came with that role to gain the trust of two parents so he could sexually abuse their child. The hit show ran from 1996 until 2007, which means that Collins may have molested children well after the crimes he has allegedly confessed to. Scroll down for video . Stephen Collins could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007 according to the latest allegations made by his estranged wife Faye Grant, left . An audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls emerged last week. According to Collins, none of those incidents had occurred after 1984. The latest allegations are included in an email that Grant sent her husband last year which has been obtained by TMZ. A source close to Collins has denied Grant's claims. ‘The notion that Stephen used his role on 7th Heaven for any improper purpose is completely false and just another example of Faye fabricating a story to gain an advantage in the divorce proceedings,’ the source told TMZ. The allegations made against Collins have already cost him roles on the hit drama Scandal and in the upcoming film Ted 2, along with his position on the Screen Actors Guild National Board. Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan has already pointed the finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, Faye Grant, claiming that she had been threatening to leak to the tapes confession for years. Collins (second left) starred as Rev Eric Camden on the long-running family drama about parents raising seven children. A still taken from the final episode, 'Goodbye and Thank You,' in 2007 . Suspected extortion: The actor's attorney said Grant has tried to blackmail the 7th Heaven star in order to get a bigger share of their assets as part of a future divorce settlement . ‘Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,’ he told TMZ. ‘When these demands were rebuffed, Faye attempted - without success - to peddle the tape in numerous ways to numerous different people. ‘It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape - not surprisingly, on the eve of the trial in the divorce case where, again, she is seeking millions of dollars more than that to which she is legally entitled.’ Grant has denied releasing the tapes to the media, saying that the recordings were supposed to be part of a criminal case. The estranged wife has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totaling $14 million, including more than $5 million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex. Grants indicated in the legal papers that she is entitled to half of the assets, but sources close to Collins believe she wants it all. Bombshell claims: Collins, 67, was accused last week of molesting three teenage girls and expressing incestuous thoughts about his unborn child . It's all about the money: Sources closed to Collins said his wife is hoping to walk away from their marriage with all of the couple's assets worth $14million . New York City police announced last week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s. The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972. An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed. Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative. Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations . ‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November. The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, who he married in 1985. Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation. Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old. She has also claimed that he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant. She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused. 'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because ""you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth"" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ. 'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added. A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.' In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children. 'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'","Actor could have molested at least one child as recently as 2007 according to latest allegations made by his estranged wife, Faye Grant .

Inuit tribesmen told Dr Rae that Franklin's men has starved to death and resorted to eating each other after their ships got trapped in the ice. After three journeys across the Arctic, Dr Rae reported back, saying that the men had 'been driven to the last dread alternative as a means of supporting life'. His unfavourable findings were widely criticised and led to him being completely discredited - Charles Dickens wrote a two-part essay theorising that it had actually been the Inuits who killed Franklin's men - and his version became the accepted story. In his essays, Dickens wrote about the 'firmness, fortitude and courage' of the crew, compared with the Inuits - a 'gross handful of uncivilised people, with a domesticity of blood and blubber', The Times reports. The successful campaign to sully Dr Rae's account was started by Franklin's widow, and he never recovered from it - he was the only Victorian explorer who was not knighted. The mantle of having discovered the Northwest Passage was also given to Franklin - despite many believing that Dr Rae actually found it. While shunned in his time, Dr Rae is now recognised as one of the country's great explorers, and a plaque with his name is to be unveiled in the Chapel of St John the Evangelist next week.

It has been placed below a bust of Franklin - to show reconciliation - and the unveiling ceremony will be attended by relatives of both explorers. Sir John Franklin, who led the ill-fated Northwest Passage expedition which resulted in his crew members becoming cannibals and all eventually dying . Also in attendance will be author Ken McGoogan - who helped restore Franklin's reputation with his book, 'Fatal Passage'. The Very Rev John Hall, Dean of Westminster, told The Times: 'We are very keen on reconciliation here,' adding that Westminster Abbey would not be joining the debate about who discovered the Northwest Passage - a sea route which goes through the Arctic Ocean. Modern historians largely believe it was Dr Rae who made the discovery, and Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen - the first explorer to sail the passage - also gives him the credit. His reports of cannibalism were all but confirmed back in 1997, when bones from some of the explorers who died were found on King William Island with cuts on them - implying that flesh had been sliced off them. Jane Hamilton, Dr Rae's great great grand-niece, will attend next week's ceremony, and said: 'John Rae survived because he got to know the Inuit ways and he looked after his own men. He only lost one person in the whole of his Arctic journeys.' Every member of Franklin's crew died in the Arctic after spending years in icy conditions. One of his ships was recently found in Victoria Strait in northern Canada. John Rae is one of Britain's great Arctic explorers, but was largely discredited in his time because of the reports he brought back about Sir John Franklin's crew - which he had been sent out in search of - resorting to cannibalism after becoming trapped in the ice. He was a Scottish doctor who took three trips to the Arctic Coast - between 1948 and 1951 - and is credited by many modern-day historians with discovering the Northwest Passage - a sea route through the Arctic Ocean along the coast of North America. The first of these three trips took him from the Mackenzie River to the Coppermine River, on the second he was thwarted by ice as he tried to cross to Victoria Island and on the final expedition he managed to explore the whole south coast of Victoria island - in Canada. As well as exploring the Arctic, Dr Rae also travelled to the Gulf of Boothia, north west of the Hudson Bay, and other parts of northern Canada. He met the Inuits who told him of Franklin's fate near Pelly Bay after leaving Repulse Bay on March 31, 1854. One of the Inuits had a gold cap-band, and told him that he had got it from the body of one white man among around 35 who had starved to death. He continued his explorations before meeting more Inuits in May. They communicated to him that they had met Franklin's crew four years before, and that, when they saw them again the following spring, around 30 men were dead and there were signs of cannibalism. Despite not getting knighted, he did leave behind a legacy after his death in 1893 - at the age of 79. Rae Strait, Rae River and Mouth Rae - all in Canada or the Arctic - are among the landmarks named after him.","John Rae was sent to find crew of Sir John Franklin lost in Arctic .

"After Seydou Doumbia's double left Manchester City reeling on Wednesday night, their Champions League hopes are hanging by a thread. Manuel Pellegrini insists that his team will keep fighting while their is still a mathematical possibility of qualification, but with just two points from four games, it looks a remote possibility. However, City can take hope from history - there have been two occasions where teams have made it out of the group from a similarly difficult position. Manchester City look down and out after their defeat to CSKA Moscow, but history shows they have a chance . Manuel Pellegrini's side may only have two points from four games, but twice before that has been enough . In the 2004-05 season Porto, coming into the tournament as reigning champions, had a shocking start to their defence. After being held to a stalemate at home to CSKA Moscow in their first game, Porto went down 3-1 to their former manager Jose Mourinho, in his first season at Chelsea, with John Terry and Didier Drogba both on the scoresheet. And while Chelsea went on to dominate the group, the holders suffered a defeat to PSG in Paris, and were again scoreless at home in the return leg. Didier Drogba scores against Porto in 2004, as the Champions League holders suffered a slow start . Drogba and John Terry were on target as Jose Mourinho's former side looked like crashing out of the group . After four games the Portuguese side had scored just one goal, and picked up two points - their attempt to retain the trophy looked all but over. But, with Benni McCarthy leading the line, Victor Fernandez's side bounced back, beating CSKA 1-0 and then Chelsea 2-1 to finish with eight points, one ahead of the Russians. The last 16 was not quite so kind to Porto, who lost 4-2 on aggregate to Inter. Maniche tackles Scott Parker as Porto bounced back in their final two games to qualify . Benni McCarthy was the key man for Porto, scoring in the 1-0 win over CSKA and the defeat of Chelsea . Diego Ribas celebrates Porto's first goal against Chelsea, which helped book their place in the last 16 . Even more impressive than the Portuguese side's feat is that of Lokomotiv Moscow three years earlier. When Frank de Boer scored for Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Matchday four, Lokomotiv had just a solitary point from four games. But the Russian side upset the odds by winning away to Galatasaray and then completed the comeback by beating Club Brugge 2-0. Lokomotiv Moscow had just one point after four games, but beat Galatasaray to keep their hopes alive . In the end, despite their terrible start, Lokomotiv qualified relatively comfortably, two points ahead of the Belgians, although they would go on to pick up just one point from their six games in the second group stage. While City can seek encouragement from these two examples from the continent, there is also one recovery from closer to home they might want to take as inspiration. In 2002 Bobby Robson's Newcastle looked down and out after four games, despite having just seen off Juventus. Alessandro Del Piero scores a beauty for Juventus against Newcastle, who lost their first three games in 2002 . Bobby Robson's side looked out of the competition but they came back to beat Juventus and qualify . The English club knew they needed maximum points from their final two games - as City do now - and showed resilience and quality to beat Dynamo Kiev and Feyenoord. It's a lesson that Pellegrini is determined to learn. As the Chilean put it on Wednesday: 'You can never imagine you are out when the maths says you are still in.' Alan Shearer fires home a penalty as Newcastle became the first team to qualify after three straight losses . Craig Bellamy celebrates the winning goal during the final win against Feyenoord that put Newcastle through .","Defeat to CSKA Moscow leaves Manchester City bottom of their group .
City need to win both games to have any chance of qualifying .
But two teams have made it through from similar positions in Champions League history ."
"This care-free wildebeest was photographed having the time of its life - kicking up and rolling around in the dust in its natural African habitat. Anja Denker, 48, from Windhoek, Namibia, took these stunning images during a family holiday to Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Botswana. The amateur photographer, who works as a fashion designer, captured the large wildebeest having fun at a waterhole in the park. A care-free wildebeest was photographed having the time of its live in Botswana - playing in the dirt and dust . The large animal jumped about, kicking up a storm of dust and rolling around on the ground . Anja said: 'We were standing at the waterhole early in the morning, where I was hoping to photograph some hyenas, which we had seen there previously. 'But two blue wildebeest approached the waterhole to drink. One of them suddenly started pawing the ground vigorously, kicking up loads of sand and dust. He then got down and rolled on the ground, with the dust billowing around him.' 'He got up after a while, proceeded to run around like a mad thing only to dig around in the sand again, lie down and wallow.' The images were taken during the photographer's family vacation to Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park . Initially hoping to spot hyenas, photographer Anja Denker soon became enthralled by the wildebeest . Anja and her family stayed for a half an hour just watching the giant animal enjoying his natural habitat . Anja and her family stayed for half an hour watching the wildebeest rolling around and playing, mesmerised by its actions. She said: 'I always considered wildebeests pretty boring but after I witnessed this one in action so close and unexpectedly, it has completely changed my mind. 'The absolute care-free and never-minded attitude of the animal just galloping around, having fun and just living in that moment touched me deeply and also just showed me that photographing the unexpected can produce some really great results.'

"Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, (above) admitted murdering his daughter, Aukse, after changing his plea to guilty two days into his trial at the Old Bailey . A deliver driver is facing a life sentence after admitting the savage murder of his nine-week-old daughter who died with a catalogue of horrific injuries including a bite mark on her forehead. Aurimas Medvedevas, 23, admitted murdering his daughter, Aukse, after changing his plea to guilty two days into his trial at the Old Bailey in London. He had previously denied murder, claiming his baby daughter had died accidentally by falling out of bed at their home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in September last year. The jury heard how the two-month-old baby had a bite on her forehead and had suffered repeated blows and violent shaking prior to her death. Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, who is the child's mother, wept and shook visibly as Medvedevas confessed to the killing. The agency worker had returned to the house she shared with Medvedevas to find their daughter dead in her cot on September 5 last year. She rushed the youngster to hospital but doctors were unable to revive her and she was pronounced dead the same evening. The infant had suffered a catalogue of injuries, including head wounds, lacerated liver, internal bleeding, fractured ribs, bite marks on her head and bleeding in her eyes, caused by shaking and striking. The court heard how Medvedevas had been looking after her all day. When interviewed by police, he denied causing the fatal injuries but gave no explanation about how they were caused. He later claimed that Aukse had fallen off the bed and hit her head while he was asleep. Then on the day his trial was due to start in May, he produced a radically different account, accepting for the first time that he caused the injuries, the court heard. He said he had shaken his baby and thrown her on the bed and then from there she fell to the floor, the court heard. But the prosecutor said that Medvedevas had still failed to account for all the injuries Aukse suffered and there was no explanation for the bite marks on her forehead. However, an examination of one of the bite marks showed it matched the defendant's teeth imprint, the court heard. Dzesika Urbikaite, 22, who is the child's mother (pictured right outside the Old Bailey in London), wept and shook visibly as Medvedevas (left) confessed to killing their baby daughter. He will be sentenced  next week . Miss Urbikaite found her daughter unconscious in her cot at the couple's (together above) Peterborough home . After changing his plea during today's hearing, Judge Timothy Pontius told the jury that they had heard Medvedevas' 'clear and voluntary confession of guilt'. He told them: 'This is a distressing case and a tragic one. You are relieved of the burden of listening to that evidence.' Medvedevas continues to deny inflicting the bite mark and the judge has yet to decide whether he was responsible for that particular wound. Sentencing for his murder charge is set to take place next week but a date has not yet been fixed. Defence barrister Sallie Bennett-Jenkins said: 'We are satisfied he has fully understood and comprehended the [legal] advice and equally, that he makes this admission of his own free will'. Delivery driver Medvedevas (pictured above with Miss Urbikaite) will be sentenced at the Old Bailey next week . Prosecutor Karim Khalil QC had previously told the court that the cause of the baby's death was a head injury although there were 'signs of numerous other inflicted injuries too'. He added: 'Baby Aukse was a helpless infant, entirely dependent upon the love and care of her parents. 'She suffered very serious and extensive injuries - to her head and body, both externally and internally. 'The nature of these injuries tells you what the person who inflicted them intended. 'All those injuries occurred when she was in the sole care of her father. 'As he committed those acts of violence against Baby Aukse, he must have intended to kill her or to cause her really serious harm - that is murder.'","Aurimas Medvedevas changed plea to guilty two days into trial at Old Bailey .

"For more than a decade, the war between Call of Duty and Medal of Honor has raged - each battling to be crowned the ultimate first-person shooter in the genre. Both sides had casualties - for every Rising Sun there was a Call of Duty 3. Nevertheless, their battle lines were very different. While Call of Duty focused on the cinematic and dramatic, Medal of Honor strived for realism and simulation. Take cover: There's a clever lean-and-shoot mechanic that you need to master . However, Danger Close has decided to buck the latter series' trend. Although the 2010 Tier 1 outing hinted at a Hollywood blockbuster influence, Warfighter is substantially more garish in its approach. From the opening level, where you're dodging shipping containers falling from the sky to the action-packed car chases and high-quality cut scenes - it's clear this latest Medal of Honor puts entertainment before simulation. And as a result, the line that once distinguished it from Call of Duty is more blurred than ever - a move that may enrage some fans, but will be welcomed by others. Similar to the aforementioned, the relatively short six-hour campaign whisks you off to a variety of locations - from Pakistan to a monsoon ravaged Philippines. The narrative, which largely follows the exploits of an operator called 'Preacher' is well paced, but not particularly coherent. Although the varied environments are a welcome change to its predominately desert-based predecessor, proceedings can often be uncomfortably interrupted by the NPCs who populate them. Varied: Bright one minute, dark the next, Warfighter offers plenty of environments . AI is by far one of Medal of Honor’s weakest hands, with enemies often taking cover in the open or charging straight into machine gun fire. There’s no sense that you’re fighting against one coherent force, rather a bunch of individual bots with reckless disregard for their own lives. The Tier 1 operators, too, are not quite as skilled as expected. They'll throw rogue grenades, shoot at inanimate objects and sometimes just stand idly by while you're taking fire. Thankfully, where Medal of Honor excels is its gameplay. Shooting is wonderfully responsive, with each weapon providing its own unique feel and result. Weapon models are all well-detailed and sound authentic, too. The breach mechanic is startlingly similar to the Call of Duty series, but Danger Close have tried to breathe new life into it. Before a breach, you are given a choice of how to do it. This ranges from throwing in a flash bang grenade, to hammering the door down or shooting the lock. Although each one is essentially just a pre-set animation, the slow-motion gunplay that follows is infinitely rewarding. There are also some strong vehicle sections - which, although so often a weakness in games of this type - work remarkably well. A car chase in the early stages is a particular highlight - the handling and clever level design helping to give you the illusion of freedom, even if it's in fact rather linear. Work together: In the campaign, you'll often have AI team-mates working with you . Graphically the game performs admirably, too, and is backed up with strong audio effects. The Frostbite 2 engine has been tweaked since its Battlefield 3 inception, resulting in wonderful lighting and animation. Texture quality does take a slight hit, as do some character models, but they are acceptable payoffs given the silky-smooth frame-rate. Multiplayer in Warfighter is superb. There’s the standard deathmatch and other expected modes, but what makes it stand out is Fireteams. Here, you work as pair of Tier 1 special forces soldiers. Cleverly, there are lots of mechanics in place to ensure working together is tactically sound and entertaining. You can share weapons and ammo at any time, see your partner’s status and position through solid objects, and can spawn on your team-mate if he’s safe. Also, if your friend is killed, taking revenge and shooting his slayer will see him instantly respawned. Medal of Honor has always divided opinion, and Warfighter will be no different. Different focus: The game sacrifices realism and concentrates on action . Indeed, critics may argue its somewhat shallow nature takes away from what it means to be a Tier 1 operative. But what it lacks in realism, it makes up with its colossal production values and memorable multiplayer - a tried-and-tested recipe for success. It's not the deep, emotional journey many were expecting, but action blockbusters never are.

"A firefighter who fought Australia's worst bushfires on Black Saturday is suing a fire agency for post-traumatic stress disorder. Glenn Barlow, named by The Age,  said he was left traumatised after he and crew members were directed into the bushfire in Kinglake West, central Victoria without any warning of the severity of the fast-approaching fire. The former firefighter is the first volunteer to bring a personal injury claim against the Country Fire Authority (CFA), which will see the Bushfires Royal Commission investigated for duty of care. A firefighter who fought against Australia's worst-ever fire, the Black Saturday bushfires, is suing a fire agency for post-traumatic stress disorder . The Black Saturday firestorm saw Coombs Road engulfed in flames killing six people. The fire swept from Kilmore-to-Kinglake killing 119 people and destroying 1242 homes . On Saturday  February 7, 2009, Mr Barlow and other CFA fighters were ordered to Coombs Road, Kinglake West, a no-through road with a smoke sighting. The Black Saturday firestorm saw Coombs Road engulfed in flames killing six people. The fire swept from Kilmore to Kinglake  killing 119 people and destroying 1242 homes. Mr Barlow has outlined in an investigation report the 'traumatising' ordeal he and his fellow fighters faced whilst being trapped on Coombs Road. He said the crew lost water supply while they were taking shelter from the fire. The report said Mr Barlow suffered a major shoulder injury and cites two firefighters who experienced smoke inhalation and burns to the head, face and eyes. According to a royal commission on the 2009 bushfires, CFA divisions were aware of the potential spread of the fire by mid-afternoon but failed to formally alert crew members of the deadly risks when entering the road in Kinglake West. The crew lost communication in the fires after experiencing radio congestion and failure so was not given a 'red flag' warning by CFA officials. Glen Barlow was left traumatised after he and crew members were directed into the bushfire in Kinglake West, central Victoria without any warning of the severity of the fast-approaching fire . The 57-year-old has been left 'totally incapacitated' from employment since Black Saturday, forcing him to file a claim in the Victorian Supreme Court that asserts the CFA was negligent and failed to provide duty of care. The statement insists the Kinglake West fire brigade was failed by the fire agent who should have properly assessed the bushfire. He said he has been left with psychiatric damage which includes, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic adjustment disorder, anxiety and depression. Karen Barrow, another firefighter who was second lieutenant on the day, shared in Mr Barlow's frustration against the CPA and said prior to Black Saturday crew members made formal complaints about the supply of inadequate communication equipment. 'There was no information whatsoever. We only knew what we could ascertain from the CFA website and ABC Radio,' Ms Barrow told the 2009 royal commission. She said a CFA operations officer said the fire agent was 'not prepared to spend any further money on the existing communications infrastructure.' A CFA spokeswoman told The Age it could not provide comment since Mr Barlow's lawsuit is in process. A date for Mr Barlow's case has not been set and his loss of earnings have not been estimated.

"Whether Australians are partying it up on a beach or planning the wedding of their dreams in sun-soaked Thailand, when troubles arise, they always turn to the Australian Embassy. Given the fact that three Australians die in Thailand every 72 hours, the embassy staff are constantly on call and nothing is off limits, making it one of the busiest embassies in the world. For the first time ever, Australian TV cameras have been granted permission to film inside the Australian Embassy in Thailand as they deal with the Thai authorities and rogue Australians. The cameras captured everything from scam-artist love-rats to dream holiday bust ups and passport dilemmas.

Following five years of discussions and negotiations with Thai diplomats, Channel 9 has finally gained access to the Australian Embassy in Thailand in their four-part series The Embassy: Bangkok. Dramatic scenes unfold as the show follows characters from the embassy dealing with problem Aussies. 'Australians are travelling more than ever. We've never looked inside an actual embassy from the perspective of the people who deal with the consequences and what it means for Australians,' Executive Producer Laurie Critchley told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's really exciting it's the first time it's happened in Australia,' she said. A group of drunken Aussies end up embroiled in a fist-fight with Thai bouncers at a nightclub.

Officers from the Australian Embassy in Thailand warn Cameron that he can't overstay his visa again, or there will be ramifications . While the program features it's share of uplifting stories with happy endings, there are some shocking scenes - from violent Australians to the horrendous conditions of the Thai jails. 'You do get shocked,' Executive Producer Craig Graham said. 'You forget how easy is it to get in trouble in a different country with a different culture.' The Embassy is alerted to a 43-year-old Australian called David, who has been jailed for overstaying his visa in a remote prison near the Burmese border. David has been locked up for three weeks in a cell with 120 other prisoners.

'It's my worst nightmare, I've never been in trouble with the law. I'm more upset than I've ever been in my life.' The rough conditions of Thai prisons are shown above, highlighting the need for Australians to follow the law when they are holidaying in Thailand . Meanwhile, Australian Matt and his partner Wayne are embroiled in a surrogacy scandal and it's touch-and-go whether their fraternal twins, Jaxon and Logan will make it across the Thai border. They are unsure whether their hired surrogate will sign a release form for their baby boys' Australian passports. 'There's always the fear that she has more rights than we do because she's on the birth certificate as the mother,' Matt says. While in another part of town, a young Aussie found out the hard way that you should always keep your passport in a safe place. 'While it's funny, there's a profound concept that if you're abroad and you don't have a passport you're buggered,' Executive Producer Craig Graham said.

'The Embassy staff are an insightful, interesting and committed bunch of people,' Ms Critchley said. 'One of the things that makes the show so enjoyable is that each story is so completely different. Each of them has a revealing moment and the Embassy helps them some through incredibly different times.' she said. 'I'm hoping people recognise what the embassy does for us,'  Craig Graham said.

"This extraordinary footage captures the intense moment police smash down two front doors in raids - using a battering ram fitted with a camera. The video shows officers forcing their way into two homes in Coventry, West Midlands, as part of a crack down on foreign criminals operating in the UK. The clip was released today by West Midlands Police - who used a state-of-the-art Go-Pro HD camera to record the action. Scroll down for video . Savvy: West Midlands Police used a state-of-the-art Go-Pro HD camera to record two house raids in Coventry . They are the first force in the UK to film a police raid from the point of view of their heavy-duty Enforcer battering rams - which are 1.9ft long and weigh 16kg. The first address in the Stoke area of the city was raided by officers at around 9am on Wednesday. A 42-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods after a large quantity of jewellery was discovered. At 10am police raided a second house nearby which was believed of being an illegal sex den. A 26-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of managing a brothel. All three people have been bailed pending further enquiries as part of Operation Trivium. Raid: The camera, fitted to a police battering ram, records an image of the intact door moments before police officers smash through . Inspector Wes Martin, from Coventry Police, said: 'This video gives members of the public a unique view of how we carry out raids to target suspects involved in crime. 'Operation Trivium has been taking place across the country this week and has seen officers from countries including Romania, Poland and Lithuania assisting officers in the UK. 'A key part of the raids yesterday was having a colleague from Romanian police with us who was able to communicate with people we encountered and assisted with intelligence checks during the day. 'Raids like this often come on the back of information received by members of the public and I would ask anyone with any knowledge of suspicious activity in their neighbourhood to contact us on 101.' The operation saw more than 700 crime suspects arrested across the country after police officers from 14 European forces joined a clampdown on foreign crooks. Broken: One swing of the heavy-duty Enforcer battering ram sends the the front door flying open with splinters of wood breaking off in all directions . Senior officers from Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Italy, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Latvia, Hungary and Finland met at the Trivium control centre in Edgbaston, Birmingham to witness the operation in action. West Midlands Police Superintendent Paul Keasey, who is leading Operation Trivium, added: 'These examples illustrate how we're working with European police colleagues, Europol and the National Crime Agency to catch and deal swiftly with foreign crime suspects. 'In the first 48 hours of Operation Trivium we have arrested more than 700 foreign nationals suspected of committing crime in the UK. That's a great result. Crackdown: Officers rush into the house as part of Operation Trivium - a nationwide clampdown on foreign criminals . 'There's huge momentum behind this initiative and enthusiasm from police forces on the continent to contribute to more pan-European police operations going forward.' All 43 police forces across the UK are taking part in Operation Trivium and running checks on people and vehicles through the control centre in Birmingham. Dutch Police Hoofdinspecteur Richard Uppelschoten said his police force was looking to replicate the operation with Belgian colleagues next month. He said: 'What I have seen is fantastic. Police from lots of different countries pulling together to stop mobile criminals who cross borders. 'We want to do the same in Holland, plans are well underway, and I can only see operations like this becoming part of normal police business in the future.' Caught: A 42-year-old woman and a 42-year-old man were arrested from the home pictured.

"The FBI is exhuming the body of a John Doe buried in Alabama in 1981 in its search for a 10 Most Wanted Fugitive accused of killing his family with a sledgehammer nearly 40 years ago. In court filings, the FBI said there is a strong resemblance between photos of the unidentified male and former State Department diplomat William Bradford 'Brad' Bishop Jr. He allegedly killed his wife, Annette, and his three sons Brad, 14, Brenton, 10, and Geoffrey, five in their Bethesda, Maryland, home in 1976, using a sledgehammer. Their bodies, which had been burned using gasoline, were found in a shallow grave in Columbia, North Carolina. The Alabama case came to the FBI's attention from a viewer of the CNN program 'The Hunt with John Walsh,' which featured the Bishop case this summer. They then reopened the John Doe investigation and released the photo, catching the attention of investigators. Scroll down for video . Break in the case: The FBI is exhuming the body of a John Doe buried in Scottsboro, Alabama (right) because they believe it could be William Bradford Bishop (left) who is accused of killing his family in 1976 . Grave: Workers at the Cedar Hill Cemetery dig up the coffin of the unidentified white male, who was hit by a car while walking on the highway in 1981 . Investigation: The body is brought up by workers in the cemetery. A number of forensic tests will now be performed on the corpse . The John Doe was killed when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while walking on a highway in Scottsboro, Alabama, in October 1981. The FBI added Bishop to its 10 Most Wanted list in April. The last confirmed sighting of Bishop was at a sporting goods store in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the day after his family was killed. Two weeks later, his station wagon was found in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, just over 200 miles from Scottsboro. Given the size of the park, which encompasses more than 500,000 acres, Bishop, an avid outdoorsman, 'could have remained in the North Carolina/Alabama/Tennessee area for many years without being discovered,' FBI agent Pamela Hanson wrote in an affidavit. It is believed he was overlooked for promotion in the months leading up to the brutal killings and had been seeking treatment for depression. Wanted: This FBI poster shows the ten most wanted fugitive poster for Bishop, the diplomat suspected of killing his wife, mother and three sons in their Maryland home 1976. He has not been seen since . Evading capture: A spokesman for the FBI said Bishop was an avid outdoorsman, and could have travelled in North Carolina, Alabama or North Carolina for years without detection . Weapon: Bradford, who was said to have been overlooked for a promotion before the deaths, allegedly killed his wife and three sons with this sledgehammer . The FBI has Bishop's DNA on file and will use DNA testing to determine if the remains are a match, said Amy Thoreson, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Baltimore field office, which is handling the investigation. She could not give a timetable on when the results would be available. After the unidentified man's death, the police chief sent his fingerprints to the FBI, but the FBI has no record of receiving the prints and no copies were kept. Since Bishop was added to the 10 Most Wanted list, the FBI has received about 350 tips, Thoreson said. The order was passed to exhume the grave after FBI investigators spotted the resemblance between the two men. It could take weeks for the DNA results to be returned .","William Bradford Bishop is suspected of killing family in Maryland in 1976 .

"This is the charred remains of Mario Balotelli's bathroom after dozens of fireworks were let off during an infamous 2011 party in his £3million rented mansion. Pictures published by MailOnline for the first time today show how the indoor display started a fire that destroyed rooms in his £7,500-a-month house in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, causing a reported £400,000 of damage. A friend of the millionaire footballer set off dozens of fireworks from 'multi-shot barrage cannons' in his first floor bathroom three years ago, starting a serious blaze. Despite the fire he scored twice against rivals Manchester United on the day after the firework incident and Balotelli revealed a t-shirt with the cryptic message: 'why always me?' Carnage: This is Mario Balotelli's wrecked bathroom in his £3million mansion after a friend destroyed it with a pre-bonfire night fireworks display . Chaos: This picture shows where the mansion's bath was and tiles and plaster appear to have been blown off the wall and ceiling . Party: These are the 'barrage cannons' of fireworks set off in the bathroom, which wrecked the first floor and started a blaze on the eve a huge game again Manchester United. Balotelli scored twice and used this t-shirt to ask: Why always me? Bathroom towels were set on fire and the flames spread but Balotelli has insisted that he did not cause the blaze and that the offending fireworks were let off by his friends. New photographs appear to show how tiles and plaster were blown off the walls and ceilings, the walls were scorched and covered in  soot and how the landlord had to rip out fittings and start again. Balotelli's four-bedroom house, where he no longer lives, suffered severe smoke damage and the bathroom was gutted in the fire, which needed ten firefighters with breathing apparatus to put it out. The indoor display happened in the early hours on the eve of Manchester City's top-of-the-table derby clash at Old Trafford in October 2011. The controversial Italian and his friends escaped unhurt after fleeing the fire at 1am, . Bedroom: Smoke and soot damaged the walls, ceilings and fittings in the mansion in Cheshire's stockbroker belt . Description: Balotelli said that he had put the fireworks in a bin in the bathroom, right and left, but left the room and one of his friends lit them . Danger: At the time it was reported that the Liverpool striker had been asked to pay £400,000 to the landlord for the damage caused . Trashed: These picture show the fire damage caused to the bathroom's shower cubicle and the carpets and walls of neighbouring rooms . Liverpool's eccentric striker had a rocket from his landlord, who wanted Balotelli, 24, demanded the Italian international pay for the estimated £400,000 repairs himself rather than go through insurance. Describing what happened in an interview with Noel Gallagher on the BBC he said: 'I was bored no, so I was with my friends and one of them was limping so I got one bin you know the bin? For put fireworks inside. 'But nothing gonna happen right, so I left the room and I left the fireworks but I didn't I walk out and then my friend go in the room and they just start screaming blah blah blah and the fireworks was going off and they put the fireworks on the bed, not on the bed sorry, on the toilet. 'But just the curtain caught on fire, that's it, nothing else. Just the toilet was lost'. Balotelli has been the subject of controversy since being in English football, playing for Manchester City before being sold back to AC Milan. He returned to the Premier League this summer in a £16million move to Liverpool. Having scored at Old Trafford, Balotelli unveiled a T-shirt which read 'Why Always Me?' in response to the scrutiny he finds himself under due to his tendency to prompt negative headlines. Aftermath: The controversial Italian and his friends escaped unhurt after fleeing the fire at 1am three years ago . Response: Despite the unfortunate incident at home Mario was chosen to front a firework safety campaign days later . Fun house: Star striker Balotelli also built a racetrack in his back garden for this quad bike, seen after the fire in his garage. Famously his mother sent him to John Lewis for an ironing board and he came back with this and a trampoline . Hobbies: Balotelli also had scooters and a motorbike in the house, as well as a remote control car on the shelf . He was disciplined by the club for throwing darts at a youth team player in 2010, while he was also pictured trading punches on the training ground with former team-mate Jerome Boateng. He has paid a total of £300,000 in club fines. In April 2011, it was reported Balotelli had spent £10,000 in parking fines and had his sports car impounded 27 times. Liaison officials at the club were forced to reclaim the Maserati time and time again as the player was given an average of three parking tickets a day since joining the Premier League club. He once crashed his sports car soon after arriving and it was reported that police found £5,000 in cash in his back pocket. The striker was reprimanded for throwing darts at the training ground.","MailOnline picture exclusive shows scale of damage indoor fireworks display caused to Mario's £3m rented mansion .

Former Fir Park boss Terry Butcher is the frontrunner for Motherwell job . But Baraclough has been invited for interview, too, after leading Sligo to their first league title for 35 years, taking the Irish side into the Champions League and lifting the FAI and Setanta Cups prior to his sacking in June. The 44-year-old Englishman, who is also in the running for the vacant post at Mansfield Town, is currently scouting for Huddersfield Town while he awaits a return to management. Motherwell have received 58 applications from potential replacements for Stuart McCall, who quit Fir Park last month, and are pressing ahead with appointing a manager despite lingering uncertainty over the club’s ownership. Managerless Motherwell suffered a 1-0 defeat against Celtic on Saturday . Fans group the Well Society have been trying to raise enough money to buy former chairman John Boyle’s 70 per cent shareholding and hope to push the deal through with the help of retired businessman Les Hutchison. Lanarkshire-born Hutchison, now based in Barbados, was once on the books of Albion Rovers as a goalkeeper but made his money in electrical engineering. The Well Society ran into problems when their attempts to buy Boyle’s shareholding stalled at £500,000. However, general manager Alan Burrows believes that an agreement is now close which will allowing the club to appoint a new manager. He said: ‘I think we are in the final stages and are confident of a good outcome.’ An Argentine consortium has also been waiting in the wings, forging plans to appoint former Peru international and Newcastle United legend Nolberto Solano as manager should the Well Society fail to reach their target.","Englishman Ian Baraclough invited for interview by Motherwell .

"Dog faeces is the scourge of parks and pavements, and figures suggest that 1,000 tonnes of poo is created each day in the UK alone. In addition to looking and smelling terrible, the faecal matter can harbour antibiotic-resistant strains of E. coli and parasites - which, when left on the ground, can seep into sewers, rivers and the sea. And now scientists have developed a new genetic test to figure out the extent to which dogs are spreading this bacteria through our waterways. Researchers have developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water. They identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples, rarely found in other animals, and were not found in the human samples. Technique pictured . In the journal Environmental Science and Technology, Orin Shanks and his colleagues said waterways are susceptible to many sources of faecal contamination, including sewage leaks and droppings from farm animals and wildlife. Currently, scientists study these water samples for certain genes in gut bacteria that end up in dog faeces. E. coli, also known as Escherichia coli, is the name of a germ, or bacterium, that lives in the digestive tracts of humans and animals. There are many types of E. coli, and most of them are harmless. But some can cause bloody diarrhoea, while others, in particular a strain called O157:H7, may also cause  kidney failure. There are also strains of E. coli that cause urinary tract infections. People can get an E. coli infection by coming into contact with faeces. This happens by drinking or eating contaminated food. Source: WebMD . But, this is not a fail-safe approach, because the microbiota of humans and the pets they live with often overlap, making analysis complicated. Professor Shanks’ team has developed a new genetic testing method to specifically detect canine faecal contamination in water. They identified 12 genetic markers that were common among most of the dog samples, rarely found in the samples taken from other animals, and were not found in the human samples. Three in particular – called DG3, DG37, and DG72 – were the most specific and sensitive of the markers studied. To determine whether this method would work for real-world monitoring, they sampled storm water from a rain garden where people often walk their dogs. The technique successfully detected some of the same markers they had identified as evidence for canine waste. Further tests will be carried out before the system can be used more widely. To determine whether this method would work for real-world monitoring, the researchers sampled storm water from a rain garden where people often walk their dogs (stock image). The technique successfully detected some of the same markers they had identified as evidence for canine waste . It’s not just dog faeces that poses a health risk, though. Seagull droppings on beaches have also been linked to E.coli bacteria found in beach water. To reduce the risk to beachgoers, Michigan scientists are using border collies as patrol dogs to walk up and down the state’s beaches each day. The dogs were put on patrol by Central Michigan University last year and are designed to scare the birds away. Following tests, E.coli levels were found to have ‘significantly’ dropped in the beaches that were being patrolled.

"First it targeted our vacuum cleaners in the name of global warming – now the EU is gunning for petrol-driven lawnmowers. They are among a range of outdoor equipment facing stringent emissions tests, including chainsaws, combine harvesters and river barges. The European Commission has already forced vacuum cleaner manufacturers to stop producing the most powerful machines. Scroll down for video . Just weeks after the high-power hoover ban, lawnmowers are among a range of outdoor equipment facing stringent emissions tests, including chainsaws, combine harvesters and river barges . The latest regulation is designed to reduce air pollution by cutting emissions from combustion engines in ‘non-road mobile machinery’, Brussels commissioner for industry Nelli Feroci said yesterday. As well as small gardening and handheld equipment, bigger off-road equipment including excavators, bulldozers and crop harvesters, as well as railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels such as river barges are also in the Brussels executive’s sights. ‘These people are fanatics,’ said Paul Nuttall, Ukip Euro MP for the north-west of England. ‘They are so blind to their own failings that they do not even realise the contempt which their hyperactivity breeds in the voting public. They just need to stop, take a deep breath and take a look at themselves.’ Industry was quick to point out that the law will backfire because manufacturers will simply withdraw from unprofitable market sectors rather than produce a new range of EU-compliant engines. ‘This is a major problem for us,’ said Theresia Hacksteiner, secretary general of the European Barge Union. ‘The engine manufacturers themselves have already warned the Commission that they will not follow the new standards.’ She added that the law will lead to unintended consequences, in particular the inability of barge owners to find replacement engines. Consumers snapped up high-powered hoovers in the lead-up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Above, the European Commission's headquarter . While big manufacturers – of cars, for example – are obliged to follow new European standards set in Brussels, smaller manufacturers of niche products are just as likely to abandon Europe for more profitable markets as produce a new product range. The new legislation comes despite a pledge by Jean-Claude Juncker, president-designate of the European Commission, to cut back on red tape by focusing the Brussels bureaucracy’s work on matters that are essential for the smooth running of European business. Last month there was a stampede of panic-buying when a Brussels diktat outlawed powerful vacuum cleaners over 1600 watts. A list of 30 high-wattage household devices could also be banned next spring following a draft EU report which examined ways to reduce power consumption. These are thought to include powerful hairdryers and kettles.","Mowers, combine harvesters and river barges are next on the EU's agenda .

"A man banned from the gym over fears for his health has had half his brain disabled by surgeons to end years of debilitating seizures. Fitness fanatic Lewis Unwin suffered countless fits and constant shaking as a teenager, having been diagnosed with a rare brain condition. The 21-year-old had been banned from going to the gym, over fears he would suffer epileptic seizures. But today, his dream of becoming a personal trainer has been reignited after he opted for life-changing surgery to disconnect half his brain. Lewis Unwin, 21, from Hornchuch in Essex was diagnosed with Rasmussen syndrome in 2011 after suffering a seizure on holiday in Minorca in August 2007 . Determined to pursue his dream of becoming a personal trainer, Mr Unwin opted to have a hemispherectomy operation where surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London disconnected half of his brain, disabling the nerve cells which had been malfunctioning causing him to suffer seizures almost 24 hours a day . He said: 'The seizures are still going on in the right-side of my brain - it's just the signals have been cut off from being passed to my left side. 'I used to shake and suffered fits all the time. 'The pain was excruciating - it felt like my bones were breaking every time I had one. 'It was a tough decision to have the operation but I just knew I needed to get my life back. 'It was the only step forward I could take.' Mr Unwin first noticed something was wrong after suffering a seizure during a family holiday to Minorca in August 2007. His condition deteriorated and left him suffering epileptic seizures almost 24 hours a day. In 2011, after rounds of tests, doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital diagnosed Mr Unwin with Rasmussen's syndrome. Mr Unwin, said: 'It was a tough decision to have the operation but I just knew I needed to get my life back' Today the 21-year-old is working as a gym instructor having been allowed back to train. He had been banned from exercising in the gym over fears for his health and safety were he to suffer a fit . Rasmussen syndrome is a rare condition that is usually diagnosed in three to 11-year-olds. It is not known what causes it, but nerve cells in regions of the brain malfunction to cause epileptic seizures . The rare brain condition is usually seen in three to 11-year-olds, causing frequent epileptic seizures. The cause of the condition is unknown, but pioneering surgery called a 'hemispherectomy' - which involved disconnecting and disabling one side of the brain - has allowed Mr Unwin to regain control of his life. He was left completely paralysed following the eight-hour operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London on August 25, 2011. Rasmussen syndrome is a very rare form of brain malfunction, which can happen at any time during childhood. It most commonly affects children aged three to 11, but can be seen in younger children, teenagers and adults. It is not known what causes the condition, but brain cells in one hemisphere of the brain become very inflamed and swollen. There is no evidence of viral infection causing the inflammation in most cases, although research has found very rarely a virus is detected. It is thought a virus may trigger an antibody response by the brain, which in turn causes the inflammation and malfunction of the brain. The nerve cells malfunction, causing seizures. They can occur frequently, often many times a day. In some cases the seizures can become continuous. A child can develop a weakness of one side of the body as a result of the seizures. And in some cases a sufferer can develop learning or behaviour problems as the condition worsens. Patients can be treated using epilepsy drugs and medicines to suppress or alter the immune system can also be used. For some, where the disorder is confiend to specific parts of the brain, doctors can remove or disconnect the affect regions of the brain. Source: Epilepsy Action . But the football-mad West Ham fan stunned doctors by learning to walk within two weeks of the op, kicking a football after just four weeks. He added: 'It's always been my dream to be a personal trainer. 'I used to have to take drugs every day and my condition meant I wasn't allowed into the gym because of fears over health and safety. 'It's great to be able to get back into the gym. I've had to learn to adapt and have retrained my body. 'I've had to teach myself to walk and talk again but I've had amazing support from everybody which has really helped.' Mr Unwinlives at his family home in Hornchurch, Essex, with his parents Gary Unwin, and full-time mother Kay Unwin, both 47, and his younger sister Holly, 15. His parents had been warned he may never speak again ahead of the pioneering operation - but were relieved when he woke up from surgery singing the Alicia Keys hit Empire State of Mind (New York). Father Gary, a black cab driver, said: 'We were really worried ahead of the operation. 'We had been told he might not be able to talk or that his memory could be affected. 'All of a sudden I heard him singing that New York by Alicia Keys as he woke up. 'It was a huge relief for us to know he was okay.' The 21-year-old has now started work as a gym instructor at Central Park Leisure Centre in Harold Hill. He said: 'When I first came back to the gym I was very intimidated. 'You worry that people are looking at you because of your disability and the fact I still wear a brace on my leg. 'I still have problems with weakness on my left side but I've learnt to adapt. 'I will not let my disability hold me back and I want to teach people that message.

"Babies born by Caesarean section may be more likely to develop autism, research shows. Research found the procedure appeared to increase the chances by a quarter – although there is no clear explanation. But academics urge women not be alarmed by the findings as the overall risk of autism remains very small . In Britain, up to 1 in 4 deliveries now take place by C-section and rates have risen four-fold since the 1970s. Risk: Research found C-sections appeared to increase the chances of a child developing autism by a quarter . The increase is partly because women who are deemed at risk of having a complicated birth are strongly advised to have the procedure because it is safer. But researchers from University College Cork, in Ireland, looked at a number of existing studies linking Caesareans to autism. They found that on average it increased the risk by 23 per cent, although there was no obvious reason behind it, . The study also tried to look at whether there was a link between C-section and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although the findings were inconclusive. Professor Louise Kenny, one of the authors and a practising obstetrician, said the link between C-sections and children developing autism remains unclear. ‘Parents should be reassured that the overall risk of a child developing ASD Autism Spectrum Disorder is very small and that when medically indicated it can be lifesaving,’ she said. Rise: C-section procedures have increased four-fold since the 1970s in the UK . But Eileen Curran, lead author of the report, said more research was needed about the possible link, given the numbers of women having Caesareans. ‘Given the accelerating rate of Caesarean section globally, this finding warrants further research of a more robust quality using larger populations to adjust for important potential confounders and explore potential causal mechanisms,’ she added. Previously, experts have said the link could in fact be down to genes which mean babies are more likely to be born with difficult deliveries – and then develop autism. Another possible explanation is that women who have C-sections tend to be older – and their babies are also at higher risk of the condition. They have urged women not to feel guilty that by having a C-section they were in any way harming their child’s development. The increased rate of Caesarean is mainly down to doctors advising women to have them if they are at high risk of complications. These include women who are overweight, are diabetic, have previously had complications in childbirth or who have certain mental health conditions. But some experts have accused doctors of being too willing to carry out the procedure. Women who don’t want to give birth naturally can also choose to have it done privately – some have been accused of being too posh to push. In addition to these planned or elective Caesarean, other women will also have the operation in an emergency if they develop complications during labour. The study looked at both types of procedure. Although it is far safer compared to 50 years ago there is still a risk of infection, blood clot and damage to some internal organs. And in 2012 a study by Imperial College London found that one in 10 developed an infection and needed to stay longer in hospital . A planned Caesarean costs the NHS an average of £2,369, while a natural birth costs £1,665.","Britain has seen huge rise in C-sections which now account for 1 in 4 births .
Doctors encourage procedure when there is a possibility of complications .
Expert warns further research is needed to explain the link with autism ."
"The former lover of accused serial killer Darren Vann has opened up for the first time about the horrific night he poured a can of gasoline over her, threatening to burn them both alive and take an apartment block down with them. After a decade of terrified silence, Ceritha Grant, 43, finally feels free to tell her story after Vann's arrest in connection with the murder of seven women around Gary, Indiana. And she revealed Vann came looking for her less than a week before he is accused of strangling prostitute Afrika Hardy in a motel room, leaving her in the bathtub with the water running. Scroll down for video . Choke hold: : Ceritha Grant describes the day Darren Vann almost took her life for MailOnline: 'He got what was left of the gasoline and poured it over me. was drenched in gasoline from my shoulders down. Then he tipped the rest of it over his own head' Nightmare: Ceritha Grant, 43, finally feels free to tell her story after Darren Vann's arrest in connection with the murder of seven women around Gary, Indiana. Monster: Darren Deon Vann  is the 43-year-old man in custody for the suspected murders of seven women in Gary, Indiana. Ceritha Grant narrowly escaped death at the hands of the accused murderer . 'He went to my mother's house hoping to find me there. I don't dare think what he was going to do,' Ceritha said as she sat down exclusively with MailOnline. 'I know he is capable of doing exactly what he is charged with — I went through it,' she added. Vann, a former Marine, has now been charged with Hardy's murder last Friday at the Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana. Authorities expect to charge him with three other killings this week and he is the sole suspect in three more murders after a weekend in which he led police to women's bodies in several abandoned buildings in Gary. Cops in both Indiana and Texas believe that Vann, 43, could be linked to more killings, possibly going back 20 years. Vann charmed Ceritha with his intellect when they first met as neighbors on Madison Street in Gary in 2003. 'He was very smart,' she said. 'His idea of a night out was to go to Barnes and Noble and read books, mostly science fiction or Harry Potter. 'All he wanted to do was read and watch movies. He was very clean living, he didn't smoke, didn't drink and he didn't take drugs.' But behind the clean-cut façade was a monster who frequently kept her locked in the house, refused to let her have friends and even hogtied her in her own mother's home, she said. 'I couldn't leave him. When we were together he would hold on to me so tight I couldn't get away. When he went to work he would often lock me in the house.' Disrepair: This is the rundown home of Darren Vann in Gary, Indiana. There was no police tape outside the home . A shack at the back of Vann's unkempt backyard . Ceritha's terror came to a head in early April 2004 after they had been together for nine months and she realized she had finally had enough of her boyfriend's controlling ways. Vann went looking for her, believing she was seeing her wheelchair-bound friend David Abram, who had been paralyzed below the waist in a shooting. 'He had absolutely nothing to be jealous about,' she said. 'David couldn’t have had sex with me even if we had wanted to. He was just a very dear friend.' Vann twice went round to Abram's apartment threatening him. The third time, he returned with a red, plastic gasoline can, claiming he also had dynamite and was going to blow them all up unless he could find Ceritha, who, he claimed, owed him $7,000. According to a police report of the incident acquired by MailOnline, Abram asked him 'You're going to burn my family — innocent people — over a woman?' Coldhearted Vann replied: 'Give me $7,000 and you can have her.' Within minutes, Ceritha turned up on the scene and Abram threw her his keys. She ran into the apartment, locked the door and hid under the bed. Infuriated, Vann kicked in the door and started pouring the gas on the floor, saying if she didn't come out from her hiding place he would burn the place down, the police report states. Ceritha crawled out from beneath the bed as the fumes from the gasoline got stronger. Her ex-lover grabbed her and put her in a headlock, she recalled. Victims: These are two of the women whose bodies were found in and around Gary, Indiana. The undated photo at left, provided by Marvin Clinton, shows Teaira Batey. The photo at right, provided by Lori Townsend, shows Afrika Hardy, whose body was found October 17 in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, Ind. (below). Authorities say Darren Vann confessed to Hardy's slaying . 'He got what was left of the gasoline and poured it over me,' Ceritha told MailOnline. 'I was drenched in gasoline from my shoulders down. Then he tipped the rest of it over his own head. All of this was in full view of the police.' 'He was flicking the lighter threatening to burn me alive, to set fire to us all,' she exclaimed. 'Police got everyone out of the apartment block. There was 12 or 16 apartments there. If he had lit the gasoline the whole place would have gone up.' By this time police had arrived at the now-demolished apartment complex on Gary's VanBuren Street, but as Vann gripped his ex, he told them to back off or he would set the whole place on fire. 'Vann pulled this woman out of the home by force with his left arm around her neck while he was holding a lighter in his right hand along with the gas can,' the police report states. 'He refused to let the woman go after she asked him several times.' Despite being charged with a felony, Vann only served 90 days in prison. April 6, 2004 was just the culmination of Vann's cruel ways, Ceritha told MailOnline. Some three months earlier they had visited her mother on East 7th Avenue. 'He hogtied me and duct taped my mouth shut so I couldn't scream — that was in my mother's own house! 'Another time he locked me in our apartment for a whole week. It was like a jail, the only time I saw him was when he brought me my three meals a day. 'By that stage of the relationship I realized I had to get out, but I couldn't because he would threaten my mother. He said he would kill me, he would kill my mother.' Widening search: Investigators with the Lake County Indiana Sheriff's office have continued to search for more victims, here, the garage where a Vann victim was found days earlier . Grim discovery: Lake County Indiana Sheriffs use a cadaver dog Riley to search homes in Gary after finding 4 bodies in abandoned homes nearby . To make his point, Vann marched Ceritha to a desolate spot in the down-at-heel town. 'He said he could easily make me disappear here. It was just because I wouldn't have sex with him that night.' Ceritha was then finally able to make her escape from his clutches and went into hiding. Ceritha admits she knew that Vann was already married when she moved in with him. His ex-wife Maria is 29 years older than him and now lives in Texas. 'He told me he only married her because he hated being alone. I didn't know her but she would come around occasionally and bring him food. She didn't stay with him.' Bizarre coincidence: Ceritha's husband Jacobbie Landers  told MailOnline that unbeknownst to him he once employed his wife's former lover in his repair shop in Gary, just five blocks from where Vann threatened to set the apartment block on fire. Landers has since relocated the business to East Chicago. Vann was jailed for five years in Texas between 2008 and 2013 for aggravated sexual assault. After his release he returned to Indiana where he registered as a sex offender and began again to look for Ceritha who is now happily married and living in East Chicago, Indiana, a few miles northwest of Gary. 'He always said he was going to get me and to the day he was arrested he was looking for me,' she said. 'Of course I am relieved he has been arrested, but I worry about what his friends or his family could still do.' Ceritha's husband Jacobbie Landers, 47, told MailOnline that unknown to him he once employed his wife's former lover in his repair shop in Gary, just five blocks from where Vann threatened to set the apartment block on fire. He has since relocated the business to East Chicago. 'Of course I knew of the time with Ceritha and the gasoline,' he said. 'But it wasn't until my brother saw his picture on the television after his arrest that we realized he worked with us for a time. 'We fix stoves and refrigerators and household items and I liked to hire people from the neighborhood rather than bring people into Gary. He only worked for us for a couple of months, but he was a pretty good worker. 'I didn't know he was the man that tried to kill my future wife. 'Now I can't help wondering if my wife is the one woman who got away from this man.'","Darren Vann has admitted to seven murders and could be liable for more .

"Two drunk women who caused havoc on a flight to Tunisia that forced the captain to make an emergency landing have been jailed. Serena Meade and Karen Wildman caused misery to other passengers. Their antics were so bad the captain diverted the plane to Lyon and had them removed from the plane. That cost British Airways more than £4,500 and delayed the flight by four hours, New Year's Eve, 2012. Serena Meade and Karen Wildman have been jailed after their appalling behaviour on a 2012 British Airways flight to Tunisia (File Photo) The out-of-control pair swigged from a bottle of Malibu, hid inside toilets, swore in front of children and were aggressive towards air crew - Meade even lit up a cigarette at 30,000 feet. Both women were jailed for eight months at Lewes Crown Court last month after Meade admitted acting in a destructive manner on an aircraft and Wildman endangering the safety of an aircraft. The details of their case have now emerged for the first time as judges at London's Criminal Appeal Court cut Meade's sentence to six months. The court heard the friends were travelling on board a British Airways flight from Gatwick to Tunis for some winter sun on December 31, 2012, when they caused havoc. Meade and Wildman had both been drinking before boarding the plane. Judge Alistair McCreath said there was an 'unpleasant scene' as the pair were asked to move from the seats they had chosen. That was because Meade was in a wheelchair at the time and needed to be in the part of the plane reserved for disabled passengers. He said the pair were 'much the worse for drink' and began behaving badly, being abusive to staff and upsetting other holidaymakers. The pair were jailed at Lewes . The judge added: 'Passengers who were on their way to enjoy a winter holiday were affronted and disturbed by their behaviour.' When they were refused alcohol by staff, they opened a bottle of Malibu they had bought in duty free and swigged from that until it was confiscated. Their behaviour was so appalling that one air hostess served them with a written warning - which they ripped up in front of her. They then followed her into the galley, where she was confronted and pushed, before hiding in a toilet cubicle - where Meade started smoking. After seeing the drama unfold on CCTV from the cockpit, and hearing their raised voices, the captain took the decision they would have to be ejected from the plane and made an emergency detour to Lyon. Meade and Wildman were handed over to French police before being flown back to the UK. The diversion cost British Airways £4,683 and passengers were held up as the plane was delayed for hours. Judge McCreath said it was 'hardly surprising' the crown court judge sent both women to jail. He added: 'Their conduct was prolonged and caused distress to other passengers - not only by the delay and inconvenience, but also by the incidents themselves.' However, allowing Meade's appeal against the length of her jail term, he said her personal difficulties meant her sentence should be reduced. Sitting with Lady Justice Sharp and Mr Justice Blake, he added: 'We have come to this position entirely because of the nature and degree of the personal mitigation available to her.'","Serena Meade and Karen Wildman were on New Years' Eve flight to Tunisia .

"This is the moment a hapless thief is arrested by bouncers after he tried to steal from a car parked outside their training session. Nathan Webb, 39, slipped inside the unlocked Vauxhall Astra parked outside The Training Hub in Manchester city centre in an attempt to grab a sat-nav. But owner Danny Rose, a trainee doorman who was taking part in a session on how to use handcuffs, was watching from inside the building and rushed outside to stop him. Scroll down for video . Nathan Webb, 39, is caught slipping into the driver's side of the Vauxhall Astra parked outside training centre . One of the trainee bouncer's is then seen approaching the car, where Webb is inside trying to take a sat-nav . He called for help from the centre manager - Marcus Gentles, a bouncer with 16 years’ experience – who was able to apprehend him with the handcuffs he had been using during the lesson. CCTV footage shows Mr Gentles leaning into the driver’s seat, where Webb was sitting, and detain him as the trainees look on. He held Webb inside the classroom for 15 minutes until the police arrived. He was charged the next day and appeared before magistrates in Manchester where he pleaded guilty to theft from a motor vehicle. Mr Gentles, a former Fusilier from Oldham, said candidates on the 10 candidates on the training course thought the incident had been staged as part of the session. ‘It was just so funny. He’s come up to a building that is teaching doormen how to arrest people - and has tried to steal from them,’ he said. He opens the door as other trainee bouncers, who were learning how to use handcuffs, come rushing out . ‘I said to him, “Are you stupid mate? There are big signs outside”. ‘He said, “You’ve got to take a chance, mate”.’ His training centre works with Get Licensed to offer Security Industry Authority (SIA) approved sessions for would-be doormen and he has been doing the training for five years. Centre manager Marcus Gentles - a bouncer of 16 years - rushes out and detains him using cuffs from lesson . Webb is taken into classroom where he waits for police to arrive. He was charged the next day and pleaded guilty to theft from a motor vehicle . The 40-year-old said he taught candidates to make citizen’s arrests using handcuffs because police were increasingly over-stretched and often took up to 20 minutes to attend an incident. He added: ‘People slag off the police but when you work in the industry you see how under-funded and over-stretched they are. That’s why we are now doing the arrests ourselves.’ Webb is due to be sentenced later this month.","Nathan Webb, 39, slipped inside unlocked Vauxhall Astra but was caught .
