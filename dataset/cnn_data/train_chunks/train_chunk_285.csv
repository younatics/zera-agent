"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is in Texas today. Texas is the center of the current crisis at the border. From Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, thousands upon thousands of children are pouring into the United States. This flood of foreign children is not a problem of border security. They are not sneaking across the border illegally. Under the Feinstein Amendment of 2008, unaccompanied minors from these countries can present themselves at a legal border crossing, claim to be political refugees and seek asylum. The argument on the left is that these three countries have violent gangs and therefore we have a moral obligation to take in their children. One Democratic senator told me that the real key was to end violence in those three countries. Given last weekend's 82 shot and 16 killed in Chicago, I wanted to ask that senator how he thought his policies would be more successful in Central America than they have been in our third-largest city. It is in this context of the liberal fantasy -- that we owe the world everything, we can do nothing to protect ourselves and everyone else is innocent while we Americans somehow have an extra burden to take care of their problems -- that you have to view the President's current actions. The President's trip highlights vividly the failure of Obama-ism. It is clear he wants our money. He is doing two big Democratic fundraisers in Texas this week to get political money. He has just sent up a request to Congress for an additional $3.7 billion to address the immigration crisis on the southern border -- the majority of which would go toward caring for the unaccompanied minors crossing the border. Still, this request is larger than the entire U.S. Border Patrol budget in 2013. Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, on CNN's ""Crossfire"" Tuesday night, demolished the President's proposal. ""That's $60,000 per child that we're going to spend, in emergency money,"" he pointed out. (Parents and students trying to get through college should contemplate that number.) ""That shows just how incompetent we [are] -- we can't do that for three or four thousand per child?...If we can't do that, the Border Patrol is as bad as the VA."" ""For $8 million,"" he pointed out later in the show, ""we can put them all on a first-class seat back to their homes."" Actually, he exaggerated a little bit. A business class flight from San Antonio to Guatemala City is about $450. Lowest economy ticket is $318. For the 60,000 young people entering the United States this year under the Feinstein Amendment, flying home commercially would be in the range of $18 to $26 million plus the cost of staffing etc. So the Coburn plan might cost (once staff, etc. is included) in the $40 million to $80 million range. That means, of course, that the Coburn plan would save at least $3.62 billion over the Obama plan. Why is the Obama plan so expensive? Simple. Left-wing Democrats wake up every morning knowing the answer is bigger government and more money. They just don't know what the question is. The border crisis is a new opportunity for Obama to create even bigger government, spending even more of our children's money. In a rational world it would be an absurdity, but this is the world of Obama and Sen. Harry Reid, and nothing involving more spending and bigger government is absurd to them. Coburn also noted that the current scale of the border crisis would disappear if Congress would simply repeal the Feinstein Amendment. Chairman Bob Goodlatte of the House Judiciary Committee also notes that there are a number of executive actions the President could take which would end the open borders for foreign children policy. The Obama administration policy of ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals"" was an executive decision to begin with (and one of questionable legality). The President certainly has the authority to enforce immigration law. The Obama policy instead assumes the border will remain open and he wants to use taxpayer money to fund the lengthy process of getting children from Central America involved in the American legal system. It is a great excuse to have the government hire even more lawyers. House Republicans should immediately repeal the Feinstein Amendment and call on the President to do everything within his power to stop this rush on our borders. Let's see how long Democratic senators up for reelection can allow Reid to bottle up a solution to the flood of foreign children coming into our country. Three cheers for Senator Coburn and a loud ""no"" to President Obama is the right response to this mess.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea said Wednesday that it had put a satellite in orbit for the first time, giving a lift to its homegrown space industry and matching a feat achieved last month by its hostile neighbor, North Korea. Amid a billowing plume of smoke, the Naro-1 rocket blasted off from a launch site perched on the edge of an island near the country's southern coast. South Korean television footage showed it ascending into the clear blue sky. South Korean officials: North Korean rocket could hit U.S. mainland . Officials and technicians watched the launch intently to see if it would succeed in delivering its payload into orbit. A crowd of onlookers near the site applauded and waved national flags. About an hour after takeoff, Science Minister Lee Ju-ho declared the launch a success. North Korea on Google Maps: Monuments, nuclear complex, gulags . The pressure on the South Korean rocket scientists to get the satellite into space increased after North Korea carried out its own successful launch last month in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Only weeks before that, the South was forced to suspend its previous attempt to launch the Naro-1 rocket after finding problems with the electronic signal just minutes before it was due to take off. The country's previous launch attempts in 2009 and 2010 had failed. After threats against U.S., North Korea turns ire to South . Wednesday's successful effort comes at a delicate time on the Korean peninsula: North Korea said last week that it plans to conduct a new nuclear test and carry out more rocket launches after the U.N. Security Council voted to tighten sanctions on the secretive regime. Pyongyang didn't say when it intends to carry out the nuclear test, which follows previous underground detonations in 2006 and 2009. Although the North's rocket launch last month managed to put an object in space, it was widely considered to be a test of long-range ballistic missile technology. It's unclear whether that satellite is functional. North Korea says new nuclear test will be part of fight against U.S. Saber-rattling statements . In its saber-rattling statements last month, North Korea said its missile and nuclear programs were part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. It also threatened ""physical counter-measures"" against South Korea if it participates in the imposition of the new sanctions. South Korean authorities say their latest attempted satellite launch is a crucial step for the development of the country's civilian space program. The satellite carried by the launch vehicle is mainly intended for gathering climate data and other atmospheric information, they say. Is Asia on cusp of space race? Analysts have said the South Korean launch is different from that of the North because it is more transparent, clearly focused on civilian applications and doesn't contravene U.N. sanctions. The development of the South Korean rocket program, using Russian technology for the first-stage launcher, began in 2002. Seoul is aiming to develop its own thruster by 2021 through a program estimated to cost 1.5 trillion won (about $1.4 billion). The successful launch puts South Korea among the small group of nations that have sent a rocket into space from their own soil. Others include the United States, Russia, China, Japan, France, India, Israel, Iran and North Korea. South Korea already has a number of satellites in space, but they were launched in other countries using foreign rocket technology. Opinion: Rescind North Korea's license to provoke . CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: South Korea was forced to suspend its previous attempt weeks earlier .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona must do without the services of four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi for between six to eight weeks, the club said Monday. The Argentina ace limped off after 19 minutes of Barcelona's win at Real Betis Sunday and the worst fears of the fans were confimed by a statement on their website. ""The club's medical services confirmed after tests this Monday morning that Leo Messi has a torn hamstring muscle in his left thigh,"" it read. ""The first phase of Messi's recovery will be covered in Barcelona and he will then travel to Buenos Aires,"" it added. It is the third time that Messi has been sidelines, suffering a bruised thigh in the Spanish Super Cup match against Atletico Madrid on August 21, which kept him out for a week. The second, more serious injury, came against Almeria on September 28 where he suffered a small muscle tear in his right thigh, meaning he missed three weeks. His absences have not prevented Barcelona from making a storming start to their La Liga programme with 37 points from 13 games and they have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League. Messi is set to miss their last two group games against Ajax and Celtic, plus six other matches in La Liga and the Copa del Rey. He has scored 14 goals in his 14 appearances for the Catalan giants this season and manager Gerardo Martino will be hoping he can be restored to full fitness for their clash at second placed Atletico Madrid on January 12. Martino wants other players to step up to the plate in his absence. ""We have the best player in the world, but we also have four or five of the next six or seven best players in the world,"" he said after the 4-1 win at Betis. ""The injury to Messi doesn't have anything to do with the previous ones because it is in the other leg. ""We also need to speak with Leo, it is the third episode he has had in a short time so it is obviously playing on his mind,"" he told AFP. Messi has also been ruled out of Argentina's forthcoming friendlies against Ecuador and Bosnia and Herzegovina as he begins his recuperation.","Lionel Messi ruled out for between six to eight weeks .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a former Democratic presidential candidate from Ohio, introduced a resolution to impeach President Bush into the House of Representatives on Tuesday. Kucinich announced his intention to seek Bush's impeachment Monday night, when he read the lengthy document into the record. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said she would not support a resolution calling for Bush's impeachment, saying such a move was unlikely to succeed and would be divisive. Most of the congressman's resolution deals with the Iraq war, contending that the president manufactured a false case for the war, violated U.S. and international law to invade Iraq, failed to provide troops with proper equipment and falsified casualty reports for political purposes. Kucinich also charges that Bush has illegally detained without charge both U.S. citizens and ""foreign captives"" and violated numerous U.S. laws through the use of ""signing statements"" declaring his intention to do so. Other articles address global warming, voting rights, Medicare, the response to Hurricane Katrina and failure to comply with congressional subpoenas. Last year, Kucinich introduced a resolution to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney. But in November when Republicans tried to force a debate on the move, the attempt failed. Democrats voted to send the resolution to the House Judiciary Committee, where committee chairman Rep. John Conyers has taken no action on it. An earlier resolution to impeach Cheney has languished in the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties since May 2007. The House of Representatives has voted to impeach two presidents -- Andrew Johnson, in 1868, and Bill Clinton, in 1999 -- but both were acquitted by the Senate and remained in office. No U.S. vice president has been impeached. Kucinich dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination for president in January to focus on his re-election bid in Ohio. He handily won the Democratic primary in his district on March 4 and faces former State Representative Jim Trakas in the general election.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will not support the lawmaker's resolution .

"(CNN) -- At first it may seem ""24's"" Jack Bauer didn't get the memo. In 2014, our heroes now wear capes and fight the bad guys at the box office, while the small screen has been taken over by a gang of antiheroes. From ""Scandal"" and ""Mad Men"" to ""Breaking Bad"" and ""House of Cards,"" the recent slate of leading men aren't as interested in saving the world as they are in saving themselves. Yet on Monday night (May 5), counterterrorism agent Bauer will return in Fox's ""24"" event series, ""24: Live Another Day."" He's once again played by Kiefer Sutherland and is as determined as ever to do the right thing. Those around Bauer may question which side he's on, but viewers have always known him as the guy willing to do anything (and we mean anything) for what he sees as the greater good. In a TV world filled with monsters and Heisenbergs, where does Bauer fit in? In a sense, the 12-episode ""24: Live Another Day"" is asking that very question. When ""24"" ended in 2010, Bauer was still alive but a fugitive. In its two-hour premiere, ""24: Live Another Day"" picks up four years later with a hardened, angrier Bauer living in exile as a presumed threat to the U.S. government. ""He's actually working on his own, but the people that he's trying to help are actually hunting him and they're trying to either kill him or arrest him,"" Sutherland told CNN in a press call. ""He's had to hide in Eastern Europe for four years. He's been estranged from his daughter and grandchildren, he has not been able to go back to the country that he feels he served. That kind of isolation has made him really hard."" And yet, as executive producers Evan Katz and Manny Coto point out, he'll still jump at the chance to stop another attempt on a president's life without asking, as many of our favorite characters would today, what's in it for him. ""Jack is an individual who has saved his country numerous times and now that country has turned his back on him,"" Coto said. ""On the outside (he's) changed and has a darker view of humanity and the people around him, but at his core has maintained his love of country and what he's always fought for."" That core is undoubtedly part of what made audiences root for the impossibly unstoppable federal agent when ""24"" debuted in 2001. With a premiere date that came just weeks after the September 11 attacks, ""24"" greeted TV viewers badly in need of a hero. ""He was a man who got things done at a time when that was all this country wanted,"" observed Los Angeles Times' TV critic Mary McNamara. ""I don't think Sutherland cracked a smile during the entire run of '24.' He was all business."" At the time, the series was one of a few new programs focusing on the CIA, but ""24"" was unique in its setup. Each week's episode covered one hour of a very long, very bad day for Jack Bauer, with the conceit that all the events viewers were watching were happening in real time. Although the series was shot five months prior to the September 11 attacks, that event seemed to rule out ""24's"" success, Sutherland said. (It's not surprising he assumed as much, given that ""24's"" premiere episode featured a terrorist placing a bomb on a plane.) ""After that terrible day we personally thought the show was over and we shouldn't do it because it was too close to something that had really happened,"" Sutherland said. ""We were very surprised to see the audience reaction ... to the show early on. Somehow there was something that made Jack's character quite cathartic."" To producer Katz, audiences have connected with Bauer because he's ""selfless in a way that a lot of the other characters aren't. He's not ambitious, he doesn't care about what happens to him,"" the producer said. While that may make him unique in today's TV world, at the very least it'll help him stand apart. ""He's definitely a singular character,"" Katz noted. ""No one is occupying the same pace."" Now with his return, there's another fight that Bauer is facing that has nothing to do with a world leader. The question of whether audiences are interested in welcoming back this gun-toting archetype, and whether this event series will be a success or a disappointment for Fox, doesn't have a straightforward answer, said Variety's Brian Lowry. The TV critic wasn't that impressed with ""24's"" new event series, noting that it ""doesn't in any way reinvent the show."" Although, Lowry continued, that may be enough for fans who are content to watch what they would've seen in the mid-2000s ""in a more truncated form."" For Sutherland, the concern is less about ratings and the possibility that there could be more ""24"" on the horizon as it is about doing justice to the man he brought to life for nine years. During production on the event series, which is set and shot in London, ""we became so focused on trying to make these the best episodes of '24' period,"" Sutherland said. ""I feel very, very strong about the first eight episodes that we have completed. Now we just need to really bring it home.""","Jack Bauer returns to TV with event series ""24: Live Another Day""
The character doesn't quite fit the current antihero trend .
But the reason he became so popular is because of his ""get it done"" attitude ."
"(CNN) -- During a recent meeting, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin provided encouragement and sang patriotic songs with 10 agents who were expelled from the United States this month after they were accused of spying, state media reported. ""I am sure they will work in decent places. I am sure they will have an interesting and bright life,"" Putin told reporters Saturday as he described his meeting with the group, state media RIA-Novosti said. Putin, a former KGB officer, said that betrayal allowed the spy network to be uncovered, adding that he knew the names of those responsible, RIA-Novosti reported. Betrayers ""always end up badly taking to drink or drugs, in a gutter,"" he said, according to the news agency. The 10 Russian agents pleaded guilty in the United States earlier this month for failing to register as foreign agents and were ordered out of the country. In Washington, Attorney General Eric Holder said none of the 10 had passed classified information and therefore none had been charged with espionage. But U.S. officials said the group had been under observation by federal authorities for more than a decade. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told PBS' ""NewsHour"" that although the 10 agents didn't plead guilty to being spies, they ""were clearly caught in the business of spying."" After the pleas, the agents were ordered out of the country and the United States and Russia completed an elaborately choreographed spy swap, using chartered planes to exchange the 10 agents convicted in the U.S. with four Russians who had been imprisoned for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies. Putin told reporters Saturday that the life of a spy is difficult. ""Imagine - they have to master a foreign language as your own, think and speak it, fulfill tasks in the interests of their motherland for many years without counting on diplomatic immunity,"" he said.","Putin says he sang patriotic songs with expelled agents in a recent meeting .

"(CNN) -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. Read more: Why China needs to learn the three R's . The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that the top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income and 85% of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries, and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why? The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. Read more: Why China won't turn the other cheek over foreign policy . Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. Typical thinking is to attack the problem from the income side by increasing the tax on the rich and redistribute it to the poor. Chinese policymakers are working in a similar vein. Beijing plans to issue new guidance on income redistribution in December. Although information on this measure is still limited, it is likely to focus on the income side by regulating market wages -- a disappointment if it were true. Additional regulation will not only create market inefficiencies, it simply may not work -- if the past is any example, firms will find ways to circumvent regulation. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. Read more: Why China's reforms have hit a brick wall . Unfortunately, Chinese government has not given up the idea of spending on massive infrastructure projects to remedy its economic problems. Over the last 10 years, government spending on social welfare programs is only about 3% of the total spending. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Li Gan.","Key challenge for China's leaders is moving to a consumption-driven economy .

"(CNN) -- In my line of work I get to meet a lot of talented developers, entrepreneurs and people who are just plain passionate about technology and Africa. These people tell me their story, pitch me their start-ups and sometimes show me how they intend to change the world. I like it; it makes me feel like I am part of something amazing. Recently I was given the opportunity to mentor a few start-ups, and as interesting and as innovative as their ideas are, I am yet to meet a start-up in Africa that wants to build hardware that they hope will change the world. The general consensus with most of the start-ups that I have met is that they want to provide a service with the lowest barrier to entry so as to minimize costs. That makes sense. Companies that are daring to build hardware are outsourcing to China, sure it's cheaper to make things there but surely this hurts the continent's economic growth in the end, but I digress. There are African start-ups/companies that are building hardware but they seem to be getting the market's attention as easily as the established devices, which are understandable, I suppose. Why are tablets built by African start-ups (which there are) not getting enough traction in the market? Is it because they just don't stand up to the competition? There are quite a few cool projects that tackle hardware that get an initial burst when they launch, but their products don't seem to stay in the minds of everyday people for long, you know the consumers. Enter the Inye tablet, built by Nigerian hardware pioneer Saheed Adepoju, the man that founded Encipher Limited, which launched Nigeria's first Android-based tablet device. So there are gadget makers in Africa. Adepoju's tablet costs between $250 and $300 but according to his site he is out of stock, which could be a sign of great success or lack of funds. It's more the latter as Adepoju is looking for investors and, according to an interview with VC4Africa, he feels that African investors don't want to invest. ""Talking about venture capitalists in Africa, I am yet to see one that will invest... when I mean invest, I don't mean give seed funding of $50 000. I mean actually give $2 million to a business that is already gaining traction. So I believe they are very risk averse in investing in a market where they are not sure of a return on investment,"" said Adepoju. So is Africa facing an investor problem rather than a product problem? See also: Africa grows, but youth get left behind . It seems the consensus around this is that building physical products tends to be more expensive, and there is the problem of trying to compete with China. In the world of cheap and affordable tablets it seems the East is winning. All it takes is Apple or Samsung to announce a new product for a cheaper version of it to show up in the streets of China. Then there is the Way-C, a tablet designed by young entrepreneur Verone Mankou in the Republic of the Congo. The device, though designed in the Congo, was assembled in China like all major manufactures seem to do. Interestingly this Android-based device is targeted at West African countries and some countries in Europe. It also seems to have the support of MTN in Congo. See also: Bringing the Dreamliner to Africa . Perhaps this is the solution: partnering with mobile operators to launch affordable smart devices make in Africa aimed at the African market. Erik Hersman, a technology blogger, argues that the environment in Africa has ""bred a generation of problem-solvers"". ""Concurrently, we're a net importer of fabricated products from around the world. We might make some of our own software now, but we do little to nothing with hardware. How can we be the masters of our own future if we don't do any meaningful levels of fabrication?"" he adds. There are some really fascinating projects that look at fabrication and building hardware, such as the Maker Faire Africa project. A project that recognizes the need for Africa to take charge of its hardware future and encourages tinkering. The fair is organized around African innovation and gets people together to build gadgets in a tech DIY environment. So who else is building gadgets in Africa and why don't we know about them? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michelle Atagana.","Most African start-ups provide services rather than hardware to minimize costs .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government allegedly spied on prominent American Muslims under the same program it used to keep tabs on suspected terrorists, according to documents held by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. Journalists Glenn Greenwald and Murtaza Hussain, writing for The Intercept, said Snowden provided them documents that show that at least five American Muslims were monitored by their own government for periods between 2002 and 2008. The names of Republican Party operative and lawyer Faisal Gill; attorney Asim Ghafoor; international relations professor Hooshang Amirahmadi; Muslim civil liberties advocate Agha Saeed; and the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Affairs, Nihad Awad, all appear on a spreadsheet that purportedly lists individuals under NSA, CIA or FBI digital surveillance. The spreadsheet shows more than 7,000 e-mail addresses that appear to include the names of foreigners linked to terrorist organizations and U.S. citizens suspected of terrorist activity, according to The Intercept's report. But also on the list are the names of the five prominent Muslim-Americans, who have never been accused or charged with terrorism, and who deny any involvement in terrorism. Accusations of profiling . Two of them -- Gill and Ghafoor -- told CNN that they were targeted just because they are Muslim, a violation of their rights. ""I can't think of any other reason,"" Gill said. ""Absolutely. No other reason,"" Ghafoor said. Gill said he had a security clearance working in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""That's why my No. 1 reaction was of shock and surprise because there's nothing in my background that would lead any law enforcement agency to suspect me of any acts of terror,"" Gill said. Ghafoor is a civil rights attorney who represented clients in terrorism-related cases. ""If it's my clients that's causing it,"" Ghafoor said of the alleged spying on him, ""that's a reason for pause -- to find out what benefit does the government have listening in on the lawyer's communications with his or her client? What information can they use in court? ""Imagine a government lawyer telling his or her supervisors we had to listen to his calls and maybe we can go to court to beat him,"" Ghafoor said. Ghafoor said that the government apparently spied on his Yahoo e-mail -- not his e-mail with his law firm. ""I feel sorry for the agents who had to read all of that. There's not a whole lot you will get from my Yahoo account,"" Ghafoor said. Opinion: A year after Snowden, the real costs of NSA surveillance . Gill served in the Navy and later became a senior policy adviser in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush. Gill also worked as a spokesman for American Muslim Council, whose founder and executive director, Aldurahman M. Alamoudi, was sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2004 for activities with nations and groups with ties to terrorism. But the U.S. government allegedly spied on Gill from 2006 to 2008 -- after Gill left the council and when Gill was the Republican nominee for a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates, journalist Greenwald told CNN. Gill said he did not know Alamoudi and hardly had contact with him. Moreover, after he left the Muslim council, Gill disclosed that job to the U.S. government, which eventually gave him a security clearance. ""Surveillance needs to happen but there has to be a reason for it,"" Gill said. ""There was nothing in my background."" He asserted that authorities have a 99.6% success rate in obtaining warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance, or FISA, Court, which rules on U.S. requests to do surveillance on suspected terrorists and spies. Gill described that success rate ""ridiculous."" ""If you go to any county in the United States...it would not be that high. Clearly there is something wrong,"" Gill said. Gill told The Intercept that he believes that his e-mails were intercepted because he is Muslim. ""Look, I've never made an appearance or been a lawyer for anyone who's been (associated with terrorism),"" he told The Intercept. ""But there are plenty of other lawyers who have made those appearances and actually represented those governments, and their name isn't Faisal Gill and they weren't born in Pakistan and they aren't on this list."" U.S. response . In a joint statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department denied that the U.S. government conducts surveillance based on anyone's politics, religion or activism. ""Unlike some other nations, the United States does not monitor anyone's communications in order to suppress criticism or to put people at a disadvantage based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation or religion,"" the statement said. Any surveillance of U.S. citizens requires a court order from the FISA Court, the statement says.

"(CNN) -- Spain's Marc Marquez became the youngest rider to ever win the MotoGP world championship on Sunday after finishing third at the final race of the season in Valencia. The 20-year-old rookie only needed to finish fourth to ensure that the 13-point lead he took into the race could not be overhauled and he duly delivered. Two-time world champion, Jorge Lorenzo did all he could to put the pressure on his young rival taking the chequered flag to claim his eighth win of the season with Dani Pedrosa finishing second. But it was Marquez who stole all the headlines. Read more: The greatest battle ever on two wheels?

""I cannot explain what I feel, (it is) a dream come true,"" Marquez said. ""Maybe I was clear too early (in the season) and then Jorge came charging at the end and I had to keep my nerve in the final race. I am overjoyed,"" he added. Lorenzo finally ran out of track in his attempt to reign in the lead Marquez built in the first half of the season.

"(CNN) -- France's top court ruled Friday that French mayors cannot refuse to officiate same-sex marriages based on their personal, moral or religious beliefs. The Constitutional Council ruled that the same-sex marriage law does not infringe on the mayors' ""freedom of conscience"" and therefore should be applied. A group of seven mayors had filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council on September 18 stating their opposition to conducting same-sex marriage. A bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt was passed earlier this year by the French parliament and signed into law by President Francois Hollande. A growing number of countries around the world now allow same-sex marriage, the majority of them in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark and France. A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is also now law, though it isn't expected to come into force until 2014. Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa are the non-European countries in the group, according to the Pew Research Center.

"(CNN) -- With a litany of stubbed toes, sprained ankles, broken bones and blistered feet, Americans' feet are hurting. According to the National Foot Health Assessment 2012 released in June, 78% of adults 21 and older have experienced one or more foot problems in their lives. One common culprit of America's foot pain, especially during the summer, is the flip-flop. Whether it be on the beach, at the grocery store or even in the office, people love to free their feet. But flat sandals are nothing but bad news, says Bob Thompson, executive director for the Institute for Preventive Foot Health, who doesn't own a single pair. ""There's no heel support and structural support ... on that little slab of rubber."" Flip-flops have been around since at least 1500 B.C. They have been the choice of footwear for everyone from ancient Egyptians to California beach bums to Northwestern University's women's lacrosse team during a 2005 visit to the White House. Providing wearers with ease and emancipation, flip-flops are hard not to love, said Brian Curin, president and co-founder of Flip Flop Shops. ""It promotes this good mental state of health,"" he said. ""It's hard to be in a bad mood when you're wearing flip-flops."" Despite the shoe's popularity, Thompson said there are many risks involved with wearing flip-flops. Flip-flops aren't always easy on the feet . Although feet were designed to walk barefoot on Earth's natural surfaces (grass, sand or gravel), they were not prepared to endure the concrete, asphalt and steel that covers so many landscapes today, Thompson said. These unmovable surfaces are harsh on bare feet, and the thin rubber sole of many flip-flops does little to adequately absorb the shock they produce. Whether you are standing still or in motion, your feet are your first point of contact with the ground. The way your feet are positioned provides the foundation for the body's skeletal alignment. A flat shoe provides little arch or lateral support and even slight shifts in stance over time could lead to misalignment, causing pain in the knees, hips and back. ""Everything in your body starts with how you strike your heel to the ground,"" Thompson said. With nothing to keep a wearer's foot in place, flip-flops can also lead to tumbles, twisted ankles and even broken bones. ""You're taking your five toes and grabbing your shoe to make sure it doesn't slide out,"" Thompson said. ""That action of the toes grabbing the shoe on the toe box is not normal."" Shoes should flex where your foot bends, said Noreen Oswell, a podiatrist at The Foot Center at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Towers in Los Angeles. But the rubber soles of most flip-flops just bend all over the place, while the stiff soles of some stylish varieties may not bend at all, she said. Flip-flops' straps can also rub as a wearer walks, creating friction that leads to blisters. And because the lightweight sandals offer virtually no protection, it's more common for wearers' feet to get cuts, scrapes and bruises. ""A little layer of rubber -- it will protect you from a stone or a glass, but a nail could puncture that,"" Thompson said. Oswell said wearing flip-flops can be seriously detrimental for people whose feet are already at risk: For people with diabetes, who often have poor circulation and feeling in their feet, wearing flip-flops can expose them not only to injury but to infection. Those with balance issues may find it hard to feel secure when wearing rubbery flip-flops. And for those suffering from obesity, sporting the unstructured shoe can add strain to feet that are already stressed with carrying extra weight. The real problem is that people are wearing flip-flops while doing everything from skateboarding to gardening to running errands, Oswell said. ""It's not that they wear them,"" Oswell said. ""They overwear them."" But Curin said researchers, who typically refer in their studies to cheap rubber flip-flops that can be purchased at discount stores, must realize not all flip-flops are created equally. ""They seem to miss that whole other part of the industry that is creating really good footwear with innovation and technology,"" he said. Curin said oftentimes it's such sandals that alleviate problems, not cause them. ""I know a lot of people, both customers of our shop, friends and family, and people in the industry that wear flip-flops because they have problems,"" he said. ""It's more comfortable, easier to put on and off, and there's breathability."" Rather than buying a $2 pair of rubber flip-flops at the drugstore, Curin suggests spending the extra money on a pair with deep heel cups, high arch support and comfortable toe support, such as those from OluKai and Reef. Oswell agrees that there times when wearing flip-flops can be beneficial. In the health club locker room or at the community pool, flip-flops can protect feet against fungi and wart-causing viruses that can be acquired by walking around barefoot. The simple sandals can also shield feet against the beach's hot sand, which might otherwise cause skin to burn and blister on your walk to the water. But flip-flop use should be limited, experts say. Oswell's go-to shoe for everyday wear is a pair of tennis shoes. ""The number one best shoe for everybody is a good athletic shoe â€” something that laces up and has good structure to it,"" Oswell said. Thompson said people should always wear padded, acrylic-blend socks, which wick moisture away from the foot, under properly fitted shoes that have plenty of toe room and support. Crocs, which have some structure, cushion and breathability, can be an easy alternative to flip-flops, while sandals with a substantial foot bed and softer and broader straps are also a better option, Oswell said. For people who insist on indulging in flip-flops' cool convenience, Thompson's asks them to avoid uneven surfaces and wash feet thoroughly after the sandals come off. ""I tell people I'm not going to change your lifestyle; I just want you to know what the concerns are,"" he said.","78% of adults ages 21 and up have experienced one or more foot problems in their lives .

"(CNN) -- Empires, wars and various ethnic groups have rendered the map of Europe a patchwork upon which dozens of countries and languages vie for space. A trip to every one of these nations is possible if you have endless weeks stretching ahead of you, but if you're short on time, cash or motivation, you need to think smarter. That's where border towns come in. Where Europe's frontiers rub against one another lie cities in which diverse cultures clash and blend, creating places that showcase the best of all worlds. Here are a few of our favorites. Lille, France . Border: Belgium . The food-loving French have long held the cuisine of their northern neighbors in contempt. Some French expats even consider Belgium a hardship posting, presumably because of their disdain for unpretentious menus of moules, fries and waffles. In return, beer-chugging Belgians could be forgiven for mocking the wanting concoctions of water, yeast, hops and barley consumed to the south. (Though, to be fair, French microbreweries are starting to make up for lost time). No such concerns in the northern French city of Lille. Here traditional local restaurants combine the intricacies of Gallic dining culture -- making extensive use of the region's tasty maroilles cheese -- with the bold beer selections favored further to the north. At Estaminet Chez la Vieille (60 rue de Gand; +33 328 364006; website in French only) the beef in beer, and roast chicken in cheese, are worth the trip. The city also blends Flemish with classical Parisian architecture -- the art deco Coilliot House (14 Rue de Fleurus) is a prime example. And its Palais des Beaux Artes de Lille (18 Rue de Valmy; +33 3 20 06 78 00) has one of the best collections of classic art outside the capital. Bratislava, Slovakia . Borders: Austria, Hungary . Close to the border of both Austria and Hungary, the proud capital of Slovakia has only recently emerged from a centuries-long identity crisis that still resonates around fairy tale streets that once charmed Hans Christian Andersen. Bratislava -- or as it has variously been known, Istropolis, Bresburg, Pressburg and, briefly, Wilson City -- was for 300 years the capital of the Hungarian Kingdom. Meanwhile, its close ties with nearby Vienna once saw the two cities share a tram line. It was also, until the ""velvet divorce"" of 1993, part of the old Czechoslovakia. The reconstructed Bratislava Castle (+421 2 544 114 44) has been witness to most of this and is a good place to savor a city that's enjoyed a unique place at the crossroads of central Europe, as well as the imperious views it commands over the nearby borders. Traditional local cuisine is a hearty melange of dishes influenced by Austria and Hungary. Presburg (Michalska 382/4; +421 2 544 384 55) or Leberfinger (Viedenska cesta 257; +421 2 623 175 90) are both good options for food. Malmo, Sweden . Border: Denmark . Another country-hopping city that continues to bear the imprint of its former occupants, Malmo lies on the southern coast of what's now Sweden but was, until the 17th century, Danish. The two nations are now umbilically connected by the majestic eight-kilometer Oresund Bridge, which plugs Malmo almost directly into the Danish capital of Copenhagen and serves as a potent symbol of their close ties (not least in the gripping Danish-Swedish TV drama ""The Bridge""). You can still hunt for Danish influence in the buildings of Malmo's Gamla Stan (Old Town), although it's more fun these days to contemplate modern architecture, including the twisty Turning Torso skyscraper (Lilla Varvsgatan; +46 40 17 45 00; website in Swedish) or the offshoot of Stockholm's Moderna Museet art collection, housed in an old electric plant (Gasverksgatan 22; +46 40 6857 937). Denmark still has something to offer though, as can be seen at the sublime Malmo public library extension, designed by Danish architect Henning Larsen (Kung Oscars vag; +46 40 660 85 00). San Sebastian, Spain . Border: France . The sheer size of France, and its numerous borders, mean an inevitable reappearance in this list -- this time pushing its influence into Spain. In San Sebastian, just 20 kilometers south of the border, France's contribution can be seen in the city's neat urban layout and the Belle Epoque architecture of its grand casino-turned-city hall and Victoria Eugenia theater (Republica Argentina 2, +34 943 48 11 60). Also, as more than one grumbling tourist has pointed out, in the prices that are typically higher than the rest of provincial Spain. The French would also no doubt like to take credit for San Sebastian's disproportionately large number of internationally rated restaurants. And although the surrounding Basque region does have its own strong culinary traditions, French fine dining has clearly made its mark at places such as Arzak (Av. del Alcalde Jose Elosegi; 273, +34 943 27 84 65), among a trio of restaurants in the city to earn three Michelin stars. Trieste, Italy . Border: Slovenia . While this Italian port lies close to the border of Slovenia and within striking distance of Croatia, its heritage lies firmly within the same middle European empires that once laid claim to Prague, Vienna and Budapest. And so from Italy we have operetta, piazzas (the monumental Piazza dell'UnitÃ  d'Italia is one of Europe's largest) and gelato, the latter being unsurpassed at Chocolat (via Cavana 15/b; +39 040 30 05 24). From Vienna we get literary salons of the kind that drew ""Ulysses"" author James Joyce to Trieste. Most have now fallen by the wayside, but a recent campaign appears to have saved Joyce's mahogany-lined favorite, Caffe San Marco (Via Cesare Battisti, 18). And from Hungary we get places like Buffet da Pepi, small eateries where pretty much everything on the menu contains pig, beer or pickled cabbage (via della Cassa di Risparmio 3; +39 040 366 858). Kirkenes, Norway . Borders: Finland, Russia . A chilly 400 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle lies Kirkenes, a small Norwegian town located between the borders of Finland and Russia. Admittedly, there isn't much in Kirkenes to influence -- for a lot of the year it's too shrouded in gloom and snow to distinguish from other settlements in region. But as a visit to the Sor-Varanger museum (Hvistendalsgate 31; +47 789 428 90) confirms, Russian revolutions, czars and Finnish migrants have all left their mark. Kirkenes isn't without its attractions. During the literally endless days of summer, the fjords and forests are worth exploring. Winter brings spectacular displays of northern lights and the almost obligatory Snow Hotel (Sandnesdalen 14; +47 789 705 40). There's also a Russian market (Barents Spektakel) on the last Thursday of every month, where you can buy matryoshka nesting dolls as well as porcelain and, because apparently nothing says Russia like a pair of knitted toe warmers, socks.","Too rushed, poor or lazy to tour the continent? Here are places to cut corners .

"(CNN) -- Oceans around the globe could inject an extra $50 billion into the world's economy -- if fisheries were sustainably managed, a new report backed by Prince Charles shows. Prince Charles, a keen environmentalist, hosted a meeting in London Thursday bringing together representatives of the fishing industry, governments, campaigning groups and investors. The aim was to transform the way the conservation efforts are funded -- from philanthropic and public sources of money, to business investment. ""Success would provide a much-needed example of how to regenerate our planet's dangerously depleted, threadbare and under-performing natural capital while also providing a realistic economic return,"" Prince Charles said. Fisheries contribute more than $270 billion to global GDP and employ hundreds of millions of people around the world, according to the report from the Prince of Wales charity. An additional $160 billion comes from related businesses, such as ship building or fish processing industries. But environmentalists argue the world's oceans are being exploited, and that will eventually cost the industry billions. The report points to the Canadian Grand Banks cod fisheries, where unsustainable fishing led to its collapse, as an example of the impact. The report argues global demand for fish and seafood have pushed prices up since early 2000s -- but stocks have remained constrained. It says sustainable fishing would ensure a bigger and healthier fish stock, producing yields in the longer term. ""Oceans are the single most important resource in human history,"" Fred Krupp, the President of Environmental Defence Fund said. ""We can transform our oceans into a sustainable, enduring resource -- one that provides more fish in the sea, more food on the plate, and more economic prosperity,"" he said. The Global Ocean Commission has also sounded warnings about the high seas, saying in June that there was a risk of exploitation in oceans outside national jurisdictions. ""There are 'too many boats trying to catch too few fish' yet, despite this clear overcapacity, governments still grant at least US$30 billion a year in fisheries subsidies,"" the commission said. The commission said the majority of sustainable fishing in these waters is done by only 10 countries -- most of them developed countries that can afford subsidizing the expensive operations of sending large boats into remote corners of the oceans. ""Economy and ecology do not have to be locked into an irreconcilable struggle,"" the Prince said. Prince Charles, along with the Environmental Defense Fund and a fisheries network 50in10, is now calling for investors to transform the industry into a more sustainable model -- and find that extra $50 billion.","A new report backed by Prince Charles says fisheries could bring $50 billion .

"(CNN) -- Young, urban and culturally savvy, meet the Afropolitans -- a new generation of Africans and people of African descent with a very global outlook. Something of a buzzword in the diaspora, the term ""Afropolitan"" first appeared in a 2005 magazine article by Nigerian/Ghanaian writer Taiye Selasi. Selasi wrote about multilingual Africans with different ethnic mixes living around the globe -- as she put it ""not citizens but Africans of the world."" Now the term has spread, used not just by New York hipsters and in trendy European capitals but in Africa's own multicultural megacities. But just who are these Afropolitans? Brendah Nyakudya is the editor of Afropolitan magazine, produced in South Africa. A Zimbabwean based in Johannesburg, who has lived in London, she has the kind of international background that typifies an Afropolitan. ""I have African roots but I've kind of been raised by the world, and that's helped form my identity,"" she says. See also: Congo's designer dandies . Her magazine is aimed at successful urban 30-somethings -- intelligent, upwardly mobile and politically aware -- most of whom she says can be described as Afropolitans. ""An Afropolitan is someone who has roots in Africa, raised by the world, but still has an interest in the continent and is making an impact, is feeding back into the continent and trying to better it,"" according to Nyakudya. She also believes the term can apply to non-Africans. ""We like to think that it doesn't matter where you were born, if you find yourself on the continent and you love the continent, that makes you an Afropolitan,"" says Nyakudya. But for some people the term isn't so easy to define. Tolu Ogunlesi is a Nigerian journalist who is based in Lagos. He studied for his Masters degree in England and last year chaired a debate at London's V&A museum on what it means to be an Afropolitan. He says it's a problematic term and its meaning is hard to pin down. ""It's one of those words that people invest with their own meanings, people interpret it as they want,"" he says. ""Some people dismiss the concept entirely, saying there's nothing that people who are called Afropolitans share in common -- what they have in common is superficial."" He feels the term is too often applied only to those living in the diaspora. ""It's a problematic term because it's supposed to combine (the words) African and cosmopolitan,"" says Ogunlesi. ""What it should mean is an African person in an urban environment, with the outlook and mindset that comes with urbanization -- people who live Lagos, Nairobi, and have this world-facing outlook. ""But people who consider themselves Afropolitan are not here in the continent, they are out there in the global capitals."" See also: Sounds of the Sahara . Minna Salami, who blogs as Msafropolitan, is a true global citizen. Born in Finland to a Nigerian father and a Finnish mother she has lived in Nigeria, Sweden, Spain and New York, and now lives in London. She agrees that some people see Afropolitanism as existing only outside Africa, but says that, in reality, it applies just as much to people living in the continent. ""Some people have interpreted it as a diaspora movement but it absolutely isn't,"" she says. ""When you go back to the original term 'African and cosmopolitanism,' Africa has very many cosmopolitan cities ... and in those cities you have art scenes and music and all kinds of creativity that's influenced by cosmopolitanism."" For her it's a movement that is politically aware and has an obligation to correct decades of Africa being misrepresented as a ""dark, failing continent."" ""Afropolitans are a group of people who are either of African origin or influenced by African culture, who are emerging internationally using African cultures in creative ways to change perceptions about Africa,"" Salami says. Salami adds that social media has been key to the movement, creating global citizens who are in tune with the same cultural trends and political issues. Ogunlesi agrees. He says that while ordinary Nigerians don't define themselves as Afropolitans, the prevalence of the internet and satellite television means young Nigerians do have a global outlook and are exposed to much of the same pop culture as youngsters all over the world. And social media also means that the coolest in contemporary African culture is quick to travel around the world. African and Africa-influenced pop culture is a key part of the movement. Afropolitanism implies a certain type of cool, with an aesthetic influenced by African style magazine Arise and a soundtrack provided by anyone from Nigerian musician Femi Kuti to South African ""township tech"" producer Spoeke Mathambo. But Nyakudya insists that to be a true Afropolitan takes more than a multi-cultural background and the right record collection -- it means having a commitment to making the continent a better place. She says: ""From philanthropic work to trying to lobby for political reform there's a lot that needs to be done in Africa and if you're going to call yourself an Afropolitan you need to show what you're doing to deserve to be called an Afropolitan.""","The term ""Afropolitan"" is often used to refer to young Africans with a global outlook .

"(CNN) -- Jared Remy, the son of famed Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy, pleaded guilty in a Massachusetts court Tuesday to killing his fiancÃ©e Jennifer Martel just days after he was arrested for assaulting her. Remy, 35, was sentenced Tuesday to life in state prison without the possibility of parole after changing his plea to guilty after he was charged with the August 2013 stabbing death of Martel, 27. ""Jared Remy perceived that he was losing control of Jennifer Martel and lashed out at her in a fit of rage, killing her,"" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement. ""Today, with this plea, the defendant has been held accountable for his actions. This plea ensures that Jared Remy will spend the rest of his natural life in prison."" The gruesome details of the case rippled through the small community of Waltham, Massachusetts, after questions surfaced about why Remy had not been held on bail after his arrest just two days before the slaying. Remy was arrested on August 13 for assault and battery after Martel told police that Remy had grabbed her neck and head and ""slammed her face against a mirror"" in the bathroom during an argument, according to a Waltham police report. Martel fled the home with the couple's daughter to a neighbor's home and called 911. Martel could be heard on the call, which was released by police, saying ""(Remy) is just a very violent person who is on lots of medication who might need serious help."" Domestic violence facts . When Martel filed for a restraining order, she told police that Remy had been arrested before for assaulting an ex-girlfriend, according to police. Remy was arrested by Waltham police after the incident and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was arraigned the next morning and released after posting just $40 for the bail fee, according to Waltham District Court documents. The next day, Remy returned to the Waltham home he shared with Martel and their child and stabbed her multiple times. The couple's daughter was home at the time, according to police. The Middlesex district attorney's office conducted an internal review after Martel's death, which resulted in some countywide procedural changes on how domestic abuse cases are handled. Remy is the son of famed Red Sox color commentator Jerry Remy. The elder Remy played for the Red Sox as a second baseman from 1978 to 1984 and was voted an all-star his first year with the team. Remy is also considered the president of Red Sox nation, according to the Red Sox homepage. Massachusetts abolished the death penalty in the early 1980s when lawmakers ruled it was unconstitutional. Remy will spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.

"(CNN) -- Construct a film that includes chiseled, handsome Hollywood actors like Matthew McConaughey and Alex Pettyfer portraying strippers, as is the case with Friday's ""Magic Mike,"" and you can guess that veiled promise of nudity will draw some moviegoers. But add Channing Tatum to that mix, and the stakes are raised even higher. The 32-year-old actor has steadily built a career over the past seven years, folding teen films, action flicks, comedies and romantic dramas into his filmography. Yet this seems to be the year that Tatum's success has reached a crescendo, the moment at which the actor is poised to reach a new level of stardom. ""Magic Mike,"" directed by Steven Soderbergh and inspired by Tatum's own brief stint as a stripper in his younger years, has caused a frenzy of anticipation, leading box office observers to expect this to be another solid turnout for the actor. If that happens, it will be just the latest in a string of successes for Tatum, who had a strong showing with both February's ""The Vow"" and March's ""21 Jump Street,"" says Phil Contrino, editor of Boxoffice.com. ""I can't think of an actor who's having a stronger year in terms of building their drawing power,"" Contrino says, estimating that ""Magic Mike"" will pull in $29 million on opening weekend, taking second place behind ""Brave."" That would ride on the heels of the romantic drama ""The Vow,"" which ""turned him into kind of a more solidified romantic interest,"" Contrino says, and earned $194.6 million globally, as well as his comedic success with Jonah Hill, ""21 Jump Street,"" which earned $195.6 million worldwide. That movie not only had a solid box office run, but it also showed just how funny Tatum can be. ""He's coming off these two very huge movies, and then you have ['Magic Mike']. It's great timing,"" Contrino says. ""Not only can he be in a romantic role because women would love to be with him, but he can be in an action role because he fits that mold too. In terms of a box office draw, that's a dangerous combination."" Hollywood has taken notice, says Forbes' Dorothy Pomerantz, who pegs Tatum as one of the actors who has the most to gain or lose this summer. ""When you talk to anybody in this town and you say, who's the next big movie star, [it's] Channing Tatum, Channing Tatum, Channing Tatum,"" says Pomerantz. ""He is the one that everybody has their eye on, everybody's expecting to be a guy who can draw audiences, [and] who can draw a lot of money."" More specifically -- and most importantly -- he's been able to draw profit. ""He's not just minting box office money -- lots of people can do that,"" Pomerantz says. ""He's making movies that are being made on a small budget that are just churning out the dollars. I think when you talk about this being a make or break moment for him, that's apt."" Yet Tatum hasn't gotten this far by being a repeat critical darling or a constant nominee at awards shows. Instead, he's used strategic film choices, an innate gift that lures in audiences and a reputation for a diligent work ethic to go from the fringes of the industry to high-profile features, such as his upcoming role in the Wachowskis' sci-fi film, ""Jupiter Ascending."" Anne Fletcher, who directed Tatum in his breakout lead role in 2006's dance-centric movie ""Step Up,"" says she knew instinctively that Tatum was right for the part, however green he may have been at the time. ""Channing and I are each other's firsts -- first starring role, first directorial,"" Fletcher says. ""I think a lot of [the casting] was instinctual. ... We auditioned him and he was fantastic. The thing about Channing was that a) he could move, and b) he had so much charisma. It just poured out of him ... and without question that would permeate on screen."" ""Step Up"" went on to gross $114 million worldwide and spawn a franchise, with a fourth film arriving this summer, and it was also a stepping stone for Tatum to show that he could dance as well as ""hold the camera's attention,"" says Peter Debruge, senior film critic for the trade publication Variety. "" 'Step Up' sort of took Hollywood by surprise in terms of how popular it was, and I don't think anyone would've thought that would be the film that would launch an acting career,"" Debruge says. ""Especially because what he really brought to that were dance moves."" Casting directors Amanda Mackey and Cathy Sandrich Gelfond, who have cast Tatum in 2006's ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,"" 2009's ""Fighting,"" and this year's ""The Vow,"" say that the actor has been able to carve out a space for himself as an American guy's guy who can show sensitivity. ""The thing that I think Channing does so naturally and brilliantly is ... he has an innate honesty and charm that is just beguiling,"" Mackey says. ""And I think it's completely natural and I think it's exactly actually who he is. I don't think it's about performance, I think it's about something in his being that's very honest."" Debruge agrees, saying that while he doesn't necessarily look to Tatum for an exciting, groundbreaking performance, he also doesn't overlook what the actor does well, which is ""connecting directly with an audience."" ""What he's doing is low-key and very natural,"" Debruge says. ""In some ways, it appears so effortless that there's this sense that anyone could do it. And I think it's really a mistake to dismiss it as being that simplistic."" Debruge adds that Tatum's performance in ""Magic Mike"" is the kind where ""critics can once again sharpen their knives when looking for the chance to break down his performance, but I think it's a little bit more complicated, what he's doing,"" he says. ""I don't think he's a great thespian, the kind of person who's shown that he can deliver complexity, but there is a subtlety, a casualness that feels familiar and that feels like you can relate to the characters that he plays, that's not accidental and is absolutely part of the performance."" Thus far, though, critics seem to have fallen for Tatum's particular brand of nonchalant charm in ""Magic Mike."" Observers are curious to see who turns out for the film, as well as how well it will perform. Pomerantz, for one, predicts that even if ""Magic Mike"" is a flop, it won't hurt Tatum's trajectory. ""There's something about him that's working right now, and Hollywood is rooting for him, [and] I think the audience is rooting for him,"" she says. And if this movie is a hit, she adds, ""it takes all these suspicions that Hollywood has about him as a leading man and shoots them through the roof. He is the guy.""","Channing Tatum has had a successful year with ""The Vow"" and ""21 Jump Street""

"(CNN) -- A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology won $40,000 in a high-tech scavenger hunt on Saturday by discovering the location of 10 red weather balloons. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced that the MIT team was the first group in the contest to report the latitude and longitude coordinates of all 10 balloons, which were scattered across the United States. DARPA is the U.S. military's research arm. Saturday's challenge is the latest in a series that the agency has hosted since 2004. This contest was designed to test the way social networking and lesser-known Web-based techniques can help accomplish a large-scale, time-critical task. DARPA said in a written statement that the MIT team discovered the locations of the 8-foot-wide balloons less than nine hours after they launched, around 10 a.m. ET. It did not say exactly when the task was completed or how many groups had participated. Johanna Jones, a spokeswoman for DARPA, said the hunt was designed in part to give the military new ideas on ways to operate in a range of situations, from natural disasters to combat. The agency said it plans to meet with teams to discuss their approaches and strategies used to build networks, collect information, and participate in the contest. The challenge was announced on October 29 -- 40 years after the first message was sent on ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet. DARPA said it hopes the contest will lead to advances in the way the military communicates and coordinates activities among multiple geographically separated groups. On MIT's Web site, a link was posted inviting people to sign up to help find the balloons and urging them to invite their friends. It said the MIT Red Balloon Challenge Team ""is interested in studying information flow in social networks, so if we win, we're giving all the money away to the people who help us find the balloons!"" It detailed a chain for giving away the money, beginning with $2,000 given to each person who first sent in the coordinates of each balloon. iReporter on balloon challenge . ""We're giving $2,000 per balloon to the first person to send us the correct coordinates, but that's not all -- we're also giving $1,000 to the person who invited them.

"(CNN) -- Fans of China's outspoken artist Ai Weiwei are not shy when it comes to posing nude. The nude photos are part of an effort by Ai fans to show their support for the controversial artist who says he's being investigated on porn charges. The latest allegations come after Ai was slapped with tax evasion charges, which he says is punishment for his outspoken criticism of the Chinese government. Beginning this month, thousands of Ai supporters have donated money to help him pay an estimated 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) fine that the Beijing tax bureau says his design company Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd. owes in back taxes. Ai paid $1.3 million last week to prevent his wife, who runs the company, from going to jail and to appeal the charges. Only moral victory possible against China, dissident says . Supporters donated an estimated 9 million yuan to help him pay the fines and now they're lending their bodies by posting photos online. More than 100 online supporters from around the world have posted images of themselves in nude poses -- a nod to a photo of Ai titled ""One Tiger, Eight Breasts"" taken last year with four women -- all of them nude. As a result, Ai says he is under investigation on porn charges. The photo tactic has grown so quickly that a new website has surfaced featuring posts by fans with the slogan, ""Listen, Chinese Government: Nudity is not Pornography. On blogger writes, ""Don't be afraid to bare all! The body is beautiful!"" Another one says, ""I love my body and freedom."" Photos run the creative gamut from racy shower scenes to just breasts or buttocks. Others hide their private parts with photos of Ai, pose like famous statues by Rodin, display their middle fingers to the camera while covering their faces or even pose while on the toilet. Despite the support, Ai says he is not optimistic when it comes to his tax charges and says he doesn't believe in justice from the government since his detention for 81 days in April.","Chinese artist Ai Weiwei says he's being investigated on porn charges .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, I was free. On Wednesday, I became a criminal. Tuesday, we mourned the loss of President Nelson Mandela -- a leader whose presidency saw the first constitutional prohibition on anti-gay discrimination. On Wednesday, the India Supreme Court denied my freedom as a gay man, upholding a nearly 153-year-old colonial law that could result in my own imprisonment. Tuesday, on Human Rights Day, the story of my gay friend fleeing India because his family threatened to kill him went viral. Today, India's highest court has wiped away four years of progress following the Delhi High Court ruling that set me free. Religious groups -- have been fighting to overturn the high court ruling for three years, and have succeeded. I was 19 when I was set free. And I remember the feeling of hope as I heard the news -- not just that my country was on a new path, but that my life was. I sat down with my family and came out to them. So many of my friends did the same, all across the country. When I heard the news Wednesday, I wondered about all those people who are living with the burden of hiding, with the fear of harassment and violence. I wondered about those who had come out of the closet over the last four years, and if they, like me, heard in the Supreme Court ruling a clear message to go back in. I will not, much to my mother's distress. I called her upon hearing the news. She wasn't always by my side -- she has a journey of her own over the last four years. But last year she marched in the Gay Pride parade with me. Today, she's worried about her son. ""I told you,"" she said, ""it's not that easy."" But I refuse to retreat. With this ruling, according to ILGA, India becomes the 77th country worldwide that views lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people as criminals. Just this week, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Samantha Power, spoke out strongly against these laws, saying ""To criticize the criminalization of LGBT status is not cultural imperialism. To deny gays and lesbians the right to live freely and to threaten them with discrimination and even death is not a form of moral or religious Puritanism. It's in fact barbarism."" As I write this, I sit in the Human Rights Campaign offices in Washington, D.C., as a fellow with the Global Engagement Program. Upon accepting this fellowship, I knew I would be working to shine a spotlight on this barbarism. But I never imagined my own homeland would take center stage. We all had hope. Now, our opponents do. On Twitter, the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer is cheering the ruling, saying the U.S. Supreme Court should follow India's example. Back in my home country, where the only chance of reversing this decision lies with the Parliament, the conservatives who give passes to anti-LGBT ""honor"" killings are downright giddy. But their enthusiasm will only make my voice louder. In President Barack Obama's eulogy at the funeral of Mandela, he said that, ""he tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well. Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals."" While India's Supreme Court justices took my freedom, they cannot take my hope.

"Fall River, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The New England Patriots are refusing to voluntarily turn over scouting reports and psychological tests to the defense team of former star tight end Aaron Hernandez. ""This is not a fishing expedition,"" Patriots attorney Andrew Phelan told a Massachusetts Superior Court judge during a hearing Wednesday. The Patriots cut Hernandez loose on June 26, 2013, the same day he was arrested in the slaying of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. He has pleaded not guilty to murder in the Lloyd killing and those of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in 2012. Hernandez' defense team wants a judge to issue a subpoena to be served on the three-time Super Bowl championship team. ""We never thought the Pats would refuse our request,"" Hernandez co-counsel Michael Fee told the judge. The Patriots argue that psychological tests done before the 2010 NFL draft and scouting reports that can go as far back as the childhood of a prospective player don't have a proven role in Hernandez's case because they were conducted three years before Lloyd's death. ""They must be relevant to an issue in dispute in the case, "" Phelan told the court. ""But he's not putting his state of mind at issue,"" the attorney said of Hernandez. The defense argues it is relevant, but has not yet made clear what the information may play in its case. ""Any record bearing on a defendant's psychological function, illnesses or afflictions, addiction, cognitive ability, social interactions, behavior under stress, relationship with authority and other such factors are undeniably relevant to the defense of an individual charged with First Degree Murder,"" Fee wrote in a motion. The team says its scouting report contains ""trade secrets,"" adding that revealing them could ""cause competitive harm to the Patriots."" The report includes an athlete's speed, stats and injuries, including concussions. The Patriots have offered to allow the defense to look at, but not have, a one and half page summary of a psychological test administered during the 2010 NFL Combine called the Troutwine Athletic Profile (TAP). It takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be given to athletes ages 13-25, according to court records. The team claims the summary is the only thing it can provide because of copyright restrictions, adding the company is the proper record keeper. Lawyers for Hernandez are hotly contesting that claim. The Patriots are offering to provide Hernandez' lawyers with a 317 pages of ""employment and medical/training room records without a court order."" But first, they want a current signed release form, pointing out one previously provided by his attorneys was outdated. The judge will hold another hearing on the case July 22. Will Hernandez get the subpoena he's seeking from the court? University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann says he probably will. ""I could see the judge limiting the order to only psychological aspects of those reports, given the trade secret concern raised by the Patriots,"" McCann told CNN. ""The judge has an incentive to be fairly permissive in allowing Hernandez access to these reports since denial would be grounds for a Hernandez appeal should he be convicted.""

"(CNN) -- Several boaters are missing after separate incidents on Lake Michigan over the weekend, the Coast Guard said. Near Chicago, searchers were looking for four people Sunday about seven miles offshore, where rescuers had pulled two boaters from the water. One rescued person ""was in a hypothermic state but reported four or five additional people in the water, reportedly all wearing life jackets,"" the Coast Guard said. The boaters entered the water late Saturday night during a voyage from New Buffalo, Michigan, to Chicago. Officials didn't say what happened to their boat. In a separate incident, rescuers pulled five people from the lake near the Michigan City Lighthouse in Indiana Saturday. They called off the search for a sixth person who was missing Sunday morning. ""The six people reportedly jumped off their boat into the water to escape the heat, but then their boat started drifting away and they could not get back to it,"" the Coast Guard said. ""None of the people in the water were reportedly wearing life jackets."" Temperatures in Lake Michigan are much lower than normal for this time of year, the Coast Guard said, after a long and cold winter. In southern Lake Michigan, the water temperature is 45 degrees, officials said.","The Coast Guard searches for missing boaters in Lake Michigan near Chicago .

"(CNN) -- It seems ""the worst drought that California has ever seen"" has become even worse. It has been a month since Gov. Jerry Brown said the state was facing perhaps ""the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" New numbers released Thursday are painting an even dimmer picture. Currently, the whole state of California is ""abnormally dry,"" according to a weekly report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's a little worse than last week, when 98% of the state had that designation, the report said. Brown has already urged Californians to cut back on water use. He's already called for a voluntary 20% conservation effort statewide. ""It's important to wake all Californians to the serious matter of the drought and lack of rain,"" Brown said in January. ""We are in an unprecedented, serious situation that people should pause and reflect on how we're dependent on rain, Mother Nature and each other."" Drought hits ski towns hard . President Barack Obama was in California last week announcing a new federal initiative aimed at helping farms and communities. The exact financial impact of the historic drought in California has yet to be calculated. But the financial blow could be in the billions of dollars, especially if the 2012 national drought is any indication. That disaster cost the country $30 billion, according to the National Climatic Data Center. CNN's Dave Hennen contributed to this report.","The whole state is ""abnormally dry,"" report says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Fliers beware. As soon as Monday, travelers nationwide could face flight delays because of the federal spending cuts, with delays averaging 10, 20, and 30 minutes at major hub airports during peak periods, but soaring on days when controller furloughs force airports to shut down runways. In those infrequent circumstances, delays could exceed an hour at Los Angeles International and hit three-and-a-half hours at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport, top federal transportation officials warned. Airlines ask court to block FAA furloughs . And those delays, long as they are, could grow longer if compounded by bad weather or equipment failures, officials said. A dour Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood and his Federal Aviation Administration chief, Michael Huerta, briefed the airlines on Tuesday and reporters on Thursday, saying the public needs to be informed about the impending impacts of the forced spending cuts, known as the sequester. The Department of Transportation needs to cut $1 billion from its budget, with some $637 million of that coming from the FAA's $16 billion budget. Congressional Republicans say the DOT could have chosen less harmful cuts. But LaHood, himself a Republican, says there's no way to cut $1 billion without impacting services. ""We have done everything (possible) to find a billion dollars, and if we had our way we probably wouldn't be sitting here,"" LaHood said. ""This is very painful. This is not what we signed up for. This is a dumb idea. Sequester is a dumb idea. Not one person in America would use the sequester to figure out their budget. It's a meat-ax approach."" LaHood and Huerta said impacts will reduce the efficiency of the system, but will not imperil passengers' safety. ""I want to make it abundantly clear, we will not take a backseat to safety during sequestration,"" added LaHood. Furlough notices have been sent to the DOT's 55,000 employees, telling them that they will be placed on unpaid leave for 11 days by September 30, the end of the fiscal year. All employees face furloughs, including the 47,000 FAA employees, many of whom are air traffic controllers. ""We cannot avoid furloughs,"" LaHood said. Huerta said the nation's large hub airports face ""heavy to moderate"" delays, and delays are likely to ripple to other airports. The impact is uneven at the hub airports because of differing traffic volumes and configurations, he said. Airports can have intersecting or non-intersecting runways, single or multiple control towers, and varying technology. Furloughs will be managed at the airport facility level, LaHood said. In an effort to predict the impact, the FAA studied actual airport traffic at 13 major airports on March 29, a clear weather Friday. Mondays and Fridays traditionally are the busiest air travel days. The FAA looked at the actual traffic and the rate at which it can accept aircraft and calculated the impact of fewer controllers. The FAA said its study showed a ""wide range of impacts,"" and it predicted ""average delays"" and ""maximum delays"" at six airports it considers illustrative: . Newark's Liberty: Average delay: 20.5 minutes. Maximum delay: 51 minutes. The FAA said peak air traffic already exceeds the airport's capacity. A reduced staffing could lead to ground delays, which is a hold on traffic at the originating airport until the load is reduced. New York City's John F. Kennedy: Average delay: 12 minutes. Maximum delay: 50 minutes. The FAA expects it will have to introduce ground-delay programs to meet afternoon demand on busy days. New York City's LaGuardia: Average delay: 30.5 minutes. Maximum delay: 80 minutes. The airport's small, compact size contributes to difficulties storing planes on the ground, Huerta said. Chicago O'Hare: Average delay: 50.4 minutes. Maximum delay: 132 minutes. O'Hare has two towers. Furloughs will lead O'Hare to occasionally shutter one of its two control towers, closing one runway and reducing takeoffs and landings. Los Angeles International: Average delay: 10.1 minutes. Maximum delay: 67 minutes. Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson: Average delay: 11.3 minutes. Maximum delay: 210 minutes. Safety limitations could create situations where the FAA would not be able to use all of the airport's five parallel runways. The FAA said it plans to release predictions for seven other airports: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Philadelphia, Charlotte, Chicago Midway, San Diego and San Francisco. LaHood said the FAA shared the information with airlines on Tuesday. The officials called the maximum delays ""an estimate... a forecast."" Of the most extreme delays, Huerta said, ""We think they will be infrequent."" Criticism came from all directions Thursday. Airlines for America, which represents major U.S. airlines, said it is reviewing legal options to prevent the furloughs. ""We have consistently said -- and we have three, third-party legal opinions affirming -- that the FAA has the discretion to implement cuts without furloughing air traffic controllers,"" said spokeswoman Jean Medina. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, said ""savings can and should be found elsewhere."" ""I am baffled by the administration's continued insistence on putting its top-line message -- that we can't cut a dime without severe consequences -- before the safety and well-being of Americans."" Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, blamed Republicans for ""refusing to work"" for a budget compromise and slammed the FAA for not doing more to warn the public. ""I am deeply disappointed that the agency has failed to inform the public on how dramatically their travel plans will be impacted in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said. ""The FAA immediately needs to do substantially more to explain the impact of sequestration on the traveling public."" Industry groups said the impact of furloughs would be far-reaching. ""For the airlines, it means significant cuts in capacity and major financial losses,"" said the Air Line Pilots Association, International. ""For pilots, it could span from challenges getting to work to losing their jobs. For passengers, it could mean a lot of time waiting in airports and not making it to their destinations on time."" A group representing airports Thursday also warned that the FAA furloughs could impact passengers. Airports Council International - North America said it is ""standing ready to assist passengers whose travel plans are disrupted by sequestration-related furloughs."" The FAA also plans to close control towers at 149 small- to medium-sized airports on June 15. It postponed plans to close the airports beginning April 7 to give airports a chance to find alternate sources of funds for the towers.","Transportation officials say travelers will wait, and wait, and wait out effects of sequester .

"Miami (CNN) -- A satellite whose orbit is degrading will fall back to Earth Friday afternoon, but only some of its pieces will survive the fiery ride through the atmosphere, NASA scientists said Thursday. The pieces are not expected to come down over North America, scientists said, but where they'll likely land is something NASA expects to narrow down over the next 24 hours. Most of the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) is made of aluminum and will burn up on re-entry, NASA said. Of the satellite's 6 tons, only about half a ton of it will make it back to Earth. The components that won't burn are made of stainless steel, titanium and beryllium. NASA has identified 26 pieces they expect to survive, ranging in size from around 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds. Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team in Houston told CNN there's no way to know exactly where those pieces will come down. ""Keep in mind, they won't be traveling at those high orbital velocities. As they hit the air they tend to slow down and travel, they're still traveling fast a few tens to hundreds of miles per hour but no longer those tremendous orbital velocities,"" he explained. Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes as it orbits -- even just before it hits the Earth's atmosphere -- it will be impossible to pinpoint the exact location the pieces will come down. On top of that, Matney said, the satellite is not stable. ""Part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry."" Because water covers 70% of the Earth's surface, NASA believes that most, if not all of the surviving debris will land in water. Even if pieces strike dry land, there's very little risk any of it will hit people. However, in an abundance of caution, the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday released an advisory warning pilots about the falling satellite, calling it a potential hazard. ""It is critical that all pilots/flight crew members report any observed falling space debris to the appropriate (air traffic control) facility and include position, altitude, time and direction of debris observed,"" the FAA statement said. The FAA said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows, rocket launches, kites and inoperable radio navigational aids. NASA says space debris the size of the UARS components re-enters the atmosphere about once year. Harvard University astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell noted that UARS is far from being the biggest space junk to come back. ""This is nothing like the old Skylab scare of the '70s when you had a 70-ton space station crashing out of the sky. So, I agree with the folks in Houston. It's nothing to be worried about,"" McDowell said. Pieces of Skylab came down in western Australia in 1979. The only wild card McDowell sees is if somehow a chunk hits a populated area. ""If the thing happens to come down in a city, that would be bad. The chances of it causing extensive damage or injuring someone are much higher."" NASA says once the debris hits the atmosphere 50 miles up, it will take only a matter of minutes before the surviving pieces hit the Earth. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Pieces of the satellite will crash back to Earth Friday .
NASA can't predict the exact location of where they'll hit .

"(CNN) -- In my family, I'm always bringing up stories from the past, our family's story, our diversity. My daughter often rolls her eyes. ""We don't need to keep talking about this stuff. We get it."" My son admonishes. ""We know!"" In truth, their schools have done of a good job trying to make their population more closely resemble our country and our world. My kids have friends of all races, cultures and social classes. However, as a female white mom married to a male white dad with two biologically conceived white children, I'm trying to make a different point. I want them to understand that light skin color is not the norm from which everyone differs. White is not the signifier of normal. Many white kids take diversity for granted. They have worked hard to overcome stereotypes and bias and to accept other people as different. The fact that they may be someone else's diversity rarely occurs to them, let alone most white adults. Three influences have altered my white-centric perspective: my psychology students, the people with whom I work in my clinical practice and the diversity work of both my kids' New York City private schools. Some of my psychology students wanted to write a children's book where every character had a different identity. Children's books generally feature characters of one race or ethnicity, not multiple identities in interaction with one another. When we finished our first draft, we realized our characters had become very close friends. They each came from a different place but everyone had came from somewhere. Skin color doesn't define personhood, but since race is a marker of identity in our society, the experience of personhood includes having to deal with the meanings others attribute to racial identity. Protected by the privacy of a clinical relationship, beautiful black and brown women have shared how ugly they feel. Gentle dark-skinned men convey the humiliation that overcomes them when white people mistake them for dangerous criminals. Since whiteness has become synonymous with a better life, it is easy for any lighter-skinned person to use skin color as a shield against hurtful stereotypes about social class, gender, sexuality, family history or even mental illness. When white people deny their own embarrassing identity markers, we perpetuate the hypocrisy that only people of color have these problems. As a psychologist -- no, as a person -- recognizing status and identity anxiety as a mutual experience lifts the veil that ordinarily separates us from each other. This year, the parents association at one of my kids' schools named me co-chair of the diversity committee. I felt so self-conscious. Group leadership called forth a greater reckoning with my identity than simply participating in a committee. It also provided me the chance to experience being a minority member of a group. Sometimes I sat as the only white person at the table feeling really insecure, worried that I would be seen as a white stereotype instead of as myself. How did growing up white with financial struggles intersect with racial diversity? When white people want to ""help"" people of color, it always reeks of privilege and entitlement as in, ""let me help you with your problems."" It's a different sentiment than ""let's help each other with our problems."" Did people of color trust me? Did they wonder what I was doing on the diversity committee? Was it my job to speak for the concerns of underrepresented minorities? Or did I contribute more by trying to put forth a more multifaceted approach to the question of identity? How can we sit with each other's differences without feeling compelled to rank one way of being or looking as being better or worse than the other? Our diversity committee ultimately worked through these questions in our conversations. Although we did not fully answer them, we found that by talking about them, we discovered the theme of our work and developed a friendship. I now look at diversity as something that is in my interest: I want to live in a society where dignified difference constitutes our common core. Nuances in how we think, feel, work and love define what it means to be human. Everyone is unusual and unique. Racism is just another word for hating our realness. Our commonality as a country derives from the fact that we all have an identity just beneath the surface of our skins. The variety of stories that inhabit the people who call this country home -- from the brutality of slavery to the flight from genocides to the call to some better god -- enable democracy's creative synergy. The hands that have built the instruments of modern America have been every color, every nationality and every religion. I want to be part of a world that loves and embraces humanity as a diverse and interconnected organism. I want to be part of a world that accepts that every difference has a color, and every color has a unique meaning. How do I do this? I realized that it starts at home. Rather than teaching my kids that they are white, I want to impart to them that they are part of a kaleidoscope -- lots of continually shifting colors and shapes. They don't always want to hear their parents tell another story about grandpa's poverty or the coal-mining relatives. But this history holds our family's painful and joyous truths. Every family need only peel back the layers of a few generations to find their own story. Authentic family history exposes everyone's diversity. A society that embraces uniqueness loves the messiness of the human condition. Being loved despite or because of our messy truths creates empathy rather than sympathy. When we raise children to accept and acknowledge their own story, they learn to listen to someone else's, with respect. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Susan Bodnar.","Susan Bodnar: ""White is not the signifier of normal""

"(CNN) -- Reigning English Premier League champions Manchester City began the new season as they ended the last, at the top of the table. But City were made to work hard for their 2-0 victory against a lively Newcastle United side. The match began with floral tributes for two Newcastle fans who died when flight MH17 crashed in eastern Ukraine last month killing all 298 on board. John Alder and Liam Sweeney were traveling to New Zealand to watch their team play in a preseason tournament before tragedy struck. On 17 minutes the stadium broke out into a minute's applause in their honor. Classy control . On the pitch Newcastle more than matched City, creating almost as many chances. Crucially, they couldn't get a single shot on target and with half time approaching, Bosnian international Edin Dzeko superbly controlled a long ball over the top of the defense before back-heeling it into the path of David Silva who slotted home. ""I think we deserved it,"" Man of the Match Dzeko told Sky Sports after the game. ""We played aggressive and they didn't have any chances."" A late second . That wasn't strictly true. Newcastle pressed in the second half and with a little more composure could have snatched an equalizer. Instead, substitute Sergio Aguero fired the ball home at the second attempt in injury time to add some gloss to the scoreline. ""It was frustrating for us because in the second half we pushed on, brought some younger players on who were a little naive but threatened with their pace,"" Newcastle coach Alan Pardew told Sky Sports. ""We looked like we might win it,"" he added. Liverpool win . Earlier in the day, Liverpool began life without Luis Suarez with a 2-1 victory over Southampton. Suarez had been in phenomenal form since his arrival at Anfield in 2011, scoring 69 goals in 110 games. Last season had been his best yet, driving Liverpool to a second place finish and narrowly missing out on the club's first Premier League title. Yet his time had always been filled with controversy. He arrived after serving a suspension for biting a player whilst playing in the Dutch league, and was suspended again for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. He was also banned for allegedly racially abusing then-Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. However, after being sanctioned for biting a player at this summer's World Cup finals -- a four month ban from all football related activities -- Liverpool sold him to Barcelona. A solid start . It was a solid, if unspectacular, start for life without Suarez. Raheem Sterling, one of the players to shine most alongside the Uruguayan last season, opened the scoring with a superb side foot finish from a wonderful Jordan Henderson through ball. Southampton equalized with aplomb, Nathaniel Clyne smashing home into the top right hand corner, and had much the better of the second half. Yet it was the diminutive Sterling who somehow won a header in Southampton's penalty box which was guided home by fellow England international Daniel Sturridge. ""He sent us a lovely text this morning wishing us all the best, which was a great gesture. He is a friend now of Liverpool,"" coach Brendan Rodgers said of Suarez after the game, according to the Press Association. ""I texted him back. It's a real love in! He's a great boy but he is gone now ... Today was about winning and we got there.""","Manchester City go top after a 2-0 victory over Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is already making critics cheer. The follow-up to 2011's surprise hit ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" won't open until July 11, but early reviews and strong box office predictions are setting it up for a splashy debut. As the sequel to ""Rise,"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" takes place 10 years following the events of that 2011 movie. In this future existence, the apes, led by Andy Serkis' Caesar, have built a functioning society in the woods of California's Bay Area, while humans have suffered a severe blow from a global virus. When the survivors stumble upon the apes' community, there's an initial attempt to keep the peace, but it isn't long before the dawn of a war. In addition to Serkis, who received plenty of praise for his work in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""Dawn"" also stars Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. Interestingly, it's not the human cast that's really driven critics bananas. ""Few blockbusters this summer are likely to provide an image as stirring as an angry chimp on horseback, leaping through a wall of fire with a machine gun blazing in each hand -- in 3D,"" The Guardian's review begins. ""Both the forest settings and post-apocalyptic San Francisco are rich in detail and atmosphere, the action sequences are thrilling without being flashy, and the apes themselves are uncannily expressive, particularly their eyes. ... We've arrived at the stage where the soulful expression on the face of a virtual chimp can conjure more sympathy than a real, emoting human."" HitFix's Drew McWeeny goes as far as to call ""Dawn"" one of the best movies of 2014, thanks to its combination of digital expertise and talented direction from Matt Reeves. While McWeeny entered his screening just wanting ""a solid and respectful follow-up,"" what he got instead was ""a film that digs deep, that challenges not only the notion of what a studio blockbuster looks like but also how sequels are supposed to work in a commercial world, a movie about real ideas with a spectacular sense of character and mood. 'Dawn' is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie. It's a great science-fiction film, full-stop."" And the effort to make the apes as realistic as possible ""pushed performance into a whole new realm,"" McWeeny continues. ""It's one thing to pull off one or two characters like this, but ... to bring to life dozens of characters, and to have them all register as fully as they do here, is a remarkable accomplishment. Add to that the idea that so much of this was shot outside, on real locations, and you end up with something that destroys any boundaries in terms of what can or can't be done at this point."" To put it another way, ""'Dawn' is to 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' what 'The Empire Strikes Back' was to 'Star Wars' â€” it's that much better,"" says The Hollywood Reporter. ""[D]irector Matt Reeves' synthesis of brains and brawn kicks it over the goalposts and out of the stadium ... Whatever anyone might think about the film as a whole, there is no question that Andy Serkis gives the most expressive, soulful, deeply felt performance of a non-human character the big screen has ever offered as the mature Caesar."" With praise like that, it's no wonder box office prognosticators are imagining huge returns when ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" opens on July 11. According to Variety, many observers believe ""Dawn"" will easily grab a $54.8 million opening, with BoxOffice.com placing its bets that ""Dawn's"" first weekend will land close to $70 million.","""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" has strong early reviews .

"(CNN) -- As investigators in Georgia looked into the death of a 22-month-old boy left seven hours in a sweltering SUV, they seized computers from the father's office, a source with knowledge of the investigation told HLN's Nancy Grace. The officers found something startling: an online search for information about how long it takes animals to die in hot cars, the source said. It's unknown when the Internet search was conducted and whether the father did the searching. Police have declined comment when asked about the computer search. The father, Justin Ross Harris, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty. He sits in jail without bond, with an appearance before a judge set for next Thursday. Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris. Father won't attend son's funeral . The funeral for Cooper Harris will be held Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Justin Harris, 33, won't be allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend, sheriff's office spokeswoman Nancy Bodiford said. The child's mother wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the funeral but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris. Police spokesman Michael Bowman told CNN, ""If we have evidence, we will not be releasing that due to chain of custody issues."" Bowman would not confirm what, if any, evidence they had in their possession. A charity fund at Harris's employer, The Home Depot, will pay for the funeral, company spokeswoman Catherine Woodling told CNN. Harris, who worked as a web designer, has been placed on unpaid administrative leave, she said. The funding of the funeral from the Home Depot charity, the Homer Fund, is a ""standard approach,"" she said. In an obituary for Cooper appearing in the Tuscaloosa News, the family asks that in lieu of flowers donations should be made to the Homer Fund. 'What have I done?' Initially, police described the June 18 death of the toddler as the result of tragic absent-mindedness. They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson; he didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot. But suspicions grew as police investigated. ""The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence, and evidence will be presented to support this allegation,"" said Cobb County Police Chief John House. A criminal warrant released Wednesday described the events that led to Cooper's death. A timeline of events . On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said. He drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office, about a half-mile away. He works as a Web designer there. Usually, he would take his son to an on-site day care. But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat. During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said. After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away. A few miles away, he stopped the car at a shopping center and called for help. When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him. ""What have I done?"" he wailed as he tried to resuscitate the boy. A wave of sympathy . Each year, dozens of children die from heat strokes in cars, according to KidsandCars.org. More than 40 died last year. The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll. The charging of Harris triggered a wave of sympathy and a vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished. Two change.org petitions urging authorities to release Harris were started and then shut down this week. One petition posted this note: ""I think that based on the recent developments this petition is no longer relevant. I still pray that this was truly an accident. If that is the case, the DA now knows that the community does not want Justin prosecuted on murder charges."" Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family. ""Please don't listen to the media. It just upsets me to watch it,"" wrote Heather McCullar, who set it up. ""Please don't listen to the media. The family will speak when they can."" Contacted by CNN via e-mail, she wrote back, ""No one is allowed to comment right now."" ""The manner of death is homicide"" As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media. The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued Wednesday. Temperatures hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of his death. The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death.

The station chief, the highest-ranking U.S. intelligence officer in Pakistan, operates covertly and his identity is considered classified. He had recently been named in a lawsuit filed by a Pakistani man seeking $500 million for the death of his son and brother, who the man alleges were killed in a U.S. drone strike. The spy's name then appeared in Pakistani media stories about the lawsuit. The threats ""were of such a serious nature that it would be imprudent not to act,"" the intelligence official said, describing the decision to pull him from the country. A spokesman for the CIA declined to speak about any details of the situation in Pakistan but said in general that protecting CIA personnel is a top priority. ""Our station chiefs routinely encounter major risk as they work to keep America safe, and they've been targeted by terrorists in the past,"" CIA spokesman George Little said. ""Their security is obviously a top priority for the CIA, especially when there's an imminent threat.""

"(CNN) -- Three games are on the schedule Friday at the World Cup, including a match between fancied Spain and always tough the Netherlands in a rematch of the 2010 final. You'll also be able to watch Mexico, which at one point was a minute away from missing the finals, battle Cameroon in the first match of the day, and Australia take on Chile in the last. Here are five things to look for on Friday: . Crushing on Cameroon . Their World Cup history is short and their highlights are limited, with six appearances in the finals and five early exits. But since Roger Milla's goal to shock holders Argentina in the 1990 opener, we've loved watching them. They are like a rock band with no hit records, but man do they put on a live show. El Tri says we're ready now . Mexico was about 90 seconds from being sent home from qualifying, but thanks to a stoppage-time goal from the United States that eliminated Panama, Mexico was able to advance. The team also struggled in warmup matches, so you'd think they might have a goal of say, getting out of their tough group, but no, they plan more. ""Our team is strong and in our minds we believe we can make it all the way to the finals and make history,"" longtime defender and captain Rafa Marquez said Thursday. No sweat, they just have to make it out of a group that also has Brazil and Croatia. Early showdown . Defending champion Spain has this winning major titles thing down pat. Spain won European championships in 2008 and 2012 as well as the World Cup in '10. That's why La Roja is the No. 1 team coming in even if teams like Brazil and Germany are more favored. ""It's a veteran team,"" Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque said. ""It's a mature team with people who are in shape, it's what they do, what they have done."" On Friday they meet the Netherlands -- you might call them Holland -- in what should be the best game of the day. Will there be more protests? In Natal, where Cameroon and Mexico play in the first match of the day, there are 4,700 federal troops to provide security and keep order, The New York Times reports, adding that a bus strike affecting a half-million commuters began this week.

"(CNN) -- A couple convicted of tax evasion was taken into custody after a five-month-long standoff with federal agents in New Hampshire, a federal law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Ed and Elaine Brown, who had refused to surrender to authorities to serve their prison sentences, were taken into custody without incident Thursday evening by U.S. Marshals at about 8:00 p.m. The Browns had been holed up in their concrete-reinforced home in Plainfield, New Hampshire. They were convicted of evading $1.9 million in taxes -- a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. The Browns were sentenced in absentia in April. Throughout the ordeal, the Browns insisted there was no valid law that requires them to pay income taxes. ""We have committed no crime and we will not go to prison for non-crimes,"" Elaine Brown told CNN in June. Marshals cut off utilities to the house in early June, but the Browns told CNN it was not much of a hardship because they had their own wind turbine, as well as solar panels that provided some electricity. Also, their property covers more than 103 acres, so there was plenty of wood to keep them warm in the winter, they said. The couple and their New Hampshire home had become a rallying spot for anti-government supporters. Randy Weaver -- a survivor of the 1992 incident in Ruby Ridge, Idaho -- had recently visited the Browns to show his support. Over the summer, the Browns invited their supporters and friends to an outdoor party on their property that included live music, bocci and barbeque. Their online invitations asked attendees to ""stand in solidarity with the Browns against income tax fraud and celebrate freedom."" U.S. Marshal Steve Monier told CNN the service had no desire to engage in a violent confrontation with the Browns. ""But warrants aren't going away. They will serve their prison sentence,"" he added. The Browns, who are in their 60s, now likely face a host of other charges. They accumulated the back taxes between 1996 and 2003, in part from money made from Elaine's private dental practice. Four people accused of aiding and abetting the Browns, including one man who allegedly provided security, were arrested and taken into custody in mid-September.

"(CNN) -- A Pakistani Taliban commander who had escaped in mass prison break two years ago was arrested again last week, Pakistani intelligence sources told CNN on Tuesday. Adnan Rashid, a prominent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan commander, was captured Friday, the sources said. He was injured, but authorities were questioning him, one source said. Sources told CNN he was taken into custody in South Waziristan province and had since been moved. But the Pakistani Taliban told CNN the report was baseless and that Rashid is in a safe area. Authorities have said Rashid is responsible for several large prison breaks in Pakistan. In 2004, he was sentenced to death for planning an attack on former President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 2003. He was incarcerated at Bannu prison in northwest Pakistan and was freed, as were 400 other inmates, when militants stormed the facility in 2012. Rashid also wrote a controversial letter to Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani schoolgirl shot in the head on her way home from school in 2012. He told her she was targeted not because she advocated education for girls, but rather for her criticism of the militant group. In the letter, Rashid said he was writing -- not as a Taliban leader -- to say he was shocked by the shooting, and to express his regret that he did not warn Malala of the attack. The letter went on to say that the Taliban supports the education of women, as long as it adheres to Islamic law. The letter drew criticism from people who said the Taliban are known to target female students. Inside militants' secret tunnels in Pakistan .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The top ranking is at stake in the men's game when Rafael Nadal meets Novak Djokovic in Sunday's French Open final. But don't let that fool you -- both tennis titans, having held down the No. 1 spot previously, are more concerned about piling up grand slam titles. For current holder Nadal, he's seeking a record-extending ninth success at Roland Garros, an accomplishment that would also see him tie Pete Sampras for second on the men's list with 14 majors. A bad back and Stanislas Wawrinka, likely in that order of significance, stalled Nadal in January's Australian Open final. Djokovic, meanwhile, is attempting to become the eighth man to complete a career grand slam and inflict only a second defeat on Nadal at Roland Garros. Their historic 41-match rivalry has seen streaks of the roller-coaster variety, and second-ranked Djokovic is the man in the ascendancy at the moment, capturing four straight tussles including the final of the Rome Masters last month. Djokovic stretched Nadal to five sets last year in the last four, undone by a freak occurrence when he touched the net deep in the fifth. ""He's an unbelievable opponent,"" Nadal told the crowd after his semifinal Friday. ""It's always a big, big challenge."" It's a finale too close to call but based on the semis, Nadal might just have the upper hand. As temperatures soared in Paris to about 30 degrees, helping to banish memories of a cold, rainy first week, Djokovic toiled in the heat -- not something new -- before ousting Roger Federer's conqueror Ernests Gulbis 6-3 6-3 3-6 6-3. He subsequently told French television he indeed dipped physically in the third. Nadal then had an easier time against Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, prevailing 6-3 6-2 6-1 in a quick-fire 100 minutes. Murray always had an uphill task, never overcoming Nadal in five tries on clay, spending four-and-a-half more hours on court this fortnight -- maybe the equivalent of two matches -- and having to contend with a Spaniard whose heavily spun balls shoot off the clay and spin in the air even more in steamy conditions. ""Today I played my best tennis of the tournament,"" Nadal said. Nadal, probably unlike Djokovic, will be glad to know the mini-heat wave is expected to continue through Sunday. ""For me it's much better when the weather is like today,"" Nadal later told reporters. ""It's obvious that with days like today, it helps my game. ""I need to play aggressive. I need to find my best level, and I'm gonna try."" Djokovic took his time attending the post-match press conference, heightening suspicions something was amiss. ""There is nothing bothering me,"" he said. ""Just the general fatigue that, you know, probably was influenced by conditions or other things that I felt today. But I'm not going to talk about. That's it. ""I'm glad I won in four sets, because if it went to a fifth, God knows in which direction the match could go."" Gulbis' coach, Gunther Bresnik, said before the semifinals his man had ""no chance"" against Djokovic, trying to ease the pressure on the reformed Latvian. But unlike Chelsea football manager Jose Mourinho, who often resorts to mind games, Bresnik admitted to uttering the words to relax Gulbis. Doesn't that defeat the purpose? Ultimately, Bresnik was right. Djokovic breezed through the first two sets before a blip in the third -- the third time that transpired this tournament. Hunched over and hitting with less pace, his malaise allowed Gulbis to force a fourth. The problem for Gulbis was that he, too, seemed to be in distress, often clutching his lower back. He said afterwards, however, that he wasn't hurt. It was simply tension. Djokovic broke near the end of the fourth set and to his relief served out the match comfortably to achieve a second French Open final. ""I'm just going to rest today and tomorrow, try to not spend too much energy on the courts and get ready for finals,"" said Djokovic. Nadal seized the initiative with an early break against Murray and never let his grip go. His feared forehand was in devastating mode, giving what must have been a jaded Murray little opportunity. Nadal never faced a break point and was taken to deuce only once, in his last service game. The result countered their tight three-setter in Rome. ""You can go out there with all the tactics in the world, but when he's hitting the ball like that, it's very difficult to hit the ball where you want to,"" Murray told reporters. Djokovic has the ability to handle Nadal's cross-court forehand like no other, perhaps a reason Bresnik picked the Serb to win the title. Sunday will tell us if he is right again.","Novak Djokovic will face Rafa Nadal in Sunday's French Open final .

"(CNN) -- Americans commemorated this week the loss of those who died at the hands of al Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001. Their leader chimed in a day later with new threats against the United States. Ayman al-Zawahiri called on his followers in an audio message posted on the Internet on Thursday to ""land a large strike on it, even if it takes years of patience for this."" 9/11 anniversary: 'Our hearts still ache,' Obama says . Al-Zawahiri has headed al Qaeda, since a U.S. military operation killed his predecessor and al Qaeda's founder, Osama bin Laden, in May 2011 in Pakistan. In his message, he claimed victory against the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. He called on terrorists to continue the battle on American soil. Al-Zawahiri named the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 as an example of such an attack. Read more: Jihadist terrorism in America since 9/11 . He encouraged his followers to provoke the United States into spending more on security, in order to ""bleed America economically."" In August the Obama administration closed 19 embassies and consulates across the Middle East and North Africa after intercepting communications between al Qaeda leaders indicating possible strikes on U.S. interests. In a message between al-Zawahiri and a top ally in Yemen, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror chief told the Yemeni commander to ""do something,"" which U.S. officials inferred to mean an attack. In his audio message Thursday, Zawahiri also claimed victory over the United States in Yemen. But extensive drone attacks there allegedly carried out by the United States over the past two years have whittled away at al Qaeda's infrastructure and killed key leaders, diminishing its ability to carry out attacks.","To commemorate 9/11, al Qaeda's leader issued new threats .

"Taji, Iraq (CNN) -- Under a sweltering sun, Fallah al Araiby hunched over the hood of a car, scrubbing away the dirt. Once, his son used to work alongside him on a busy street corner in central Baghdad. Now, he does it alone. His son is one of the thousands who have answered the call from Iraq's top Shiite cleric to take up arms to protect Iraq from extremist Sunni fighters whose aim is to oust Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government and establish an Islamic state that stretches from Iraq to northern Syria. With three days of training, his son -- 25-year-old Ali -- was given a helmet, a rifle, a magazine of ammunition and sent to the front line, al Araiby said. Maps: Understand the crisis in Iraq . Some 23,000 volunteers, according to Col. Shihab Hamoud Nasir, have signed up for the security forces since ISIS seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul. In a lightning advance, ISIS seize large swaths of northern and western Iraq earlier this month. Al Araiby's son and many like him were taken by the loads in buses and trucks to the sprawling Taji training base, 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Baghdad. There, under a makeshift canopy, volunteers wait for their turn to begin training. When they are called, they are put into formation where they march -- sometimes out of step -- and practice shooting. They get about a week to 10 days of training, Nasir said. Much has been made about whether it's enough training to take on the seasoned ISIS fighters, who have had significant success in battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. ISIS fighters and allied Sunni militants have launched a number of attacks against military bases and checkpoints, killing a large number of the new recruits. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, details the deaths of ISIS fighters during military briefings televised near daily, but he says almost nothing about Iraqi security force casualties. But sporadic reports about the fighting from police and local government officials paint a sometimes bleak picture. Take the report about fighting at a military base south of Baghdad: . ISIS fighters launched an attack Sunday against the base at Jurf al-Sakhar, on the outskirts of Hilla, where an infantry brigade is based. At least seven soldiers, all new recruits, were killed and 15 were wounded, according to police officials. It was the second such attack on the base in as many days. Still, volunteers come by the hundreds to Taji to train. ""I can assure you that volunteers came from all of Iraq's provinces, and a few were underage but we convinced them to change their decision and return to their families,"" Nasir said. While Nasir said recruits are not asked about their religious affiliation, the majority are Shiite who answered the call put forward by Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the country's top Shiite cleric. Among them is 23-year-old Mohammed Jassim, who left his job as a taxi driver in Baghdad's Sadr City to take up arms. ""This is my first day here, and I am ready to be deployed to the field, even to the front line, if that's needed,"" he said as he sat on a wooden bench waiting to be called. As Nasir detailed the training for CNN, he was interrupted by a man in his 70s who reminded him that he has come to the training center every day for much of the last two weeks. ""When will it be my turn,"" he asks Nasir. ""When God wills,"" the colonel tells him. ""When God wills."" On the street corner in Baghdad, al Araiby praises his son's decision to volunteer. He doesn't know where he's been deployed. ""No, I am not afraid for him. He is a brave young man, and it is his duty to obey the religious authority,"" he said. ""... I encouraged my son to join as a volunteer because this is our responsibility and duty."" The 50-year-old al Araiby hopes to join his son at the front line. He says he's just waiting for the military to call. Who are the militants fighting to take over Iraq?

"(CNN) -- The revelation that nearly 800 children may have been buried in an unmarked mass grave at a former Catholic-run home for unwed mothers in Ireland is ""sickening"" and must be investigated, the country's top Catholic clergyman says. Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin has issued a statement urging anyone with information about mass graves to go to the authorities. ""The Gospel message is that authentic faith is measured by how we treat children who represent Jesus Christ,"" Martin said in the June 5 statement. On June 1, the Irish Mail on Sunday cited a local historian as saying she believed 796 children who had died between 1925 and 1961 at a home run by the Sisters of Bon Secours had been buried in an unofficial grave beside the home's old location in Tuam, County Galway. Local children stumbled upon the grave in the 1970s, Irish media reported, but the site was never examined afterward. The historian, Catherine Corless, told The Irish Times Saturday that she had bought death certificates for the children but she found that there had been no burial records. The revelation has sparked calls for an investigation and renewed questions about the treatment of unmarried mothers and their children by the Catholic Church and institutions associated with it. 'Full bodied inquiry' The Dublin Archdiocese said Martin had asked the Diocesan archivist to compile information on mother and baby homes in Dublin several months ago. Hundreds of documents had been collated but none so far contained information concerning mass graves, it said. ""The Archbishop has said he will share this information with any inquiry the government will establish. He expressed the hope that a full bodied inquiry will be set up, examining all aspects of life in the homes and crucially how adoptions were organized."" In an interview with Ireland's national broadcaster RTE Sunday, Martin said it was important that any commission investigating the graves be given ""full judicial powers."" ""I also think it's very important that the commission be clearly separate from church/state or any other organization that was involved in it,"" he told RTE. ""I'm not too sure we can throw the entire blame at the church, I think that would be wrong to do that. There was a society in which there was a sort of collusion between the church and state institutions,"" Martin said. The archbishop called for a commission to be established to study the social context of the period. Government response . Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Charlie Flanagan said in a statement Wednesday that ""active consideration"" was being given to how to address the details that had emerged. ""Many of the revelations are deeply disturbing and a shocking reminder of a darker past in Ireland when our children were not cherished as they should have been,"" he said. Government departments are working together to establish the best course of action, said Flanagan. Opposition parties Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail have urged a comprehensive government inquiry into the matter. Archbishop Michael Neary, who heads the Tuam archdiocese, last week welcomed any government move to examine what happened at the home. ""It will be a priority for me, in cooperation with the families of the deceased, to seek to obtain a dignified re-interment of the remains of the children in consecrated ground in Tuam,"" he said. 'Magdalen Laundries' The Tuam case is the latest high-profile episode in which the state and Catholic Church have been called to account over care of the most vulnerable in Irish society. A government report last year into the so-called Magdalen Laundries, run by various Catholic orders, acknowledged that Ireland's government sent thousands of women and girls to ""harsh and physically demanding"" workhouses, where they worked and lived without pay, sometimes for years. The laundries operated from 1922 to 1996. While some were sent there by courts, others were unmarried mothers, victims of sexual abuse, orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state, or were mentally or physically disabled. And earlier this year, Philomena Lee -- whose decades-long search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption in the 1950s was the subject of an Oscar-nominated film -- launched the Philomena Project in hopes of compelling the governments of Ireland and the United States to open access to adoption records. Lee met with Pope Francis in February. Read more: Outcry over reported mass grave .

"(CNN) -- More people died violently in Iraq in April than in any other month in nearly five years, the United Nations said Thursday. A total of 712 people died and 1,633 more sustained injuries ""in acts of terrorism and acts of violence,"" the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said. Civilians made up most of the victims, 595 in total. 1,438 civilians were injured. Baghdad saw the most deaths with a total of 697 civilian fatalities. April's total was the deadliest since June 2008, UNAMI said. Iraq at a crossroads as bombs explode . Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. The International Crisis Group last month said that the ""failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle."" ""The most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames, and the burden for this lies above all with the government,"" the Belgium-based think tank said in a report. ""The country is at a crossroads,"" said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq. Some Iraqi leaders and international powers fear that tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate and bring a return of a full-blown sectarian war.

"CHEYENNE, Wyoming (CNN) -- A trained sniper accused of gunning down his singer wife shot himself to death as investigators closed in on his hideout in Wyoming's remote back country, police said. David Munis, a National Guard sergeant, was flown to a hospital in Laramie with a chest wound, Capt. Jeff Schulz said. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. Albany County Sheriff Jim Pond said police were attempting to arrest Munis in connection with the death of his estranged wife, a singer who was shot to death on stage over the weekend. ""It was a self-inflicted gunshot wound as [an] arrest team was approaching him,"" Pond said. Munis was spotted by a ranch hand in rural Albany County, who tipped off the sheriff's department, and led investigators there on horseback. A high-powered rifle and a pistol were found near Munis, Pond said. Prosecutors had filed charges Tuesday accusing Munis of killing Robin Munis, 40, in a sniper-style shooting early Saturday as she sang at a Cheyenne restaurant. Authorities found his black pickup truck late Monday in a remote area called Rogers Canyon, outside of Laramie. At least 40 officers had used dog teams and a Black Hawk helicopter in searching the area. The truck was in a police impound lot, authorities said. Schulz said earlier that authorities found a handwritten message pinned to the wall at David Munis' home, apparently written before the shooting of Robin Munis, that was ""near-confessional in nature."" ""It does not come out and say, 'I did it,' "" Schulz said. ""It just very clearly points in that direction."" The note, which according to court documents was addressed to ""everyone,"" also gives ""a number of reasons why [the shooting] was going to happen,"" Schulz said. Robin Munis was gunned down from a distance as she was on stage singing at the Old Chicago Restaurant. ""This part of her head was just, was absolute -- was gone,"" said Ty Warner, who was performing next to her.  Watch bandmate Ty Warner describe how Robin Munis died » . Witnesses told authorities they heard a ""pop"" or a shot fired and saw a dark pickup truck speeding away from the area, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed in the case. Investigators found a bullet hole and damaged glass in a door of the restaurant, the affidavit said. ""The trajectory of the bullet was in line with where the victim had been standing ... and the bullet was recovered from a doorjamb behind the victim,"" documents said. The bullet, a 7-mm., appeared to have been fired from a high-powered rifle and ""was executed with precision. The shot was made from a distance."" David Munis, 36, had extensive military sniper training and was proficient in the use of high-powered rifles, the affidavit says. Military officials told CNN he was a staff sergeant in the Wyoming National Guard and a decorated former Army sharpshooter who was trained at ""sniper school"" in Fort Benning, Georgia. That course includes wilderness survival and evasion tactics. ""The investigation revealed that David Munis owns approximate a dozen high-powered rifles equipped with professional optical scopes,"" the affidavit says. ""One of these was described as a 7-mm firearm."" That firearm has not been found, documents said. The shooting came the day after police were contacted by Robin Munis, who told them she and her husband were in the middle of a divorce and that ""he was frequently calling her and harassing her,"" the affidavit said. She also said he had been sending her ""hostile"" e-mails. Police called David Munis, and he agreed to stop calling his estranged wife and use a third party for contact. Both parties also agreed to meet only at neutral locations, the affidavit said. Schulz said David Munis did not make any threats to Robin Munis during the phone calls, but said the calls were frequent and she told police she did not want to talk to him. Investigators found that a call was made from David Munis' cell phone to the Old Chicago Restaurant's business line at 8:54 p.m., a few hours before the shooting. Authorities recovered seven ""long guns"" at David Munis' home, Schulz said. David Munis' family, in Montana, has been ""very cooperative,"" he said. His aunt told CNN her nephew had never been a violent person. She said she did not know Robin Munis. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- In April, Carol Rossetti began a personal project to continue practicing her drawing technique, ""while saying something worthy."" With some paper found in her office in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and an old box of colored pencils, the 26-year-old graphic designer began sketching. Four months later, her unnamed project's Facebook page has attracted more than 83,000 likes, a Tumblr page and an international following. The drawings feature images of women and girls with commentary on topics including weight, hair, clothes and sexuality. The images take about two hours to create; the commentary is first written in Portuguese, and volunteers take on the delicate translations in English, Spanish, Hebrew and other languages. ""Ana was raped,"" says an image of a woman clutching her knees. ""Ana, you are not alone. It's not your fault. This experience is not what defines you as a human being. You are so much more than this."" ""Helena avoided wearing high heels because everybody told her she would be too tall,"" one image says. ""Then, Helena tried on the Louboutins and has never ever wanted to take them off."" ""Babi is 7 years old. Her parents found it a bit odd that she chose to take karate instead of ballet,"" says one drawing of a girl with a ponytail and in the middle of a high kick. ""Babi, gender conventions should never limit your identity! You can do whatever you want!"" Rossetti said she had no idea her art project would spur a global response. ""Your art is brilliant,"" Madhumita Hota wrote from India on Facebook. ""I loved reading your descriptions as well. Well done."" ""I love your work and don't mind waiting for the translations,"" Paige Hayley Wren commented from the United States. ""I love what you have to say and I think it's commendable that you are so careful with translations and so sensitive to/aware of using positive language."" Rosetti's project is one of several that are reimagining how women are seen, and how they see themselves. Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In partnership with Getty Images features a curated selection of photographs to highlight the diversity of women in and outside the office. In a recent commercial, Always, the sanitary napkin company, challenged viewers to reconsider the phrase ""like a girl."" Rossetti hopes to establish an online shop to make the popular illustrations available as prints. For now, she said, she'll continue working with volunteers to translate the illustrations into several languages. In an e-mail interview, Rosetti explained more about her images and why they're reaching an audience around the world. Her edited answers are below. CNN: How do these illustrations reflect who you are? Is there an illustration that is personally relevant for you, or that you drew from personal experience? Rosetti: I think they obviously define how I feel about many things, especially concerning the representation of people. Most of them were based on people I know, that are close to me. For example, my mother who has white hair, and I think it's gorgeous, but still many people tell her to dye it. In the end, I can relate to most of them, because they are all about the control over women's bodies, and I live that every day. Whenever I see a newspaper criticizing a woman's appearance, it's like saying that every woman in every occasion can and will be evaluated by her looks. Doesn't really matter if she's receiving a Nobel Prize or saving people from drowning, papers will talk about her poor choice of shoes or a nip slip. CNN: How would you describe your illustrations and the response to them? What has surprised you about the response? Rossetti: I think the point of my illustrations is to show, in a gentle and nonaggressive way, that there is still a lot of oppressive control over women's personal choices and identities, and expose a problem of representation toward women, people of color, people with disabilities, (LGBT concerns) and so on. I was really surprised with such huge success, the way people shared my illustrations. I really wasn't expecting that. I fight prejudice in so many ways, and that doesn't mean I don't still have some of my own. I was surprised to see so many people that I thought would be very conservative sharing my work, and thanking me for doing it. Sometimes we stumble on our own expectations, and sometimes that's a good thing. CNN: Are there any posts or illustrations that have had a particularly passionate response from the community? What was it, and why do you think it struck a nerve? Rossetti: Many people have thanked me for the one about Ana being raped, saying that my words somehow helped them through a hard time. Honestly, there's nothing as rewarding as that. Some people told me they finally got the courage to wear high heels after they saw the picture of Helena. That's really amazing, (and) makes me so so happy! Of course, the one about abortion had also some angry comments, but that was expected. CNN: You deal with a lot of delicate topics. How do you choose which topics you illustrate? How has your approach to the project evolved since you began? Rossetti: I have some topics I'd like to discuss on a list, but people are now sending me amazing suggestions from all over the world. It's fantastic, I think I'll never end this project. At first, I was thinking about feminism. But now I'm talking about so many other things, like racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia. ... People are happy to feel represented, and I'm happy that, even in a minor scale, I am being able to do that. CNN: What has been surprising about this experience? Rossetti: I guess I was positively shocked by the amount of people who are eager to see a wider representation of the human being. Many people told me how happy they were to see a person in a wheelchair when the topic in discussion was not the disability. That's representation. And it's great!","Graphic designer Carol Rossetti draws images of women as a personal project .

"(CNN) -- Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is ""just about done"" with the final phase of his reintegration, a military source with access to information on Bergdahl's care told CNN. He is expected to be assigned shortly to a new Army unit, the official said. Any issue of leave would be up to that unit. Bergdahl, the U.S. soldier held captive for five years by militants before his release in May, has ventured several times off an Army base in Texas as part of the effort to get him used to everyday life in America, a military spokeswoman has said. His release on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban being held by the U.S. military has rankled some, including former members of his unit, who said he was a deserter who endangered colleagues searching for him. Yet while investigating circumstances surrounding his departure, the military has also said it's focused on making sure Bergdahl gets better mentally and physically, so he can gradually readjust to normal life. Since being freed, Bergdahl has been carefully monitored at a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, and at his military home since June 13, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. He recently transitioned from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas to outpatient care, the Army said on June 22. Still, Bergdahl has hardly left the care of military health professionals. Members of his reintegration team escort him whenever he leaves base and interacts with the public, the Army spokeswoman said. His stops have included restaurants, a library, a supermarket and several stores of his choosing. Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. But there was no definitive conclusion Bergdahl was a deserter because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to him, a U.S. military official has said.

"(CNN) -- A mandatory evacuation was issued Saturday for a southwestern Illinois town threatened by the rain-swollen Mississippi River, an order that was issued as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers weighed whether to blow up a levee and flood rural farm communities to save the town. Heavy rains have pushed the river to near-record levels, putting pressure on a tributary system that began buckling days earlier when a levee failed and flooded a handful of rural towns in southeastern Missouri. ""I know that the price being paid is high,"" said Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh of the Army Corps of Engineers, who told reporters during a briefing that he had flown over a number of the affected communities. With more rain predicted and the deterioration of a levee near Cairo, Illinois, the town's mayor, Judson Childs, ordered his 2,800 residents to leave by midnight. Walsh told reporters that a decision whether to blow a 2-mile hole in the levee to save Cairo will be dictated by the conditions. ""The decision clock has been rolling,"" he said. But the decision whether to blow up the levee has pitted Illinois and Missouri against one another in recent days, with Missouri filing a federal lawsuit to block the Corps. Illinois joined the Corps as a defendant. A federal judge ruled Friday against Missouri, saying a 1928 law permitted the breach of a levee to ease pressure on the river. Caught in the middle, though, are residents on either side of the river, which threatens to swallow communities in Missouri and Illinois. ""People are losing their jobs. They're losing their homes. They are losing the beds they sleep in at night. All because of this flooding,"" said Aaron Mitchell, 48, who worries breaching the levee could overwhelm smaller tributaries that could flood his home. Mitchell is also concerned about where the water released under the Corps' plan would go since much of the land in the area is already under water because of heavy rains. ""Where is all that water going to go?"" he said. The plan calls for engineers to use explosives to breach the Birds Point-New Madrid levee, flooding 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland that has been designated as a flood plain. About 90 families who live in the area have already been evacuated, Missouri officials have said. Illinois and Missouri have called out hundreds of National Guard soldiers to help evacuate communities and protect vacated communities. But while government officials were divided by the decision to breach the levee, residents on both sides of the river appeared to be pulling together. Families forced to flee were being offered shelter in area hotels and at local churches, according to county officials. A car dealership in Sikeston, Missouri, was allowing residents forced to leave their homes to store furniture and other personal belongings in buildings on their lot, while some restaurants in the area were providing food to the displaced. ""Everybody is pulling together,"" Mitchell said. While Walsh said a final decision has not been made to breach the Birds Point-New Madrid levee, he has begun preparations by ordering barges that would be used in the operation to move toward the levee. Engineers have reported sand boils and seepage at a number of levees near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, a condition that Walsh said also threatens the integrity of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project -- the world's largest flood control project. ""There is water in places where we have never ever seen it before,"" Walsh said. Engineers have warned that should the rising waters of the Mississippi River overwhelm the entire flood control project, it could deluge cities, destroy crops, destroy businesses and paralyze river transportation.","Mayor orders evacuation of Illinois town as river rises .

"(CNN) -- This is a story about two brothers. They grew up in eastern Washington, joined the Marines and fought in Iraq and Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of September 11. The brothers served valiantly, in the name of American freedom, to defend liberty and democracy abroad. They saw battle and bloodshed, bore witness to the loss of life and faced the unforgettable and haunting realities of war. The brothers returned to America emotionally shattered, psychologically distraught and forever changed. And the Department of Veterans Affairs failed to treat them. Years later, like many of their comrades, these brothers, whose names we are keeping private, suffer from severe post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, physical disabilities and memory loss. One lives with severe head injuries because of the bombs that went off beside him in Fallujah. The other was afraid to admit his suicidal thoughts. And when he finally did, the VA locked him in a room for several torturous hours until they ultimately let him go -- without any treatment or assistance whatsoever. He was left alone to replay and relive the horrors of war. This is unacceptable and inexcusable. As the wife of a retired Navy commander and the representative of the district covering Fairchild Air Force Base in Spokane, Washington, I see firsthand the permanent effects of war -- both physical and psychological -- on those who serve our country. Nearly 30% of today's veterans return from war with some kind of service-related disability -- often PTSD or traumatic brain injury -- and too often, the VA fails them. Though recent reports highlight the fundamental inefficiencies and mismanagement within the agency, the VA has failed to protect America's veterans for far too long. This is a serious problem, and it demands a serious solution. Document: VA audit report released . This issue is about more than the resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki; it's about changing the structure and culture that have pervaded the VA for decades. The secretary is not the root of the problem; he's simply the face of it. We need to modernize an outdated agency, bring it into the 21st century and ensure that the VA is better equipped to treat the health and psychological issues that are unique to our veterans. Shinseki apologizes, orders VA fixes . Moreover, the culture of the VA needs to change: Right now, too many veterans feel as if the VA treats them like a burden, leaving them both alone and untreated in the aftermath of war. We need to address the systemic, structural issues within the VA -- the misallocation of resources, the interminably long waiting lists, the bureaucratic inefficiencies -- to ensure that our American heroes are properly protected the second they return home from war. The House has taken swift action to do just that. Last week, we passed the overwhelmingly bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, which holds the VA accountable for actions that are both egregious and preventable. We urge the Senate to take immediate action on this legislation so we can get it to the president's desk and signed into law. We cannot afford to waste more time. With 23 deaths already attributed to delayed care -- and many more in which ""delay in treatment"" has been listed as a factor -- we refuse to let another veteran lose his or her life for something that can be prevented. When one joins the military, he or she is promised health care for life. So we need to make sure that happens. I am proud to join Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, in his legislation to allow veterans to seek outside care from private practitioners, paid for by the department, if they have been waiting more than 30 days for an appointment. Our veterans should be allowed to go to local doctors and hospitals to treat their physical conditions and rely on the VA for issues that are unique to their specific needs. It's time to bring the VA into the 21st century with stricter management, greater accountability and better care. While the agency has done great things -- such as its innovative work with prosthetics for disabled veterans or its telehealth system in regions like Spokane -- we need to take a closer look at the VA's infrastructure, its strategic plan and its allocation of resources. The agency needs greater accountability and transparency. But most of all, the VA needs to shift its priorities so the veteran is always the priority. We will keep fighting. We will fight to give veterans the care they deserve and were promised. We will fight to modernize the VA to meet the needs of today's service members. And we will fight for those two brothers in eastern Washington and for the millions of heroes just like them who have served America with unwavering resolve. They have protected us, and now we will protect them. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers says the dysfunction in the VA is unacceptable and inexcusable .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Sony and Microsoft were kicking off their new next-generation video game consoles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California. This year, the event will be all about the games, as developers show what they can do with that new technology. Some game companies have already shown glimpses of the power of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with recent releases like ""InFamous: Second Son,"" ""Titanfall,"" and ""Watch_Dogs."" E3 2014 promises to showcase even more creativity, flair, and dynamic gameplay with a look at upcoming titles arriving in the next year and beyond. Even Nintendo will be making a splash with its eye toward boosting sales of its own ""next-gen"" console, the Wii U. The company chose not to hold a traditional press conference in 2013, and has opted again for a digital event and smaller, more intimate meetings. But the real question for the expo is, how many of these games will people actually get to play? Sony . With Sony leading the sales pack with the introduction of its PlayStation 4 console, they will be looking to hold their lead and offer more titles to keep fans interested. They also will be showing off more about their latest hardware project, Morpheus -- a virtual reality headset that undoubtedly will be integrated into some of their own titles. Expect to see more about popular titles like ""The Order: 1886"" or ""Uncharted 4,"" two games that have been teased quite a bit over the months. It is also likely that fans will get glimpses of games like ""Driveclub"" and a possible new title for the ""God of War"" franchise. While Sony hasn't pushed as much on the music and movie front as their competition, it would be a surprise if PlayStation Now, their new streaming service, didn't get prominently mentioned. With a new PS4 console/PS Vita handheld console bundle recently announced, cross-play and Vita titles will likely be part of every demonstration. Microsoft . The Redmond, Washington, company has to feel like it has been playing catch-up for the past year. Fan reaction to some of its Xbox One policies and hardware forced Microsoft into backtracking on many of its E3 statements from last year. Unbundling the Kinect hands-free controller from the console, along with a price cut, garnered mixed reaction from the public, so expect Microsoft to explain why it was a good idea and how it will influence the user experience. A ""Halo 5: Guardians"" presentation will surely get everyone's blood pumping and a new title, ""Sunset Overdrive,"" should excite fans with its colorful and quirky gameplay. Will there be more exclusive title announcements? Likely, but how many will move consoles is the real question. Microsoft has been aggressive in pushing the Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment center, so don't be surprised by more content partnerships to be showcased. Nintendo . Nintendo's struggles with the Wii U have been well documented. The company just can't seem to explain to customers why the 2012 console offers a different entertainment experience and is feeling financial pressure to do something big. The company is banking on new games to help get more Wii U's into homes. ""Mario Kart 8"" and a new ""Super Smash Bros."" game will help. There are also rumors of a new ""Zelda"" game for the Wii U and a major new title for the handheld 3DS console. Hopefully, they will also give more details about a series of figurine-based games, similar to ""Disney Infinity"" or ""Skylanders."" Called the Nintendo Figurine Platform, a demonstration in May showed a Mario figurine being used with different games on the same platform. Can you imagine the demand for Mario-based figurines? PCs . Nearly every new game that comes out for the consoles also comes out for the home computer (well, except for Nintendo). The popularity of ""World of Warcraft,"" ""Neverwinter,"" and other massive multiplayer online games has opened up the field for new MMOs to try their hand. With the new games, companies are going to be showing off new bells and whistles for computer gamers -- specialized keyboards and mice, chat headsets, and high-powered gaming laptops and towers. It's a good bet a few booths on the show floor will be packed with the latest and greatest hardware for people who game on PCs. More games . Third-party game developers will also be showcasing their talent with promises for this year and next. Warner Bros. Entertainment just announced a new ""Mortal Kombat X"" title, which should get some play at E3, as well as more about ""Batman: Arkham Knight."" Both of those games are likely to be available in 2015. Electronic Arts plans on a mix of updates to classic franchises, like ""Madden,"" ""FIFA,"" and ""The Sims,"" while planting the early seeds for new, original projects set to blossom over the next few years. They will also announce a game from Criterion Games that is NOT another ""Need For Speed"" game, but something brand new. Ubisoft will be showing off a new ""Assassin's Creed Unity"" game they said was built specifically for the next-gen consoles.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of anti-government supporters led by two of Pakistan's most influential figures have joined a march to Islamabad to demand the resignation of the country's prime minister, prompting a major security operation. By early Friday, an estimated 15,000-20,000 people had joined cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan on the outskirts of Lahore in Pakistan's northwestern Punjab region. The procession took to the roads in cars, trucks and buses to make the 230-mile (370-kilometer) journey to the capital. The march started on Thursday as Pakistan celebrated Independence Day. Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain and leader of the Tehreek-e-insaaf (PTI) political party, has called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to stand down amid claims of vote rigging during last year's election, a claim Sharif has rejected. 'Huge security operation' The huge convoy was joined by followers of outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, who called on his supporters to join what he described as a ""revolution march."" Qadri, who led protests against Pakistan's government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, has accused the Sharif government of corruption and campaigned for more to be done for the country's poor. The march, which has been peaceful so far, prompted a huge security operation across the country, with tens of thousands of soldiers and police deployed along the route to Islamabad, while massive shipping containers and reels of barbed wire have been used to seal off many roads and highways. However, many Qadri supporters joined the march armed with sticks and improvised shields. Last week, at least five of his supporters were killed during clashes with security forces in the country's northwestern Punjab province. Capital gathering . Organizers from both camps expect thousands more to join the procession as they get closer to the capital. A Khan representative told CNN Thursday that they anticipated around 100,000 people would be taking part. They are expected to assemble in central Islamabad, where security has been especially tight, with routes to many government buildings and embassies blocked by containers and guarded by army personnel, who assumed responsibility for the city's security. Late Thursday, the country's interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told a press conference that the government had officially permitted the march to go ahead on the condition that protesters don't cross into the capital's ""red zone"" -- a tightly controlled area containing many government buildings. So far, crowds in the capital have been small, but they're expected to increase significantly as the march draws nearer later Friday. On Wednesday, in a rare address to the country, Prime Minister Sharif refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that Pakistan has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of ""currency value, foreign investment and economic growth."" In an apparent attempt to appease Khan's demands for an investigation into electoral fraud last year, Sharif offered to form a commission consisting of three Supreme Court judges to investigate the claims. But at a press conference shortly after the prime minister's address, Khan said the government's response had arrived too late in the day and that he was now officially calling for the resignation of Sharif. The political instability comes at a time when Pakistan is waging a bloody war against militants -- particularly in the restive tribal regions along its border in Afghanistan. On Thursday two airbases in the southwestern city of Quetta in Balochistan Province were attacked by insurgent gunmen wearing suicide vests. But by early Friday, security forces repelled the attack, killing 10 terrorists and capturing another five, according to Imran Qureshi, the Superintendent of police in the city. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. But, senior police officers suspect Islamist militants could be behind the two coordinated attacks. Sarfaraz Bugti, the Home Minister Balochistan, told CNN the dead gunmen were Uzbeks. Journalist Syed Ali Shah contributed to this report.","Supporters of ex-cricketer Imran Khan and cleric Tahir ul Qadr join march to capital .

"(CNN) -- The devastating tornado that killed 124 people in Missouri this week puts the United States on track for a record-breaking year -- despite improved forecasting, warning systems and public awareness, weather experts say. By 7:20 p.m. Tuesday, the death toll in Joplin had reached 124, making it the single deadliest tornado since the National Weather Service began keeping such records 61 years ago. The tornado in Joplin brought the number of people who have died in U.S. tornadoes to 489 so far this year. The figure could escalate as rescue workers continue digging through rubble from Sunday's tornado in Joplin, Missouri. The deadliest tornado year on record is 1925, which had 794 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The number of fatalities so far this year is more than 8 1/2 times the average number for an entire year -- 56, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. With all the advancements in storm technology, the question is simple: Why? ""That's the question of 2011,"" said Bob Henson of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. ""Why have so many people died in these tornadoes? That's the open question. It's partly because of the strength of these tornadoes. Also because they've hit populated areas."" Myers said the brute force of some tornadoes might just be too severe for many structures. ""Some tornadoes, you just can't survive them,"" he said. ""They're just too big."" Since 1875, the average number of deaths from tornadoes has actually decreased -- from about 200 to 55 a year, Myers said. This year is a sharp anomaly. In addition, the number of killer tornadoes is higher in 2011 -- 51 deadly tornadoes have touched down in the United States this year, compared to an average of 22 killer tornadoes in the past. That's counting two more tornadoes in Missouri Tuesday night. And it's only May. But early statistics on U.S. tornadoes have been spotty. Because twisters were not measured the same way they are now, experts don't know whether the 1925 Tri-State tornado that killed about 695 people in Missouri, Illinois and Indiana was actually a single funnel or many -- which is why it's not officially considered the deadliest single tornado. The weekend tornado in Joplin stirred memories of two fatal twisters that struck in Alabama last month. One tornado hit Hackleburg and Phil Campbell, killing 78 people, and another struck Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, killing 61. While many cities in tornado-prone areas have tornado sirens, the alarms sometimes get ignored. ""The sirens always go off, so no one thought anything of it,"" Joplin resident Alexa Wattelet said. ""Where we were, nobody really seemed like they were in much of a shock."" But Myers said even if people take all possible precautions, a tornado can still leave fatalities. ""If you get hit by something the size of a 225 mph storm, it is not survivable,"" he said. ""And that is not to scare anyone. But the people that did it right are not to blame."" CNN's Sean Morris and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","At least 489 people have died in U.S. tornadoes so far this year .

"(CNN) -- For the 10 days of the Sundance Film Festival, Utah's Park City is transformed into Swag City. Celebrities are gifted with everything from laptop computers (courtesy Lenovo) to moccasins (Minnetonka), headphones (Monster), boots (Ugg) and wireless chargers (Duracell). Alicia Keys, Naomi Watts, Daniel Radcliffe and Allison Janney were among the stars who picked up Samsung Galaxy products, gratis. And Sears handed out winter gear to the likes of Tim Daly and Dermot Mulroney. With so much gifting going on, it's not uncommon on the streets of Park City to see celebrities (or, more often, their assistants) toting armfuls of goods. But this Sundance has witnessed a new phenomenon: famous faces giving away the very things they've just received for free. Rally.org partnered with the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation on a ""reverse gifting"" suite on Main Street, where stars were encouraged to donate their newly acquired freebies to benefit the victims of Superstorm Sandy. Actor Jason Isaacs surrendered a pair of True Religion jeans he'd just received. He admitted that he didn't feel entirely comfortable accepting swag in the first place. ""You come to a festival like this and people give you stuff, which is very lovely,"" he said. ""I always feel very guilty."" January Jones, who stars with Isaacs in the Sundance movie ""Sweetwater,"" said she won't take swag as a matter of principle. With no freebies to donate, she instead signed a snowboard to be auctioned for Sandy relief. Down the street from the ""reverse gifting"" suite, stars could accept swag knowing they would not be the sole beneficiaries of that largesse. Sean John, one of the brands featured in a gifting lounge created by Talent Resources, announced that for every coat it gave to a celebrity, it would donate another coat to the charity New York Cares. Coats given to Octavia Spencer, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge and Paris Hilton (to name a few) resulted in items being donated to those in need. But in the end, only a small percentage of the swag handed out at Sundance is likely to wind up benefiting charities, whether it's New York Cares or the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation. A publicist for the Rally.org reverse gifting lounge conceded that donations this year were modest. ""We didn't get too many of the high-dollar donations we were looking for,"" the publicist wrote in an e-mail. She attributed the underwhelming response to it ""being the first year (for the reverse gifting lounge) and an idea that came together shortly before Sundance."" So for charities hoping for a share of Sundance swag -- and celebrities warming to the idea of giving up their free goods -- there may be more hope for next year.","Gifting suites at Sundance allow stars to pick up free products .

"(CNN) -- A 42-year-old Utah man planned to ""randomly shoot and kill"" at a Salt Lake City mall, then pick off moviegoers, and finally blow up a city bus -- a plot he detailed to a counselor who alerted police -- according to a court document. Jack Harry Stiles has been charged with allegedly making a terrorist threat involving the use of a hoax and a real ""weapon of mass destruction"" as defined under Utah law, according to the charging document obtained Tuesday by CNN from the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office. The Salt Lake Public Defender's Office acknowledged Tuesday that it is representing Stiles, but declined otherwise to speak about his case. According to the charging document, police first became aware of the plot after an employee at Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City told them August 12 how Stiles detailed plans to ""kill as many people as possible."" The document did not state why Stiles was at the hospital, identifying the woman he spoke with as a ""crisis worker."" The attack was to unfold Wednesday, which is the anniversary of Stiles' mother's death. After the hospital worker, Stiles allegedly himself then spoke to authorities. He specified three targets he had ""mapped out"" to determine the best places to hide in order to inflict the most bloodshed, the charging document states. Stiles explained he'd carry bags containing two automatic handguns with silencers, as well as five extra magazines of ammunition per gun, authorities say. The document did not state whether he had allegedly obtained any of those. ""He talked about going out and procuring these weapons,"" Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill told CNN affiliate KSL. ""Or if he couldn't do it, then he certainly knew somebody who was sympathetic to him who would help him."" Details, but no answers in Oregon mall shooting . The charging document does not specify others involved in the plot, nor is anyone else known to have been arrested in connection to it. Stiles' first stop: the City Creek Center mall in downtown Salt Lake City. Opened in March 2012, this shopping mall features restaurants and more than 100 stores such as Nordstrom, Macy's, Tiffany & Co., Michael Kors and Coach, according to its website. Having already gone there ""observing people,"" Stiles said he planned to go back around lunch time September 25 and ""just randomly shoot and kill people,"" the charging document says. His next stop, he told investigators, would be about 5 miles south at the Sugarhouse Movies 10 complex. Stiles allegedly had done his homework there as well, claiming it had slow-moving crowds and no security system and expressing concerns moviegoers might scramble if he went during a busier time. The charging document states that his idea was to take up a position in the back of the theater and start selectively ""shooting people's heads off"" with handguns. Lastly, Stiles said he wanted to plant a bomb under a public bus to detonate as it moved over the City Creek Center bridge ""to cause mass amount of death,"" according to the court document. ""The defendant indicated he will not intentionally shoot and kill children,"" the charging document says about Stiles' alleged intentions overall. ""However, the defendant said he will randomly kill people until he runs out of ammunition."" Either that or police get to him. If that happens, according to the document, the suspect planned to ""drop his guns, place his hands in the air and surrender because the police are 'faster shots.'"" Asked Tuesday about the plot, the Utah Transit Authority referred inquiries to the Salt Lake City Police Department. Linda Wardell, general manager of City Creek Center, declined to detail the security measures being taken there. ""The safety of our shoppers and our employees is our top priority every day,"" Wardell said. Stiles -- who, according to KSL and other media, was charged Monday -- is being held on $1 million bail, another court document states.

"(CNET)  -- Google began offering an encrypted option for Web searchers on Friday and said it planned to roll it out for all of its services eventually. People who want to use the more secure search option can type ""https://www.google.com"" into their browser, scrambling the connection so the words and phrases they search on, and the results that Google displays, will be protected from interception. The beta service of the secure Web search option begins in the United States on Friday and will be rolled out over the next few days to users around the world, said Murali Viswanathan, a Google search product manager. Friday's announcement makes Google the first major search engine to offer this privacy-protective feature. AOL, Yahoo, and Microsoft currently do not. ""Some users will want the extra privacy and security this feature will offer,"" Viswanathan said in an interview with CNET. ""But it's not going to be the default option, at this point. There's a lot of work to be done before we get there."" The encryption protects only data in transit between an individual's browser and the Google search server. When people click on a search result and are directed to another Web site, they leave the encrypted channel. Offering encrypted connections to Google.com means that users in China and other regimes that engage in significant surveillance will -- assuming the connection is not blocked in the first place -- be able to conduct searches without governments knowing the search terms. The protected Web search service will feature a customized logo that includes an icon of a lock and ""SSL"" which stands for Secure Sockets Layer, the technology used to encrypt the information as it travels between an individual's computer and the Google search server. The SSL technology is typically used on banking and e-commerce Web sites. Google has always offered Gmail users the ability to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), which uses SSL, in the browser. The company enabled Gmail users to set it as a persistent preference in mid-2008 and offered it as an option for Google Docs, as well. It became the default for Gmail in January. People who choose the secure option on Google will only be able to get encryption for Web searches and not for other types of searches, such as Image Search and Maps, at least for now. As a result, links for those searches will not appear on the side or top of the search page when someone is in the secure search mode. The secure Web search option will slow down the initial connection a computer makes to the Google server, but it may be hardly noticeable to most people. It also means Google will have to use more processor power to handle the scrambling and unscrambling of the SSL connection, which is the biggest reason most Web sites don't offer it as an option. The service does not protect data stored on an end user's computer or at the Google server, and if someone has malware or a keylogger on the computer, Web search data and other information could be stolen or leaked. Google announced last week that it would offer encryption for Web search soon, in the wake of the news that vehicles for capturing Google Maps Street View images had mistakenly been collecting data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks for years. But Viswanathan said the timing of the encryption announcement was completely unrelated and that Google had been working on the Web search encryption offering for a few months. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Reyhanli, Turkey (CNN) -- The patients limp into a two-story house standing on the fringes of Syria's brutal conflict. They are victims whose bodies have been mutilated by the war. But this charity is giving some Syrians a second chance at life. It is helping survivors take their first steps on the long road toward recovery. Part workshop, part physical therapy clinic, the National Syrian Project for Prosthetic Limbs manufactures artificial legs. It also helps amputee victims train their bodies to walk on these new limbs. Among the patients here is Ahmed Mohammed, who gingerly takes his first steps on a new prosthetic leg. His left leg was blown off above the knee a year ago by an explosion in the battleground city of Aleppo. A network of purple scars riddle his right leg while he says he still has shrapnel lodged in the skin of his back. Several Syrian technicians use screw drivers to adjust the knee joint of Mohammed's prosthesis as the patient tests the balance on the limb. ""They brought back hope. They brought back self esteem. They brought back life,"" Mohammed says, pointing at the young men who help him. ""My life was a tragedy before I put this limb on."" It can take months of physical therapy and a succession of different prostheses before patients' bodies can adjust to walking on new limbs. ""The first and second limbs are temporary,"" said Raad al Masri, a Syrian who runs the prosthetic limb project. ""The third or fourth become permanent."" Mohammed made the difficult, sometimes dangerous journey from Aleppo to this Turkish border town to try on this third generation of prosthetic limb. The leg has allowed Mohammed to go back to his job as a metal worker. More importantly, he adds, ""I can put my own son on my leg and pull him up, thank God."" At the charity, craftsmen grind metal on lathes and sculpt, and bake plaster for new limbs. Funded in large part by Syrian expatriates, the project's directors say it has provided limbs and therapy for free for more than 350 patients. The project is more affordable because technicians adopted the ""Jaipur Leg,"" an artificial limb developed in India that is far cheaper than some other prosthetic models. Among the young people working at the facility is Abdullah el Mawlah, a slender, red-haired teenager. Mawlah is not just an employee. The 18-year old is also a victim of the war, and has his own prosthetic leg. He says he was strafed with fire from an anti-aircraft gun a year ago as he and his family were traveling up a road in a pick-up truck. The boy who once loved to play soccer says he ended up in a hospital bed in Turkey, begging to have his mangled leg amputated because of the pain. Eventually, infection set in, and Mawlah says doctors removed his left leg above the knee. The tall teen moves quickly with a slight limp, even climbing and descending stairs. ""Sometimes we receive patients who are completely destroyed emotionally,"" Mawlah says. ""I can give the patient answers because I have lived their lives. I tell them I have a prosthetic limb and thank God I am here to tell you that you can go on and continue your life like any normal person. Yes, you may not get back to exactly how you were before the injury, but you will be able to walk again."" Despite these brave words, Mawlah privately confesses to having doubts. He fears that no woman will ever want to marry a man mutilated by war. This organization has gone a long way toward healing physical wounds left by the conflict. The emotional and mental damage, however, may prove much harder to cure.","Charity gives some Syrians a second chance at life .

"(CNN) -- Today would have been Julia Child's 102nd birthday, and Eatocracy is celebrating her legacy. Here are some lesser-known facts about the beloved TV chef and cookbook author. - At 6 feet, 2 inches tall, Julia was no stranger to standing out. But her height wasn't always welcomed. Child moved from California to Washington D.C. at the start of World War II to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). She'd previously been rejected for active duty by the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service and the Women's Army Corps. The OSS eventually became the CIA. - Her maiden name is McWilliams. - Julia had high hopes of distinguishing herself in college basketball, but the administration of Smith College, her alma mater, changed the game rules (they did away with the jump ball) to ensure she didn't receive an unfair advantage due to her height. ""I was not good at the rest of the game,"" said Child in her only authorized biography, ""Appetite for Life"" by Noel Riley Fitch. -- Julia was a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division of the OSS. While she never spent time in the field, she did have a high security clearance that allowed her to handle top secret documents. Step into Julia Child's kitchen . - While with the OSS, she also worked with the Emergency Sea Rescue Equipment Section and even helped develop shark repellent that was crucial during WWII. Underwater bombs that were meant for German U-boats would attract curious sharks that would sometimes cause premature explosions when they bumped into them. - With the OSS, Julia was stationed in Sri Lanka and China. While she was stationed overseas she met Paul Child, also an OSS officer. He is credited with teaching her to appreciate French cuisine. The time Julia Child snorted, accidentally cut a guy and other fan tales . - 573 pounds of butter were used on her show ""Baking with Julia."" - Julia wrote short stories in college and advertising copy for a furniture company after graduation. - Child once attributed her longevity to ""red meat and gin."" She died two days shy of her 92nd birthday. - Child was the first woman inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Hall of Fame.

"(CNN) -- As Jews prepare for Passover, our community has been hauled into the violence that plagues our nation. At this moment, we don't know for certain whether the killings Sunday at two Jewish Centers in Overland Park, Kansas, were aimed exclusively at Jews, but it certainly feels that way. In a larger sense, we have been victimized by the random, hate-filled violence that steals lives and futures in this country daily. Perhaps it is no coincidence that this hateful attack occurs at Passover. It surely threatens Jews' sense of security and multiplies the fear that we are persecuted. I wish, however, that you could know of the loving calls I am receiving from friends and clergy all over the wider metropolitan area and indeed around the world. Our neighbors: Jews, Christians and Muslims are outraged that senseless murder would be aimed at our community. We live among friends, and that is very different from Pharaoh's Egypt, Nazi Germany or any other place in which Jews have suffered persecution. We are being singled out, but in a larger sense we are not, because this is no longer a unique act of terror. Rather, the scourge of violence in America threatens us all. Those who hate as a way of life must be rooted out, isolated and punished. As Jews, we are no strangers to violence or wanton hatred. Many of us grew up with the fear of persecution. But we are not alone, either in our suffering or in our fears. Our newspapers report daily murderous acts against one group or another: blacks, gays, children, Muslims, minorities of all sorts. Many of the perpetrators are not sane; many of the victims are unsuspecting. The more proximate we are to the event, as the Jews of Overland Park were on Sunday, the more vulnerable and violated we feel. But look at the reality. At least two of those killed were not the apparent intended targets: Jewish people. They attended a nearby Methodist church. They were, tragically, in the line of fire because they had come to the Jewish Center to be part of an event, further evidence that this nation does not single us out as a hated minority but accepts us as beloved members of society and friends. Rather, our fear and our concern should be directed at a society that will not spend the resources to provide care for the mentally ill, will not limit the means by which violence is perpetrated and does not share common social purpose sufficient to protect us all from these random killings. For that, we are all guilty. We need to search our souls to ask why we, as a society, allow these daily murders to continue. On Sunday, Jews were apparently singled out. Tomorrow, it could well be another group, and Overland Park will recede in memory. But the truth is that we are all bound by our human experience and the tragic violence that is overwhelming the United States, ending lives and destroying families. Our prayers are with the victims and their families. They must be our main concern, as well as those who feel threatened by random violence. Sunday demonstrated that any of us could be singled out, and therefore we see we are one people that must be united in our conviction that we will not tolerate the hatred that murders innocent people and tears at the body of our nation.","Mark Levin: Shootings point to culture of hate-filled violence tolerated in U.S.

"New York (CNN) -- Seven months after dropping him from their team, the Houston Rockets signed Jeremy Lin when the New York Knicks failed to match Houston's three-year, $25-million offer for the point guard.

Morey's tweet alluded to the Lin's brief stint with the Rockets last year. Later Tuesday, Lin issued a brief statement expanding on his tweets. ""I loved this past year with the Knicks and truly appreciate the opportunity that New York gave me,"" he said. ""The way the fans fully embraced me and our team was something I'll always cherish forever. It was an extraordinary and unforgettable time that was easily the best year of my life.

Lin, a 23-year-old undrafted point guard of Taiwanese descent who brought ""Linsanity"" into the lexicon by way of his hardwood heroics, burst onto the scene in early February when then-Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni called him off the bench as the team struggled. A winning streak -- which included besting all-star Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers -- ensued, with Lin coming up big on clutch plays and endearing himself to a growing fan base, likely enamored with his unlikely story. The man who had been cut by two other teams, and spent his first few weeks with the Knicks sleeping on his brother's couch, quickly turned into a global brand, with store owners packing their shelves with Lin jerseys and other apparel.

Questions also surfaced about his ability for sustained top-level play and whether his rapid ascent to stardom had been warranted. In March, he suffered a knee injury, with an MRI revealing a small chronic meniscus tear in his left knee. New York recently signed point guard Jason Kidd and acquired former Knicks guard Raymond Felton via a sign-and-trade deal with the Portland Trailblazers, raising big questions about Lin's future on the Knicks' roster.

"(CNN) -- Russia called new sanctions against Iran ""unacceptable,"" saying the new punishments would hurt efforts to talk with Tehran. The Russian Foreign Ministry posted a statement Tuesday, a day after the United States announced tougher sanctions against Iran -- joining Britain and Canada in a coordinated effort to tighten the screws around the country's suspected nuclear weapons program. ""Russia sees such extraterritorial measures as unacceptable and against international law,"" the statement says. ""Such a practice seriously obstructs advancement toward a constructive dialogue with Tehran. Stronger sanction pressure, which some of our partners see almost as a goal in itself, will not encourage Iran to sit down at the negotiating table."" On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the new measures target Iran's petrochemical industry and its oil and gas business. The United States also said Iran is a ""primary money laundering concern."" Clinton said she expects additional sanctions by other international partners and that taken together ""these measures represent a significant ratcheting up of pressure on Iran, its sources of income and its illegal activities."" Britain cut all financial ties with Iran, the first time it has cut an entire country's banking sector off from British finance, the British Treasury announced earlier on Monday. Similarly, Canada said it was implementing a series of tougher sanctions, prohibiting almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government. The moves come days after an International Atomic Energy Agency report highlighted new concerns about ""the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program,"" the British Treasury statement said Monday. Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the U.N. watchdog's report ""unbalanced"" and ""politically motivated."" ""The IAEA's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""Today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with Iranian banks."" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird also cited the recent IAEA report as ""yet more proof that the current regime in Tehran poses the most significant threats to global peace and security today."" ""Canada is implementing, as of right now, a series of even tougher measures under the Special Economics Measures Act. These expanded sanctions prohibit almost all financial transactions with the Iranian government, add individuals and entities to the list of designated persons and expand the list of prohibited goods,"" he said in a statement. Also Monday French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to various leaders and heads of state, urging ""new sanctions of unprecedented magnitude to convince Iran that it must negotiate,"" according to a statement. France recommended that the European Union and its member states, as well as the United States, Japan, Canada and other willing countries, freeze the asset of Iran's Central Bank and suspend purchases of Iranian oil. Iran's nuclear program, the French president said, risks nuclear proliferation and ""could spark a military escalation in the region with catastrophic consequences for Iran and for the world."" Pentagon denies bunker-busting bomb is intended for Iran . The European Union already has an extensive set of sanctions in place. France, as one of the member states, is pushing to increase them. According to European diplomats, next week the EU is expected to pass further sanctions similar to what the United States announced, but France wants the international community to move beyond that, collectively. U.S. officials had been considering action against the Central Bank of Iran but became concerned that a full sanction could have a negative effect on the world economy because of the potential impact on oil prices. A number of congressional members have been calling for sanctions against the bank amid questions about how much the current restrictions are working. U.S. sanctions already prohibited American companies from doing business with Iran. ""Let me be clear: Today's actions do not exhaust our opportunities to sanction Iran. We continue actively to consider a range of increasingly aggressive measures,"" said Clinton. Following Monday's announcement, senior officials with the U.S. Treasury Department spoke to reporters on a conference call, stressing the decision to designate an entire jurisdiction, like Iran, as a ""primary money laundering concern"" is rare. The action will create a chilling effect and should serve as a wake-up call to banks and financial institutions around the world still doing business with Iran, they said. On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency board of governors issued a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the Iranian nuclear program."" But the U.N. agency's resolution did not threaten action to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.

"(CNN) -- I remember my father bringing home computers in the 1970s and watching him having to spend hours poring over their seemingly incomprehensible technical manuals just to get the new devices up and running. All that changed in 1984, when he brought home a MacIntosh. Instead of complex circuit diagrams and dense programming advice, he encountered a friendly, intuitive user experience. Operating his new computer seemed effortless. More than 25 years later, I watch my 7-year-old twins relive my father's experience as they intuitively learn to do anything and everything with their iPhones and iPads. Steve Jobs saw around corners, over the horizon and into the future, changing forever our daily lives through technology. He taught us to download music. He made computers approachable through his simple and elegant designs. He used everyday words instead of engineering jargon. He made computing comprehensible by employing ""desktop metaphors"": We opened folders, read documents and threw away our trash. It is nearly impossible to imagine (or remember) the world without the tools and experiences that Jobs created and popularized. Quite rightly, Jobs' array of gadgets and how they made us think differently about technology have been the focus of the avalanche of tributes to him. But as important as those legacies are, an even more important one may be that Jobs made the boom in social media possible. Social media have created a participation culture. We no longer merely watch and consume culture. We create, share and interact with it. Jobs laid the groundwork by first making it easy to use computers in our homes. He then challenged us to use them socially. But it was the iPhone that truly ushered in the age of social media and allowed us to engage with the Internet and visually interact with each other when not sitting in front of our computers at home. Would Facebook be the mobile phenomenon that it has become without the iPhone making it possible to for us to view content, upload photos and interact from any location at any time? Without the iPhone, would Twitter have become so dominant a communications tool? Lady Gaga tweets messages and pictures to her 14 million Twitter fans, CNN tweets breaking stories to 5.2 million followers, and the Dalai Lama tweets to his 2.5 million supporters. The iPhone was the first mobile device that taught us -- and encouraged us -- to share our words and our images of what we are doing and seeing. Jobs enabled the social media revolution in another way: He made it cool to carry electronic devices around with us. In most people's minds, technology was the realm of ""nerds"" and ""geeks."" After Bill Gates founded Microsoft, some people said that technology was ""sexy,"" and it was ""cool"" to be a nerd. In fact, technology continued to be the nerdiest of interests -- until Jobs made technology actually cool and hip forever. First came the discreet and trendy-looking iPod, which allowed us to download our favorite music and share it with others. The sleek iPhone followed, which enabled us to share our lives. ""Cool kids"" are now the first to buy and show off their new Apple gadgets. Indeed, iPhones and now iPads have become fashion accessories, used by people to accessorize their personal images and demonstrate that they are in vogue, popular and connected. Not that many years ago, people only thought iteratively, in small steps. Even entrepreneurs and innovators focused on the ""next step"" in developing their ideas. This kind of thinking is embodied in the seemingly endless versions of, say, Microsoft's Windows. Jobs challenged himself, and those around him, to pursue ideas first and ""ask"" how later. An innovator shouldn't think incrementally. His or her ideas should be the product of a ""leap,"" as in: What about making a phone that acts like a TV? Or a device to download and share music that is small enough to keep in your pocket? Jobs has laid the foundation for social media to continue to thrive and expand, and surely there will be future innovations and refinements. But it's hard to imagine anyone but Jobs connecting cutting-edge technology so effectively to what people want to do in their daily lives. Jobs made a career in taking those leaps -- and famously wowed us. In so doing, he transformed our world into one in which we can realize our dreams and desires to be a sharing society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Karen North.","Karen North: Early personal computers were difficult to operate .

"Washington (CNN) -- There are political upstarts, rebels with and without a cause, and then there's Ted Cruz. The first-term Republican senator from Texas has achieved the rare notoriety of having almost everyone in Washington mad at him, at least for now. His legislative maneuverings led to last year's 16-day government shutdown, and he almost single-handedly scuttled this week's congressional approval of a year-long debt ceiling extension that denies fiscal conservatives a key negotiating tool until after the November elections. Democrats dislike Cruz for his right-wing social and economic policies such as vehement opposition to gay marriage and President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms. Cruz's Republican colleagues, especially those in the Senate, are angry because he forces them to choose between conservative purity and political pragmatism, a particularly tough spot in an election year. To Cruz, a tea-party favorite who arrived in Washington just over a year ago, it's all about telling the truth -- as he sees it. Election-year logic explains GOP dysfunction . Cruz: Politicians are lying to the people . Washington politicians -- including fellow Republicans -- don't want to be honest with America about their unwillingness to tackle tough issues like the rising federal debt, Cruz said Thursday in an interview with conservative talk radio host Mark Levin. ""People don't like to be lied to,"" he said to explain historically low approval ratings for Congress, adding that forcing Republican politicians to tell the truth ""makes their head explode."" Others, including fellow legislators, say Cruz puts his personal agenda of galvanizing a right-wing political movement ahead of what's best for his party as a whole as it tries to reclaim control of the Senate and retain its House majority in November. Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist and CNN political commentator, said Cruz's tactics seek to position him as a conservative champion on social issues as well as economic issues. Madden cited a new proposal by Cruz intended to strip the federal government's power to legalize gay marriage by shifting that issue to state control. ""Social conservatives are looking for a voice inside the legislative process on (the gay marriage) debate and Ted Cruz is now stepping up,"" Madden said. ""And I think Ted Cruz sees this as an opportunity to become a social conservative champion because I think he has put together a pretty strong profile as an economic conservative champion in other debates."" However, such right-wing positions increasingly differ from the American mainstream, which can make Cruz a liability for the Republican Party, according to Madden. ""If he's positioning himself as the face of the party, and he's moving against public tide and public sentiment, it makes Republicans look once again like they are out of step with the American people,"" Madden said, adding: ""That's what's happening to Ted Cruz."" Panel: Cruz creating headaches for McConnell, GOP . New kid on the block . In less than 14 months, Cruz has quarreled publicly with Democratic senators, staged a 21-hour filibuster against the health reforms known as Obamacare -- at one point reading the Dr. Seuss classic ""Green Eggs and Ham"" -- and enraged GOP leaders by pushing strategies that backfired on the party. Last October, Cruz's insistence on linking provisions dismantling Obamacare to needed government spending authority caused the government shutdown. It ended with Republicans getting nothing but blame for what most Americans considered a needless political crisis. Wary of a similar debacle, Republican leaders shifted from a two-year strategy of wringing concessions out of the need to raise the federal borrowing limit. After previously saying they would target the debt ceiling deadline in late February for more deficit-reduction demands, they decided against creating another example of Washington gridlock and dysfunction. This week, House Republicans failed to agree on attaching various provisions sought by conservatives to a debt-ceiling plan that allows the government to borrow what it needs through March of 2015. House Speaker John Boehner, a past proponent of forcing concessions over the issue, gave up and pushed through a ""clean"" proposal that passed with support from 199 Democrats and only 28 Republicans. GOP leaders in Senate then sought a politically expedient strategy for the measure disliked by the party's conservative base. They urged their caucus to let it come up without objection so Republicans could simply vote ""no"" while Democrats passed it. Filibuster politics . Cruz had other ideas. He tried to filibuster the measure, which forced a 60-vote majority in order for it to proceed. That meant at least five Republicans had to join the 55-seat Democratic caucus to prevent a showdown that could roil financial markets over the possibility of a U.S. default in coming weeks. With the vote held open for far longer than usual, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and top deputy John Cornyn of Texas eventually provided the final two Republicans votes needed to overcome the Cruz filibuster bid. Other GOP senators then changed their votes to provide political cover for McConnell and Cornyn, and all 12 Republican senators who helped Democrats stave off the filibuster then opposed the debt ceiling plan on the final vote. Needing only a simple majority for final approval, it passed with purely Democratic support. Cruz railed against that kind of politicking in the interview Thursday with Levin, accusing fellow Republicans of being dishonest. ""The single thing that Republican politicians hate and fear the most ... is when they're forced to tell the truth. It makes their head explode,"" he said, calling the debt-ceiling vote ""the perfect example."" His GOP colleagues, which he called establishment Republicans, wanted ""a perfect show vote"" in which they opposed the debt ceiling plan without being held accountable for enabling Democrats to pass it by helping them overcome the filibuster bid, Cruz said. ""They wanted to be able to tell what they view as their foolish gullible constituents back home they didn't do it, and they're mad because by (my) refusing to consent to that, they had to come out in the open and admit to that,"" he said. Harsh criticism . It was unusually harsh and direct criticism of party colleagues, the opposite of the political mantra often cited by GOP icon Ronald Reagan that ""thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican."" Republican anger at Cruz for the debt-ceiling maneuver had been obvious but muted. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said his colleagues thought ""this wasn't a good strategy in light of the fact that the House showed it didn't have the ability to pass a debt ceiling with Republican votes."" Graham and other veteran GOP legislators, including McConnell and Cornyn, face primary challengers from the right this year, and the debt-ceiling vote provided ammunition for opponents to attack their conservative credentials. For Cruz, bucking what he calls the Washington establishment, including Republicans, is all that matters. ""If we wait on the entrenched politicians in Washington to make the case to stand up, hell will freeze over before that happens,"" he told Levin. ""This is nothing new. That's true of entrenched power. It's always been true of Washington."" About his GOP detractors, Cruz said that ""every one of those senators who's angry, when they go back home, they tell their constituents they're doing everything they can to stop (the rising debt ceiling), but they don't actually want to do what they're saying."" Such a public rift with his party can hurt Republicans and Cruz, said Marc Lamont Hill, a CNN political commentator who hosts ""Huff Post Live."" ""Ted Cruz seems to be uncontrollable by the Republican Party,"" Hill noted, adding that polls show Cruz ""moving in the wrong direction"" among potential GOP presidential contenders in 2016. ""People are dissatisfied with folk like Ted Cruz, who don't seem viable anymore because they're not willing to play ball."" Madden, the GOP strategist, conceded that with Cruz's ability to ""drive a lot of headlines and get a lot of attention,"" Republican leaders will continue to see him ""as a challenge.""

"(CNN) -- At least 19 people were killed in bombings in Baghdad on Saturday evening, police said. The deadliest blast was caused by a car bomb that exploded near a Western-style mall in the western Mansour district, killing at least six people. At least 13 other people died in six other incidents across the city, Iraq's capital. At least 74 people were wounded in the Baghdad bombings -- six car bombs and one roadside bomb. Baghdad police officials said that gunmen broke out 23 prisoners from the Tobchi juvenile prison in Baghdad and that two police officers were killed and three wounded. But that report was contradicted by Labor Minister Nassar al-Rubaie, who said on state TV that no prisoners escaped. The Labor Department runs the juvenile prison. By around midnight, 13 of the 23 escapees had been captured in three neighborhoods of Baghdad, police officials there said. Earlier Saturday, at least one person was killed and 11 others were wounded when two explosive devices detonated in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, the city's police said. The attack targeted a marketplace in the southern part of the city, police said. Iraq has been engulfed in fighting and political instability in recent months. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. On Wednesday, at least 61 people were killed and scores wounded in the latest wave of attacks in the Iraqi capital and across the country. Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since violence broke out in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. The violence recalls the bloody fighting at the height of the Iraq war that nearly tore the country apart. On Saturday, Vice President Joe Biden talked with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki about U.S. support for Iraq's fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group that is trying to overthrow the Iraqi government. Biden's office said the two leaders agreed on the importance of the Iraqi government's continued outreach to local and tribal leaders in Anbar province.","NEW: 13 of 23 escapees from a juvenile prison have been captured, police say .

"(CNN) -- Standing on the spot where 50 years earlier the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. made ""I have a dream"" the clarion call of the civil rights movement, a broader call for equality rang out Saturday. Thousands rallied at the National Mall to mark the 50th anniversary of the historic August 28, 1963, March on Washington. Leaders from civil rights, religious and civic organizations paid tribute to those who fought and continue to fight for racial equality, but the slate of demands today has expanded to other hot-button issues. Income inequality, discrimination based on sexual orientation and mistreatment of immigrants were all themes espoused by the dozens of speakers. ""I am a daughter of the civil rights movement, and as a daughter I am a beneficiary of all the good that resulted from the hard work, the sweat and tears, and the blood that was shed by the leaders and doers of that movement,"" Jennifer Jones Austin of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies told the crowd. ""And as a daughter and a beneficiary, I am now the burden-bearer of this generation's civil rights movement."" Bernice King's difficult journey . That burden, she said, includes equal rights for gays and fights against poverty and gun violence. Attorney General Eric Holder credited King's famous words for providing a foundation for the progress of the civil rights movement. ""Our focus has broadened to include the cause of women, of Latinos, of Asian-Americans, of lesbians, of gays, of people with disabilities and of countless others across this great country who still yearn for equality, opportunity and fair treatment,"" he said. Many speakers invoked the killing of Trayvon Martin as an example of where they see a lack of justice for African-Americans. Martin Luther King III, son of the civil rights icon, said his father's vision was a nation without racial discrimination. ""But sadly, the tears of Trayvon Martin's mother and father reminds us that far too frequently, the color of one's skin remains a license to profile."" In 1963, ""we could not have imagined we'd be here 50 years later with a black president and a black attorney general, but that's a measure of how far we have come,"" civil rights activist Julian Bond said. ""But still, we march."" Minorities have never wished their way to freedom, he said, but have worked their way up, and must continue to do so. The only class MLK taught . ""While I'm elated that we've come today to march on Washington, we must not only march on Washington. We must stand for a genuine living wage and jobs. We must stand to end the 'stand your ground' laws. We must stand against stop-and-frisk, must must stand against voter suppression,"" Bishop Darin Moore of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church said. Another theme repeated throughout the event was outrage at the Supreme Court decision that threw out a key part of the Voting Rights Act. The court in June invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the South -- could remain under special federal oversight, requiring approval from Washington before they can change voting procedures. That blunted much of the government's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls. ""We didn't forget the price they paid,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton said, referring to those on the front lines of the civil rights movement. ""We've fought too hard, our parents shed too much blood, there was too many nights in jail, for you to take our vote from us now."" Sharpton said organized protests to demand a reinstatement of the provisions are forthcoming. 5 faces of the March on Washington . Kathleen Johnson and Jean McRae were at the first March on Washington 50 years ago, and as the crowd grew on Saturday, they reflected on the span in between. ""It was a wonderful experience (in 1963) because prior to that there were many things going on in the United States that were not right,"" Johnson said. The injustices that existed in 1963 convinced Johnson and her family and friends to attend the march. ""We had to be there. We had to be a part of it,"" she said. The fight for equality that the original march embodied remains a work in progress, McRae said, which makes Saturday's event so important. ""We need this, especially now,"" she said. Both women wore buttons from the march in 1963. Saturday's event is the first of two rallies to mark the anniversary. President Barack Obama headlines another event Wednesday, the exact anniversary of the March on Washington, where MLK delivered the now-famous speech at the Lincoln Memorial. The Wednesday event will include a longer march through Washington and speeches by Obama and former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.

"(CNN) -- A veterinary pharmacy in Florida acknowledged Thursday that it incorrectly prepared medication used to treat 21 horses who all died around the time of an international polo match last weekend. Veterinarian Scott Swerdlin talks with reporters Sunday about his Palm Beach Equine Clinic's response. The deaths of the ponies, witnessed in full view by spectators Sunday in a dramatic scene where horses collapsed one after another, have shaken the prestigious polo tournament at the marquee International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida. An internal investigation by Franck's Pharmacy in Ocala, Florida, ""concluded that the strength of an ingredient in the medication was incorrect. We will cooperate fully with the authorities as they continue their investigations,"" the company said in a statement issued Thursday afternoon. ""We extend our most sincere condolences to the horses' owners, the Lechuza Polo team and the members of the United States Polo Association. We share their grief and sadness,"" the pharmacy's chief operations officer, Jennifer Beckett, said in the statement. A memorial ceremony for the horses is scheduled for Thursday at the U.S. Open Polo Championship, where officials hope to resume play after matches were postponed by rain Wednesday. The memorial service will include a brief speech and a wreath-laying on the field. The pharmacy said it prepared medication for the horses on orders from a veterinarian. Liz Compton, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, told CNN that the agency is awaiting toxicology results from the animals and could not comment on the pharmacy's disclosure. ""Obviously, we are going to follow any and every potential lead to get to the bottom of this,"" she said. The horses were trained by Lechuza Polo, a Venezuela-based team. Its captain, Juan Martin Nero, told an Argentine newspaper earlier this week that he had ""no doubts"" vitamins administered to the animals were at fault. ""There were five horses that did not get the vitamin, and those were the only ones that survived,"" Nero said. The horses collapsed one after another in front of spectators at the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, while being prepared for a tournament Sunday. Most were dead within an hour. Post-mortem examinations done by a University of Florida laboratory found significant hemorrhaging in several horses, but the findings did not single out a specific cause.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge in Virginia has struck down the commonwealth's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional, according to court documents. ""These laws deny Plaintiffs their rights to due process and equal protection guaranteed under the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution,"" U.S. District Judge Arenda Wright Allen wrote in her opinion. The decision comes just weeks after Virginia's new Democratic leadership said it wouldn't defend the ban in federal lawsuits. ""It's time for the commonwealth to be on the right side of history and the right side of the law,"" state Attorney General Mark Herring said at a news conference last month. Virginia passed the ban in 2006. The judge's decision is the latest in a recent series of such federal court rulings in mostly conservative states that began last June with a historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriages. On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that Kentucky's refusal to recognize same-sex marriages also violates the 14th Amendment. Federal judges took the same stance in Oklahoma and Utah in recent months. A similar development may be underway in Nevada, where the state's ban will no longer be defended in light of federal judges' rulings in other states in support of same-sex marriage. Some states are taking up measures to counter the growing legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Kansas are considering a bill that would make it legal to deny goods and services to same-sex couples for religious reasons. Same-sex marriage is permitted by law in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of the nations are in Europe and South America.

"Washington (CNN) -- If Congress has danced at the most perilous edges of brinkmanship, we the people helped push them there. We did it by voting lawmakers out of office when they work with the other party to craft legislation but then claiming we want Congress to compromise and seek bipartisan solutions. We're doing it by sending to office those who promise to toe the line and continue the partisanship we say we despise. We did it by allowing our state legislatures to draw congressional districts that are so starkly red or blue that there's little room for any other hue or viewpoint. We did it by congregating in neighborhoods and communities with like-minded people who share our views on politics, religion, and social mores and, as a result, largely electing lawmakers who echo those views. We the people have always tended to live, work, and play with and around people who have similar values. So no matter how many ways you slice many of the nation's neighborhoods into districts, the outcome is the sameâ€”homogeny. That's because you can't redistrict social attitudes. ""We the people do bear responsibility,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. ""It's often been said we get the government we deserve. The polarization has come in part because the middle has fallen away and engagement has been left to the far right and far left."" The Gangs of D.C.: The dubious history of the political posse . A house divided . It was New Year's Eve, and few in Washington had anything to celebrate. The 112th Congress had spent weeks in an acrimonious fight over reducing deficits and averting the fiscal cliff. The battle ended in a series of late night and early morning votes. In those final votes, the 112th Congress stayed true to the deeply partisan course that had earned it low national approval ratings, the nickname ""do-nothing"" and a track record as one of the least effective in recent years. In the House in particular, those votes seemed to reflect the districts those lawmakers represented. The chamber's Republicans were starkly divided with 85 voting to support the measure and 151 opposing it, according to an analysis by Keith Poole, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. Among Democrats, 172 backed the measure while just 16 were opposed. One congressional delegation's votes seemed to highlight that divide. Hyper-partisanship dragging down nation . In North Carolina, congressional districts are either so red or blue that they trend well above the national average in that regard, said David Wasserman, House of Representatives editor at the Cook Political Report. There are ""diametrically opposed viewpoints just across the highway median from each other,"" Wasserman said. As a result, in votes like the fiscal cliff showdown, members of Congress ""are simply responding to what their districts want."" North Carolina's congressional delegation was nearly evenly split in its fiscal cliff votes. The ""no"" votes included Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, who represents the largely white, rural and GOP-leaning 5th Congressional District, and Democrat Brad Miller. Due to Republican-friendly redistricting of an area that went to Democratic presidential candidates in the last two election cycles, Miller decided not to run for re-election to represent the 13th Congressional District. Those voting for the measure included Democrat Rep. Mel Watt, who represents a largely urban, racially mixed 12th Congressional District, and Democrat Rep. David Price, who represents the state's more liberal-leaning Research Triangle in the 4th Congressional District. More 'cliffs' to come in new Congress . During 2011 redistricting efforts, North Carolina's lines had to be redrawn to account for a phenomenon that political and social scientists say deeply affects partisanship â€”population growth near large metro areas and a move away from rural areas. North Carolina's redrawn 9th Congressional District's population, currently represented by Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger, mushroomed by 38%. Pittenger lost urban Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, to Democrat Jennifer Roberts in the general election. But he won places like more rural Iredell County, which has a NASCAR hub. For several generations, urban areas have tended to trend Democrat while many rural areas have remained Republican strongholds, political demographers say. And the number of swing states, those where a presidential candidate could run a competitive campaign and nab voters on the fence, has decreased dramatically over that same period of time. Even when attempts are made to remove partisanship from the redistricting process, those drawing the lines run up against those types of trends. In California, a citizen-led commission, chosen randomly from a bipartisan pool of applicants, has created some of the most competitive districts in the nation with mixed results. It was hoped that by avoiding the state legislature, the redistricting process could steer clear of the type of partisanship that often marks that process. However, ""Democrats had figured out the map they wanted to end up with and then they went to community groups and made the pitch to get that,"" said Douglas Johnson, a fellow at the Rose Institute of State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College. So a process that was supposed to be random wasn't completely. ""It was a huge improvement over the legislature drawing the lines,"" Johnson said. ""It didn't measure up to the grand hopes and nirvana dreams of some, but it was an improvement."" Thirteen states have adopted some version of commissions to try to remove politics from redistricting, a task some political scientists and demography experts say is impossible and doesn't necessarily result in more balanced districts in this hyper-polarized climate. ""Given the breakdown of traditional institutions and the traditional ways people mix, how do you govern this new country?"" asked Bill Bishop, co-author of ""The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart."" ""How do you create one country out of a country that is becoming increasingly a collection of communities?"" The house we built . Increasingly, people live in communities that are carefully crafted political echo chambers. ""The dirty little secret is that redistricting only explains part of polarization,"" Wasserman said. ""Congressional districts are polarized partly because Americans have polarized with their feet. It makes it easier for partisan line drawers to draw those lines."" Every 10 years, just after the U.S. Census is completed, state lawmakers are charged with the task of redrawing and, in some cases, creating congressional districts that take into account population shifts since the last census. It is often a deeply partisan and complicated process in which the party in power usually tries to craft districts that are favorable to them while minimizing the other side's political heft. A number of states, many of them in the South, with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices, also must get pre-clearance from the Department of Justice before tweaking their voting laws and maps. In several places, efforts to achieve this equity have resulted in odd shaped districts and court challenges. Take for example Watt's 12th District in North Carolina, a narrow, serpentine strip that nearly dissects the state as it snakes 80 miles along Interstate 85. The district is considered ""majority minority"" and is reliably Democratic. ""In states where Republicans have control, Republicans have been able to use the Voting Rights Act to pack (minorities) into districts so they can win the rest, Wasserman said. But that only explains part of why some districts are so partisan. Across the nation, people are self-sorting into neighborhoods and cities with likeminded peers, political experts and demographers say. ""We don't think people move to be around others who vote like themselves. They are moving to be around people who are like themselves in every other sort of way,"" Bishop said. ""Young white people moved to Austin. Young black people moved to Houston, Atlanta and D.C. Every time we looked at a measure on the country level, differences began to appear,"" Bishop said. ""Civic groups became more specialized. Churches began to organize around lifestyles. Lifestyle characteristics began to line up with the vote."" In looking at election data from 1992, 2000 and 2002, political scientists Marc Hetherington of Vanderbilt University and Jonathan Weiler of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that places where spanking is more likely to be used to discipline children tend to lean Republican. Areas where timeouts are the norm tend to trend Democrat. Women in the Northeast who married and started families later in life tended to vote Democrat while their Midwestern peers who got a head start on marriage and family building often voted Republican, Belgian demographer Ron Lesthaeghe found. Five things we learned on Election Night . Large numbers of women, minority, gay and young voters helped President Barack Obama clinch his victory in the recent general election. Likewise, a historic number of women and racial minorities were elected to Congress from similarly diverse and largely Democratic states and districts. On the other hand, Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney's strong performance among many white voters echoes his party's congressional representation â€” largely older, white men. During the 2012 election, Obama won technology hub Silicon Valley, continuing a trend of technocrats backing Democrats. But he lost the Deep South, continuing that region's red streak. All of this self-sorting in tiny towns, urban enclaves and suburbs has had a collective impact on the rarefied and increasingly toxic political climate in Washington these days. The 112th House was roughly 50% more polarized in terms of makeup than that of the 102nd, which convened from 1991 to 1993, Poole found in his research. The 112th's Senate was more polarized than the 46th Senate, which was in office from 1879-1881, just after the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War, Poole found. ""This is polarization based on choice and self-selection,"" Bishop said. ""Being an adult is accepting lots of different ways of being. We are so unsure of our own identities that we are not as accepting as we could be of people of different identities. In a sense we are getting what we demand from government. We demand our tribe wins. So that's the fight. It becomes a fight of tribal differences.""","Americans are partly to blame for political partisanship .

"(CNN) -- The German blowout over Brazil stunned the world, launched countless memes and set a new Twitter record. Twitter's trending hashtags Germany (insert your verb) #Brazil 7-1 and ""BrasilDecimeQuese7"" should tell you the whole story. But in case you haven't heard, here's the recap. The pummeling of the Brazilian team on home turf was the most-discussed single sports game ever on the social media network with 35.6 million tweets. Not many saw this coming -- including ESPN's FiveThirtyEight statistician, Nate Silver. During the first 29 minutes, Germany scored five goals, leaving the vast sea of yellow and green in the stadium stunned. After halftime, things didn't get any better for the hosts. The Germans weren't in the mood for mercy, as they struck twice more to drive the point home. Some lamented the lack of Brazilian superstar Neymar, who was out with a fractured vertebra sustained in the previous game against Colombia. Photoshop tribute . With a blowout imminent, many football fans turned away from their televisions and poured their energy to Photoshop. Some found a new design for Rio's famous Christ the Redeemer statue -- with designs featuring an triumphant German Chancellor Angela Merkel or a weeping Jesus. And the Brazilian flag. Others held their heads up high, taking comfort in Brazil's storied soccer tradition. A Tumblr called Sad Brazilians popped up showing sobbing children, women with their face paint-stained, tears streaming down their cheeks, and -- of course -- the teary Brazilian captain, David Luiz. And as Brazil's players returned home, the German team celebrated with a picture on their plane ride back to prepare for their final showdown on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro. They will face the winners of Wednesday's other semi-final clash between Argentina and the Netherlands.

"(CNN) -- Another day, another star player ruled out of the 2014 World Cup. France is the latest team to suffer a hammer blow after playmaker Franck Ribery failed to overcome a back injury. Ribery, who plays club football for German champions Bayern Munich, had been battling the problem ahead of France's opening Group E match against Honduras on June 15. The 31-year-old had been following an individual training regime, but was forced to pull out of his first full session back with the squad. It was a doubly bad day for France coach Didier Deschamps as Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier's World Cup was ended before it began due to a thigh injury. ""(Ribery) stopped with a strong pain,"" Deschamps, who captained France to World Cup glory in 1998, told reporters. ""He had tests early in the afternoon which unfortunately confirmed the severity of the situation, that he will be unavailable for several weeks."" Ribery, who played for France in the 2006 World Cup final, and Grenier will be replaced in the squad by Montpellier's Remy Cabella and Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton. ""The two players were on the reserve list and they are similar to the two players who left us,"" added Deschamps. ""You cannot copy them exactly but Morgan Schneiderlin is the player most in the profile of Clement Grenier, and Remy Cabella is the most in the profile of Franck Ribery."" Ribery is the latest high-profile player to be ruled out of football's showpiece event. Colombia striker Radamel Falcao failed in his bid to recover from a knee injury, while reigning world champions Spain will be without the services of Ribery's Bayern teammate Thiago and Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes. The Netherlands has lost two key players to injury. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman is out with a long-term knee problem, joining Hamburg's Rafael van der Vaart on the sidelines. England is missing Arsenal's Theo Walcott for the tournament, while his Arsenal teammate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is also struggling to play a part in Brazil after injuring himself in Wednesday's friendly against Ecuador. Fitness doubts also hover over two of the world's finest players. Uruguay's Luis Suarez is in a race against time to recover from knee surgery, with FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo also managing a thigh injury and tendonitis in his knee, which has ruled the Real Madrid forward out of Portugal's warmup match against Mexico on Friday.","France's Franck Ribery is out of World Cup with a back injury .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Even in the darkest, deadliest days of Iraq's war, you'd find people still hopeful it would all work out. That the killings would stop, the bad guys would be routed and a stability of some sort would return. That the Americans would leave with their Humvees and their private security companies and the country would -- perhaps -- get on with the freedom the U.S. promised upon Saddam Hussein's removal. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki promised as much, and pledged an inclusive system for all. Power-sharing politics and making all Iraqis -- Sunni, Shia, Christian -- feel they shared national values. Now, there a plenty of Iraqis who believe he had his fingers crossed when he said such things. Just over two years ago, I watched as the last of 110 or so U.S. military vehicles crossed the border from Iraq and into Kuwait -- the same border crossing I'd gone through in at the start of the war in 2003 with a U.S. Marine convoy headed to the Iraqi capital. I've had nearly a dozen trips in between and now here I am, back in Baghdad. The city feels much the same as it did during some of those other trips -- and that's not a good thing. Actually, it feels worse. READ MORE: Are things worse than ever in Iraq? The U.S. departure may have ended the war for Americans, but for Iraqis, the violence, the bombs, the shootings and the torrents of blood barely skipped a beat. A lull here and there, periods of what might (for Iraq) pass for stability, but really, the deaths never stopped. More than 8,000 people were killed here last year, mostly innocent civilians, according to the U.N. The feeling in Baghdad today is one of dread -- dreading the next car bomb or suicide attack or assassination. The city isn't lacking a security presence -- it is awash in it. Two years ago there were checkpoints, but nowhere near the number we've seen these past days, nor were those manning those checkpoints as, let's say, fastidious as they are now. Just moving around the city is an exercise in moving from one checkpoint to the next, each manned by young men who themselves, one imagines, fear the next car could be the last one they ever inspect. Getting around the city is as difficult as ever. Traffic jams are a way of life here, but they seem worse because of the security presence. Check points and police posts are everywhere, but they can't stop every attack -- eight bombs have gone off in Baghdad in the past two days as I write this. READ MORE: 26 killed in bombings in northern Iraq . People have to get on with life, and do the best they can. One target of the terrorists is marketplaces, where locals put their lives on the line just to shop for dinner. Many buildings damaged during the war sit unrepaired, but there are signs of construction too. There's even a mall of sorts being built not far from where we're staying. Many parts of the city retain a tattered feel, like it's a tired city, weary of the tribulations of the last decade. Public services are a problem -- electricity can still be patchy, there's no shortage of roads needing repair, unemployment is high, sewage systems are in desperate need of repair. Iraq's to-do list, despite growing oil revenues, is a long one. In the ""bad old days"" of, say, 2005-2007, barely a day went by when, sitting in our bureau, we would not hear a boom or gunshots, some dulled by distance, others rattling our windows. One day, a stray bullet pierced one of those windows. Those booms are back. Plenty has been reported about the violence in Ramadi and Fallujah and the resurgence of al-Qaeda linked radicals, but the killing is widespread -- from Mosul in the north to Baghdad to the south of the country. Dr. Ayad Allawi was Iraq's first post-Saddam head of government, serving as interim Prime Minister in 2004 and 2005. Tough as nails, but a committed secularist, he looks at his country today with more than a dose of pessimism. ""Unfortunately the country is moving on a sectarian road now,"" he tells me as we sit in his office, hidden behind blast walls and protected by government and private security. ""It was very dangerous to start with, and I warned leaders in the region. (Now) Iraq has started a civil war -- it hasn't reached the point of no return, but if it does then the whole region will burn up."" He points the finger of blame in many directions, from Syria to the U.S. to Iran, but mainly at the man who now holds his old job -- Prime Minister al-Maliki. ""He doesn't believe in power sharing, he doesn't believe in reconciliation,"" Allawi says. ""He promised to do these things once he became Prime Minister, but in effect he talks against this -- accusing everyone else of being a terrorist, or corrupt, or extremist and so on. ""Authoritarian regimes don't work in this country -- we tried this before and it didn't work. No one sect can rule, no one party can rule, no one man can rule -- we want a democratic country but this is not, unfortunately, what this government wants."" READ MORE: Zakaria on why Iraq is in turmoil . There is no shortage of those who also point to al-Maliki, a Shia Muslim, and his sectarian brand of governing and say his alienation of Sunnis is why al Qaeda-linked fighters could reappear so easily to once again wreak havoc. Extremists thrive on disaffection, and there is plenty of that in Anbar and Mosul and other places. Allawi is also unhappy with the U.S., saying they have made a ""huge mistake"" by supporting al-Maliki without also turning the screws on him to engage Sunni leaders and include them in a meaningful way in the running of the country. ""They can support al-Maliki -- that's up to them,"" he says. ""But they should clarify to him that their support is conditional on inclusivity of the political process and respecting the constitution and respecting human rights."" I suggest to him that the Americans have of late been applying some of that pressure, but he disagrees. ""Of course the Americans are not doing this,"" he says. ""I don't know if they are pushing, frankly speaking -- I do believe they may pay lip service, but they don't fully use the influence they have as friends of Mr. al-Maliki."" Over the course of more than a dozen trips to Iraq since the war began, I've always encountered angry Iraqis -- angry at the American troops, angry at the lack of services, angry at the insurgents and the sectarian bloodletting. But on this visit, I've found a hardening of attitudes right down the sectarian line -- Shias who feel Sunnis are al Qaeda-supporting extremists, and Sunnis who tell terrible tales of persecution, exclusion and fear of being detained based on their religion alone. The moderates who wish to embrace their fellow Iraqi, regardless of sect, are becoming harder to find.","CNN's Michael Holmes returns to Iraq for first time in 2 years .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN)  -- A Brazilian TV host denies authorities' charges that he orchestrated the murders of drug dealers and other criminals to generate sensational footage for his show. TV host Wallace Souza is accused of ordering hits on criminal rivals and then covering the deaths for ratings. Wallace Souza, a state legislator and former host of a police TV show called ""Canal Livre,"" also was a drug trafficker, officials say. And to get rid of the competition -- and drive up ratings -- he would order that criminal rivals be killed and then would have his camera crews arrive first on the scene, authorities say. ""In truth, they went as far as creating acts,"" said Thomas Augusto Vasconcelos, intelligence secretary for Amazonas state. ""It's been determined that the crimes were committed in order to generate news for the program."" Souza has denied the accusations, and his lawyer has criticized key testimony and questioned the investigation. ""In all the investigations carried out by the public minister and the police, up to now they have not presented any technical evidence of any type,"" attorney Francisco Balieiro said on Brazilian TV. State officials say Souza faces charges of forming a criminal gang, corrupting testimony, drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms. He remains free because of legislative immunity, officials say.  Watch report on Souza's former show, charges he faces » . State Attorney General Otavio Gomes told the Agencia Folha news outlet that Souza's gang has been linked to six slayings. But prosecutor Pedro Bezerra told the news outlet he could not bring murder charges against Souza for lack of concrete evidence. The Amazonas State Justice Tribunal, which held a hearing on the accusations, said the criminal complaint was based on testimony by former Souza associate Moacir Jorge da Costa. After Jorge's arrest, he talked about the gang's reputed activities, including slayings. Souza's lawyer, Balieiro, said police and public ministry officials did not have standing to investigate the TV show host because he is a legislator. Furthermore, Balieiro said, Jorge's testimony was obtained in an irregular manner. According to the state public minister, who brought the charges against Souza, the legislator's son, Raphael, belonged to the criminal gang. Raphael Souza has been convicted of homicide, drug trafficking and illegal gun possession. Fifteen people connected with Souza, among them police officers and a chief, have been arrested. Souza, a former police officer who left the force more than 20 years ago after being implicated in a fuel theft case, received the most votes of any candidate in the last election in Amazonas state. His TV show went off the air last year after the investigation into his possible criminal involvement intensified. He lives in the jungle city of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, a region of Brazil known for its prevalent lawlessness. Souza would often rail on his lunchtime show about the killings and other atrocities being committed in the area.

"(CNN) -- Eric Cantor's loss in a Republican primary against an unknown economics professor with barely enough money in the bank to buy a mailing list is a political twist that's a little bit Shakespeare and a little bit ""House of Cards."" Oh, the irony, as the Bard himself would declare: Cantor was one of the original ""young guns"" who recruited some of the tea partyers, whose progeny then destroyed him. He was their rep in the more establishment leadership, a public thorn in the side of the White House during the 2011 budget negotiations. Cantor was primed to go places, maybe even to the speakership. But when high ambition strikes, political roots can be severed -- even if unintentionally. ""Measuring the drapes is never a good political strategy,"" a GOPer told me. See: Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar."" This being politics, a loss is mourned until the sharks circle. Cantor is not yet gone and the questions abound: Who will replace him in the leadership? (Establishment or tea party?) Will House Speaker John Boehner (whose job he coveted) stay on longer? (Probably yes.) Will the tea partyers be in full revolt against all the establishment leaders? If this were TV, Kevin Spacey might say, ""You might say that; I couldn't possibly comment."" Cantor 'earthquake' rattles Capitol Hill . But here's what's really going on today: The GOP is trying, once again, to figure out exactly what it is -- and what it can aspire to be. At this point, it's a successful congressional party: in control of the House. In the hunt to win control of the Senate, with a real shot at it. An opposition party that shut down the government and thwarted immigration reform. One teensy problem: The reasons the GOP succeeds as a congressional party are very much the reasons it fails on the presidential level. Base politics works in GOP primaries, to be sure. It also works in congressional races that have been gerrymandered and tailored to partisan voters. But it's a lousy strategy if you want to win the presidency. Cantor lost his race for lots of reasons having to do with his own disconnect from his district, or at least the most conservative primary voters in his district. He was so disconnected, in fact, that by the time he realized he was in trouble the train was coming right at him. Arrogance? Maybe. Political malpractice? Maybe. Opinion: Who said the tea party was dead? But there's something else: Cantor, in recent years, actually started behaving as a leader. While he was a holdout against the budget deal in 2011, he wanted to end the government shutdown last year -- to the everlasting dismay of the hell-no caucus. And the sin recently was his decision to support one strand of immigration reform -- a path to citizenship for children who were brought to the United States illegally -- the so-called Dreamers. It was a leadership decision. It was the right decision. So now Republicans will run scared, and run away from immigration. They will overread this as a litmus test of what they can and cannot support. It's sad, really, because GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham -- who is trying to work a deal on immigration reform -- won his GOP primary with almost 60% of the vote in South Carolina. So, if Cantor lost and Graham won, how did that happen? Graham actually went back home, explained his positions to the voters and got out his supporters. Politics 101. But, as usual, the politicians will overdraw the lessons from the Cantor loss -- and draw the wrong ones, too. Cantor's demise will scare Republicans away from immigration reform which, as a national party, is an issue that they should embrace. Sure, it hurt Cantor -- and brought out opponents from the woodwork. But here's the real problem: Cantor never figured out that he had to explain himself to the voters who were actually going to show up to vote in the primary. Shakespeare might remind Cantor that ""Men at some times are masters of their fates."" And Frank Underwood would no doubt be succinct in his analysis of Cantor's loss: ""Friends,"" he tells us, ""make the worst enemies.""","Gloria Borger: Eric Cantor's upset is a little bit Shakespeare, a bit ""House of Cards""

"(CNN) -- Sailing the Atlantic on a perfect blue-sky day, HMS Bounty survivor Jessica Hewitt knew this would have been a beautiful moment to share with Claudene Christian. She looked down from the deck of the 125-foot Liberty Clipper to see dozens of playful dolphins swimming alongside the tall-masted sailing ship as it cut through the waves off North Carolina. As the 26-year-old held a glass bottle filled with pictures and handwritten notes, Hewitt's eyes moved across the southeast horizon toward a painful spot she knew was about 25 miles away. She couldn't help but picture what happened there aboard the HMS Bounty exactly a year ago Tuesday. The leaking, aging ship sailed into what would become the largest hurricane in generations. As the Category 1 storm churned about 100 miles off Cape Hatteras, Hurricane Sandy's battering winds and towering waves flipped the 180-foot ship sideways, spilling Hewitt and her shipmates into the water. The body of Capt. Robin Walbridge, 63, was never found. Christian, a 42-year-old rookie sailor, died after Coast Guard rescuers were unable to revive her. Their deaths and the sinking of perhaps the most famous tall ship in the world spurred an investigation that could still lead to new safety regulations and criminal charges. The story of the sinking: Life & death on the Bounty . The bottle in Hewitt's hand contained notes from fellow survivors, past Bounty crew and loved ones. Her note to Christian read, ""I'm so sorry. And I miss you."" ""Even now, I can't really form any words other than those,"" Hewitt said Friday from aboard the Liberty Clipper. Her voice trembling with emotion, Hewitt said Christian's death ""was such a huge loss for a lot of people. She really, really trusted us."" 'A part of me sank with the boat' Drawn by the romance of a freewheeling, seafaring lifestyle, Christian hoped to learn the ins and outs of a complicated three-masted square-rigger. When they met, Christian told Hewitt she'd always wanted to send off a message in a bottle, to take part in that universal time-honored tradition of the ocean. ""We were going to do it sometime during the passage,"" Hewitt remembered. Now, so close to the site and after all that happened, a message bottle seemed even more appropriate. She thought back to the wailing wind, pelting rain and fear that she and her shipmates experienced in the early morning darkness of October 29, 2012. The disaster set them on an emotional and psychological course that some of them still struggle to correct. In the minutes after the tipping ship tossed the crew into the water, Hewitt -- who was tethered to her boyfriend, Drew Salapatek -- felt herself being pulled underwater by her tether line, which had snagged on sinking debris from the ship. Hewitt realized she was about to drown. That thought triggered a frenzy to fight and free herself from the tether. She verged on passing out and even inhaled seawater. Wriggling out of the tether just in time, she finally broke the surface and sucked in precious gasps of air. Fourteen of Bounty's 16-member crew survived the next grueling hours thanks to GPS locator beacons, life rafts and Coast Guard rescuers. The trauma left Hewitt feeling embarrassed, ashamed, angry and sad. Worst was the fear. Since the rescue, Hewitt has been afraid to sail on open water in the high seas. It was quite the opposite while growing up. With roots in California, Florida and Cape Cod, Hewitt had always loved the vastness of the ocean, training for a seafaring career at the prestigious Maine Maritime Academy. What happened aboard the Bounty, she said, has left her damaged: afraid to dive underwater near big ships, fearful of sleeping below deck, especially during rough seas. When the fear comes, her heart races. Reminders of the disaster still come too often. ""I felt like a part of me sank with the boat. A sort of innocence was just gone."" Overhearing comments about the Bounty crew being ""reckless"" or that they're ""loving the attention"" made Hewitt mad. She said people often don't understand the lingering emotional trauma brought on by disasters, like when she's driving and suddenly the tears start welling up, forcing her to pull over. They ""don't see the side like when I had to interrupt my job conducting boat tours to go cry in a Porta-Potty."" Dealing with all this has been hard, Hewitt said. ""I've never been that sort of person before."" Despite her own struggles, Hewitt also wants to somehow transform the tragedy into a force to help others. 'Use your brain and your gut' One morning in early October on the campus of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Hewitt walked into Admiral's Hall. The lecture room was packed with about 150 students and faculty. ""I was so nervous,"" Hewitt said. ""I had no idea what to say."" Nonetheless, she stood at a small podium and shared her story, offering guidance on how others might save their own lives after abandoning ship. She joked about funny things that go through some people's minds during desperate times. For some reason, she thought it was important to bring her car keys with her before the ship sank, and another crew member chose to bring his teddy bear. She also talked about how her ""training clashed with what I was told"" when the crew was instructed to put on their floating emergency immersion suits below deck instead of up top, where the storm raged. ""What I took from that was, in situations like that, there are no rules except what you think will work best,"" she said. ""Sometimes, you just have to use your brain and your gut."" The bottom line, she said, quoting a former instructor, is that ""all you need is the will to survive."" For Hewitt, speaking to the students was ""a chance to say thank you and to maybe help someone else. Because other boats sink all the time, and you lose people at sea."" She has grown tired of some of the questions surrounding Walbridge's decision to sail while Sandy churned. They ask, ""What were you doing out there? What was the captain thinking?"" ""I tell them, 'I can't answer that for myself, and I can't answer that for you.' "" ""Nobody intentionally puts themselves and their crew at risk,"" said academy President Rick Gurnon. ""But once you've committed to a certain course of action, it's often impossible to change your mind. He made a choice. It turned out to be the wrong choice."" The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board have spent the past year investigating the disaster for possible negligence and safety violations. The Coast Guard report is under review and could be released at any time. It could lead to regulation changes -- and perhaps even a recommendation that criminal charges be forwarded to prosecutors. A $90 million civil lawsuit filed by Christian's parents against the Bounty's owners is in settlement talks, a family attorney said. Read more about the lawsuit . A return to the high seas . This past summer, Hewitt chose to fight to win back the person she was before. She needed to confront the high seas. ""I really wanted to do an ocean passage and kind of conquer that fear,"" she said. First, she ""baby-stepped it"" aboard ships that didn't venture too far out to sea. Now, Hewitt works aboard the Liberty Clipper as it sails from Boston to Key West, Florida, and then to its winter port in the Bahamas, her first real high-seas journey since the sinking. The past year has cast doubt on her dream of commanding a teaching vessel that toured young sailors around the world. ""This was my passion,"" she said. ""I've lost that, at least for the time being. ""I can work on tugboats and other stuff, but it's just not the same."" Her desire to give back may lead to a new career path as a maritime instructor. In various ways, other Bounty survivors, Hewitt says, are moving forward after the tragedy. She and fellow survivor Laura Groves seek out books by other adventurers who've overcome disaster. ""It's therapeutic to read other people's struggles and not feel alone,"" Hewitt said. Most of Bounty's survivors have returned to the water, gaining spots on other ships, said survivor Josh Scornavacchi. He's between vessels after volunteering aboard a few tall ships in the Philadelphia area. Despite nearly drowning when the Bounty sank, the 26-year-old says, he hasn't suffered any debilitating trauma. ""I think about it a lot,"" he said, ""I might get a little sad, not angry-sad but sad. It just makes me want to go out again."" Most of all, he misses sailing the high seas at night, the waves, a ""good squall"" and his favorite, climbing up the ship's rigging. Bounty life jackets found 400 miles from sinking site . Aboard the Liberty Clipper -- not far from the site where the Bounty went down last year -- Hewitt held the corked bottle filled with messages to Capt. Robin Walbridge and Claudene Christian. The bottle, weighted with an iron shackle, is ""the only way the message would get to them,"" she said. Symbolically, you might say the bottle also contained the crew's countless painful struggles and disappointments during a difficult year. She let the bottle go. It tumbled into the water, beginning a secret journey to a final destination determined by currents and tides -- and life's other infinite and random forces.","Survivor reveals yearlong struggle after tall ship Bounty sank in Hurricane Sandy .

"(CNN) -- The message is simple: stop wildlife trafficking. And to highlight it, the United States destroyed tons of elephant ivory it has seized over the years -- and will pay out $1 million to make sure it doesn't happen again. Hours before the destruction of the stockpile in Colorado Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced the reward money to help dismantle elephant and rhino trafficking syndicates. It's the first time the United States has offered such a reward, he said. Kerry said the bounty will target the Xaysavang Network, a wildlife trafficking syndicate based in Laos, which has affiliates in South Africa, Mozambique, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and China. ""The involvement of sophisticated transnational criminal organizations in wildlife trafficking perpetuates corruption, threatens the rule of law and border security in fragile regions, and destabilizes communities that depend on wildlife for biodiversity and eco-tourism,"" Kerry said. Profits from animal trafficking are between $8 billion to $10 billion a year, most of which are used to fund narcotics and human trafficking, according to Kerry. Commercial ivory trade was banned in the United States in 1989. The crushing of the six-ton stockpile of elephant ivory near Denver is the first time the U.S. has destroyed such large quantities. The ivory was seized and maintained as evidence until court trials were completed. Once the cases were concluded, some of it was used for training law enforcement officers. ""Over the past 25 years, we have accumulated far more elephant ivory than we can use for these purposes, and decided to destroy this material as a demonstration of our commitment to combating wildlife trafficking,"" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. ""We want to send a clear message that the United States will not tolerate ivory trafficking and the toll it is taking on elephant populations, particularly in Africa."" The illegal ivory trade has doubled worldwide since 2007, with the United States the second-largest retail market for illegally acquired ivory. China is the largest market. Poaching of the rhino horn is also a lucrative industry. Much of the loot is sold to the affluent in Asia, where some believe the horns cure a series of ills, including cancer and hangovers, and can boost virility. Last year alone, about 745 rhinos were poached throughout Africa -- the highest number in two decades. Some rhinoceros subspecies have been declared extinct. Conservation groups say the recent surge in the illicit ivory trade has resulted in the killing of 30,000 African elephants annually in recent years. Other nations including the Philippines, Kenya and Gabon have destroyed large quantities of ivory in recent years.","NEW: It's the first time the U.S. has offered such a reward, John Kerry says .

"(CNN) -- In a bookstore, I saw a woman taking photograph after photograph of newly released titles that were arranged on a shelf. She was using her phone to take the pictures. I didn't understand. Why would anyone want to take pictures of books? Then, at a restaurant, waiting for a table, I heard two men, also waiting, talking. One said he had just ended a frustrating day at the store he owned. ""Do they think I'm a showroom?"" he said. He mentioned people who had come into his shop that day, had looked at the merchandise, had taken notes -- and then had left. ""Do they think I don't know what they're doing?"" he said. It is a relatively new phenomenon. Among retail merchants -- owners of stores both small and large -- it has a name: . ""Showrooming."" No one showrooms by choice. And it represents a potential sea change in American life. Its implications are vast. As described in an article by reporter Amy Zimmerman in the Wall Street Journal, showrooming is ""when shoppers come into a store to see a product in person, only to buy it from a rival online, frequently at a lower price."" Say a merchant owns a retail store -- a brick-and-mortar store, on a city street. He or she hires staff, pays rent, writes checks for electricity and telephone service, pays for janitorial work, pays real estate and sales taxes, invests heavily in merchandise. And hopes against hope that customers will come in, look around and buy something. This is how the retail sales business has always worked. But in recent years, as online companies without a single physical store have risen to prominence, something new has occurred. People will come into stores, look around, stop at items they particularly like -- and instead of carrying them to the cash register, will take photos of them, or type a description into their smartphones. Then, in many cases, they will go home, enter the product into a search engine and find some online-only merchant -- a merchant who has no real-life stores -- who is selling the item for less money. A tap of the ""Enter"" key, a few keystrokes to provide credit card information, and the item -- the item the person has examined and liked in the brick-and-mortar store -- is on its way to the buyer's home. It's all so effortless. The online merchant wins. The purchaser wins. Who loses? You know the answer. The loser is the owner of that real-life store: the person who has stocked the merchandise, hired the staff, paid to keep the store cool in summer and warm in winter, written the rent checks and the tax checks. It is no wonder merchants are feeling frustration and anger that their stores are being considered as little more than showrooms by some shoppers -- showrooms displaying merchandise that, if the people wandering the aisles go home and buy from an online vendor, will provide not a cent in revenue to the owner of the real store. Do the customers ever look into the eyes of the proprietor of the store and wonder if this new way is fair to him? As Brad Tuttle of Time magazine has written: . ""Most consumers don't really care how, or even if, a retailer makes money. All they care about is which one has the best products at the cheapest prices. The ideal situation is one in which they can inspect merchandise in person, and then buy it at the cheapest price without having to schlep it to and from the car, and without having to pay extra for delivery."" What's the difference, you may ask? Why does this matter? It will matter when and if critical mass is reached, and online-only merchants, who don't have to underwrite the expense of having traditional stores on city streets, reach dominance. Then, one by one, the stores that have unwillingly become showrooms for the online merchants will fold up. And the American downtown-and-mall landscape will begin to look barren. A doomsday scenario? Perhaps. But ""just browsing"" has taken on a different meaning in the context of shoppers who go home and use their computers' browsers to find online retailers who will undercut the conventional stores. Last weekend I was in central Ohio for the annual charity race we hold to raise cancer-research money in memory of my late friend Jack Roth. I asked his daughter, Maren, who owns a women's boutique called Rowe, whether she was familiar with the showrooming phenomenon. She said she has seen it with her own eyes, in her own store. ""If they tell you how much they like an item, and take a picture of it and then leave the store and you never hear from them again, it's a pretty good indication that they may be going home and looking for a better price online,"" she said. ""And if they call the store later and ask you to tell them the specific style name and number of the item -- then you really know. They're putting the merchandise they saw in your store into a search engine."" It's not just smaller merchants like Roth. Target, the retail-store giant, wrote a letter to its vendors this year that said, ""What we aren't willing to do is let online-only retailers use our brick-and-mortar stores as a showroom for their products and undercut our prices without making investments, as we do, to proudly display your brands."" What all this will eventually do to old-style stores is anyone's guess. Perhaps they will be judged to have outlived their usefulness. In the meantime, merchants will continue to open their doors each morning in the hopes that the people who come in will really intend to buy something. There is a longstanding axiom that business owners are supposed to believe in: ""The customer is always right."" But in this emerging era in which people come into stores taking photos and making lists, with no intention to give the store owner their business, worried merchants can't be blamed if they look around their shops and ask themselves: . Who, and what, is a customer? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: A new practice called' ""showrooming"" a threat to brick and mortar businesses .
He says shoppers take pictures of an item, or make notes, and then buy the item online instead .
He says running a store costly, how can merchants compete if shoppers ""showroom?""
Greene: Even big stores, like Target, worry. Showrooming may lead to stores' demise ."
"(CNN) -- The Arab League, which held an emergency meeting in Cairo on Sunday about the ongoing unrest in Syria, is considering suspending the country from the organization. The Gulf Cooperation Council, made up of six Gulf Arab states, is spearheading the motion, which would need two-thirds of the assembly vote to pass. In his opening remarks, Syrian ambassador Yousef Ahmad blamed foreign influences for the unrest in his country. He cited the influence of Arabic-language news groups, which he said are targeting Syria. The Arab League meeting comes after more than seven months of protests against the government in Syria in which the United Nations says about 3,000 people have died. Also Sunday, Syrian security forces set up barricades and carried out raids, according to opposition sources. Eleven people were killed, said the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) of Syria -- eight in Homs, two in Idlib and one in Zabadani, a Damascus suburb. Security and military forces were conducting raids and arresting people, apparently at random, in the suburbs of Damascus -- where heavy gunfire was heard -- and in villages around Homs, according to two opposition groups. There were also general strikes in the city of Daraa, one of the centers of resistance to the government of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the LCC and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The latter group said security forces fired live bullets at thousands of mourners attending the funeral of activist Ziad al-Obeidi in Dair Elzor on Sunday, which turned into a demonstration demanding the overthrow of the regime. A group allied with the government, meanwhile, named a number of anti-government activists it said were being paid and organized by agents of the United States and Israel. ""America is recruiting these weak-minded people to create sectarian fighting to help Israel and weaken Syria,"" said Elyas Helyani of the Syrian Human Rights Network. ""We have evidence of all this and will publish it soon to let the entire world know the reality,"" he told CNN. CNN cannot independently confirm events in Syria, which restricts international journalists from accessing many parts of the country. The government says it has been making efforts to respond to citizens' grievances about the country's political system, and blames armed groups for stoking the violence. Al-Assad announced the formation of a committee Saturday to draft a new constitution within four months, the Syrian Arab News Agency reported. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian security forces kill 11, an opposition group says .

"Lithonia, Georgia (CNN) -- Baptist televangelist Eddie Long said Sunday he will fight allegations that he coerced young male church members into having sex with him. ""I am not the man that has been portrayed on television,"" he told his congregation. Speaking publicly about the accusations for the first time, Long did not address the specific allegations contained in four lawsuits filed against him earlier this week. ""I've been accused, I'm under attack,"" he said, lowering his head and softening his voice behind the pulpit at the New Birth Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta. ""I want you to know, as I said earlier, that I am not a perfect man. But this thing, I'm going to fight,"" he said. ""I feel like David against Goliath, but I've got five rocks and I haven't thrown one yet."" With that, the 57-year-old pastor put down his microphone and walked off stage, receiving deafening applause from the thousands who had come to hear him. The lawsuits accuse Long of using his power and influence within the 25,000-member church to lure young male church members into sexual relationships. The suits allege that the relationships, which began when the men were in their teens, lasted over many months. Long took the young men -- all of them teens at the time -- on trips, including to Kenya, according to the suits. Long allegedly paid for their hotel rooms, and gave the young men gifts, including a car, cash and jewelry -- all in exchange for sexual favors such as massaging, masturbation and oral sex. The accusations were particularly controversial because Long, who is married, has preached passionately against homosexuality over the years. In 2004, he led a march to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s grave in Atlanta in support of defining marriage as being between a man and a woman. He once declared that his church had created a ministry that ""delivered"" people from homosexuality. He has a national presence, has been invited to the White House, runs a popular television ministry, and oversees a worship campus that includes a school. In the parking lot after the services Sunday, church member Juan Davis told CNN affiliate WXIA that he was ""very satisfied with what I heard."" ""It's a very difficult moment for the church, for the pastor, but I know for sure they're going to overcome it -- overcome it in a big way,"" Davis said. Gabrielle Richards, 21, who has attended New Birth for nearly eight years, told CNN that after hearing Long's sermon, ""nothing has changed."" ""My love for the ministry, my love for [the] bishop and his family has not changed,"" she said. Richards also said she was ""proud"" of Long for ""the way he came out with his head up. ... He showed the strength that I'm accustomed to."" On Saturday, New Birth members also voiced support. ""I stand behind the bishop because of the leader that he is. He is a true leader. The word that he gives is so rich, it is so life-changing,"" church member Gary Foster Jr. told CNN. A former New Birth employee, Kevin Bond, said he hopes the allegations are not true. ""The evidence ... all of that is very troubling to many of us in the gospel community, the Christian community,"" said Bond. Long gave 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. sermons on Sunday. They were essentially the same. Eliciting chuckles from the audience, Long began both by joking, ""I gotta talk to my family"" of worshippers before addressing what other ""folk"" -- meaning media -- were there to hear. Both sermons focused on ""understanding painful situations."" He quoted Isaiah: ""When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you."" Long encouraged congregants to think about natural disasters -- tornadoes and floods. He specifically named Hurricane Katrina and other ""painful situations."" ""Bishop Eddie Long will have painful situations,"" he said. Shouts of affirmation came from the audience. ""We will walk through this painful situation,"" he continued. Then, the bishop quoted the 23rd Psalm. ""Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ..."" Worshippers were on their feet. He urged them to stay committed to being ""prayerful,"" then briefly reminded them that it's nearly election time in Georgia, that it was important to vote and be involved. He then went back to speaking about himself. ""Some people think I'm lost,"" he said. It is those people, he said, who ""will have an opportunity to come down to the altar."" New Birth will continue to worship and thrive, he said. ""We ain't gonna stop it,"" he said. More cheers. The camera panned to the pastor's wife Vanessa Long. She smiled. Each sermon ran approximately 20 minutes. Between sermons, Long spoke briefly to reporters. ""I want this to be dealt in the court of justice and not by public opinion,"" he said. ""I will say that I am going to fight, fight very vigorously against these charges."" CNN's Aaron Cooper, Susan Brown and Don Lemon contributed to this report.","Pastor talks for first time since suits filed alleging sex with young male members .

"(CNN) -- Hollywood's release of ""50/50"" in September received praise from top critics, but didn't do as well at the box office. The movie, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, is screenwriter Will Reiser's humorous take on his own experiences as a cancer patient. ""Everything that we put in the movie, we wanted it to feel like it was real and honest,"" says Reiser in an interview with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Critics give credit to movies, such as ""50/50,"" that they believe deliver a sense of authenticity and evoke an emotional response. To patients like Pamela Cromwell, cancer-themed movies do not accurately portray the truth behind real-life cancer diagnoses. ""'50/50' was a great start, but the majority of movies reinforce the stigma that to be a 'certified' cancer patient you must appear weak, decrepit and on your death bed,"" says Cromwell, a breast cancer patient of the Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Philadelphia. Many patients also feel that some of these movies fail to show the daily physical and mental effects of cancer. For Thomas Brokaw, a colon cancer patient in Alaska, ""Movies tend to miss the realism of the day-to-day negative impact from having this disease or the impact the treatments have on the total body."" Although movies such as ""My Sister's Keeper,"" ""The Bucket List"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" tried to focus on the effects of the disease, they still received lukewarm reviews. The New York Times' A.O. Scott said ""My Sister's Keeper"" was ""... too soft, too easy and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue."" Meanwhile, USA Today critiqued ""The Bucket List"" as ""...superficial, manipulative and schmaltzy."" The star power leading some of the plots may encourage viewers to watch, yet audience response overall is similar to the critics. ""A Walk to Remember"" grossed a modest box office total of $41,281,092 while the Chicago Tribune said it ""...scrapes the bottom of the melodramatic barrel."" On the other hand, some cancer patients and survivors can relate to these movies and find them comforting in their own way. ""I think they drive the reality for those that were impacted,"" says Sandra J. Wing, founder and president of the Healing Therapies Foundation, a volunteer organization that provides financial assistance for cancer patients. ""It reminds you of the importance of life -- the importance of every moment and not to waste it on things that aren't of value."" Some films help to deliver a greater appreciation of life. To many viewers, these movies provide a platform that brings a sense of comfort. Reiser agrees saying, ""Everyone's affected by cancer...but after screening the movie, people are much more open about sharing their own stories, and talking about the different ordeals they've gone through to one another.""","""50/50"" is one of Hollywood's many cancer-themed films moviegoers did not rush to see .

"(CNN) -- The 14-year-old victim of Tuesday's school shooting in Oregon was a sweet kid who sometimes put on a tough front, friends said. Emilio Hoffman was shot in a locker room at Reynolds High School in Troutdale. The motive of the shooter, identified as 15-year-old Jared Padgett, is not known. Padgett died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound elsewhere at the school. There is no known link between Padgett and Hoffman, authorities said Wednesday. Almost as soon as the news spread that Hoffman was the victim, a candlelight vigil was quickly organized. Hundreds of students and parents showed up Tuesday night to remember the teen, who was a standout soccer player. Hoffman's parents attended. They wept as the mass of people circled around them, trying to comfort them, singing songs of praise and hope. ""Emilio loved his friends, and his friends loved him. To those friends we say -- be happy like Emilio. Smile like him. Laugh like him,"" his mother, Jennifer Hoffman, said in a statement. ""To the parents out there -- Love your kids. Hug your kids every day. And live with no regrets. I don't have any regrets with Emilio. None. And he knew that,"" she said. Hoffman had one sister and three brothers, plus a number of foster brothers and sisters. He enjoyed science and history, but loved sports -- especially soccer. ""He was a sweet boy,"" friend Savannah Rowe told CNN. ""He acted all cool around his friends, but when you got to know him he was just sweet and always there for you if you needed someone to talk to."" They got to know each other in middle school, and they were in choir together, Rowe said. Hoffman ""didn't deserve what he got,"" a close friend, Kaylah Ensign, told CNN affiliate KGW. As soon as the lockdown was lifted, Hoffman was the first person she tried to reach by phone, she said. When she got no answer, she joined Hoffman's mother, and together they continued their search. It was then that they learned that the young man had been shot dead. ""I wish I could have said goodbye, or told him how much he meant to me, but I know he knows,"" Ensign said. Hoffman was the person who could make Ensign smile on her hardest days. ""He's just so amazing and great, and it really hurts to know that I'm going to wake up tomorrow and he's not going to be here,"" she said. Student Cody Gleason was close to where the shooting happened, and he heard and watched it unfold. He heard the shots, which he initially mistook for firecrackers, and then saw people running. That morning, he was supposed to see Hoffman in a class where he was his teacher's assistant. ""He was a great kid, I loved him,"" Gleason said. ""He was always respectful to his teachers. He was a great student."" Oregon shooting: 'This is becoming the norm' -- but will anything change?","NEW: ""Be happy like Emilio. Smile like him. Laugh like him,"" his mother says .

"(CNN) -- Being top of the tennis tree can make grand slam predictions a little predictable, especially if your name is Serena Williams. The world No. 1 breezed into the third round of Wimbledon Thursday with a 6-1 6-1 victory over South African Chanelle Scheepers. The demolition lasted just 49 minutes and was more than enough to confirm Williams' status as favorite for a sixth Wimbledon crown. ""I'm always the favorite,"" the American told reporters at the All England Club. ""It's been that way for the last three years and maybe years before that. So it can create pressure. But it's OK -- I'd rather it was that way."" Being the favorite, and defending champion, did not help Williams at last month's French Open, where she crashed out in the second round. The 32-year-old is now taking a softly-softly approach to the British grass court tournament, as she aims to finally claim her 18th grand slam to tie with legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. She next faces French 25th seed Alize Cornet, who won their last meeting on hard courts in Dubai this year but lost their first three encounters. ""I don't want to feel great necessarily right now because hopefully I have several more matches I can play,"" said Williams. ""The goal for me is just to feel a little better every day. I feel there's some things I still want to work on to hopefully stay in the tournament."" It was a case of once bitten twice shy for men's second seed Rafael Nadal on Centre Court. Spain's world No. 1 lost the first set to Czech Lukas Rosol, who dumped him out of the tournament in 2012, and found himself heading for a repeat at 2-4 down in the second. But the 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon champion regained his composure and pulled himself back into the match. He roared with delight as he sealed a 4-6 7-6 6-4 6-4 victory to reach the third round for the first time since 2011, setting up a clash with Kazakhstan's 63rd-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin. ""I was just trying to fight,"" said nine-time French Open winner Nadal. ""I was waiting for my moment, trying to find my moment. ""He was serving very well -- that always happens on the grass. That second set was very important for me. To be two sets down against a player like Rosol is very dangerous."" Roger Federer cantered into the third round after his match with Gilles Muller was interrupted to close the roof on Centre Court as a late evening shower washed London. When the players returned under lights, Federer didn't waste any time. The seven-time Wimbledon champion wrapped up a 6-3 7-5 6-3 victory over the Luxembourg qualifier. The Swiss star will meet either Spain's Marcel Granollers or Colombian Santiago Giraldo next. Federer was satisfied to advance after last season's shock second-round defeat to Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky, who is also into the third round. ""It was really a serving contest out there, I'm happy I made it,"" Federer, the fourth seed, told the media. ""The second set was tough today with the rain delay. It's nice to get those wins but better keep working hard and try to be consistent."" Maria Sharapova made short work of Swiss challenger Timea Bacsinszky on Thursday evening, sweeping into the third round with a 6-2 6-1 victory. The Russian fifth seed won her first grand slam of the grass of Wimbledon in 2004 as a 17-year-old and returns to London in ominous form as the French Open champion. Sharapova faces American Alison Riske, who defeated Italian Camila Giorgi, in the third round. Elsewhere, in the men's draw, French seeds Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga faced five-set zingers on day four at the All England Club. Promising Australia Nick Kyrgios sent 13th seed Gasquet packing 3-6 6-7 6-4 7-5 10-8 while Tsonga, the No. 14, defeated American Sam Querrey with another epic scoreline 4-6 7-6 6-7 6-3 14-12. The 19-year-old Krygios, who turned professional only last season, is playing in his first Wimbledon and faces Czech Jiri Vesely next. Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka dropped a set against Taiwan's Yen-Hsun Lu on his way to a third round encounter against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic also defeated young American Jack Sock 6-3 6-4 6-4 and will next face Poland's Lukasz Kubot. Last year's women's runner-up, Sabine Lisicki, stayed on track with a straightforward 6-3 7-5 victory over Czech Karolina Pliskova , and the German will next play former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic.

"(CNN) -- The only tinge of regret Alison Yu Chui Yee has from another prodigious Paralympic campaign is that she didn't take a leaf out of Usain Bolt's book. Another two fencing gold medals at London 2012 took her tally to seven overall, enhancing her reputation of one of Hong Kong's greatest ever Paralympians, and she had planned to premiere her very own signature pose at the apex of her latest triumph. But the 28-year-old, who jokes she only took up fencing because she was promised there would be plenty of ""handsome guys"" on show, missed the chance to showcase her own version of the Jamaican sprinter's move because she was too immersed in battle. ""I watched the Beijing Olympics and saw so many champions when they won try to do so many signature postures,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I did think 'What should I do if I get the gold medal in Beijing? Should I kiss the blade or hug the coach?' ""Finally (when I) knew that I won, I just took off my mask with a facial expression that my friend said looked like I had just woken up because I was still concentrating!"" Her celebrations might need some work but Yu's pedigree in the noble art of fencing is indisputable. Diagnosed with bone cancer in her left leg at the age of 11, Yu eventually had to have part of it removed. After making the move to fencing from swimming, she was instantly transfixed, rising through the ranks to make her Olympic debut at Athens, Greece, in 2004, aged just 20. The sport, based on attack and defense with swords, has a heritage that some claim dates back as far as 1200 BC, due to the discovery of several ancient Egyptian carvings detailing duels involving combatants with blades and wearing masks for protection. After being enticed along to her first lesson by a friend who promised a bevy of attractive men to look at, Yu was transfixed. ""In the very first lesson, I didn't see any handsome guys but I felt fencing was so cool because the costume is all in white and you have to wear a mask. It's just so mysterious. It reminded me of the movie 'The Mask of Zorro.' ""After that I found fencing does not only have a good appearance, but also the strategy and the technique is very interesting. You have to use your physical strength together with your mental strength. I think it is so challenging and I love it."" Fencing remains one of only four sports to have featured in every modern Olympic Games since 1896 but Yu's first thought when she arrived at the world's biggest sporting event at the age of 20 was about hamburgers, not history. ""I was so excited,"" she explained. ""Everything was just so new to me. ""I heard there's a restaurant open 24 hours and a fast food shop which you can take all the food that you want free of charge. I couldn't wait to eat so many hamburgers!"" That excitement was also transmitted to Yu's performance as she bagged a gold medal in all four of her events in 2004, both as an individual and as part of the Hong Kong team in the epee and foil categories, which use different blades and scoring systems. Wheelchair fencing sees athletes compete in a chair that is fixed into a frame and fastened to the floor. Points are scored by landing a blow with the tip of your sword on an opponent in epee and foil. Yu excelled in both fields of combat. She's taken part in nine fencing events in her Paralympic career to date winning seven golds, one silver and one bronze. After the relative disappointment of winning only one gold in Beijing, where she had to settle for silver in the epee, Yu bounced back to win both her individual events at London 2012 despite a difficult preparation working with a new coach -- during which she had contemplated quitting the sport. ""I was so depressed. I'm quite an optimistic girl, and I can hardly imagine that I cried a lot at that time. After training I would just go back to the room and cry because I didn't know what I was doing and the training atmosphere was just not very good."" However, cheered by her teammates and helped with her training by able-bodied fencing colleagues, she got back in the groove and had a successful Games, also winning bronze in a team event. ""When I came back, I just bought them a very big meal and shared my happiness with them."" Yu's record makes her one of Hong Kong's most successful Paralympians, and that fact leaves her bursting with pride. ""Whenever I see the Hong Kong flag is flying in the sky, not because of anybody else, because of my efforts, I think it's the most proud time of my life,"" Yu said. ""I was the first female fencer in Hong Kong who captured four gold medals in the Paralympic Games (in Athens). ""When I came back to Hong Kong, so many reporters and journalists were waiting for us and interviewing us, and I thought 'Wow, I just looked like a Hollywood star!' ""I am so proud of being a Paralympian because I think the Games are a very good platform for disabled persons to perform themselves. ""Within the Paralympics movement, it's not just talk about excellence, it's not just talk about the competition, it's also talk about the equality and how your world accepts those disabled people."" Yu's infectious character explains why she's had little difficulty in overcoming the treacherous obstacles that were placed in front of her at such an early age. A dedicated, passionate athlete, away from fencing she is relentlessly positive, something that has driven her through cancer and onto a clutch of gold medals. ""When I had bone cancer, I was just 11 years old. I think my parents suffered a lot because they worried about my health, my life, so much,"" she said. ""For me, it was quite bad feeling during the treatment. But I quite enjoyed staying in the hospital because so many kids played with me. ""Every time when I talk about this memory, my mom scolds me because she says, 'Come one, no one like hospital life, only you.' ""I think the most important thing for your life is the way you interpret things. Having an optimistic point of view is so important -- your life will be so bright.""","Fencer Alison Yu Chui Yee has seven Paralympic gold medals to her name .

"(CNN) -- Miley Cyrus is back on track after a severe allergic reaction put the pop star in the hospital. The 21-year-old is scheduled to resume her previously postponed ""Bangerz"" tour in August after being forced to hold off on the remaining performances due to her illness. Cyrus' new U.S. lineup features nine stops: seven shows to make up for the ones that she missed, plus an additional two concerts for fans in Pittsburgh and Chicago. Fans who purchased tickets to her April 7 concert in Charlotte, North Carolina; the April 16 show in St. Louis; and the April 15 show in Kansas City, Missouri; will receive full refunds and be able to purchase tickets to her rescheduled dates -- on August 6, August 10 and August 12, respectively -- starting May 2. Those who purchased tickets to her April concerts in Uniondale, New York; Philadelphia; Nashville; and Louisville will be able to use them for admission to her August shows in those locations. The ""Wrecking Ball"" songstress was initially put out of commission in early April with a flu-like illness, which caused her to pull out of her Charlotte show. Yet after being prescribed the antibiotic Cephalexin her health woes only grew worse; an allergic reaction to the drug left Cyrus hospitalized for more than a week, according to a statement from her representative earlier this month. By April 25 she seemed back to her old self. If her Instagram photos are to be believed, pancakes were a part of her recuperation. Cyrus' next ""Bangerz"" stop will be Amsterdam, as she kicks off the European leg of her tour on Friday.","Miley Cyrus has rescheduled her postponed U.S. tour .

"(CNN) -- The silly season is upon us: the time during an election year when those trying to muck up the other side throw all sorts of nonsense about a candidate onto the public wall. Hillary Clinton, because she's the Democrat's presumptive 2016 front-runner, has become the target du jour. Frankly, I don't know how public figures get through it. I'm reminded of Henry Kissinger's remark, which I'm paraphrasing: ""It's impossible to be paranoid in Washington because the definition of paranoia is the 'false belief that someone is out to get you.' In Washington, someone is always out to get you."" The latest craziness comes from Matt Drudge, who publishes the Drudge Report, the political equivalent of an online supermarket tabloid. Drudge funnels anonymous propaganda into the mainstream media, propaganda it might not buy otherwise. That's the secret to his success. Of course, some of what he reports is solid stuff. But there is space to fill daily. So, somewhat like a National Enquirer reporter who dreams up his day's ""scoop"" while showering, Drudge teases his readers with innuendo and fluff. So often, it's hard to tell the difference between fluff and fact. Maybe Drudge is more entertainer than reporter. I imagine he enjoys baiting the mainstream media, then watching it look foolish when his story is debunked. Take, for example, his tweet about Hillary Clinton, which caused something of a media firestorm. People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera. Only the top part of the chair showed after the picture was cropped for publication. So Drudge tweeted the picture, asking, ""Is Clinton Holding a Walker?"" That was at 12:16 p.m. on June 4. By ""coincidence,"" 74 minutes later, at 1:30 p.m., The Wall Street Journal's political division tweeted: ""Is that a walker? Hillary Clinton's latest magazine cover is raising eyebrows."" That may be a record time from right-wing hype-and-blarney to validation from a major publication. Drudge's tweet fits in with Karl Rove's orchestrated charge in mid-May that maybe Hillary Clinton was ""brain damaged"" because of a fall she suffered. The idea was to portray her as physically unfit to be president and save the right a billion or two of negative advertising in 2016. But it wasn't true. Since her recovery, we've witnessed a vigorous Hillary Clinton. Other pictures in that same issue of People show her animated, smiling and even combative. Apparently, though Drudge (and perhaps The Wall Street Journal, which had no problem accepting his ""con"") wanted to turn Rove's ""will it stick to the wall"" into a meme. How long will the media let this tweetle-dumb linger? Russian President Vladimir Putin also took a pot shot at Clinton, calling her ""a weak woman."" ""It's better not to argue with women,"" Putin said, ""but Mrs. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements."" Referring to Clinton's comparison of his aggressive actions in the Ukraine to Hitler's with Poland, Putin ironically said, ""When people push boundaries too far, it's not because they are strong but because they are weak."" Then Putin delivered his zinger: ""But maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman."" Well. It's one thing to take on a world leader like Hillary Clinton, but an altogether different matter to offend half the planet while doing it. His ""It's better not to argue with women,"" clearly shows Putin learned from his domestic encounters. Putin is a home-grown Russian social conservative. He considers the West degenerate for granting human rights to women and gays. If he had been born an American, he and the Robertsons of Duck Dynasty fame would likely be at one another's backyard barbecues. I can't help but wonder if Putin would consider the following statements from Clinton as strength if a male had said them: Referring to George W. Bush's ""I looked into his soul,"" Clinton said, ""I could have told (Bush) he was a KGB agent; by definition he doesn't have a soul."" Politico ran the quote with the observation, ""This isn't going to play well in Moscow."" Now we know it didn't. Being weak is not a Clinton hallmark; some Obama supporters cautioned him to hire a food-taster if Clinton joined his Cabinet. Perhaps Putin considers referring to Russia as ""despicable"" for vetoing U.N. sanctions against Syria, and calling his election possibly fraudulent being ""weak."" Or maybe he needs a dictionary. We can expect a lot more to be said about Hillary Clinton, since her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" is coming out. I'm sure it will reflect her strengths, and weaknesses. I'm sure that on some issues it will provide clarification, and on others, controversy. And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.

"(CNN) -- Pro-Israel advocates and politicians, breathe easy. Israel is safe once more from the threat of ""apartheid"" -- the word, that is. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has clarified comments made in a closed-door meeting last week, and he stated clearly that Israel is not an apartheid state. But Kerry's dire warning, and the future the secretary was predicting for Israel, lingers. That point seems lost amid this week's onslaught against Kerry, as members of Congress and Israel advocates raced to prove their pro-Israel credentials with their outrage. The histrionics over the secretary's remarks are yet one more sign of how fundamentally broken American politics are when it comes to Israel. Vast energy is poured into defending Israel from an inappropriate word. Yet nowhere near enough energy is devoted to promoting policies that will actually protect and save Israel's Jewish democracy in the long run. Labels aside, Israel is maintaining the longest military occupation in the world. In the territory occupied in 1967, Jewish residents enjoy all of the benefits of Israeli democracy, while Palestinian residents in the same territory lack basic rights of citizenship. Many predict the number of non-Jews in the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River soon will be greater than the number of Jews, and everyone from President Barack Obama to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come to understand what this means. Without a two-state solution to this conflict, Israel draws ever closer to an unfathomable choice: Forsake its democracy by establishing rule of a Jewish minority over a non-Jewish majority, or forsake its Jewish character by granting equal rights to all residents under its control. That's the future that former Israeli Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak warned about when they invoked the specter of apartheid, and it's that future that Kerry has been working tirelessly to avert with his Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative. It's a choice that draws sadly closer, now that Kerry's efforts have passed their initial nine-month deadline, and the parties have resumed the familiar cycle of provocation and retaliation. To question Kerry's commitment to Israel over a word, after everything that he's done to help Israel, is absurd. No U.S. leader has done more to help Israel gain acceptance in the international community and ensure its long-term peace and security. What friends of Israel should really be asking themselves is not whether they are doing everything they can to protect Israel from being called certain names, but whether they are doing everything possible to secure its future as the democratic home of the Jewish people by bringing about a two-state peace. Sadly, this question is conspicuously absent from our politics. Many politicians' reflexive defense posture at times like this allows our friends and family in Israel to continue believing that the root of their problems is anti-Israel bias rather than the expansionist policies a right-wing minority is foisting on their country. They need to hear that the policies of that minority are out of sync with the values and the interests of the United States, and that staying the present course risks the foundations of the relationship between the two countries. Shooting the messenger does Israel no favors. Friends of Israel should start by thanking Kerry for his commitment to Israel and supporting him as he seeks to break the present impasse in negotiations. And if we can channel as much passion and energy into ending the conflict as we do into protecting Israel from painful words, Israel may yet stand a chance.","Jeremy Ben-Ami: John Kerry used the word apartheid about Israel, setting off a firestorm .

"(CNN) -- Missouri death row inmate Russell Bucklew's rare birth defect will make his execution, slated for just after midnight Wednesday, an ""excruciating"" process, his lawyer says. And she hopes to prove it by videotaping her client's death, a motion a federal court has denied. In what would be the first execution since Oklahoma's botched procedure last month, Russell Bucklew is schedule to die at 1:01 a.m. ET at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre. In their request for a stay, filed Tuesday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, Bucklew's attorneys say he could suffer a ""prolonged and excruciating execution"" because of his birth defect, known as cavernous hemangioma. A U.S. District Court judge on Monday declined to stay the execution, along with the request that the procedure be videotaped. ""If Missouri officials are confident enough to execute Russell Bucklew, they should be confident enough to videotape it. It is time to raise the curtain on lethal injections,"" said defense attorney Cheryl Pilate. Bucklew, who turned 46 last week, is already in pain, as his condition includes unstable tumors in his head and neck, causing him to bleed regularly from his mouth, nose, eyes and ears, Pilate said. Dr. Joel Zivot of Emory University filed an affidavit in the case saying that Bucklew's airway is so ""severely compromised and obstructed,"" especially when he's lying flat, that it could easily be ruptured, raising the risk that Bucklew could choke or suffocate. ""If you touch it, it bleeds,"" Zivot wrote of Bucklew's airway. In 1997, a jury convicted Bucklew of first degree murder, kidnapping, and first degree burglary and recommended the death sentence, court documents show. He was accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend's presumed new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, and firing at Sanders' son, 6, before kidnapping Stephanie Ray Pruitt. After raping his ex-girlfriend, he became involved in a gunfight with authorities, during which Bucklew and a Missouri state trooper were injured, according to court documents. Controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after European manufacturers -- including the Denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital -- banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. In 2009, the U.S.-based manufacturer of sodium thiopental, a drug also commonly used in executions, stopped making the painkiller. Many states have scrambled to find substitutes from overseas or have used American-based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes. Attorneys for death row inmates in several states have flooded the court system, arguing correctional facilities' secrecy over where and how they obtain drugs is unconstitutional and violates the Eighth Amendment's ""cruel and unusual"" punishment clause. Last month, Oklahoma used a new three-drug lethal injection protocol to execute convicted murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett, but his vein collapsed and he died of an apparent heart attack. A full investigation and autopsy results are still pending, but witnesses said they saw Lockett struggling to speak as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney. Previously, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson said during his January execution, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Wilson was executed using a cocktail that included pentobarbital, as was Texas' Jose Luis Villegas, who also complained of a burning sensation during his April execution. Also in Texas, Robert James Campbell's attorneys challenged the state's plan to administer pentobarbital to their client. A federal court stayed his execution last week -- not because of the drugs Texas planned to use, but because his defense team deserved more time to make the case that Campbell was intellectually disabled. On Monday, the Georgia Supreme Court weighed in on the issue, reversing a stay of execution for inmate Warren Lee Hill after his attorneys argued last year that a statute keeping the compounders of lethal injection drugs ""a confidential state secret"" was unconstitutional. ""We hold that it is not,"" Justice P. Harris Hines wrote in the 33-page majority opinion. He said the reason for keeping such information private is ""obvious, including avoiding the risk of harassment or some other form of retaliation from persons related to the prisoners or from others in the community who might disapprove of the execution as well as simply offering those willing to participate whatever comfort or peace of mind that anonymity might offer.""","Convicted murderer Russell Bucklew is scheduled to be executed in Missouri after midnight .

"Vietnam Coast Guard 8003, South China Sea (CNN) -- To be at the front line of a ""cold war"" is, these days, a rare thing -- particularly when that front line is a remote chain of islands in the South China Sea, hundreds of kilometers from the nearest landfall. The waters around the Paracel Islands, a largely unpopulated archipelago administered by China but claimed by Vietnam, have become the ""battleground"" in an increasingly volatile territorial dispute between the two communist neighbors. Taking advantage of a rare opportunity to witness the spat up close, CNN traveled to the area with the Vietnamese Coast Guard. Tensions between Beijing and Hanoi ratcheted up last month, when a Chinese state-owned company deployed an oil rig in waters off the Paracels. It was set up unilaterally, without any discussion between the two sides, much to the annoyance of the Vietnamese who view it as a Chinese incursion into their sovereign waters. Since then, an increasing number of Chinese and Vietnamese ships -- both government and private fishing boats -- have crossed paths in the area with occasionally serious consequences -- not least reports of Chinese vessels using water cannon and ramming fishing boats straying too close to the oil platform. Entering the fray . Our trip out to this marine flashpoint didn't start well. After days of prevarication over our departure date from the Vietnamese port of Da Nang, an official told us -- the small contingent of foreign correspondents selected for this rare press trip -- that while at sea we would confined below decks. ""We don't want the Chinese to know we have journalists on board,"" he explained. As expressions ranged from the defeated to the incredulous, this new piece of information was hastily qualified. ""Don't worry, there are plenty of windows that you can film through."" We eventually did set off, hustled out to sea as the light faded over Da Nang, two and a half days later than planned. Crammed into a small supply boat heading out to the Paracel Islands, about 160 nautical miles (296 kilometers) from Vietnam's central coast, it wasn't long before the boat fell quiet and the 40 journalists -- both local and international -- took to their bunks. The crew, despite their casual, day-to-day appearance -- they only wear uniforms for official duties and, it turns out, camera appearances -- were serious, and resolute in their roles -- the first line of defense against what they see as Chinese aggression. Toeing the party line . The Vietnamese refrain about these territorial waters is constant and unerring. Crew members explained to me that China is breaking the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and that the vessels are engaged in illegal activities in waters that are part of Vietnam's continental shelf. Once away from Vietnam's coast, we transferred to a bigger ship, Coast Guard 8003, one of the service's most prominent vessels, and armed with 25 mm and 14.5 mm cannon -- although I was told that they did not bring live ammunition on these patrols. Fears of being locked in below the waterline quickly faded as we were permitted on deck. It is lonely out on the water, a vast expanse stretching hundreds of miles in each direction, and around a thousand meters beneath our hull. Topside, a lone seagull followed the ship as it began its regular patrol up and down a line adjacent to the oil rig, which eventually loomed large on the horizon. The oil rig -- identified as HD-981 -- is omnipresent. It's there in everyone's minds, it's the focus of much of the conversation on the boat, and it's physically visible for most of our time at sea -- though we keep our distance. Despite our considerable distance from land, the horizon bristles with the silhouettes of dozens of ships, a mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese Coast Guard vessels and fishing fleets from both sides. The Vietnamese fishing boats are draped in red banners, which urge the Chinese to leave their territory. Dangerous dance . For the most part, ships circle, warily keeping their distance, and posture at each other from afar. However, things can, and do, spill over. Hours before we arrive in the area, a Vietnamese fishing boat has been capsized, purportedly rammed by a Chinese vessel. While the Chinese insist the Vietnamese side was at fault, the captain of the sunk vessel told me days later that he was sure the boat that hit them was a Chinese Coast Guard vessel disguised as a fishing boat -- such is the level of suspicion and mistrust in this hotly-disputed body of water. In charge of CG 8003, one of the service's largest and most prominent vessels, Captain Nguyen Van Hung has around 50 men under his protection and a very visible role to play in this conflict with China. He says that there is no communication between his ship -- or any other Vietnamese vessel -- and the Chinese; no open radio channel, no way to prevent events from escalating dangerously. Our Vietnamese hosts insist they are determined to resolve the matter peacefully and in full accordance with international law, but beyond the recorded warnings blasting out of loudspeakers into the heavy, humid sea air, it is not certain what their presence hopes to achieve. Chinese attacks . China's response is a little more robust, it would seem. Video taken by a CNN affiliate, among others, shows Chinese vessels attacking Vietnamese ships in the disputed area with water cannon and also ramming them. A Vietnam Television (VTV) crew embedded with CNN aboard CG 8003 says the previous vessel they were aboard, a government fisheries surveillance ship, was itself rammed by the Chinese Coast Guard. For its part, China abides by its territorial claims and blames the Vietnamese side for ratcheting tensions. ""The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For the media contingent, there is no direct experience of Chinese aggression as we sail up and down a furrow of the South China Sea, though from time to time we discover a Chinese Coast Guard vessel stalking us, gleaming white in the unceasing sun, but they never come closer than a couple of hundred meters. We are, however, woken early one morning to see what the captain said was a Chinese coast guard vessel using water cannon on a Vietnamese fisheries surveillance vessel. At distance, the arc of the water looks graceful, but up close it is a vicious jet which can break windows, disrupt engines and cause electrical failure and even fires. Saber-rattling . While Chinese ships keep their distance, they are intent on making their presence known. When the ships are close enough, we can see the deck-mounted guns have had their tarpaulins removed -- a less than subtle signal perhaps. In any event, the sight of naked weaponry only dozens of meters away is unsettling. The Chinese presence is also felt in the air. Towards the end of our embed aboard the ship, we see a surveillance plane -- which journalists aboard the coast guard vessel are assured is Chinese -- leisurely bank around our vessel time and time again, sometimes flying low and close enough for those on board to make out its markings with the naked eye. While there is no immediate threat from the aircraft, its intelligence-gathering is enough to make those on board jumpy. For now, though, tensions remain largely under wraps. But for as long as both sides maintain their equally intransigent positions, shrilly trading blame and engaging in low-level incidents of maritime thuggery, signs of this feud diminishing, and ending up as a footnote in the history books, remain distant.","China and Vietnam at odds over a chain of largely uninhabited islands in the South China Sea .

"(CNN) -- A year ago on Thursday, the U.S. Senate failed to pass a bill that would have helped fix our nation's gun laws by requiring background checks on all purchases of firearms. Ninety percent of all Americans -- and more than 80% of gun owners -- believe that all people should be subject to such checks. And even though the bill won majority support in the Senate -- more than 50 members -- it was not enough to break a filibuster. But in the year after the massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012, the grassroots movement to pass common sense gun laws and policies that are consistent with the Second Amendment has made great progress just about everywhere except Washington. In Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware and New York, local citizens helped lead the successful push for legislation that closed loopholes in background checks laws. In Washington state and Wisconsin, citizens helped pass laws that keep firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers. In Colorado alone, the new law stopped more than 160 prohibited buyers from getting their hands on a gun, and as Coloradans know too well, it only takes one to devastate a family, a community, a nation. And the law hasn't gotten in the way of law-abiding gun owners, who bought more firearms in 2013 than in any preceding year. We also gave voice to hundreds of thousands of Americans who persuaded Facebook and Instagram to change their policies so that unlicensed gun sellers cannot use their sites to sell guns without background checks. These significant victories were won by a growing, nonpartisan coalition that is refusing to wait for Washington to act. That coalition includes parents, mayors, police chiefs, religious leaders, gun owners and everyday Americans of all political persuasions. Mothers, in particular, have been at the forefront of this fight. They've given testimony at town halls, led ""Stroller Jams"" at state capitals, hosted quilting bees and delivered petitions to legislatures and companies across the country. To unify the efforts of this diverse coalition of Americans, we are launching Everytown for Gun Safety in America, a new umbrella organization that will be the largest and best-organized counterweight to the gun lobby that has ever been created. Everytown for Gun Safety will expand on the work of two existing organizations -- Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America -- and take the fight for gun violence prevention policies to every community in the country. Everytown for Gun Safety will continue pushing for better background check laws in Congress and state houses. But we will also broaden our focus to include other issues that are important to Americans, like safe storage education campaigns to help keep kids from being killed by unlocked or dangerously stored guns. And new laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. And efforts to help reduce the nearly 19,400 suicides that happen every year with guns. In each area, we will make progress by doing something that no gun group, other than the National Rifle Association, has ever done: inform and mobilize voters. The reason the NRA has political influence -- in addition to its campaign contributions -- is that it has scared elected officials into believing that voters will oppose them unless they follow the NRA's Washington leadership, which has grown increasingly extreme and increasingly out of touch with its own members. Bloomberg to spend $50 million to challenge NRA on guns . In fact, the NRA's reputation for political strength is wildly blown out of proportion and the election results from three statewide contests in Virginia this past November reflect that reality. Candidates who spoke out in support of common sense gun violence prevention policies were elected as governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. In the attorney general's race, his campaign manager said that the candidate's support for sensible stances on gun issues was a major factor in his victory. Nonetheless, the perception of an unbeatable gun lobby still lingers and part of our mission will be showing candidates and elected officials that the vast majority of Americans and gun owners support common sense gun policies that respect the Second Amendment and save lives. To mobilize voters who are committed to backing candidates that support common sense gun policies, Everytown for Gun Safety is launching a Gun Sense Voter campaign. Before the 2014 midterms, we aim to get at least 1 million Americans to pledge to vote for state and federal candidates based on where they stand on gun safety. We'll keep voters informed by tracking candidates' positions and determining which of them support gun safety and which do not. Leaders from all walks of life will join us on our board of directors, including one of our nation's most respected military leaders, Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; University of Oklahoma president and former Sen. David Boren; and former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge. All of us are united by the belief that accepting the status quo -- 12,000 Americans are murdered with guns every year -- is unconscionable. There is no doubt that we have a big hill to climb. Well-funded, entrenched special interests are always difficult to defeat. And for years, the gun lobby has largely had the field to itself. No longer.

"(CNN) -- Monday afternoon's devastating tornado in the Oklahoma City suburbs brought to mind a May 1999 EF5 twister that killed 36 people and smashed some of the same communities. On May 3, 1999, a total of 74 tornadoes pummeled Kansas and Oklahoma, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The states counted a total of 46 dead. Thirty-six died in Oklahoma City. The strongest tornado, rated a maximum EF5 on the Fujita Tornado Scale, tracked for nearly an hour and a half along a 38-mile path from Chickasha through south Oklahoma City and the suburbs of Bridge Creek, Newcastle, Moore, Midwest City and Del City. Monday's tornado in Oklahoma city, with a preliminary rating of at least EF4, also struck Moore and Newcastle. Dozens -- some of them elementary school children -- died, authorities said. The tornado ""hit along the same path of the May 3 tornado in 1999,"" said Gov. Mary Fallin. ""It's just hard to believe that something like this could happen again to Moore itself."" According to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, the 1999 Oklahoma City twister was among the costliest in U.S. history, with damage totaling at $1 billion. Albert Ashwood, director of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, told reporters the two tornadoes are ""equally devastating."" 10 deadliest U.S. tornadoes on record . ""And I think the fact that what we see so far today is going to be very similar if not exceed what we saw in 1999,"" he said. ""But keep in mind, any time there's a loss of life, it's a devastating disaster."" Heather Moore survived both the 1999 and Monday's storms. ""It was very, very similar,"" Moore told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""Cars were turned over, some houses were half gone, some houses were all gone. ... All the trees are gone, all the power lines are gone."" U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who lives in Moore, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the damage he was seeing on television Monday looked as bad as the 1999 tornado that destroyed more than 1,000 houses in his hometown. Moore is located between Oklahoma City and Norman -- home to the University of Oklahoma -- on the south side of the metropolitan area.

"(CNN) -- With Ivan Lendl by his side, Andy Murray opened his grand slam tennis account, won an Olympic gold and ended Britain's nearly 80-year wait for a men's singles champion at Wimbledon. When he triumphed at the All England Club last July, Lendl, not Murray's influential mom, Judy, was the first person he hugged as he climbed into the players' box. The knowledge Lendl amassed in winning eight grand slams himself was passed on to Murray and the two -- who share dry sense of humors and like to keep low profiles -- forged a strong bond. Murray thanked Lendl for pulling no punches when discussing his game, which, as good as it was, had yet to yield a major as he competed with the talented trio of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. But on Wednesday, Lendl became the latest coach to cut ties with Murray. It's another blow to the Scot, who has struggled to rediscover his best form following back surgery only months after that once-in-a-lifetime occasion at Wimbledon. ""Working with Andy over the last two years has been a fantastic experience for me,"" Lendl said in a statement. ""He is a first class guy. ""Having helped him achieve his goal of winning major titles, I feel like it is time for me to concentrate on some of my own projects moving forward, including playing more events around the world which I am really enjoying. ""I will always be in Andy's corner and wish him nothing but great success as he, too, goes into a new phase of his career."" Murray, meanwhile, had nothing but praise for Lendl. ""I'm eternally grateful to Ivan for all his hard work over the past two years, the most successful of my career so far,"" Murray said in the statement. ""As a team, we've learned a lot and it will definitely be of benefit in the future. ""I'll take some time with the team to consider the next steps and how we progress from here."" Lendl played senior and exhibition events in the period he was coaching Murray, and runs an academy in South Carolina. He was hired at the end of 2011, following the likes of Mark Petchey, Brad Gilbert and Miles Maclagan, and Murray won singles gold at London 2012 and captured the U.S. Open a month later. Lendl's arrival paved the way for other retired greats to return as coaches, with Boris Becker now alongside Djokovic and Stefan Edberg teaming up with Federer. In an email to CNN, Lendl -- a man of little words in public -- said there was no deeper issue to the partnership concluding. ""It's VERY simple -- I could not commit enough time to do the job properly,"" wrote the father of five girls. Indeed, according to Murray's former Davis Cup captain, all appeared to be going well. ""The relationship is very sound, they really enjoy each other's company, Lendl is a fantastic coach and Andy is a world-class tennis player,"" Jeremy Bates told CNN. ""So it's a shame to me that this has happened, but you have to respect Lendl's reasons for doing so. ""He's in demand to do so many different things, and I guess he feels it's time to move on in that regard. Andy has learned so much in the last couple of years and Lendl has to be a bit selfish in a decision like this, but he also has Andy's best interests at heart as well. ""To me they wouldn't split up for another reason, a tennis reason, or a compatibility issue. They would just be spitting up for the time commitment reason."" Nonetheless, the news stunned the tennis world, with Gilbert saying he was ""surprised as heck."" He described Murray as a ""genius but complicated."" It came as Murray prepares to defend his title in Miami, the city he uses as a training base. Lendl is a Florida resident. ""I got up at six, saw a tweet and I was like, 'Wow,'"" Gilbert told CNN. ""I've been inundated on Twitter and everyone wants to know why it happened. I'm just as surprised as anyone that the partnership has ended. ""It's an unusual time, right before Miami. I didn't hear that anything was coming. It just shows you how fragile the coaching-player partnership can be."" Murray, who has dropped from second in the rankings in July to sixth, has yet to win a title in 2014 and is coming off losses in Acapulco and Indian Wells to lower-ranked opposition after claiming the opening set. Bates, though, isn't alarmed. ""He's coming back from a pretty significant surgery to a very delicate part of the body,"" said Bates, a former top 60 player. ""I've been saying for months now -- and I had a lot of surgery myself -- mentally, you just don't recover from those things instantly. ""It takes you a long time to regain all that confidence in your body and so I'm not surprised that it's taking him a while to get up to speed. We might not see it in the next six months. Who knows when he's going to feel completely comfortable again. ""If (100-meter world-record holder) Usain Bolt pulls a calf muscle, he doesn't all of a sudden run 9.50 seconds in his first race.""","Andy Murray ends his successful partnership with coach Ivan Lendl .

"(CNN) -- A monthlong French offensive has killed ""hundreds"" of Islamist fighters in Mali, the French defense minister said, as his troops prepare to start withdrawing next month. French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian gave the number of casualties to CNN affiliate BFM on Tuesday night. He did not offer additional details. Read more: French leader makes jubilant trip to Mali . Hours earlier, France told the local Metro newspaper that it expects to begin withdrawing its troops out of Mali in March and leave African forces in control. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said despite the withdrawal, troops will continue operations to flush out militants in ""some terrorist havens"" in northern Mali. At Mali's request, France launched the offensive against militants in its former colony last month. The ground-and-air campaign has sent Islamist fighters who had seized the northern region fleeing into the vast desert. French President Francois Hollande visited Timbuktu last week, just days after French forces had freed the fabled city from Islamist militants. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . French-led troops now control Timbuktu and the city of Gao, along with a swath in between the two that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year.

"(CNN) -- Thousands marched in Washington this weekend to call for action to counter climate change. With organizers estimating 35,000 people filling the National Mall, the Forward on Climate Change march was said to be the biggest demonstration thus far in support of this issue. ""While they were fighting for equality,"" the Rev. Lennox Yearwood told the crowd, comparing them to those who took part in the March on Washington for civil rights in 1963, ""we are fighting for existence."" The protesters have support from President Barack Obama, who announced that he wants to make climate change a major issue in his second term. During his inaugural and State of the Union addresses, the president did not shy away from this controversial subject. But persuading Congress to pass this kind of legislation will be extremely difficult. Photos: 40,000 rally to stop Keystone pipeline . Standing Tuesday before visibly unhappy House Speaker John Boehner, Obama pointed to the recent natural disasters we've seen and spoke about the science of the environment, calling on Congress to act -- or threatening to do so himself if they refuse: . ""We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it's too late."" Democrats applauded. Republicans kept their hands in their pockets. If Obama can persuade Congress to take action on climate change, it would be one of the biggest accomplishments of his administration. But unlike some of the other issues that he has tackled -- including health care -- climate change is extraordinarily difficult since the benefits to voters are not immediate and not necessarily visible. His mission could be made more difficult if he decides to approve the proposal for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental groups that backed the president's re-election strongly oppose the project. To break through the gridlock on this issue and to persuade some of the congressional Republicans to start clapping, Obama will need more than crisis and science. The march this weekend must be the first of more organized grass-roots protests, not just on the mall in Washington but in the districts and states of key members of Congress. Most of the biggest policy breakthroughs in recent history have depended on strong grass-roots mobilization. In 1935, Congress passed the Wagner Act, which created the National Labor Relations Board and legitimated unions. This mobilization of industrial workers who would form the CIO was pivotal in providing President Franklin Roosevelt with the strength he needed to take on business with enormously controversial legislation. Several decades later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 only came about because local activists, led by prominent leaders such as Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., forced the White House and Congress to deal with the issue of racial equality over their deep political reservations. While both Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were concerned about the huge risks that pushing for civil rights posed for the Democrats' stronghold in the South -- still the electoral base of the party back then -- both were finally moved to take action because of the valiant efforts of grass-roots activists who placed pressure on them and on uncommitted legislators. The civil rights movement changed public opinion and made inaction politically unacceptable. Conservatives have also depended on the grass roots to mobilize support for their issues. President Ronald Reagan's drive for deficit-inducing tax cuts and deregulation might not have worked if it were not for the grass-roots conservative activism of the 1970s that pushed national debate to the right. In the past few years, tea party activists have succeeded in moving the GOP toward an agenda of deficit reduction even at a moment when the key problem is generating economic growth and lowering unemployment rates. Environmental organizations have created a vast organizational infrastructure since the 1970s and remain a huge presence in Washington. But in recent years, they have been less effective at developing the same level of grass-roots energy as earlier movements, including their own in the 1970s. Climate change has too often been an issue that is Washington-focused rather than grass-roots focused. Instead of having former Vice President Al Gore be the face of efforts to counter climate change, Obama needs the images of local protesters gathering to make sure that Congress deals with the issue. Obama, a former community organizer, knows this as much as anyone. He has seen the profound effect tea party activists have had on the Republican Party, much to his consternation. As Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol has written, ""To counter fierce political opposition, reformers will have to build organizational networks across the country, and they will need to orchestrate sustained political efforts that stretch far beyond friendly congressional offices, comfy board rooms and posh retreats ... insider politics cannot carry the day on its own, apart from a broader movement pressing politicians for change."" Skocpol explains convincingly that one of the reasons for the failure of cap and trade legislation was that climate reformers focused their energy on Beltway lobbying rather than mobilizing support in local communities. Members of Congress know that climate change legislation doesn't offer tangible benefits to voters, so they're unlikely to act unless they feel pressure from activists in their districts. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, have taken the lead on the issue by putting forth a bill to impose a tax on the country's largest polluters, requiring them to pay $20 per ton of carbon and methane emissions, a sum that would rise over time. Under their bill, the government would invest the money in developing renewable fuel and more efficient energy policies, including a plan to weatherize more than a million homes. If the administration is going to build support for a version of this legislation, it will need support from the bottom, not just the top, in swaying and pressuring senators who will be leery about taking on this issue.

"(CNN) -- We've all done it -- surfed on over to the book of faces, our hearts racing and pupils dilating with excitement, let our cursors linger over those oh-so-powerful words, ""Remove From Friends,"" and clicked away with the maniacal glee of a serial killer. Still, there aren't that many among us who have the skill -- the expertise -- to cut ties without cutting deep. At this point, some of you may be reminiscing about the sepia-tinged past, those glory days when, if you didn't want to chill with Lucy ""I Eat Paste"" Smith anymore, all you had to do was ghost out of her life, letting the last tendrils of your friendship dissolve into the ether like wisps of smoke. Well, those days are as dead as Lucy's creepy gray front teeth. Now, every time someone exits your life, you have to decide whether to keep them in your Facebook stream or cut the lifeline. ""Friends and acquaintances come and go as we move through life stages and find the need for keeping some friends and losing others,"" says Dr. Larry Rosen, author of ""Rewired: Understanding the iGeneration and the Way They Learn."" ""If you had no way to unfriend someone, then this would lose the authenticity of having a relationship."" You hear that? Unfriending is practically doctor-approved. Still, how do you know when -- and how -- to take the pal-eviscerating plunge? Read on for our tips on handling unfriending situations. The ex-friend . We've all nixed an ex-friend at one time or another. One group is even urging users to purge their Facebook feeds of annoying pals this week by declaring it  Delete-A-Friend Week. In fact, in an online poll of about 800 of our friends and readers, 43 percent said they were most likely to ax a close acquaintance when erasing a Facebook friendship. Said axing usually happens because of one of two scenarios: One, your best guy friend's girlfriend hates you, a situation that led to a knock-down, drag-out fight at a local watering hole. Two, you used to chill with this dude back when you lived in Illinois, dreaming of the jug band you would form when you moved to the big city. Now you actually live in the big city, where you do, indeed, have a jug band (ironically, of course), and homeboy is still back in the cornfields. In scenario one, it would probably be a good idea to reach out one last time -- in the real-world realm -- and see if you can sort out whatever BS went down at the bar. If, in the end, your former best boy persists in the venom-spewing and un-pleasantries, it's probably more healthy to remove him from that glorious realm of time-wastery. Seeing his face pop up among photos of Muriel's wedding and Marco's new kitten ain't gonna do much for your sanity. In scenario two, it's up to you to gauge how much Cornfield's presence offends you. According to Christopher Sibona, who penned ""Unfriending on Facebook: Friend Request and Online/Offline Behavior Analysis,"" a paper he'll be presenting at the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 50 percent of people who have unfriended someone saw the person in question zero times in the past year. If your former friend has no impact on your current life, and you don't foresee yourself getting the band back together, why keep him in your cyber stable? (If you're one of those other 50 percent who see the faded friend on a more frequent basis, you may want to rethink the ""Unfriend."" Nothing is more awkward than attending a party replete with ghosts of camaraderie past.) The ex . Most of the time, it's probably best to hit ""Unfriend"" after the whole, ""It's not you, it's me"" talk. Out of sight, out of mind, and all that. But it seems like a lot of folks like to keep tabs on their exes via Facebook -- only 22 percent of those surveyed said that they were most likely to unfriend an ex. Hey, I guess it's easier to make drunken, nostalgic mistakes when you still have access to their wall, huh? If you do decide to take the plunge, be gentle. If you're the dumper, cut your ex a break: Let him/her unfriend you. It's the least you can do after putting his/her heart through this meat grinder called love. If you're the dumpee, and the object of your unrequited attention feeds you some line about still wanting to be ""friends"" (an option that's about as enticing as forming a cuddle pile with your ex, her new dude and a couple of rabid skunks), send her a message before you clicky-click her outta your life. Now, if your ex is basically El Diablo, just take aim and fire. And no one will blame you if you let out the littlest of evil laughs whilst doing the blocking or unfriending deed. The enemy who friended you . Yup. He tortured you in grade school by mocking your name, your shoes and the way you crossed your T's. Now he's asking to be your friend, albeit a decade or two later via the World Wide Web. Curious, you accept his request -- you just wanna know if he ended up marrying Missy, the homecoming queen, or if he finally made it to Hollywood. After seeing that he did, indeed, make Missy his Missus (with whom he reared four hideous, mulleted children) and that he did, indeed, take off to Tinseltown (you thought that dude in that scary Skinemax flick looked familiar), you feel no desire to maintain ties with the former bully. Well, friend, this is your chance to get back at old Biff, so unfriend away. In fact, 22 percent of those surveyed would pull rather pull the trigger on an old foe than anyone else on Facebook. Revenge is a dish best served cold, and nothing's colder than depriving someone of your thoroughly illuminating status updates -- there's an emo song lyric for every occasion, right? One last thing: Our survey also included the option of ""ex-boss,"" but only 12 percent of respondents would unfriend that acquaintance over all others.

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Some people view an MBA degree the same way that Charlie thought about his Golden Ticket in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"": They believe a piece of paper can magically transport you to a place you only imagined. But can this addition to your résumé really be your dream ticket? Yes. No. Maybe. There are no simple answers, but here are ways that an MBA might help you. MBA could get you hired in a tough economy . Let's face it: If you had your pick between two candidates -- one with a BBA and one with an MBA -- who were both qualified for a job, wouldn't you take the one with the higher degree? Because of the recession's affect on employment, many companies have a wealth of talent to pick from at the moment and some can afford to be choosy in their hiring. Candidates need to score every point possible, and a graduate degree may give that extra edge. Read students trying to get a job in the tough economy . ""A category of jobs that begins to show up more in a recession is one that says MBA desired or preferred versus MBA required,"" says Dennis Grindle, director of the SMU Cox School of Business MBA Career Management Center in Dallas, Tex. ""These jobs tend to pay somewhere in between a BBA and an MBA. This allows an MBA to get into what they want to do by taking a step back to hopefully go forward later when economic times get better."" MBA may get you where you want to go faster . ""Having an MBA -- as opposed to just a bachelor's degree in business -- is sort of like traveling someplace by plane instead of taking the train. With either business degree, you may eventually wind up at your final 'destination' -- but the MBA will get you there faster,"" says Elizabeth Freedman, author of ""The MBA Student's Job-Seeking Bible"" and ""Work 101: Learning the Ropes of the Workplace Without Hanging Yourself."" Read top job hot spots for the next decade . Some of the opportunities an MBA degree may jump-start include: . • Managing larger teams • Running meetings • Greater interaction with clients • More decision-making power • Representing the company at events • ""Choicer"" projects • Responsibility for your own set of clients/projects . MBA is sometimes expected . ""In certain organizations (top-tier consulting firms, for instance), having an MBA or an advanced degree is practically a requirement for certain positions,"" Freedman notes. ""It's hard to move up without that credential, no matter how talented."" In this situation, the degree basically becomes a minimum qualification -- not your ace in the hole. To land the position, you are then expected to bring what Grindle calls ""an A+ game"" to the table, meaning that you have everything the employer is looking for and then some. Grindle notes that whether a function requires an MBA or not may vary by company size, industry, state of the economy, and even geographical location. Still, there are fields that commonly utilize MBAs, including: . • Consumer Brand Marketing • Corporation Finance • Venture Capital • Investment Banking • Commercial Banking • Production/Operations Management • New Product Development • Management Consulting • Private Equity • Strategic Planning/Business Development . MBA can round out an education . Some workers hold undergraduate degrees in fields other than business. By seeking an MBA, these employees can fill in possible gaps in their education as well as show their commitment to their field. Likewise, a person who already holds an undergraduate business degree but perhaps has been working in a different area can update his skills by seeking a graduate degree. The decision whether or not to pursue an MBA is a tough one. It involves serious thought about money, time and career goals. But for those who decide that getting an MBA is the path they wish to take, the degree might open up a whole new world of possibilities. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Three hundred days: That's how long a private contractor will have to cover a remote area of the Indian Ocean a little smaller than the country of Sri Lanka where officials believe missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ended up. The time frame for the sea floor search was included in documents released Wednesday by Australian authorities seeking bids from companies to carry out the next phase of the hunt for the passenger jet. Nearly three months after Flight 370 disappeared over Southeast Asia, searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people aboard, making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history. Authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course during a scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 or to say where exactly its errant journey ended. Hopes of closure for the families of those on board were raised in early April, when a search team in the southern Indian Ocean detected pings that were initially believed to have come from the plane's flight recorders. But last week, Australian authorities said that an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings had found no wreckage, ruling it out as the aircraft's final resting place. 'A very challenging task' Now, officials are preparing for the next stage of the search. Australia, the closest country to the area where the plane is believed to have entered the ocean, has decided to delegate the management and operation of the new phase to a private company. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading the search at the request of the Malaysian government, said Wednesday that it is accepting proposals for the task until the end of June. The new search is expected to start in August, at the earliest. ""This is a very challenging task, one that relies on very effectively limited information,"" Martin Dolan, the bureau's chief commissioner, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" this week. ""But information, if analyzed and viewed carefully, can give a lot of evidence about the likely location of the aircraft."" The exact search area is yet to be defined, as an international team of experts is reviewing the satellite, radar and other data that led to the conclusion that the plane flew into the southern Indian Ocean. It will be in the vicinity of an arc hundreds of kilometers long -- the area where investigators believe the aircraft ran out of fuel, about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia. Dolan said officials remain ""cautiously optimistic"" that the plane's resting place will be found. 'Holes, trenches, ridges' The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says the new search area will be around 60,000 square kilometers (23,000 square miles). The winning bidder will have to cover 5,000 square kilometers of the area every 25 days or risk payment being withheld. The contractor will also have to provide daily progress reports and submit its plans for the following 24 hours, the documents say. The chosen company will face a stern challenge, operating in one of the most isolated and hostile environments on the planet. The previous phase of the search, both above and below the surface of the water, was repeatedly disrupted by bad weather. Some of the ocean in the region is so remote, authorities aren't sure exactly how deep it is. The tender documents warn that the search operation will be dealing with depths of up to 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) -- and in a variety of sea states and ocean currents. The underwater terrain in question could involve ""holes, trenches, ridges, steep gradients, isolated features"" and a sea floor potentially made of silt, sand, rock and other materials, the tender documents say. A specialized Chinese ship has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. A contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts this month. Unclear who pays what . The bureau doesn't provide any specific numbers about how much the contractor will be paid. Australia had estimated that the next phase of the search would cost $60 million, with the breakdown of who's going to pay for what still to be announced. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the plane is from, but most of the people on the flight were Chinese. As the official search transitions into its next phase, Malaysia's acting transportation minister released a statement Wednesday outlining the ""way forward."" ""We have entered a new difficult phase which brings with it new challenges which we will overcome together,"" Hishammuddin Hussein said. ""As we enter the new phase of this search, we are grateful for the continuous support that we have received from the international community."" That continued support from the international community will include ""specialized assets and services"" from the United States and others, according to Hishammuddin. He said he's asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to continue using the U.S. Navy-owned Bluefin-21, an autonomous underwater vehicle, as well as the remotely operated vehicle Curv-21. Hishammuddin also announced Wednesday that Singapore-based engineering and technology company Boustead is ""finalizing terms"" for an oceanographic survey vessel, ROV and deep sea sonar. Malaysia's state-owned oil company Petronas will also be funding a deep towed side-scan sonar and crew, according to Hishammuddin. As the disappearance of MH370 approaches the 90-day mark, theories about the plane's fate continue to circulate. An Australian university on Wednesday released an audio recording and other information about an underwater sound that they say could be related to the final moments of the plane. And independent experts are studying the satellite data that have played a key role in guiding the search to see whether they agree with the official analysis that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean.

"(CNN) -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich appeared in court Tuesday afternoon to hear federal corruption charges against him. He was released on $4,500 bail. Rod Blagojevich is serving his second term as governor of Illinois. The Democratic governor, who appeared in court in a blue jogging suit, also had to forfeit his passport. FBI agents arrested Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, early Tuesday on federal corruption charges related in part to the selection of President-elect Barack Obama's successor to the Senate, the U.S. attorney's office said. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald declared Tuesday a ""sad day for government."" ""Gov. Blagojevich has taken us to a new low,"" he said. ""This conduct would make [Abraham] Lincoln roll over in his grave."" Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois before becoming president. Fitzgerald said the government had bugged the governor's campaign office and placed a tap on his home phone. Each was charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery, authorities said.  Watch: Fitzgerald discusses the charges » . In a 76-page affidavit, federal authorities said wiretaps caught Blagojevich conspiring to sell or trade the vacant Senate seat in exchange for financial benefits for himself and his wife, Patti. The governor also often weighed the option of appointing himself to the Senate seat, saying he was ""stuck"" at governor and might have access to more resources as a senator than as a governor, the affidavit says. A Senate seat could also help him remake his image ahead of a possible presidential run in 2016. ""If ... they're not going to offer anything of any value, then I might just take it,"" he said in one conversation. Obama reacted at a news conference on Tuesday.  View politicians' reactions to the charges » . ""Obviously, like the rest of the people of Illinois, I am saddened and sobered by the news that came out of the U.S. attorney's office today,"" he said. ""But as this is an ongoing investigation involving the governor, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on the issue at this time."" When asked whether he had any contact with Blagojevich about the Senate seat, Obama said he had no contact with the governor or his office. ""I was not aware of what was happening,"" he added. At times, Blagojovich discussed obtaining a substantial salary for himself at a nonprofit organization or an organization affiliated with labor unions, as well as placing his wife on paid corporate boards where she might make as much as $150,000 a year, the government said. During one recorded conversation, Blagojevich said he needed to consider his family and said he was financially hurting, the affidavit said.  Get an overview of the governor and the case against him » . ""I want to make money,"" Blagojevich said, according to the affidavit. The intercepted phone calls also caught the governor and Harris discussing the possibility of the Tribune Co.'s obtaining assistance from the Illinois Finance Authority in efforts to sell the Cubs and the financing or sale of Wrigley Field, the government said.  The company owns the Chicago Tribune, the Cubs and Wrigley Field. The Tribune Co. announced Monday that it is filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Blagojevich allegedly directed Harris to tell Tribune officials that state assistance would be withheld unless members of the Chicago Tribune's editorial board were fired. The Illinois governor saw them as ""driving discussion of his possible impeachment,"" the affidavit said. ""Our recommendation is fire all those [expletive] people, get 'em the [expletive] out of there and get us some editorial support,"" the governor allegedly said in one phone call. Federal authorities also allege the governor and Harris schemed with others -- including convicted real estate developer Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko -- to obtain financial benefits for himself, his family and others, including his campaign committee, Friends of Blagojevich. Reports from the Chicago Tribune last week said federal authorities were investigating the governor and were secretly taping his conversations -- with the help of his former congressional chief of staff, John Wyem. ""I don't believe there's any cloud that hangs over me,"" Blagojevich told WLS-TV in Chicago on Monday as he responded to the reports of wiretapping. ""I think there's nothing but sunshine hanging over me."" He added, ""By the way, I should say if anyone wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it. I appreciate anybody who wants to tape me openly."" Fitzgerald said the case required ""unusual measures"" because of actions Blagojevich was expected to take soon, including filling the vacant Senate seat. ""There were a lot of things going on that were imminent,"" he said. ""We were in the middle of a corruption crime spree and we wanted to stop it,"" Fitzgerald said.  Watch: Fitzgerald discusses Obama's Senate seat » . One big question now is whether Blagojevich retains the right to name Obama's successor if he remains in custody or even under indictment. The answer is yes, according to Fitzgerald. Jay Stewart, executive director of Chicago's Better Government Association, agreed. He said Blagojevich retains the right to fill the senate vacancy until he's out of office, which won't happen unless he quits or is removed from office by impeachment. At a news conference Tuesday, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said he wants the Illinois Legislature to act quickly to pass a law setting a special election to fill Obama's seat, in order to prevent Blagojevich from making a tainted appointment or there being a lengthy vacancy in the Senate. ""No appointment by this governor under these circumstances could produce a credible replacement,"" Durbin said. iReport.com: What do you think of Blagojevich's corruption charges? Fitzgerald said Blagojevich was looking to pull $8 million in funding for a children's hospital after the hospital's chief executive officer did not give a $50,000 contribution to the governor's campaign. Also, Fitzgerald said, it was expected that Blagojevich would soon sign into law a bill that would direct a percentage of casino revenue to the horse racing industry -- a bill supported by someone who contributed $100,000. ""To let that bill be signed, to me, would be very, very troubling,"" Fitzgerald said. The governor's office, in an afternoon statement, said the allegations ""do nothing to impact the services, duties or function of the state."" ""Our state will continue to ensure health, safety and economic stability for the citizens of Illinois."" Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn said the governor should use a provision in the Illinois constitution that allows him to step down, but not necessarily to resign. ""I recommend to the governor to realize ... that he cannot carry out his responsibilities of office today, and he should, in my opinion, step aside."" Quinn, a Democrat like Blagojevich, said under the provision, a determination can be made later as to whether he can return to office. Quinn said he had not spoken to Blagojevich at length since summer 2007. Blagojevich, who turns 52 on Wednesday, is in his second four-year term as Illinois governor. His term ends January 2011. Before that, he served as a U.S. congressman for Illinois' 5th district from 1997 until 2003, according to his online biography. He and his wife have two daughters. The state's last governor, George Ryan, was convicted in April 2006 on racketeering and fraud charges. Ryan reported to a federal prison in Wisconsin in November 2007 to serve a 6½-year sentence. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of the United States said it would not hear an appeal from Ryan. CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","NEW: Gov.

The accident happened near the Dinner Key Marina in Biscayne Bay around 10:45 p.m. Friday following a fireworks display, as a crowd of boaters was making their way back to shore. ""One vessel crashed into another, then that vessel hit a third,"" Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Officer Jorge Pino said Saturday. Pino said up to five people were thrown into the water after the crash and as many as 12 were transported to local hospitals. Those hurt include several children with minor injuries. Two victims died at a hospital Friday night, he said, and two more deceased victims were found in the water Saturday morning. One person is hospitalized in critical condition, according to Pino. Afterward, at least one of the boats towed back to shore had a gaping hole in its side. ""It's possible that these boats were rushing to get back to the boat ramp to get out of the water,"" Pino said.

"(CNN) -- Manute Bol, one of the tallest players in NBA history, died Saturday at the age of 47, a spokeswoman with the University of Virginia Medical Center confirmed to CNN. The hospital did not disclose the cause of death. Bol, who was listed at 7-feet-7 inches tall and 225 pounds, played for the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat in his 10-year career. The native of war-torn Sudan was known during and after his career for his charity work for his home country. ""He was a wonderful person. He would always talk about the civil war going on in Sudan, because he was sending all of his money back to Sudan,"" Charles Barkley, Bol's teammate on the 76ers and an NBA analyst for TNT, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""I can honestly say I never played with a better person,"" Barkley said. ""He never forgot about the Sudan. He would talk to us about it all the time. ... The world is not a better place today; It's worse because we don't have Manute Bol,""  he added. In 2004 after he was nearly killed in an auto accident, Bol told Sports Illustrated, ""God guided me to America and gave me a good job. But he also gave me a heart, so I would look back."" Bol donated his NBA earnings to charity, according to the article. Bol, so tall and so lanky, was somewhat the oddity when he came to national attention as a player for the University of Bridgeport in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1984. He was a dominant shot blocker and rebounder at the Division II school, where often the tallest player on the other team would be a foot shorter than him. He played one year at Bridgeport then went pro. Known as the Dinka Dunker for the Sudanese tribe he was from, Bol was drafted in 1985 by the Bullets and twice led the NBA in blocked shots. Fans also loved when he would stand behind the 3-point line and push up a long-distance jumper. He had more blocked shots than points scored in his career, the only NBA player to ever accomplish the feat. He also drew attention after his career ended when he fought a former NFL player, William Perry, in made-for-TV boxing match. Bol won the fight over the man known as the ""The Refrigerator"" with a third-round decision. Many did not know about Bol's propensity to joke on his teammates, especially Barkley. ""There's never been a guy who played more practical jokes or who made more people laugh more than Manute Bol,"" Barkley said. ""He was hilarious."" Bol is survived by four children, two sons and two daughters, he had with his ex-wife, Atong. Former NBA player Gheorghe Muresan, who starred with Billy Crystal in the 1998 movie ""My Giant,"" was also listed at 7-feet-7.","At 7-feet-7, Manute Bol was one of the tallest players in NBA history .

"(EW.com ) -- 300: Rise of an Empire speared its competition and kept on raking in the dollars on its opening weekend. Warner Bros. and Legendary's hyper-stylized 3-D sequel earned an estimated $45 million from 3,470 theaters. Despite lackluster reviews, audiences turned out in droves to watch Eva Green's Atremisia and the rest of the scantily clad warriors take to the sea for battle in the $108 million pic. Smart People director Noam Murro took the helm from Zack Snyder this time around â€” though Snyder produced and wrote the film. Audiences (62 percent male) slapped the epic with a B Cinema Score. The lure of IMAX helped. The 342 IMAX screens brought in $6.8 million (or 15 percent) of the film's weekend earnings, while 3-D showings accounted for 63 percent of the grosses. 300: Rise of an Empire is also performing quite well internationally with $87.8 million from 58 markets. Still, it doesn't even come close to Zack Snyder's $70 million March 2007 opening for 300. Nevertheless, the sequel should enjoy a healthy box office life. DreamWorks Animation's Mr. Peabody and Sherman (Cinema Score: A) opened in the No. 2 spot this weekend with an estimated $32.5 million from 3,934 theaters, exceeding studio and analyst expectations for the $145 million movie. Audiences were slightly more female (54 percent) and 52 percent were over 25. Despite the stellar A Cinema Score, it seems younger audiences were even more enthusiastic: The 25 and under crowd gave it an A+. The brilliant dog and his eager young companion will likely enjoy at least one more good weekend at the box office before Muppets Most Wanted screams into theaters on March 21. Liam Neeson's tense thriller Non-Stop snagged the third place spot with $15.4 million â€” a 46.7 percent drop from its debut. The Jaume Collet-Serra pic now boasts a $52.1 million domestic total. Meanwhile, The Lego Movie dropped 47 percent and claimed the No. 4 spot with $11.1 million. The animated building blocks have made about $225 million domestically in five weeks in theaters. Finally, in fifth place, Mark Burnett and Roma Downey's biblical epic Son of God fell 60 percent and took in an estimated $10 million in its second weekend in theaters, bringing its domestic total to $41.5 million. Here's the top five: . 1. 300: Rise of an Empire -- $45.05 million . 2. Mr. Peabody and Sherman -- $32.5 million . 3. Non-Stop -- $15.4 million . 4. The Lego Movie -- $11.1 million . 5. Son of God -- $10 million . In the speciality box office world, Wes Anderson's art caper The Grand Budapest Hotel earned an estimated $800K from four theaters. Its $200K per-screen average is the highest ever for a live-action film. According to Fox Searchlight, sell-out crowds even caused extra showings to be added on the spot. For those not in New York or Los Angeles, the film will open in 17 new markets this weekend. Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master was the previous record-holder with $147K per theater. Budapest's debut also pushes Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (opened to $130k per theater average) to the No. 3 spot. Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave also expanded into 1,000 theaters this weekend, earning $2.2 million and a spot in the top 10. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- It's often described as the game no team wants to play in. This was certainly the case for Brazil Saturday as the World Cup hosts suffered further embarrassment after the Netherlands triumphed 3-0 in the third place playoff match in Brasilia. Chaotic defending helped the Dutch race into an early lead with Robin van Persie scoring a penalty before Daley Blind added a second soon after. Brazil spent much of the second period looking for a way back into the game but despite a couple of dangerous looking free-kicks and a solid claim for a penalty of their own never looked like clawing back the deficit. A late strike by Georginio Wijnaldum added further gloss to the scoreline and piled even more misery on the World Cup hosts. It's a result that will doubtless further fuel the debate as to how the world's most successful football nation overhauls the structure of its game after a calamitous end to its first home World Cup in 64 years. As in Tuesday's 7-1 shellacking at the hands of Germany, a glaring lack of quality and organization shone through in the Estadio Nacional Mane Garrincha. Brazil was once more out-maneuvered and out-thought by their well drilled opponents. Dutch coach Louis van Gaal takes a pride -- which he's not shy of telling everyone about -- in preparing for every eventuality during a match, although he gave the impression that this fixture was not much of a concern to him ahead of the game. ""There is only one award that counts and that is becoming world champions,"" he had told reporters after losing to Argentina in midweek. Here, Van Gaal made two changes to the side which started that semifinal. Jordy Clasie came in for Nigel de Jong in midfield and Jonathan de Guzman replaced Wesley Sneijder who injured a hamstring in the warm-up. Brazil too altered its personnel. Captain Thiago Silva was restored to the center of defense after his suspension while Maxwell, Willian and Jo all came in to the side. It would make little difference. The shortcomings so ruthlessly exposed by Thomas Muller and co. in Belo Horizonte were clear for all to see right from the off. Arjen Robben burst clear of the Brazil defense in the first minute and was pulled back by Silva as he approached the box. The referee had little option despite contact beginning outside the area and pointed to the spot. He arguably should have sent Silva off for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity but instead flashed only a yellow card, much to the frustration of Robben. Van Persie stepped up and blasted the ball high beyond Julio Cesar in the Brazil goal. Brazil immediately began to press high looking to force a mistake that would let them back into the game, but in doing so left themselves exposed at the back. It was a tactic that when combined with yet more suicidal defending from David Luiz would lead to the Dutch doubling their advantage after 17 minutes. A weak headed clearance from the former Chelsea defender fell at the feet of Blind who had what seemed like an age to take two touches to set himself before firing the ball beyond Cesar with his third touch. Brazilian fans would have been forgiven for fearing the worst at this stage. But the five times world champions composed themselves as the match progressed. They had a penalty claim of their own turned down midway through the second half after Blind appeared to clear out Oscar in the area. Wijnaldum's neat finish in the 90th minute, meanwhile, was one of the few clear shots on goal the Netherlands had in the second half. Still, the gulf in class was obvious throughout and not what the world has come to expect from the land of Pele, Garrincha, Zico, Socrates, Romario and Ronaldo. Neymar and Silva aside, Brazil have looked little more than average throughout the tournament, drawing on good fortune and favorable refereeing decisions to make it past decent but limited teams like Croatia, Mexico and Cameroon. A physically robust approach, meanwhile, was deployed against more skilful teams like Chile and Colombia. As a result, few sides have committed as many fouls as Brazil. This is a particularly galling statistic for the once renowned samba kings, emphasizing the negative, spoiling nature of much of their play over the last four weeks. Gone are the days, for now at least, of ball-playing midfielders who could flummox opponents and onlookers alike with their skill, style and mastery of the ball. Instead, powerful players like Fernandinho, Luiz Gustavo and Paulinho graft in the midfield engine room for the vintage of 2014. More technically adept talent like Philippe Coutinho, Lucus Moura and even Ronaldinho have been squeezed out of the team and the squad as a result. There might be plenty of muscle in this Brazil side but at times the hosts also have seemed like a collective nervous wreck. Tears have been shed during the playing of the anthem before games and after penalty shootouts. For the Netherlands, change is also afoot. Van Gaal will depart to manage English Premier League team Manchester United and Guus Hiddink will arrive to plot the path to the European Championships in France 2016. Another group of fine young Dutch players have made their tournament debuts in Brazil as the old stagers like Van Persie, Robben, Dirk Kuyt and Sneijder have possibly played their last World Cup. The likes of Bruno Martins Indi, Memphis Depay, Jasper Cillessen, Blind and Stefan de Vrij have all equipped themselves well. Blind, who is the son of the Dutch assistant coach Danny, in particular looked mature and composed in both defense and attack before being carried off injured late on while de Vrij was again calm at the back. If only the future looked as rosy for Brazil. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari will find out whether he will keep his job as coach as the post-mortem begins. ""It is up to the president to decide,"" Scolari told reporters after the match, referring to the head of the Brazilian Football Federation. ""We will hand in a final report and then leave it to him to analyze what needs to be done."" Meanwhile, many of the players who performed so miserably in the latter stages will likely not play for their national team again. And yet, despite all this, the most painful result could be yet to come. Argentina will face Germany Sunday in the Maracana Stadium in Rio to decide who will win this most entertaining of tournaments. Should Brazil's great South American rivals triumph, this World Cup could quite possibly top the famous Maracanzo of 1950 in the annals of Brazilian sporting disasters.","Netherlands defeats Brazil 3-0 in World Cup third place playoff match .

"(CNN) -- Cher sits in a director's chair in one of the many rooms of her ""Architectural Digest""-worthy home, perched high above a prime stretch of Malibu beach. She's talking about her infamous ""Farewell Tour,"" an extended global trek that ran from 2002 to 2005, and was supposed to be her swan song as a touring artist. ""I never should have called it that, but it seemed like it at the time,"" she tells CNN. ""It was like the tour that would not quit. I won't do that again."" A few feet away, members of her entourage burst into laughter. Exactly one week later, the 67-year-old entertainer announced her ""Dressed to Kill"" tour which kicks off in Phoenix next March. According to Monday's press release, Cher is scheduled to headline arenas in 49 North American cities -- but who knows? The lure of her adoring fans may be too hard to resist once she's packed her G-strings. In the meantime, she is out promoting her first album in 12 years, ""Closer to the Truth."" CNN's Denise Quan sat down with the outspoken Oscar, Emmy and Grammy winner about her own truth, and as usual, the star didn't disappoint with her candor. CNN:  You seem to always speak the truth. Is that accurate? Cher: I'm not so sure that's the truth. Sometimes I don't tell the truth, which is telling the truth about not telling the truth. I think people don't tell the truth when they're afraid that something bad's going to happen if they tell the truth. But I got to be this age, and I'm doing this, and what's somebody going to do to me, really? I say things all the time that I could really get into trouble for, but they kind of blow over. CNN: You have to admire women who have the courage to put it out there. Cher: When I grew up, it was a time when women were just supposed to be cute and not have many opinions. My mother and her friends were quite different. They were all the most beautiful women you've ever seen ... and they were very strong women. When I was with Sonny -- when I met him, I was 16, so it didn't bother me until I was 20-something -- it started to chafe at me. I really wanted to do what I wanted to do, say what I wanted to say. I didn't want to be shackled to somebody else's opinion, and Sonny was very much, ""My opinion is your opinion."" So when I decided to leave him, I just thought, ""I have to get back to myself. I have to decide who I am, and just be who I am."" I have to tell you something. It doesn't always turn out. It's not always a happy ending when sometimes you say things that you think, and it goes against the grain of the larger group. CNN: You recently turned down a chance to perform at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, in protest of the Russian government's stance on gay rights. Cher: Well, first of all, it was back channels. But it was to be an American ambassador, to sing or to do something in the opening. I have a lot of great friends in Russia -- wonderful people, people I really love -- and I have great fans there, too. The Olympics are the Olympics, so it wasn't something that I'd think, ""Ah, that's sad."" But you can't. You just can't. If I were an athlete, I'd think long and hard, because you spend your whole life preparing for the whole moment, and then your life is nothing. Your dream is nothing. So I couldn't fault an athlete. But mine was just, ""It would have been fun."" You just can't do it. It's not possible. CNN: Do you think gay rights have taken a backwards turn in some parts of the world? Cher: I think maybe gay marriage has scared some part of the world. I've seen many countries where it's punishable by death. How can people be so afraid of something that's really not going to involve them? I just don't get it. My mother had gay friends. It's something I was around my whole life. Also, my best fan base is gay guys that have never gone (away). They've always been there. All I can hope is that the people that I know in Russia, that there are more people like that. I never felt that when I was there. We had gay guys with us in my show, and it was like, no problem. So I hope this is just a bad period in their history, and it'll blow over. Look, when I was young, it was against the law. It's amazing how far we've come in that amount of time. CNN: You really pushed boundaries in 1989 with your music video, ""If I Could Turn Back Time."" Cher: It seems like nothing now, but the first one to push is the first one to push. So yeah, I got a lot of flack for that. It doesn't make any difference. It's a great video, and it kind of stands the test of time. But when you're pushing against the people, they either have more judgment, or they don't see the humor in it. Some people got really unhappy, and that's why they pulled the video after it had already been on for weeks and weeks. Then they started playing it late at night. I think there are probably some things that kids shouldn't see. I don't think that was one of them. If you look at it in comparison to what's happening today, it's nothing. CNN: What did you think of Miley Cyrus' performance on the VMAs? Cher: You have to give her credit for trying something, for trying to stretch the boundaries. I didn't like it because I didn't think it was very good. If she had come out naked, and done that and pulled it off, I would have said, ""You stretched it. You pulled it off. It was great."" But I didn't love it as an art form. I thought it was sloppy. I didn't think it was professional enough for her. I think she's got to go back to the drawing board. And yet everybody's talking about it. I certainly don't think she deserved all the flak that she got for it. It was just one performance at the VMAs. Who cares? CNN: It's hard to believe you're 67. Cher: I know! It's terrible. I hate that number. I don't like any of them. I thought I was 10 years younger, and I was upset. But you know, my mom has this saying -- and I'm not sure I agree with her -- but she said, ""If you don't pay attention to age, then it won't pay attention to you."" And she says it, and it sounds nice, but I don't buy it. CNN: Are skimpy costumes still part of your stage show? Cher: Well, not always, but will be as long as I can do it. My friends and I were talking the other day, and we were looking at what we were wearing and it's the same things that we've been wearing since we were in our 20s. And I remember thinking, ""When will I have to stop wearing jeans, or when will I have to cut my hair?"" All those things, but it doesn't seem like it. I'm going to die wearing the same things that I love wearing. I'm going to wear my jeans. I'm going to wear wifebeaters. I'm going to wear my leather jacket. I don't care. As long as I can look good in it, and feel comfortable in it, then I'm going to do it. CNN: Are we going to see a ""Farewell Tour 2?"" Cher: Yes, absolutely! I shouldn't have called it that, but it seemed like it was at the time. It was like the tour that would not quit. It was crazy long. I won't do that again. The reason I'm doing this is mainly because I know I really will never do it again because I don't have the energy. It takes so much energy to be on the road . I know I have finite energy, and I can probably squeak by this time, but I did the longest tour ever by a woman, and I don't think there were 20-year-olds who could handle that. Three-and-a-half years is a really long time. So we'll see. But if I don't do it now, I won't do it. I'm not like when Tina (Turner) came back and did a tour at 70. That's not going to be me.

"(T+L) -- Can just traveling to a city make you better looking? Liz Eckert would say so. On a recent visit to southern California, the Connecticut real estate agent was struck by the gorgeous scenery—as in, the people. She chalked it up to the locals' regular access to sand, surf, and sunshine. ""After one week there, I actually looked and felt healthier,"" she says. ""My skin was glowing, my hair was shiny, and even my nails grew—and they never grow."" Given the area's seemingly magical powers of osmosis, it's no wonder that both San Diego and Los Angeles made it into the top five cities for America's best-looking people, according to Travel + Leisure readers. New results are in from the annual America's Favorite Cities survey, in which readers rate 35 metropolitan areas for qualities such as people-watching, walkable streets, and hot music scenes. This year, the attractive locals category saw a fair amount of movement: the new number 1 city is a past champ that had previously fallen from grace, and several cities have made impressive rebounds in the rankings or else seemingly let themselves go. (What happened, Las Vegas?) While plenty of the top 20 cities offer the potentially transformational elements that Eckert found in SoCal, other winners offered proof that being gorgeous is more than skin deep. Non-coastal (or downright chilly) cities such as Minneapolis, Nashville, and Kansas City fared just fine—and also ranked well with readers for being friendly. T+L: America's most romantic cities . One new category in this year's survey may have also boosted chemistry: a charming accent, something T+L readers found lacking with the folks of Phoenix and Seattle, who also ranked among the less attractive.Of course, a key ingredient in attraction is a solid fashion sense and that may be a reason that some sunny cities landed near the bottom. ""Locals in Orlando know what they are to the world""—a giant theme park—""and don't even try anymore,"" says Lisa Finkelstein, a Tallahassee-based freelance writer. ""Since it's warm much of the year, shorts and a pullover shirt, plus tennies, takes them everywhere,"" she says. ""Even Angelina Jolie can't work that look."" Number 1: Miami . Did they do something new with their hair? These party-loving Floridians have reclaimed the top slot this year, which they haven't held since 2009. They also ranked in the top 10 for their fashion sense and fit physiques. See for yourself over drinks at one of the city's highly rated cocktail lounges. The only downer: Miamians also ranked as being pretty aloof. Number 2: San Diego . It's hard to argue with a beauty regimen of fresh air and miles of beaches for staying in shape. This SoCal city has consistently ranked as the first runner-up for good looks in T+L's survey, even if readers tend not to be so impressed with the locals' conversational skills. San Diegans do, however, score well for being tech-savvy. Number 3: San Juan, Puerto Rico . Last year's winner slipped a few spots this year, but the island city is still a magnetic place for mingling with a good-looking crowd: it also ranks in the top three for its happy hour and singles scene. Readers downgraded the Puerto Rican city for its sense of style, but they were suckers for the fabulous local accent. T+L: America's best cities for singles . Number 4: Charleston . Proof that voters are a little fickle: this South Carolina city was No. 1 for attractive locals in 2010, but fell to No. 7 last year. While readers still find the locals to be charming—and think that the city makes a great romantic getaway—they were easily distracted by all the good shopping, ranking the city in the top five when it comes to antiques, design stores, and indie boutiques. Number 5: Los Angeles . It's easy to make jokes about some locals having ""work"" done. But whatever the reason, Angelenos have ranked in the top five for looks in the last three out of four years, and they won the silver medal this year for their fashion-forward style. They're also trying that catch-more-flies-with-honey strategy: their niceness factor went up by three positions since last year. Number 6: Nashville . A cowboy hat sets off the face nicely, doesn't it? Music City jumped up seven places in the attractiveness category since last year, even if it lost its grip on the top spot in the survey for music. If you want an alternative to the honky-tonks, look for any crowd wearing SEC team shirts: Nashville ranked No. 3 for its sports bars. Number 7: Austin . Folks in the Texas capital seem to be simultaneously quirky, smart, and buff: the only personal quality that voters were less-than-smitten with was perhaps residents' tendency toward hipster fashion. Look for them hanging out by the No. 2--ranked food trucks or dining on gourmet burgers. T+L: The best and worst airports to find a date . Number 8: Savannah . If these Georgians ever said anything unattractive or rude, voters might not even notice, so blinded were they by the top-ranked local drawl. Voters were also charmed by these southerners' willingness to indulge themselves: the handsome city ranked No. 3 for its happy hour, and No. 1 for ice cream parlors. Number 9: Honolulu . Despite the fashion gambles of occasional floral shirts and muumuus, the Hawaiians are regulars in the attractive top 10 for their compelling mix of diversity, fitness, and a mellow attitude. It can only help that the Hawaiian city won the top spot in the survey's weather category. Number 10: Minneapolis/St. Paul . After a two-year absence, the Twin Cities have returned to the top 10, perhaps because locals nicely walk the line between nerdy and outdoorsy: they won the survey for smarts, and the cities ranked No. 1 for their parks.

"Rome (CNN) -- Amanda Knox's ex-boyfriend and murder trial co-defendant revealed in a new book that he sometimes questioned her innocence because of her ""bizarre behavior"" the day a British student was found dead in their apartment. Raffaele Sollecito's memoir, ""Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox,"" is the first book written by anyone directly involved in the Meredith Kercher murder trial in Perugia, Italy. Kercher, a 21-year-old British student, was found stabbed to death in the Italian apartment she shared with Knox, now 25, of Seattle. Sollecito and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011. They face a final high-court decision in March. Judge explains murder acquittal . Italian prosecutors appeal decision . Rudy Guede of Ivory Coast was convicted separately in 2008. His conviction was upheld on appeal in 2009. Sollecito's book draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends, family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison, the preface says. He chronicles the day of the murder, admitting that he and Knox smoked marijuana that afternoon, which he says he regretted because it clouded his memory of what happened. While maintaining his innocence, he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him. He and Knox made mistakes the morning of the discovery, including trusting police investigators, he writes. Sollecito writes that at times, he was uncomfortable with Knox's ""bizarre behavior,"" which he says prosecutors used against both of them. ""Of all the things that Amanda did that day, nothing attracted more criticism than her failure to raise the alarm as soon as she saw so many things out of place,"" he writes. ""It wasn't just the police who attacked her. Many Italians, including most of my family, could not fathom how she could go ahead with her shower after finding blood on the tap, much less put her wet feet on the bath mat, which was also stained, and drag it across the floor."" Neither he nor Knox had solid alibis for the night of Kercher's murder, Sollecito writes. ""We had no real alibi for the night of November 1 except each other, and we did not have lawyers to protect us, and we seemed to have a propensity for saying things without thinking them through,"" he says. Sollecito describes his doubt about Knox's innocence at times, referring to the night the two were arrested. ""When I first found out about what Amanda had signed her name to, I was furious,"" he writes. ""Okay, she was under a lot of pressure, as I had been, but how could she just invent stuff out of nowhere?"" He gives an account of his life inside several Italian prisons, where he befriended rapists and murderers, played with cockroaches and scrubbed the cells of dirt and mold. While sharing his family's personal stories and sagas during the lengthy trial, the book gives very little attention to the evidence presented in court. The revelations include how he distrusted the lawyers his father hired for him. They were intent on getting Sollecito to abandon Knox and accuse her of the murder, he wrote. 'Foxy Knoxy': Sex, violence and media hysteria . At one time after the first conviction, Sollecito's father sought the help of a private lawyer not connected to the case, who spoke to Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini about striking a plea deal to cut Sollecito's sentence in exchange for evidence against Knox. Sollecito's lead attorney, Giulia Bongiorno, a prominent parliamentarian, almost walked off the case because of the backroom deal. Mignini declined to comment about the book or the case until the high court appeal is completed. Sollecito's book is especially hard on Mignini, whom he accuses of concocting a ""conspiracy-laden plotline from Umberto Eco"" instead of a normal investigation. He laments the star treatment Knox received, saying the prosecution focused squarely on his co-defendant. He wrote that he believed he was arrested as a way to get to Knox. ""I don't think the prosecution or police ever seriously thought of me as a murderer,"" he wrote. ""They had one overriding reason to arrest me, throw me into solitary confinement, and threaten me with life imprisonment, and that was to pressure me into rolling over and testifying against Amanda."" Sollecito condemns his treatment by Perugia police who, he says, would not give him food or access to a lawyer during the questioning, even though it was clear to him that they were treating him as a suspect and not just a person informed of the facts of the case. Sollecito gave several spontaneous declarations during both the original and appellate trials, but he never took the stand in his own defense. The book offers many details from behind the scenes during the four years between when Kercher was killed and when the two were released, but it does not answer all the questions about what happened that night. Sollecito wrote that he believed that Guede acted alone in killing Kercher. In the epilogue, Sollecito recounts how he went to visit Knox in Seattle last fall, but how he was nervous to see her. ""I wasn't at all sure it was a good idea and I continued to waver back and forth even after I booked my ticket. We had been through so much; perhaps we owed it to each other to live our lives and leave each other in peace."" Guede is writing a book but does not have a publisher, according to his lawyers.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Grammy-winning jazz bassist Charlie Haden, whose music career spanned seven decades and several genres, died Friday, his publicist said Sunday. He was 76. Haden, who first performed as a yodeling toddler with his family's country band in the 1930s, played on hundreds of recordings with the biggest jazz legends. His wife and four children were with him as his life ended following a long illness, ECM Records spokeswoman Tina Pelikan said. Haden, a sideman in saxophonist Ornette Coleman's band in the 1960s, is known as a founding father of free jazz. He also led his own Liberation Music Orchestra and the Charlie Haden Quartet West. The National Endowment for the Arts named Haden a ""jazz master"" in 2012 for his long career as a musician, composer, bandleader, educator, producer and activist. ""Lyrical and expressive on the bass, he embraced a variety of musical genres, ranging from jazz to country to world music,"" the NEA's bio of Haden said. Haden was just 22 months old when he first sang on his parents' country-western radio show. He took up the bass as a teenager before moving from his native Iowa to Los Angeles in 1957, the NEA bio said. His work on the influential recordings with Coleman ""helped move the bassist from an accompanying position to one of innovation and more direct improvisatory participation,"" the bio said.

"(CNN) -- ""Please tell me your name,"" a robotic female voice says to the caller. ""Larry Valentine,"" the caller responds. ""You said, 'Barry Shmalenpine.' Is that right?"" So begins the exchange between actor Kevin James and the automated phone system in the 2007 film ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" -- a scene that correctly assumes moviegoers have had personal experience with the absurdity of non-human customer service. Who hasn't? We've all waited through the recitation of menu items, none of which were related to our actual question. We've all hit zero repeatedly, hoping to be transferred to a real person. When that didn't work, maybe we even lost our temper, shouting ""Representative!"" over and over, whether the robot had given us that option or not. Why hasn't there been a mass revolt against automated systems? The answer is simple: We believe that this nonsense is temporary. We believe that computers are on the cusp of being able to understand human language. And that belief, according to many linguists and cognitive scientists, is completely wrong. First, there's the problem of voice recognition itself. Julie Sedivy, a professor of linguistics and psychology at the University of Calgary, told me that simply recognizing speech sounds and matching them up with specific words is much more complicated than most people realize. ""The way I say 'dog' will depend on my age, gender, geographic dialect, the particular anatomy of my vocal tract, and how quickly or formally I'm speaking,"" she said. ""Humans are able to calibrate their perception after hearing just a couple of seconds of someone's speech, but really good speech recognition is still a problem for many programs."" Although this technology has steadily improved for the past 20 years, ""speech recognition systems are still markedly inferior to human beings in understanding spoken language,"" said John Nerbonne, a linguist and information sciences professor based in The Netherlands. ""Telephones are a particularly difficult medium because they limit the signal a good deal."" Furthermore, studies show that people almost universally hate automated phone systems, and that most customers are even willing to pay more to speak to an actual person. ""Ally Bank,  Discover Card and TD Bank  all have ads on television right now that brag about the fact that if you call the phone number, a real live person will answer,"" said Adam Goldkamp, spokesperson for GetHuman, an organization dedicated to improving customer service. Such is the sad state of the current customer service world. In other words, only now are companies starting to wake up to the lost revenue potential of frustrated customers who give up on the automated system and take their business elsewhere. ""When you see companies launching ads like these, it shows they understand that there are things they can do to increase their future revenue by giving customers what they want: an actual person to speak to when they have an issue,"" Goldkamp said. Maybe one day in the future, automated systems will be able to identify our words with perfect accuracy. Even then, there is still an insurmountable problem: the ability to understand what we mean by those words. ""We're a long way from being able to communicate with computers in real language,"" said Suzanne Kemmer, director of Cognitive Sciences and associate professor of Linguistics at Rice University. ""Human language has a powerful design feature that works great for normal person-to-person interactions, but is completely at odds with the way computers work."" Computers are based on formal logic and fixed categories, she explained. Human language is flexible and dynamic, and follows a cognitive logic that differs fundamentally from computers. In short, human words and grammatical structures don't have fixed meanings. Instead, they have a certain amount of vagueness and ambiguity built in, so that their meaning is highly affected by context. Actually understanding meaning is a very different problem from voice recognition or from the auto-correct on your computer or phone, Kemmer said. When I brought up this topic with Harvard professor Steven Pinker, one of the world's most influential linguists, he noted that major companies, by looking for statistical patterns in large datasets and applying them to user input, have largely dropped the ball when it comes to real artificial intelligence: ""The stupidity of a lot of computer language understanding systems comes from the fact that they've turned their backs on genuine intelligence and satisfied themselves with statistics."" In other words, computers are still very bad at trying to guess what we mean when we say something. They also don't get our social and emotional psychology. ""Often the automated phone systems were developed with a tin ear to the way people interact with each other,"" Pinker told me. ""They sound like people, but if you think of them as such, they are the most infuriating people in the world. When I hit '0' to get a human being, and a voice dripping with a combination of mock concern and mock confusion says, 'I'm sorry, but I did not understand your answer,' I am apt to go into a rage."" ""If this were a real person,"" Pinker added, ""she would be simultaneously stupid, mendacious, and condescending."" It's time to stop the madness. We are not on the cusp of inventing computers that understand human language. Silicon Valley can, and will, continue to strive for this goal. In the meantime, let's stop kidding ourselves. Let's admit that computers, by themselves, are terrible at customer service. Let's admit that, at a time of economic uncertainty and job losses, we should be supporting companies that employ real people to answer our questions. Let's admit that, unless we demand change, we will be forced, forever, to deal with an automated system that thinks our name is Barry Shmalenpine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Wheeler.","David Wheeler: We all know futility or trying to make automated systems understand us .

"(CNN) -- So, you think you have it bad this tax season. Have you heard that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg will pay between $1 billion and $2 billion in taxes? That sounds like a tough pill for anyone to swallow. But it is premature to start a pity party for Zuckerberg. The twenty-something billionaire reaped large financial gains from exercising the stock options that triggered his tax bill, and he has benefited from favorable tax rules along the way. Even better, Zuckerberg will survive his encounter with the tax man in a position to never have to pay taxes again for the rest of his life. You heard that right. Let's start with the tax bill. According to media reports, Zuckerberg reported $2.3 billion income from Facebook's IPO in May 2012. How did that happen? By contract with his own highly controlled company, Zuckerberg has many stock options. The options give him the right to buy shares for a preset price: 6 cents, to be exact. So on the day of Facebook's IPO, with shares trading as high as $42, Zuckerberg bought 60 million shares for 6 cents each: a great way to net a cool $2.3 billion. The IRS views that money as compensation -- wages -- taxable at ""ordinary"" income tax rates, the same that most of us pay on our regular salaries. This means, for 2012, Zuckerberg will have to pay tax on the $2.3 billion at close to a 50% rate, federal and California taxes combined. The resulting whopping $1 billion to $2 billion tax bill continues a theme, evident in my CNN.com columns on Warren Buffett, Mitt Romney and Phil Mickelson, that wage-earners are highly taxed, but not the wealthy. So should we feel sorry for Zuckerberg? Before we start crying, let's step back a bit. As soon as Zuckerberg exercises any of his stock options he triggers a tax hit. He did just that when he bought the 60 million Facebook shares for 6 cents each. But from that moment forward, Zuckerberg is responsible only for any further rise in the value of the stock, and only when he sells it, and, even then, only at the far more favorable ""capital gains"" rates. Zuckerberg's $2.3 billion payday also came after years of building up value in Facebook, meaning that he was deferring paying taxes for years. This is considered a financial benefit: It is better to pay taxes later rather than sooner, all things being equal. It also bears mention that all things were not equal, because 2012 featured one of the lowest top ordinary tax rates in a century of income taxes, at 35%. Most observers were assuming that rates would increase in 2013, as they in fact did. Zuckerberg cashed out at both a high market price and a low tax rate. One puzzle to tax experts is why Zuckerberg waited so long to cash out, causing that large ordinary income tax hit. The answer likely has several parts. One, Zuckerberg's timing almost certainly played a role in boosting Facebook's stock price at the IPO stage, when it peaked. Two, it is obvious that Zuckerberg had indeed cashed out, in large part, before the IPO. How else did he get to a net worth of more than $11 billion, according to media reports, with a (mere) $2.3 billion payday, roughly cut in half by taxes, further reduced by a falling stock price? At a minimum, buying shares during the IPO allowed Zuckerberg to cash out at the market top, and then to sell off shares -- as he did ""for tax purposes"" -- without any additional tax hit. Indeed, Zuckerberg now holds shares with tax losses built into them, which he can sell to offset capital gains elsewhere in his portfolio. Zuckerberg also has plenty of other shares (and still more options), rising in value as we speak. He is playing what I call Tax Planning 101, simply holding onto assets as they appreciate without paying tax on them. Zuckerberg's tale is really just another story about stock options, the coin of the realm in Silicon Valley. They can be tricky and easy to manipulate. Remember the backdating scandals? Those were about the timing of the exercise of stock options by highly paid executives. After his big stock option exercise, Zuckerberg can walk in the footsteps of hi-tech icons such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. These entrepreneurs built up vast fortunes using stock options with great savvy and then, after they made it to the levels of the super-rich, simply got rid of their ordinary income salaries. Jobs, famously, got paid $1 a year to run Apple. Gates one-upped that by stepping down altogether from his day job as CEO of Microsoft. The really rich leave wages and the W-2s that go with them to the little people, like us. The truly rich do not have to pay any tax once they have their fortunes in hand. They can follow the simple tax planning advice to buy/borrow/die: Buy assets that appreciate in value without producing cash (like shares of Internet stocks), borrow to finance lifestyle, and die to pass on a ""stepped up"" basis to heirs wherein the tax gain miraculously disappears. Zuckerberg now has $11 billion or more with which to play this game. He can live off money borrowed against that huge sum (rest assured, he can get good interest rates), never having to sell any asset at a gain, and never having to get an ""ordinary"" salary again. As is so often the case, the real wizard here is Buffett, who got into the game in the early 1960s, buying up a company, Berkshire Hathaway, that pays no dividends. Buffett was able to amass his fortune, well north of $50 billion, without ever incurring a tax bill nearly as large as Zuckerberg's. We cannot all be Warren Buffetts, of course, but being Mark Zuckerberg isn't too shabby, even with that more than a billion dollar tax bill coming due. Zuckerberg can rest peacefully knowing he won't have to worry about paying taxes again. The rest of us aren't quite so blessed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edward J. McCaffery.","Mark Zuckerberg will pay between $1 billion and $2 billion in taxes for 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Connecticut's governor says he will sign a bill abolishing the death penalty, making it the 17th state to abandon capital punishment. On Wednesday night, lawmakers in Connecticut's House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 86-63. The state Senate approved it last week. ""I'm pleased the House passed the bill, and when it gets to my desk I will sign it,"" said Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat. ""When I sign this bill, Connecticut will join 16 other states and almost every other industrialized nation in moving toward what I believe is better public policy."" Malloy did not say when his office will receive the bill. Connecticut's move continues a national trend toward the abolition of capital punishment. In the past five years, four states have done so. State lawmakers in Connecticut first tried to pass a similar bill in 2009 -- but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. Capital punishment has existed in the state since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972, when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals. The state currently has 11 people on death row. The bill, however, is prospective in nature, meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death. Advocates of a repeal say Connecticut's current law keeps inmates on death row for extended periods of time, who are often engaged in multiple appeals, and presents taxpayers with far larger costs than if the convict were placed in the general prison population serving a life sentence. They also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods, including forensic testing. Opponents of the repeal commonly argue that capital punishment serves as a criminal deterrent, offering justice for victims and their families. In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November. The other non-death penalty states are Alaska, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.","State House of Representatives passes the bill 86-63 .

"Chamonix, France (CNN) -- ""Ever since I was a kid, I had a dream where -- if I ran fast enough on the ground -- I could lift off and start flying."" Ellen Brennan, 26 years old, wakes up. She opens her window to look out across the bustling pines of the Chamonix Valley, to the clustered snow-capped peaks of Mont Blanc. For six years, Ellen has been throwing herself from mountaintops, with only a baggy synthetic suit to stop her from falling like a stone to a certain death. She checks for clouds. Soon she'll set off for the ""Aiguille du Midi"" -- a jagged, vertical needle of granite, where she will face her hardest jump yet. There, she will have just three seconds to speed to 100mph, twist right away from rocks and begin racing over the fearsome Alps below. Or... ""there is no option -- you have to start flying."" Inflight . In 2006, a video surfaced on YouTube that gave the unsuspecting world its first glimpse of modern ""wingsuit"" fliers. They called him ""The Flying Dude,"" and the clip showed him leaping from a helicopter 1000ft above the Swiss skiing resort of Verbier. While many before him had attempted to leap from airplanes and buildings with improvised wings, The Dude's suit was different.. Originally developed by French skydiver Patrick de Gayardon, it worked like a body-size paraglider: creating lift thanks to airfoil-shaped arm flaps. First used to jump from airplanes, thrill-seeking wingsuit fliers had soon relocated to low-flying helicopters, sheer cliffs and mountaintops. In the famed YouTube video, The Dude -- real name Loic Jean-Albert -- tumbles toward the jagged crest of the mountain, then begins to glide, and skirts along the snowy piste, just feet above startled skiiers' heads. The aim of the game had become ""proximity flying"" -- dipping down to within just two or three meters off the ground, to feel a bird-like sensation of clipping tree tops and swooping through gorges. In flight, average speeds top 160kph (100mph). 200kph (124mph) is possible. At flying pace, the tiniest mistake or a gust of valley breeze can destabilize a wingsuit pilot. Landing requires fliers to gain extra distance from the terrain below, before pulling a parachute to slow. It can be just as perilous as scorching feet from the rock face. The sport can count only a small group of skilled skydivers and BASE jumpers among its participants, but almost all can list friends who have died. Around one in ten of them will lose their lives wingsuiting, they say. One in twenty, conservatively. Ellen's story . Ellen Brennan arrived in France in 2009, hoping to learn the language and, eventually, become a nurse in western Africa. When she found Chamonix, she gave it all up. For Brennan, the fledgling sport offers an experience like no other: to glide across historic terrain, more like a bird than a human: . ""It is unique. You know you are seeing that part of the world in a way that no one else has ever seen it before,"" says the 5-ft-1-inch New Yorker. ""When you land you have this feeling of relief and achievement and satisfaction... You have achieved something that no one else has done yet."" Brennan is one of the sport's top competitors. She was the only female flier to be invited to compete in the inaugural World Wingsuit League. In timed races, she shot into the competition's top 8 -- earning herself the title of ""fastest flying woman on earth."" In a sport still in its adolescence, Brennan has become an unlikely pioneer. Having mastered skydiving and BASE jumping soon after her 18th birthday, she turned to wingsuits and has quickly racked up between 500 and 600 suited jumps -- being the first to take off from many of Chamonix's treacherous peaks. But Brennan is far from the stereotypical immune-to-fear adrenaline junkie. She's a realist who admits to often being scared, and will never be too stubborn to make the lonely hike back down the mountain if conditions change for the worse. In the early days, Brennan explains, the number one danger was equipment failure. Now it's not knowing when to say no. The jump . After an exhausting hike to the top of the Aiguille du Midi, getting to the jump point means abseiling down to a narrow rock with barely enough room for a person to stand. As Brennan looks to her left, there is a 120m vertical drop. To her right, the same. ""You have to learn to focus on just your body -- to see only the things you need to see -- otherwise it is too much,"" she says. Wrapped in her pink squirrel suit, Breenan holds her breath and checks the wind and the position of the sun. ""Ideally you see some birds flying and that gives you a good idea of what is going on in the air."" ""And then you go: 'OK, this is good.'"" She dives. For two-and-a-half seconds, the earth rushes straight toward her, faster and faster, on all sides. A feeling of blissful acceptance overtakes her. Her wings inflate and she begins to glide. It is three kilometers to the landing area and for the next two and a half minutes she'll be flying. ""I think everyone dreams about it."" ""And I still have those dreams. But now they involve wingsuits... with things I can do and things that actually happen.""","Ellen Brennan is a 26-year-old ""wingsuit flier""

"(CNN) -- France is an impressive country. And nobody knows it better than the French. The country is surprisingly like the United States (which it taught a thing or two about liberté) in that you don't really ever need to leave. There are sophisticated cities, sunny seashores, snowy mountains and wooded valleys all in one country. Not to mention a lot of cheese. And sex. As well as quite a few other things the French do superlatively well. 1. Cheese . Yes, it's a cliché but France remains the ultimate destination for cheese lovers. General de Gaulle once asked how he was meant to govern a country that produced 246 varieties of cheese. Maybe he was afraid they were living organisms and would start a revolution. Some French cheeses, such as Reblochon, are so smelly and runny they seem to be decomposing. Even mild, hard Mimolette is apparently so scary that last year the United States restricted its import. No one's arguing against the existence of great cheeses around the world -- but no French citizen needs to go much further than the corner shop to find one. 2. Shopping . There's a reason the French invented the word ""bourgeois,"" which now stands in for all things materialistic. Paris department stores stock everything from cheap generic brands to labels so chic you feel the need to dress up before trying them on. The annual sales in January and at the end of June offer unbelievable bargains because by law all stores have to discount prices at the same time and compete for business. At the other end, the French have defended their small, often family-owned neighborhood stores -- boulangeries, boucheries, épiceries -- from being steamrollered by chains. The French also do quirky, one-off boutiques probably better than anyone else. 3. Museums . Paris, of course, is home to perhaps the world's best known museum, the Louvre. But French museum culture spreads much wider afield. The Loire region has what is arguably the most beautiful collection of museums in the world -- its chateaux include the huge Chambord, with a spectacular collection of tapestries, and the impossibly romantic Chenonceau, astride its moat. Even the lesser-known castles can be wonderful -- Chinon, for example, is set above a perfectly preserved old town. You can almost hear Joan of Arc riding up to the gate and offering to kick the English invaders out of France. 4. Trains . French trains are faster than planes. If you want to go from Paris to the Mediterranean coast for lunch, hop on a TGV -- train à grande vitesse, or ""very fast train."" Three hours later, you'll be sipping rosé and gazing at billionaires' yachts while the fliers are still putting in a claim for their lost luggage. TGVs crisscross the country, and the SNCF (French national railways) offers excellent online deals -- first class for just a little more than second. The French might like the good life but it needn't also mean slow. 5. Traffic jams . The average French driver's notion of etiquette is a strong but terrifying one: I'm going that way, and you can't stop me. If going where he or she wants to means causing an accident or total gridlock, that's everyone else's fault, non? The unwillingness to acknowledge any other car on the roads -- the supreme French belief in liberté incarnated in the automobile -- means that on every Saturday in summer, and on national holidays, the whole country is transformed into a huge traffic jam as everyone drives to or from their vacation at exactly the same time. 6. Politeness . Politeness -- the French? Aren't they notoriously abrupt, especially Parisians when addressing non-French-speaking tourists? More accurately, the French have mastered the art of being impeccably polite and startlingly dismissive at the same time. When a posh maître d' raises one eyebrow and oozes ""Monsieur?"" or ""Madame?"" at you, he's simultaneously respecting you and questioning your right to exist. But if you get the hang of French politeness, anything is possible. The golden rule is simple: you should begin every conversation with a bright ""bonjour!"" (""bonsoir!"" in the evening). This doesn't just mean hello. It's recognized French code for, ""Yes, I am here, and I am respecting you by being polite, so you are going to respect me and maybe even be pleasant to me."" All that in one magic word -- and it works. 7. Sexiness . It's hard to pin down sexiness but, for many, ""being French"" is a good working definition. That accent, plus a certain insouciance and joie de vivre (yep, inevitably slipping into French here) make a pretty attractive package in both men and women. And then there's plain sex, which is everywhere in France. Take French films, for example, which almost by law have to include at least two naked breasts and four buttocks. Frenchmen and women know the rules of attraction equally well and rarely stop playing. It's almost a duty to look sexy and classy whenever anyone else is around -- and to leave a memorable impression. 8. Luxury . It's a clever trick. When you think of luxury goods, the word ""French"" slips almost automatically into place. Today, the French talent for luxury has trickled down beyond Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët et Chandon and the rest. Its effects can be felt in the dozens of stylish Parisian cafés with starched-apron waiters, and in the many reasonably priced spa hotels, such as Thalazur (French site only), that can make you feel like a millionaire without charging you accordingly. French light-touch sophistication has been copied worldwide. 9. Customer Service (oh yes) Related to ""politeness,"" but with an important retail distinction. The French have a saying: the customer is king. Yes, and we know what you did to your kings. But behind a sometime façade of surly indifference, French service can be wonderful. That grumpy waiter doesn't hate you, it's just that he's a pro and you're an amateur on his territory. The same goes for the snooty department store saleswoman. Unlike in other countries, such jobs in France can still be lifelong careers, bringing a lifetime's worth of skills. The thing to do is soldier on, smile and inform your server what you want. The French respect people who know what they want, and will do their best to help you get it (as long as it's not just before their lunchtime, of course.) 10. Globalization . France has the world's best policy on globalization -- it spends so much time complaining that foreign invaders are killing off its economy that no one notices how French products are taking over the planet. Have you checked recently who provides your electricity, who owns your transportation system, who feeds your army, even who built your city's public toilets? Especially if you live in Europe, there's a strong chance you'll find a French multinational, such as EDF, Transdev, Sodexo or JCDecaux. That's not to mention the countless French brands on every shopping street in the world. Next time a French person tells you Hollywood is destroying French culture, just point to the nearest public toilet. Stephen Clarke's (@sclarkewriter) books about France include ""A Year in the Merde"" and ""Talk to the Snail: Ten Commandments for Understanding the French.""","The French are impeccably polite -- really .
They're so good at making certain cheeses that the United States has tried to restrict them .
Their traffic jams are world class, but so are their (very fast) trains .
Globalization: simultaneously the bane of France and something it excels at ."
"(CNN) -- Canadian health officials confirmed Wednesday that a resident from Alberta has died from H5N1 avian flu, the first case of the virus in North America. Canada's Health Minister, Rona Ambrose, said the infected individual had recently traveled to Beijing. The Canadian case also is the first case of H5N1 infection ever imported by a traveler into a country where the virus is not present in poultry. No such H5N1 viruses have been detected in people or in animals in the United States. Ambrose stressed that Canadians should not be worried about contracting the virus. Hong Kong on high alert after first human case of H7N9 bird flu . ""As Canada's Health Minister I want to reassure the public this is an isolated case,"" Ambrose said. ""The risk of H5N1 to Canadians is very low. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. It is also important for Canadians to know that this case is not part of the seasonal flu which circulates in Canada every year."" According to the World Health Organization, most avian flu viruses do not cause disease in humans. However, some like H5N1 are zoonotic, which means they can infect humans and cause disease, even death. The H5N1 virus has been primarily found in poultry in parts of Asia and northeastern Africa, where some people have contracted the virus and died. China reports first H10N8 flu death . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the 648 human cases of H5N1 infections that have been detected since 2003 have occurred in people with direct or close contact with poultry. The CDC considers that the health risk to people in the Americas posed by the detection of this one case is very low. The U.S. agency is not recommending that the public take any special actions regarding H5N1 virus in response to the Canadian case.

"(CNN) -- As Washington pundits watch the carnage in Kiev, images of a rapacious Russian President Vladimir Putin, puppet master of Ukraine and of its president, Viktor Yanukovych, stalk the headlines. Putin, the theory goes, is willing to stoke a civil war in order to keep Ukraine from turning to the West. America's obsession with Putin, however, does not explain the complex realities fueling the uprising in Ukraine or the uneasy relationship between Putin and Yanukovych. Long before the uprising began, if Yanukovych had carried out real economic and political reform, he would not have been caught between a long-term promise of a closer relationship with Europe and an immediate hand-out from Moscow and with it the Kremlin's demand that he toughen up and put down the opposition's demonstrations. But Yanukovych, up for re-election in 2015, was not willing to bite the bullet and carry out the measures the West was demanding. Yanukovych tried to play both sides against the middle. ""Yanukovych has played Putin against Europe and the United States quite masterfully. So there is no love lost between them and no trust there,"" says Eugene Rumer, who, until this month, served as U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the CIA. He's now director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace. ""The quality of the discussion here in Washington has really been appalling,"" he adds. ""A lot more has been said about Russia and Russia's role ... but it ignores the fact that Ukraine has had an independent life for the last 25 years, and this crisis is really a domestic political crisis in Ukraine. Not that the Russians haven't helped, but it is a Ukrainian domestic political crisis."" Opinion: Can Ukraine sustain fragile peace? Putin does have interests in Ukraine: a desire to keep NATO and U.S. military bases out, ties with Ukrainian aircraft and shipbuilding enterprises closely linked with Russia's military-industrial complex, his own Black Sea Fleet, in Ukraine's port of Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula, as well as ensuring unimpeded transit of natural gas to Europe. What's more, Harvard University's Simon Saradzhyan says, Putin and his advisers essentially see Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians as one people and ""therefore, seek to draw Ukraine into Moscow's orbit."" ""The size of Ukraine's population and, to a less extent, of its economy would make it a valuable asset in the Eurasian Union, which Putin is building in the post-Soviet landscape."" Yanukovych, however, ""has never been Russia's man,"" says Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""I think it's a myth. He's been a very difficult partner for Russia, a very unreliable partner, someone who let the Russians down on many occasions. Someone absolutely not to be trusted."" Yanukovych's only goal is to stay in power and to protect his wealth and the wealth of his family, says Trenin. ""With Yanukovych vacillating between Russia and Europe and always having his own private interests in mind, it's mind-boggling. So the Russians have long given up on Yanukovych."" Putin's envoy to Kiev refused to sign the latest truce between Yanukovych and the opposition, in which they agreed on early elections and a return to a constitution that would shift more power from the president to the Parliament. ""I think the Kremlin feels cold-shouldered,"" Trenin says. ""I think it feels betrayed by Yanukovych. Betrayed may be too strong a word, but certainly Yanukovych has managed to play the Europeans off the Russians."" Putin is not rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect of an epic battle with the West over Ukraine. In fact, says Carnegie's Andrew Weiss, who worked on policy toward the region in the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations, ""I think if you're sitting in the Kremlin the prospect of a Yugoslav scenario in Ukraine is quite scary."" ""As much as the political narrative in Washington and the West is that Putin, the puppet master, has guided all of this,"" he says, ""I think there's reason to believe that he's more worried and more cautious about how dangerous this is. He's set a policy framework which, obviously, has made the situation worse but at the same time, the really scary stuff that's out there as possibilities, I think, scares the Kremlin no less than it scares Europeans and Americans."" Weiss calls it a ""four-way political fiasco"" involving the Ukrainians, the Europeans, the Russians and the United States, where ""people didn't want to get engaged in the early stages of the conflict and events were quickly hijacked by politicians and self-interested actors on the ground."" The Partnership agreement, in which the European Union offered Ukraine eventual economic and political cooperation, was too long-term to solve Ukraine's immediate financial problems. Russia, angered by the move, stepped in to offer $15 billion. In the anti-Putin narrative, that is depicted as ""blackmail,"" but if the Russian President, angered by Yanukovych's deal with the opposition, does not follow through with aid for Ukraine, then the ball will be back in the court of the United States and Europe, ""who are not willing to dig deep in their pockets like the Kremlin has,"" Weiss says. The Yanukovych government must pay back more than $15 billion in debt payments to creditors over the next two years. And without Russia's money, the U.S. and the EU would be forced to come up with some form of emergency support. ""I don't believe there's any receptivity in Brussels or Washington to do a major financial bailout for the Ukrainian government,"" Weiss says, ""which has a terrible track record on economic reform, a completely unsustainable currency peg, and its long track record of cozy deals for tycoons."" Clan struggles among Ukraine's oligarchs, social and political crisis, regional differences between western and eastern parts of the country -- Ukraine's home-grown problems are deepening, even without meddling by Vladimir Putin. ""What we see in Ukraine is, unfortunately, in the 20 years of independence, Ukrainian leaders have done little or nothing to create a single Ukrainian nation,"" says Trenin, ""and the divisions within Ukraine have persisted and they have also become much more pronounced in the last few months."" Keeping Ukraine together is a priority for the Obama administration but, says Trenin, it's also a Russian policy priority. ""Despite what you may hear from various Russian figures,"" he says, ""it's very much Mr. Putin's preference, in fact, priority, that Ukraine stays in one piece. Otherwise, a civil war very close to home, next door, essentially, could be too dangerous for Russia itself."" Russia would fight to protect the ethnic Russian population and Moscow's base in Crimea, says Harvard's Saradzhyna, quoting a senior Russian government official who told the Financial Times, ""If Ukraine breaks apart, it will trigger a war. ... They will lose Crimea first (because) we will go in and protect (it), just as we did in Georgia."" Tenin isn't so sure. ""I don't think the Russians are about to invade Crimea,"" he says. ""What I think is more likely is that, in the future, the various regions of Ukraine will present their own claims and may go in different directions on a number of issues. And attempts by Kiev to clamp down on those autonomous or regionalist tendencies could lead to a new spike in tensions in Ukraine."" Kiev is burning, and Ukraine is unraveling. Yanukovych -- or the leader of a new government -- will have to find a new way to keep the country together. Vladimir Putin will not simply stand by and watch it happen, but he is not the puppet master of Yanukovych -- or of Ukraine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jill Dougherty.","Jill Dougherty: The popular image is that Putin is manipulating the Ukraine crisis .
She says reality is that Yanukovych is to blame for avoiding economic, political reform .

"(CNN) -- Federal support for renewable power helped the United States reclaim from China the title of the world's biggest investor in clean energy, researchers for the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts reported Wednesday. The $48 billion in U.S. private investment in technology such as wind turbines and solar panels in 2011 edged out China's $45.5 billion, Pew researchers found in a new study. Worldwide, investors put $263 billion into renewable energy projects last year -- a 6.5% increase over 2010 -- and the cost of producing electricity from solar power was cut in half, the study found. But the U.S. gains have been boosted by government incentives, including provisions of the 2009 economic stimulus package, that are due to disappear within two years, said Phyllis Cuttino, director of Pew's clean energy programs. ""Those countries that have long-term policies in place are the ones that have had consistent growth,"" Cuttino told CNN. ""And we don't have that."" And while U.S. investors have been ponying up while the incentives are in place, much of that money is going into projects overseas -- and America is importing the resulting products. ""The United States is, frankly, missing an opportunity if we do not manufacture and export to these counties with growing middle classes who are going to be purchasing these products,"" Cuttino said. Solar, wind, biomass and small-scale hydroelectric projects installed worldwide had the capability to produce about 565 billion watts, or 565 gigawatts, of electricity in 2011, the report found. That's about 10 percent of the worldwide total, and roughly enough to reduce carbon emissions most scientists blame for a warming climate by between 3% to 6%, according to analysts at the Breakthrough Institute, a California-based think tank that concentrates on energy and the environment. In the United States, renewables other than hydroelectric provide about 4.7% of U.S. generating capacity, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Germany saw the third-largest investment in alternative energy with nearly $31 billion in 2011, even though that figure was down 5% from 2010, the Pew report found. The Germans added more than 7 gigawatts of solar energy capacity in 2011, while Italian investments grew by nearly 40% to $28 billion. Italy added about 8 gigawatts of solar energy, mostly in small-scale projects. And India saw a 54 percent increase in support for clean energy. Indian projects grew to $10.2 billion, adding 2.8 gigawatts in wind power. Germany and China have boosted their green energy sector ""through consistent policies,"" by setting targets for new generating capacity, the report said. ""What that tells investors is, 'Go there -- they're in it for the long term,'"" Cuttino said. ""They're not going to let that expire in 2013."" Meanwhile, no new U.S. wind projects have been commissioned for 2014, she said. The United States is also seeing a boom in cheap natural gas, which produces fewer carbon emissions than coal or oil. And in the past year, the collapse of the solar energy firm Solyndra has cast a pall over alternative energy funding in the United States. Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after receiving more than $535 million in federal loan guarantees, putting more than 1,000 people out of work. President Barack Obama's Republican opposition has attacked the loan-guarantee program as ""crony capitalism,"" accusing Solyndra of receiving special treatment because a key investor was an Obama fundraiser, but supporters say the company was undermined by the explosive growth of China's solar industry. Cuttino said companies are going to fail as the renewable power industry grows, comparing it to the early years of the automobile industry. ""There were over 100 companies trying to make cars at the turn of the century,"" she said. ""And now we basically have three.""","Government incentives boost U.S. investment in green power, Pew says .
But many of those incentives will expire in the next two years .

""Every girl who has read it says, 'That was me in high school, or that was me in seventh grade,'"" Holly Bario, DreamWorks president of production, tells EW. ""It reminded all of us of our own sort of awkwardness, or family dysfunction."" The studio was drawn to the teenage love story for the same reason as its legions of fans.

Set in 1986, and following one school year in Omaha, the novel follows the tentative romance of two 16-year-olds: Eleanor, a somewhat heavy girl overwhelmed by insecurities and trying to survive an abusive household, and Park, the quiet, half-Korean kid who also doesn't feel like he fits in but finds refuge in music and comic books. After its publication in February 2013, the book spent 12 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and has inspired a passionate, devoted following.

"LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. A Banksy painting of the British House of Commons at England's Bristol museum. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. CNN's Max Foster got a preview of his largest project to date. The artist's anonymity gained him notoriety and he became one of the art world's biggest names with his works selling at auction for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art.  See pictures from Banksy's exhibition » . ""I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs"" Banksy, who is thought to be from Bristol, said about the museum. He filled three stories of the building with his art in 36 hours under tight security, as only a few museum staff were aware of the shows' imminent arrival. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures. In one of the paintings, a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting's frame, perhaps taking a break from posing? Another piece, which at first glance, looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue, is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item. Perhaps the most controversial, yet equally light-hearted piece, is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons, filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly ""ministerial."" ""You paint a hundred chimpanzees and they call you a guerilla artist,"" Banksy said. While one of the more poignant installations is that of Tweety, the Warner Bros. animated character famous for his upbeat personality and energy, looking old and life-less. ""This show is my vision of the future,"" the artist said . Banksy is unlikely to show up at the exhibition as he attempts to retain his anonymity. But while we may never know his identity, with this latest show, Banksy has definitely shown yet another facet of his personality.

"(CNN) -- Chris Brown is a free man, for now. The troubled singer was released from a Los Angeles County jail just after midnight Monday, a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department representative confirmed to CNN. Brown had been in jail since March. He was ordered to be held after being expelled from a court-ordered rehabilitation facility. He had been ejected from the facility for violating the rules. In May, Brown admitted to violating his probation for his arrest last year for an alleged assault in Washington. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin sentenced Brown to serve 365 days in jail for the admitted probation violation, and the singer was given credit for serving 234 days because of the rehab and jail time. The case against Brown in Washington, in which he and his bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were accused of beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October, is still pending. Brown has been charged with misdemeanor assault.","The singer was released from a Los Angeles County jail early Monday .

"(CNN) -- A large part of northern and central Nigeria is now at the mercy of intensified attacks by Boko Haram, and the group seems to be embarking on a new phase of its campaign against the Nigerian state -- piling further pressure on the government of President Goodluck Jonathan. The last four days have seen devastating bomb attacks in Jos, in central Nigeria, as well as a suicide bombing in Kano - the largest city in the north. Two more villages in the state of Borno, Boko Haram's stronghold in the northeast, came under attack, with at least 30 civilians killed. There have also been two bomb attacks in the federal capital, Abuja, in the last five weeks. What alarms analysts is the way Boko Haram and its supporters are able to carry out multiple attacks on targets far apart, all within days of each other. Jos and Kano are more than 300 miles from Borno. The double car-bomb attack against a market in Jos on Tuesday, which killed 118 people, according to the National Emergency Management Agency, is typical of its strategy beyond Borno: to strike soft targets in places where sectarian tensions are already high, with massive force. The use of two bombs some 30 minutes apart copied an al Qaeda tactic. Jacob Zenn, a long-time observer of Boko Haram, says its aim is likely to stretch Nigeria's beleaguered security forces, possibly by combining with another Islamic militant group: Ansaru. ""In 2012, one of Boko Haram's goals was to launch attacks in the Middle Belt and southern Nigeria via the Ansaru networks - in order to spread Nigerian forces thin in Borno,"" Zenn told CNN. ""We may be seeing a similar tactic employed now."" Zenn says Ansaru networks carried out more than 15 bombings in Jos, Kaduna and Abuja between 2010 and 2012, even though the attacks were attributed to Boko Haram. Those networks, he believes, have now been reactivated. Zenn, an analyst at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington, says Boko Haram recruits who have trained in Borno - disaffected young Muslims from across the Middle Belt region - may be returning home to ""carry out attacks against their enemies -- whether rival Christians or the government."" John Campbell, a former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria and now a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, agrees that Ansaru seems to be reappearing but adds that little is known about the group and its leadership. What is known is that Boko Haram and Ansaru have plenty of money to recruit and finance operatives -- through bank robberies and kidnappings. Campbell says Boko Haram has become adept at bank robberies and stealing weapons from government armories. Zenn believes Ansaru's connections to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) have helped fill its coffers. In 2012 it kidnapped a French engineer, Francis Collomp. AQIM also held four French hostages - who were freed in late 2013 - reportedly for a ransom payment of $27 million. A few weeks later Collomp escaped, or perhaps was allowed to escape, provoking speculation that Ansaru had been in on the deal and shared the ransom money. Last year, Zenn says, Ansaru received part of a $3 million ransom paid to secure the release of a French family kidnapped by Boko Haram in northern Cameroon. The challenge for the Nigerian security forces grows by the day. According to locals quoted in the Nigerian media, Boko Haram fighters were able to spend several hours unchallenged looting and killing in the village of Alagano early Wednesday. The village is only a few miles from the school where the girls were abducted in April, and supposedly in an area where there is a heightened military presence. One option to squeeze Boko Haram would be better military coordination with neighboring states, where the group takes refuge and resupplies itself. On Tuesday, President Jonathan announced plans to bolster a Joint Task Force - with a battalion each from Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. But Zenn says that ""thus far all initiatives of this sort have absolutely flunked. It's supposed to exist already in the Multinational Joint Task Force but, because of language issues, mistrust and lack of funding, doesn't really work."" There is also a larger question looming in a country that has had military rule for more than half its life as an independent state. Nigeria has had civilian rule since 1999, but Zenn says there is now a risk that ""the still less than 20-year old democracy experiment in Nigeria may be coming to an end, since there are increasing reports of military defections and mutinies."" ""With the potential for instability ahead of the elections [due in February next year], the military may step in in one way or another,"" he adds. Campbell says the surprise is that the military hasn't moved before now, given the deteriorating situation. But he says it is a much smaller and weaker organization than 10 or 15 years ago; the top brass has been thoroughly politicized and is close to the Presidency. The nightmare scenario, he says, is a mutiny by junior officers. But Campbell cautions that the Nigerian military is little understood by outsiders, which incidentally makes foreign assistance to improve its performance more difficult to deliver. There is another larger danger for Nigeria stoked by the Boko Haram campaign: a version of ethnic cleansing. Thousands of Christians have already fled areas like Gwoza in Borno, and Campbell says that sectarian divisions and violence have divided the city of Jos into predominantly Muslim and Christian districts. After Tuesday's bombings, which were likely calculated to inflame religious tension, Christian youths began setting up roadblocks around their neighborhoods. The Kano attack was also in a Christian neighborhood. In another sign that sectarian tensions are spreading, some Christian groups have demanded that the next Governor of Lagos - the country's commercial capital and the city least prone to religious conflict - be a Christian. For now, Campbell says, Boko Haram has the wind in its sails, after a series of devastating attacks in recent months that have humiliated the government and military. The abduction of the schoolgirls has brought it international notoriety and attention. Far from seizing the opportunity to outline demands for greater autonomy and resources for northern Nigeria, Boko Haram seems set on two goals: the destruction of the Nigerian state and what it -- and it alone -- sees as creating God's Kingdom on Earth.","Boko Haram seems intent on destroying Nigeria .
Attacks have shown it can coordinate operations .

"(CNN) -- All the talk of phone-hacking this summer has brought the thorny issue of mobile device security to the forefront of the news agenda. But even the most scurrilous hack of Fleet Street would be amazed at the talents of the some of the dedicated hackers of cyberspace, who are now targeting mobile devices with great audacity. iPhones, iPads, BlackBerrys, Windows 7 phones and Android users routinely use shared networks in public places, which leaves them all susceptible to infiltration. Unless these networks have been properly secured, freely available browser add-ons and apps can help hackers seize control of personal data at the touch of a button. Meanwhile so-called ""drive-by download"" attacks lie invisibly in wait on web-pages or in malicious emails then compromise the machine of anyone unfortunate enough to visit. It means that the person using a laptop in a coffee shop may look like they are just checking their Facebook page, but they might just as easily be accessing yours. They could also be flicking through your contacts book, copying your email, or seizing your online banking details. At 44Con, a recent security conference in London, a talk by Josh Pennell, the founder of the computer security consultancy IOActive, carried the teaser: ""They watch you sleep, they watch you work, they hold all your personal and professional data, and they sacrifice security for performance and usability. Your mobile devices present attackers with a 24/7 threat surface (and don't think the hackers haven't noticed)."" None of the most popular devices are immune. In 2009, for instance, a hack resulted in 145,000 BlackBerry users having their email forwarded to servers in the United Arab Emirates. Pennell also described an attack on the network of an airport in Israel, which threatened anyone using Bluetooth in the terminal. Pennell showed a battery charger that had been modified to serve as a hacking device, and even spoke of an attack to iPhone and iPad users that came through malicious coding attached to bonus levels of Angry Birds. According to a recent report, the success of Google's Android operating system has resulted in a 400% increase in Android-specific malware since 2010. Furthermore a commonly distributed app for Android called FaceNiff actually makes hacking possible through the handset itself. After a simple download, a FaceNiff user can hijack any number of social media profiles over a Wi-Fi connection in a process that takes less than two minutes. ""Your Facebook or YouTube account could be hijacked with someone using little more than a cheap second-hand phone from eBay,"" said information security professional Steve Lord. For all the exceptional sophistication of attacks on mobile devices, however, sometimes the greatest risks to data leakage remain the most prosaic. ""We've seen executives leave laptops on buses or in the back of taxis,"" said Matt Adams, a manager in Deloitte's security and resilience team. ""What they're doing now is potentially leaving their mobile device behind, and those devices now can carry just as much data as the laptop did."" Adams advises businesses on the specific challenges encountered when an executive buys a smart phone or an iPad and begins using it for business as well as pleasure. Companies will usually have tightly managed internal networks, with firewalls, encryption, etc. for ensuring security of their data. But once executives begin using their own device, and accessing networks elsewhere, the threats multiply significantly. A recent YouGov study, for instance, found that only around 6% of mobile devices have even basic anti-virus software installed. ""Typically users haven't learned to regard their mobile devices as the same risk,"" Adams said. In addition to the simple education of users, Adams advises businesses to develop clear policies governing user-owned devices to avoid difficult confrontations with staff if a device is lost, stolen or compromised. ""If users use a device that contains their personal phone book and treasured photos, and that device also contains sensitive business data, who gets the call on whether the whole of that device is erased?"" he said. ""That's quite a tricky question in hindsight unless you've addressed it."" Security experts have touted the idea of ""split personality"" phones, with an inbuilt division between personal and business data. Adams also ran through the pros and cons of mobile device management software, such as Mobile Iron, which allow businesses to keep a permanent inventory and track their registered handsets. Such systems can manage passwords and encryptions, and even cut down on expenses by finding the best roaming charges for devices overseas. However some employees may feel that their privacy is jeopardized by software that essentially tracks their movement across the globe. ""It is a significant but manageable problem,"" said Adams, adding that businesses are slowly beginning to talk more seriously about the key issues. ""I just hope we don't see too many major security breaches caused by a failure to manage or use mobile devices properly.""","Drive-by download attacks can come from mallicious emails or web pages .

"(CNN) -- The first American to orbit the Earth has undergone successful heart surgery. Former Sen. John Glenn, 92, had a heart valve replaced last month at the Cleveland Clinic, according to Hank Wilson, director of communications for the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. ""He's in great shape,"" and is at home in Columbus, Ohio, recovering, Wilson said. Glenn, piloting the Mercury space capsule dubbed Friendship 7, became the first American to orbit Earth on February 20, 1962, circling the planet three times in just under five hours. He is the last surviving of the original seven U.S. astronauts from Project Mercury. In 1998, at age 77, he flew a nine-day mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person to travel in space. Glenn, a Democrat, served as a U.S. senator from 1974 until 1999, and ran for president in 1984.","The first American to orbit the earth has undergone successful heart surgery.

"New York (CNN) -- Social media lit up Wednesday with reactions to Vice President Joe Biden's off-the-cuff remarks about fending off a would-be home intruder. But unlike most debates about gun control, on which Biden is leading a White House task force, the online commentary largely centered on the advice he apparently once gave his wife. ""I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem just walk out on the balcony here ... put that double-barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house,"" Biden said during an online question-and-answer session Tuesday. His comments were likely intended to underscore the position that shotguns were sufficient for self-defense, rather than high-capacity or semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15. But they also unleashed a torrent of online reaction after conjuring up the image of Jill Biden hypothetically firing off rounds outside the vice president's home in Delaware. ""So when the cops come to arrest me for shooting off the porch, I can tell 'em Joe said it's ok,"" wrote one online user. ""The scariest part about his whole statement is that he is encouraging people to blindly fire off rounds at unknown noises and in unknown directions,"" said another. NRA ramps up campaign against proposed gun control measures . The Obama administration has called on Congress to reinstate an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, to restrict ammunition magazines to no more than 10 rounds, and to expand background checks to anyone buying a gun. But the White House has met stiff opposition from congressional Republicans and the National Rifle Association, a powerful lobby group that opposes new regulations governing firearms. ""You don't need an AR-15,"" said Biden in the online forum. ""It's harder to aim. It's harder to use. And, in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun."" Online commentary was mixed in response. ""An AR-15 (is) easier to shoot than a shotgun, there's less recoil in a .223 than a 12 gauge,"" wrote one online user. ""A shotgun is not for everybody. Even in smaller (gauges), the recoil is too much for many people, and buckshot isn't nearly as precise as a rifle shot,"" wrote another. Obama: Overcoming violence hard, but can be done . Others hailed the benefits of a shotgun because ""it doesn't need to be aimed precisely"" and that ""one or two shots should do the trick."" ""It's safer than pistols re: accidents at home, especially involving children,"" wrote one user. ""Unfortunately, there are too many GUN NUTS out there w/vivid imaginations... who lie awake at night thinking up imaginary dangers."" In the online chat, Biden said he does not favor constitutional amendments to adjust the Second Amendment, which is cited by both proponents of and those opposed to new gun regulations. But, he said, the Constitution ""does allow the government to conclude that there are certain types of weapons that no one can legally own."" The limits are imposed for ""public safety,"" Biden said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday the nation needs to take sensible, common sense action to try to reduce ""the scourge of gun violence in this country."" He declined to further comment on Biden's remarks, though he added that the vice president is a law-abiding gun owner who has both a 12-gauge and 20-gauge shotgun locked up in a safe in his Delaware home. The Obama administration has been pressing for gun reforms since the December massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where an AR-15-wielding gunman killed six adults and 20 children between the ages of 6 and 7.

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, the live Web broadcast of perhaps the world's most prestigious science fiction awards ended up in the Twilight Zone. Blame it on an attack by 'bots. The Hugo Awards were being streamed live on video site Ustream when, at 10:43 p.m. ET, the feed went dark during an acceptance speech by fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. The reason? Ustream says automated software designed to detect the unauthorized posting of copyrighted material was triggered when, before Gaiman's speech, the ceremony showed clips of ""The Doctor's Wife,"" an episode of the popular sci-fi series ""Doctor Who,"" that Gaiman penned. Instead of Gaiman, text reading ""Worldcon banned due to copyright infringement"" appeared. Worldcon is the conference at which the awards are held. ""Our editorial team and content monitors almost immediately noticed a flood of livid Twitter messages about the ban and attempted to restore the broadcast,"" Brad Hunstable, CEO and founder of Ustream, wrote on the site's blog. ""Unfortunately, we were not able to lift the ban before the broadcast ended. We had many unhappy viewers as a result, and for that I am truly sorry."" The third-party system, Vobile, is used by video sites to detect unauthorized posts. The Hugo Awards had permission to air the clips but apparently had not notified Ustream. Hunstable acknowledged that his site's system for doing so wasn't as clear as it should be. He said the automated system has been suspended until Ustream is able to ""better balance the needs of broadcasters, viewers, and copyright holders."" ""Ustream is committed to promoting Internet freedom, and we will strive to continually improve our service to provide the best, legal viewing experience possible,"" he wrote. Perhaps as a boon to disappointed fans, Gaiman, a prolific Twitter user with more than 1.7 million followers, shared a link Monday to his video acceptance speech from when he won the SFX Award for screenwriting in February. ""Copyright bots switched off the Hugo Award stream last night,"" he wrote. Named after Hugo Gernsback, the editor of groundbreaking sci-fi magazine Amazing Stories, the Hugos (originally the Science Fiction Achievement Awards) have been awarded annually for science fiction and fantasy writing since 1953. Gaiman, whose ""Doctor Who"" episode explored the doctor's most longstanding relationship in an unprecedented way, is known for the groundbreaking ""The Sandman"" graphic novel series and books like ""Neverwhere,"" ""American Gods"" and ""Coraline,"" which was turned into an Academy Award-nominated animated film in 2009.","Livestream of Hugo Awards was cut short by copyright-protection software .

"(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius faced another day of relentless cross-examination Friday as the prosecution challenged his account of the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of Steenkamp, whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria, South Africa. His questions again sought to undermine Pistorius' reliability and credibility and to portray the Olympic athlete as someone who was inventing his version of events and ""tailoring"" evidence to suit his story. As Nel turned once again to the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, he repeatedly challenged Pistorius over his actions in the moments leading up to Steenkamp's death. The prosecution's argument is that Pistorius shot Steenkamp intentionally after a heated argument. Pistorius does not deny shooting her but insists that he mistook her for an intruder. Pistorius said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired. ""I didn't intend to shoot. My firearm was pointed at the door because that's where I believed that somebody was,"" he said. ""When I heard a noise, I didn't have to think, and I fired -- I fired my weapon. It was an accident."" Nel, known in South African legal circles for his bulldog-like approach to cross-examination, responded to Pistorius' testimony almost with scorn. ""Your version is so improbable that nobody would ever think that it was reasonably, possibly true,"" he said. Nel then hammered Pistorius on whether he had known Steenkamp was in the toilet when he fired. ""You knew Reeva was behind the door, and you shot at her,"" Nel said more than once. ""That's not true,"" Pistorius replied in a low tone. That dramatic moment was when Nel asked for the trial to be adjourned until Monday morning. Prosecutor: You wanted to shoot . Pistorius earlier denied being ""ready to shoot"" as he made his way to the bathroom where he says he heard what he thought was an intruder. But he agreed that he had taken off the safety catch so he could fire if needed. ""I didn't want to take anybody's life. I screamed for the intruders to get out of my home,"" he said. ""You wanted to shoot,"" contended Nel, who on Thursday sought to build a picture of Pistorius as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns. Pistorius replied that there is a ""massive difference"" between being ready for something and wanting to do it. Asked by the prosecutor why he approached the apparent threat rather than seeking to move out of harm's way, the athlete said it was his in his nature to respond that way. ""I wanted to put myself between the perceived danger and Reeva,"" he said. ""I wish I did all these other things put to me."" Nel also argued that it was ""not possible"" that Steenkamp would not have responded when Pistorius screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house, as he has said happened. Steenkamp was only 3 meters from Pistorius at the time, behind the toilet door, the prosecutor said. ""She would've been terrified, but I don't think that would've led her to call out,"" Pistorius said, arguing that Steenkamp would have assumed the danger was getting closer. ""She wasn't scared of anything except you. She wasn't scared of an intruder. She was scared of you,"" replied Nel. The prosecutor also pressed Pistorius over whether he heard a woman screaming during the shots he fired, as some witnesses have said they heard. Pistorius said he did not. Pistorius: I was fixated on the threat . As Nel went through the events leading up to the point of the shooting, Pistorius said that after getting up to close a balcony door and move fans inside, he heard the bathroom window sliding open and slamming into the frame. Nel repeatedly asked him why he hadn't at that point asked Steenkamp whether she too had heard the noise. Pistorius replied that he didn't because he was sure about what he had heard. He said he whispered to Steenkamp to get down and call police. Nel asked whether he had waited for a response, as he said would have been reasonable, pointing out that his ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor had testified he had done that on a previous occasion when he'd heard a noise. ""I never waited for a response. ... My whole body was fixated on the threat,"" Pistorius answered. Nel's questions then focused on the position of certain items in the bedroom, including a duvet, the fans and a pair of jeans, all of which Pistorius says were moved by police. Nel sought to argue that they do not support Pistorius' version of events. At one point, the judge reprimanded Nel for calling Pistorius a liar and told him to mind his language. More than once, Nel suggested that Pistorius had difficulty remembering what happened because he had made things up. Pistorius became emotional as the cross-examination continued, prompting Nel to ask him why. ""This is the night I lost the person that I cared about. I don't know why people don't understand that,"" Pistorius responded. As he broke down in tears, the judge ordered a short break to allow him time to gather himself. Nel has previously accused Pistorius of becoming emotional when the questions get difficult. Pistorius quizzed about mistakes . During cross-examination earlier Friday, Pistorius made mistakes in answering questions about repair work and his alarm system. He attributed the mistakes to fatigue, prompting Nel to ask whether he was too tired to continue in the stand. Pistorius, becoming emotional, replied, ""I don't need time. I am tired; that's not going to change."" ""With respect, Mr. Pistorius, I'm not convinced. ... I think you're trying to cover up for lies,"" Nel said. After Judge Thokozile Masipa pressed Pistorius on the question, the athlete said he wasn't making mistakes because he was tired -- prompting Nel to ask why, in that case, he was making mistakes. A little later, Nel made a mistake while questioning Pistorius, who pointed it out. The prosecutor said Pistorius wasn't too tired to highlight the mistakes the prosecutor himself was making in his questioning. Nel also focused on security on the gated Silverwoods estate where Pistorius lived, pointing out that despite his claimed fear of burglary, the athlete left his cars outside and had not immediately fixed a broken window in his house. Pistorius' message exchanges with Steenkamp . A day earlier, the athlete denied that he acted selfishly toward Steenkamp. In a bid to paint their relationship as rocky, he ripped apart message exchanges between the couple Thursday. Nel also sought to paint him as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend's declaration of love. But Pistorius said he preferred to talk to his girlfriend over the phone rather than messaging. He acknowledged he never got a chance to tell her that he loved her. ""Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius,"" Nel said. The runner has admitted to the killing but said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the toilet door and killed her. The prosecution alleges that Pistorius killed his girlfriend after they argued. Several witnesses have testified to hearing a man's shouts coming from the house, although they have also spoken of the terrified screams of a woman leading up to and during a volley of shots. The trial has gripped South Africa, where Pistorius is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity. His disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby, but he went on to achieve global fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" winning numerous Paralympic gold medals on the steel blades fitted to his prostheses. Only those in the courtroom can see Pistorius because he has chosen not to testify on camera. His testimony can be heard on an audio feed. The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Emily Smith contributed to this report.","Oscar Pistorius denies knowing that Reeva Steenkamp was behind door when he fired .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The judge who sentenced Saddam Hussein to death has condemned the manner in which the notorious dictator was executed. Saddam Hussein was hanged after being found guilty for his role in the killing of 148 people in Dujail. ""It was uncivilized and backward,"" said Chief Judge Raouf Abdul Rahman, who spoke to reporters on Tuesday as they awaited the start of the latest trial of ex-regime members. Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, was hanged for his role in the killings of 148 people in Dujail, a mostly Shiite town north of Baghdad, after a 1982 attempt to assassinate the then-Iraqi leader. The hanging -- which took place as hostilities between Sunnis and Shiites were erupting -- occurred December 30, 2006, when Sunnis began celebrating the religious holiday Eid al-Adha. A cell phone video showedHussein being taunted by Shiites and included bitter exchanges between Hussein and Shiite witnesses. There were shouts of praise for Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose father was believed to have been murdered by Hussein's regime. After Hussein was hanged, Shiite witnesses danced around his body, chanting celebratory slogans. ""In Iraqi law, there are no public executions,"" Abdul Rahman said. ""Eid is a time of love, tranquility and reconciliation, not a time for executions."" None of the Iraqi government's top officials attended the execution and Hussein was buried in Awja, near Tikrit, in the same cemetery as his sons Uday and Qusay. His execution was condemned at the time, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a leading advocate of Hussein's overthrow, saying its manner was ""completely wrong."" The Vatican said the killing of the guilty was not a route to justice or reconciliation, while Russia warned that it would worsen the situation in the country. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- India has summoned a senior U.S. diplomat over reports the United States authorized its National Security Agency to spy on the ruling party, the BJP, an official said Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. According to the latest disclosures by NSA leaker Edward Snowden published by the Washington Post on Monday, the NSA obtained legal authorization to spy on the BJP in 2010, when it was the opposition party. The BJP, or Bharatiya Janata Party, came to national power in May in an electoral landslide. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved a broad certification for spying abroad in 2010, which included a list of 193 countries to concentrate on, the Post reported. The Post reported that the list was a recommendation and that the agency was not required to spy on all of them. The approval permitted the NSA to intercept communications through U.S. companies related to targets on the list, the report said. Also on the list were banks and international agencies such as the World Bank Group and the European Union. The BJP was one of six political organizations recommended for observation. The list also included the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the Pakistan Peoples Party. At present, there's no full-time U.S. ambassador in New Delhi.

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey mayor is compelling gun manufacturers bidding for gun and ammunition contracts with the city police to answer questions on gun safety in what is believed to be the first such move in the nation. Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said Wednesday that answering questions about social responsibility is now part of the bidding process. The revised bid specifications include six questions intended to gauge the gun manufacturer's responsibility to public safety, according to city documents. The answers will impact the firm's competitiveness, Fulop said. Refusal to answer the questions will deem their proposals incomplete. The six questions are: ""What do you do to combat illegal gun trafficking and illegal gun crime? Do you manufacturer and sell assault weapons for civilian use? Do you agree not to sell certain models of firearms for civilian use? Are you requiring your dealers to conduct background checks? Do you fund research related to gun violence and smart gun technology? Will you commit to prohibiting your brand name from being used in violent video games?"" An admitted gun control advocate who also happens to have military background, Fulop said he hopes to make Jersey City a national example for other cities. Jersey City is believed to be the first in the country with such a requirement, the mayor said. Fulop said social responsibility requirements exist for most industries and that the gun manufacturers should not be exempt. As expected, the initiative has its detractors. ""It is inappropriate to politicize the selection of firearms for law enforcement,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a Connecticut-based firearms trade association. Keane said it is dangerous to select firearms for law enforcement on anything other than what is best for police officers. The bid winner would supply rifles, handguns and ammunition to the Jersey City police department, which employs nearly 800 officers, according Bob McHugh, a Jersey City fire and police spokesman. A pro-gun control organization in Jersey City known as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America praised the move, according to New Jersey chapter leader Mandi Perlmutter. ""If other mayors were to use their purchasing power, it would force the manufacturers to change how they do business,"" she said. On Saturday, Fulop will speak at an event called ""No more silence"" to honor the one year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in which 20 students and six staff members died. The event is sponsored by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and other organizations.

"(CNN) -- Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder in the death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a special prosecutor announced Wednesday. Zimmerman, 28, who had been in hiding, turned himself in, his new lawyer told CNN legal analyst Mark NeJame. The suspect was transported Wednesday evening to the Seminole County Criminal Justice Center, police said. Zimmerman got out of a black SUV and was escorted into the center. He wore a plaid shirt, with a black cloth draped over his head. A hearing in the case is expected Thursday, according to authorities and Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara. Sheriff Donald F. Eslinger said officials would determine whether Zimmerman would be held in the general inmate population. What happens next . Charges against Zimmerman were announced in Jacksonville by prosecutor Angela Corey, who has said her job was ""to find out the full truth"" about the February 26 incident in Sanford. ""It is the search for justice for Trayvon that has brought us to this moment,"" Corey told reporters. ""We did not come to this decision lightly."" What do you think about the decision to charge Zimmerman? Zimmerman's claim of self-defense failed to quell an uproar about the decision by Sanford police not to initially charge him and about Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows the use of deadly force by anyone who feels a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. The case also sparked a nationwide debate about race and racial profiling. Martin's parents spoke after Corey's announcement. ""We simply wanted an arrest; we wanted nothing more, nothing less,"" said Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. ""We just wanted an arrest, and we got it and I say thank you, thank you Lord, thank you Jesus."" Martin's father, Tracy, said, ""we will continue to walk by faith, we will continue to hold hands on this journey. White, black, Hispanic, Latino.... We will march until the right thing is done."" George Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that the family was ""devastated"" by the development. ""There were no winners in this already,"" Robert Zimmerman Jr. said. ""Our brother could have been dead. Our brother literally had to save a life by taking a life."" Trayvon Martin case has a tough, controversial prosecutor . O'Mara said a bond motion hearing may be held Thursday in Seminole County. ""I will be seeking his release,"" he said of Zimmerman. Corey said Zimmerman had the right to appear before a magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest. ""I think (Zimmerman) is troubled by the fact the state decided to charge him,"" O'Mara attorney told reporters Wednesday evening. ""I think anyone charged with second-degree murder would be scared."" He said his client will enter a plea of not guilty. Like Zimmerman's relatives, O'Mara asked there be no rush to judgment. ""I am hoping the community will calm down,"" he said. ""We have to have faith in the justice system."" In Florida, a conviction for second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Elements in such a charge include demonstrating the death was caused by a criminal act, and that the act demonstrated a depraved mind without regard for human life. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Corey ""threw the book"" at Zimmerman. Robert Zimmerman Jr. said prosecutors in such cases sometimes hope a defendant will take a plea deal. The Rev. Al Sharpton appeared with Martin's parents after Corey's announcement. ""They charged him with a serious crime,"" Sharpton said of Zimmerman. ""He deserves a fair trial. We don't want anybody high-fiving tonight. There's no victory here. There are no winners here. They've lost their son,"" he said of Martin's parents. Zimmerman was alone Wednesday when he turned himself in to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's office in Jacksonville, said Joyce Dawley of the department. In a letter last month to the Orlando Sentinel, George Zimmerman's father wrote that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Although details of the evening shooting remain murky, what is known is that Martin, an African-American, ventured out from his father's fiancee's home in Sanford to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of Skittles and an Arizona Ice Tea. On his way back, he had a confrontation with Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, and Zimmerman shot him. Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood, according to authorities. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, after which the dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursued Martin anyway before saying he lost sight of him. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman told authorities that after he briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman said, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman said Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into the sidewalk. Audio experts earlier this month told CNN that they don't believe it's Zimmerman who can be heard yelling ""Help!"" in the background of a different 911 call related to the shooting. They compared those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in the 911 call he made minutes earlier. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. A police report indicated the volunteer was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head. Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, said nothing in it allows people to ""pursue and confront."" Gov. Rick Scott, in a statement issued late Wednesday afternoon, said, ""Most Floridians and local civic leaders are law-abiding, responsible citizens who all want justice to prevail. No matter what State Attorney Corey determines following her investigation of the Trayvon Martin tragedy, I trust in the goodness of all Florida citizens to allow our justice system to reach an appropriate conclusion in this case."" O'Mara replaces Craig Sonner and Hal Uhrig, the two lawyers who had been giving legal advice to Zimmerman. They told reporters Tuesday that they had lost contact with their client and no longer represent him. Attorney General Eric Holder pledged Wednesday that the Justice Department will ""conduct a thorough and independent review of the evidence."" ""I know that many of you are greatly -- and rightly -- concerned"" about Martin's death, Holder said -- ""a young man whose future has been lost to the ages."" The department's investigation, launched three weeks ago, remains open, he said, which ""prevents me from talking in detail about this matter."" Holder did note, however, that Justice Department officials had traveled to Sanford to meet with Martin's family, community members and local authorities. The FBI is assisting, he said. The case has drawn comments from President Barack Obama and led to protest marches in cities and campuses across the country. Ben Jealous, president of the NAACP, said Zimmerman's arrest ""is an important first step toward bringing justice for Trayvon and his family."" He claimed Martin was profiled because of his race.

"Washington (CNN) -- As many as 20,000 federal prisoners could see their sentences shortened under a new proposal by the Justice Department. The department made its pitch Tuesday before the U.S. Sentencing Commission to make some current prisoners retroactively eligible for reduced sentences. The commission voted in April to reduce drug sentences for future nonviolent offenders. Sally Yates, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Charles Samuels, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, presented the Justice Department's proposal to the commission Tuesday. Attorney General Eric Holder plans to discuss the issue at an event later Tuesday. The department estimates the change would benefit up to 9% of the federal prison population of nearly 217,000. Not all prisoners who applied for the reduced sentences would receive them. The change is part of Holder's ""Smart on Crime"" efforts. The attorney general, who has said he wants to stay in office until late this year, is seeking to reduce prison population and loosen mandatory sentencing rules for nonviolent drug crimes. He often cites data showing that with only 5% of the world's population, the United States has nearly a quarter of the planet's prisoners. The Justice Department proposal, set to be voted on next month, would reduce sentences by about 23 months on average for those already in prison and who qualify. It would apply to prisoners without ""significant"" criminal histories, and whose crimes didn't involve weapons or violence. ""This proposal strikes the best balance between protecting public safety and addressing the overcrowding of our prison system that has been exacerbated by unnecessarily long sentences,"" Holder was expected to say Tuesday, according to prepared remarks released by the Justice Department. Holder has won support from conservatives, including Sen. Rand Paul and some Republican governors, who view mandatory minimum laws as a federal government overreach. But he also faces pushback from some Republican lawmakers and from some rank-and-file members of law enforcement. Among the objections: The administration is making changes without congressional approval, and the changes reverse laws that many credit with historical crime rate reductions in the past decade.

"(CNN) -- Violence erupted across Iraq on Saturday, with dozens of killings reported in shellings, bombings and shootings, authorities said. Most of the deaths occurred in Anbar province, the Sunni region west of Baghdad where security forces have been squaring off with anti-government fighters. Soldiers shelled and bombed parts of Falluja, killing 17 people and wounding 21 others, health officials said. This comes as Iraq's military embarks on a large-scale operation to regain control of the city. Military action, which included the bombing of mosques and houses in Falluja, sparked an exodus of thousands of residents fleeing the fighting, the officials said. The metropolis look like a ""a city of ghosts,"" Dr. Ahmed Ammar, an emergency room doctor at Falluja General Hospital, told CNN. ""Ninety-nine percent of Falluja citizens had fled the city,"" and moved to the northern outskirts, he said. ""We don't have enough medical supplies to treat wounded people,"" Ammar said. ""The international community should intervene immediately and stop this mass killings conducted by al-Maliki and his forces."" He was referring to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is Shiite. ""Fighters are all outside the city, they are not inside. Why is the Iraqi army continuing to shell residential areas? Who would accept that?"" Ammar told CNN from an area where he can receive a phone signal. More than 300 people have been killed and more than 1,300 others have been wounded in the fighting in and around the city since the beginning of the year, authorities said. In the Anbar capital of Ramadi, two police officers told CNN that Iraqi security forces killed more than 30 anti-government fighters. Some of those fighters are militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, linked to al Qaeda. The wave of violence reflects the growing sectarian tension across Iraq, where the Shiite majority prevails in government and the Sunni minority regards itself as political marginalized. Bombing attacks and a shooting left at least 19 dead and nearly two dozen wounded in other parts of the country, police said. A suicide car bombing near Dujail on Saturday killed seven people, including four soldiers, police said. The incident occurred at an Iraqi army checkpoint just north of Baghdad. In northern Iraq, one roadside bombing killed five police officers, another bombing left three civilians dead, and two people were killed in a shooting, police said. Near Baghdad, a roadside bomb killed two people near an outdoor market.","NEW: Falluja fighting sparks a large exodus .

"(CNN) -- As President Barack Obama made his impassioned speech at Nelson Mandela's funeral at a soccer stadium in Soweto, the poverty-stricken Johannesburg township that was a stronghold of support for the anti-apartheid struggle, he was standing at the procession of one of the people who had the greatest impact on his life. Mandela shaped his career. ""Over 30 years ago, while still a student,"" the president said, ""I learned of Nelson Mandela and the struggles in this beautiful land. It stirred something in me. And while I will always fall short of Madiba's example, he makes me want to be a better man."" Obama praised what this leader had accomplished for racial equality and in bringing down the apartheid regime. The speech, the first African-American president in the United States speaking at the funeral of the first black president of South Africa, is important in that it brings us back to the transformational nature of Obama, a basic fact that has been lost in all the partisan tumult and vitriol of the last few years. Since he entered office, the very moment that brought so many Americans to tears, everything quickly returned to politics as usual. Heated debates unfolded about his legislative agenda, and the underlying significance of his election in terms of the nation's racial history faded for too many Americans. While observers will be interpreting the meaning of each word in Obama's speech through the prism of domestic politics, examining each handshake with foreign leaders to glean the implications for international policy, the speech itself and Obama standing in Mandela's shadow should be powerful reminders of the progress that we have made in race relations. Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were part of a global struggle for equality in the 1950s and 1960s that rocked societies that were built on the foundation of racial inequality. While civil rights leaders in the United States and freedom fighters in South Africa took different paths and faced different challenges, their goals were similar. In South Africa, Mandela would eventually help to bring down the apartheid regime and dismantle a brutal system of white rule. Within the United States, the civil rights movement ended legalized racial segregation and strengthened the ability of the federal government -- until this year -- to protect African-American voting rights. The election of an African-American president was also part of these long-term accomplishments, bringing down another barrier in political leadership that once seemed unmovable. The civil rights accomplishments were incomplete. Many problems facing African-Americans still persist and have sometimes been ignored by policymakers. The disproportionate number of African-Americans in U.S. prisons remains a blight on the nation's record. The devastating conditions facing certain African-Americans living in the inner city are part of another massive problem that needs to be repaired. Racism, moreover, has reared its head in recent years among some of Obama's detractors. But Obama's speech is a healthy and much needed reminder about what took place in 2008 and what he will mean in the American history textbook for decades to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Obama and Mandela: The two first black presidents of their nations .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani government convened a meeting on Monday of nearly all of the country's political parties, in an effort to consolidate broad national support for its military operation to crush Taliban militants in Pakistan's northwestern Swat Valley. Pakistani civilians flee to camps for the internally displaced in Mardan district on May 15, 2009. The leaders of 42 political parties were expected to attend the All Party Congress in Islamabad, the capital. Meanwhile, fierce fighting continued in Swat on Monday -- 27 Taliban fighters were killed, including three commanders, along with three Pakistani soldiers, said Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistani military. In a separate move to pressure the Taliban, hundreds of Muslim clerics gathered in Islamabad on Sunday to issue a unanimous declaration that denounced the militants' violent tactics. ""Suicide attacks and beheading is haram,"" the resolution said. ""Haram"" means forbidden according to Islam. National consensus is critical for the military offensive to succeed, said a senior foreign diplomat stationed in Islamabad. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the diplomat singled out Mian Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N party and the most powerful political rival to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, as saying that without Sharif's support, the anti-Taliban campaign would be doomed. Sharif was at Monday's All Party Congress. The Pakistani military mounted its first assault on al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in tribal areas along Pakistan's mountainous border with Afghanistan in 2004. There have since been a number of military offensives against the Taliban, with questionable results. The attacks have displaced hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis and done considerable damage to homes and infrastructure. The Taliban has extended its area of control from the border all the way to the district of Buner, just 100 kilometers (60 miles) from the Pakistani capital. The military attacked Taliban fighters in Buner late last month. As of Sunday, troops were still battling to dislodge insurgents from parts of Buner, according to Pakistani military spokesmen. The top U.S. military commander told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that it was too early to pass judgment on Pakistan's most recent military offensive. ""My biggest question about these operations is their ability to sustain them over time,"" said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""Historically, they haven't done that."" The United Nations says the fighting has forced more than 1 million Pakistanis to flee their homes in the northwest of the country since May 2. Prime Minister Yusuf Reza Gilani, addressing the All Party Congress on Monday, said, ""The army will remain in these areas until the displaced people can return to their homes, and until peace is established.""","Government convenes a meeting of nearly all of the country's political parties .

"(CNN) -- A number of CNN iReporters made sure to get in line for screenings of ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"" and their reaction can be summed up in one word: ""More!"" ""Grade A film! Better than the first,"" said frequent iReport movie reviewer Rajiim Gross of Fort Thomas, Kentucky. Gross did have one caveat: Since ""New Moon"" is the second in a series, moviegoers will have to see the first film, ""Twilight,"" to understand some of the plot developments in the second. Watch Gross' iReport . IReporter Asa Thibodeax acknowledged that he wasn't a ""New Moon"" fan, but he ""enjoyed it,"" he said after a screening at the Minneapolis, Minnesota-area Mall of America. His daughter, Dacia, was more enthusiastic. ""I loved it -- a lot more than I thought I would,"" she said, adding breathily, ""Jacob's body,"" referring to star Taylor Lautner's chiseled physique. Have your own review? Post an iReport here . Like Dacia, most ""New Moon"" fans are well familiar with the source material -- the ""Twilight"" novels by Stephenie Meyer -- and many have seen the first film plenty of times. Fifteen-year-old Annabelle Barker and 18-year-old Hilda Akinrinade, who attended a London, England, screening, couldn't wait for the new film to start. ""I've watched ['Twilight'] at least a hundred times!"" Akinrinade told CNN. Professional movie reviewers haven't been as kind to the film as fans. ""New Moon"" currently has a 29 percent approval rating at RottenTomatoes.com, the movie review aggregator site, worse than the 49 percent approval earned by ""Twilight."" ""A morning-after mope-fest,"" wrote the Boston Globe's Ty Burr. Some moviegoers agreed. IReporter Oonabot's iReport consisted, simply, of a photograph under the headline, ""We went to the movies tonight."" In the photo, she and her husband are wearing T-shirts that state ""New Moon Sucks"" and ""I [hate] Twilight."" Nevertheless, most fans would not be denied. ""New Moon"" is the No. 1 film of all time in advance ticket sales, according to ticket seller MovieTickets.com. Forecasters say the film may gross as much as $100 million its opening weekend. And fans rallied around to show their support. ""I was blown away. It was so awesome,"" an unidentified female moviegoer told iReporter Chris Morrow of San Diego, California, where some fans waited for more than two hours at a Wednesday night screening. And even Anders Wright, who reviews films for San Diego's CityBeat, knows that he's outnumbered by the ""Twi-hards,"" as dedicated fans call themselves.

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, Phillip Loughlin made a choice he knew would brand him as an outsider with many of his fellow hunters: . He decided to shoot ""green"" bullets. ""It made sense,"" Loughlin said of his switch to more environmentally friendly ammo, which doesn't contain lead. ""I believe that we need to do a little bit to take care of the rest of the habitat and the environment -- not just what we want to shoot out of it."" Lead, a toxic metal that can lower the IQs of children, is the essential element in most ammunition on the market today. But greener alternatives are gaining visibility -- and stirring controversy -- as some hunters, scientists, environmentalists and public health officials worry about lead ammunition's threat to the environment and public health. Hunting groups oppose limits on lead ammunition, saying there's no risk and alternatives are too expensive. The scope of the trend is difficult to measure. Americans spent an estimated $1.08 billion on ammunition in fiscal year 2008, according to tax reports from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. But the bureau does not track ammunition sales by type. Industry groups are tight-lipped about their sales figures. Manufacturers contacted by CNN declined to release specific numbers. Barnes Bullets, which manufactures copper bullets because, the company says, they perform better than lead, is seeing increased interest in its non-lead products, said Jessica Brooks, the Utah company's spokeswoman. Loughlin, of Union City, California, has noticed new manufacturers jumping into the green bullet game. ""They're definitely coming out. Winchester and Remington, all the big-name ammo makers are loading green ammunition now,"" he said. Some firing ranges are banning lead for safety reasons. Lead bullets contaminate military training grounds across the country and are the subjects of many environmental cleanups. California and other state governments have taken up lead bullets as a matter of policy. They worry that lead from the bullets contaminates ecosystems and could affect people. Last year, California banned lead bullets in the chunk of the state that makes up the endangered California condor's habitat. The large birds are known to feed on scraps of meat left behind by hunters. Those scraps sometimes contain pieces of lead bullets, and lead poisoning is thought to be a contributor to condor deaths. Arizona, another condor state, gives out coupons so hunters can buy green ammunition. Utah may soon follow suit. In North Dakota, a hunter has raised concerns about lead's potential impact on humans. Dr. William Cornatzer, a dermatologist and falconer, saw a presentation about the potential dangers of lead at a board meeting of the Peregrine Fund, a group devoted to conserving birds of prey. He decided to collect and test venison samples that were going to be donated to a local program for the hungry. About half of the 100 samples -- all shot by hunters -- tested positive for lead, he said. Food banks and shelters pulled the meat from their shelves after the report. ""When we did this, I about fell out of my shoes,"" he said. ""The scary thing is these fragments are almost like dust in the meat. They're not like metal fragments you would feel when you bite down."" States in the area started investigating the issue after Cornatzer's findings. Working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the North Dakota Department of Health ran a test to find out the health effects of lead-shot game. The agency compared blood-lead levels of people who regularly eat meat shot with lead bullets with the levels of those who don't eat much wild game. The results were inconclusive. Those who ate the lead-shot meat had slightly higher blood-lead levels than those who didn't, but none of the 738 people in the study had levels above the government's threshold for danger. Still, the health department recommended that children younger than 6 and pregnant women stop eating venison shot with lead bullets because those groups are at particular risk for lead poisoning, even at low levels. The department also recommended lead-free bullets as the simplest solution to possible contamination. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources followed with its own study, which found that when lead bullets explode inside an animal, imperceptible particles of the metal can infect meat up to a foot and a half away from the bullet wound -- farther than previously thought. More research is needed to tell for sure if lead-shot meat poses a risk to people, said Dr. Steve Pickard, an epidemiologist at the North Dakota Department of Health. But until that research is done, people should take sensible precautions, he said. ""There is no cause for alarm, but it is another source of lead in the environment,"" he said of lead ammunition. Hunting groups say lead bullets pose no risk to people or the environment. Available studies -- particularly the one from North Dakota -- prove that point, said Ted Novin, spokesman for National Shooting Sports Foundation. ""The CDC study confirmed what hunters have known for centuries: Consuming game hunted with traditional [lead] ammunition has never been shown to pose a health risk to anyone,"" he said. Pickard said Novin's group is misrepresenting science. The NSSF and the National Rifle Association say efforts to ban lead ammunition are veiled attempts to take guns away from hunters. They also point to the fact that lead's main alternative, copper, is more expensive and isn't available in all calibers. Novin said the added expense will drive many people away from a sport that is part of American heritage. ""Many hunters believe lead is the best metal to be used for hunting,"" he said. ""Add into that that it [lead] is very affordable and it is very available. We think this absolutely should be left up to hunters."" Dr. Joseph Graziano, interim department chair of environmental health sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said the public should switch away from lead bullets -- even if the research is still developing. ""It's hard to imagine that you could make a bullet out of something more toxic than lead,"" he said. Loughlin, who switched to green ammo and blogs on the issue, said that lead shouldn't be banned from hunting but that hunters and the public should be more aware of lead's potential to cause harm. ""Lead will get into you, and we need to be working towards getting it out of the system,"" he said. ""I think it's something we could do away with over time.""","Green bullets are those that don't contain lead, a toxic metal .

"(CNN) -- Barely a day passes without news of another major computer security breach. Last week a hacking network named ""Hollywood Leaks"" began their attack on the personal data of celebrities, officially adding the glitterati to a roll of shame that already includes targets as diffuse as Sony, the Church of Scientology and PayPal. However only a few days before the emergence of this latest hacking outfit, a far less conspicuous but similarly-skilled group met at a London hotel to discuss the other side of all matters of information security, otherwise known as ""infosec"". The inaugural 44Con was Britain's first major conference for the good guys of infosec. Among the 300 delegates and speakers were a number of so-called ""white hats"", programmers and penetration testers specifically employed to discover businesses' weak spots. Using information from these ethical hackers, manufacturers can remedy or ""patch"" the problem before its release and companies can take measures to safeguard their data. Although their more destructive brethren might continue to grab headlines, 44Con demonstrated that the fight against hackers, and other more traditional threats to information security, is also strong. ""The way people use and consume media and share information has drastically changed over the past ten years,"" said Steve Lord, a security professional and co-founder of 44Con. ""The information that we used to think would stay on a computer, in an increasingly networked world, it goes everywhere. So there is an increasing demand for people to secure that information because otherwise people won't put it there."" 44Con attracted representatives from governments and members of the military, alongside risk managers, consultants and students. According to Lord, the roll call included ""hackers, freaks, geeks, spooks and kooks,"" none of whom was required to identify themselves further than a first name. ""It's everyone around the table all looking at the same problems and hopefully coming up with some solutions,"" Lord said. High-profile hacking is only one strand of the ongoing battle to protect electronic information from damage or infiltration. Events at 44Con ran the gamut from workshops demonstrating old-fashioned lock-picking with a paperclip, through discussions of threats to iPads and smart phones and even a presentation of how NASA's transmissions to astronauts have recently been intercepted. ""We've got a serious problem here... like the global financial crisis,"" said Haroon Meer, a researcher at the infosec consultancy, Thinkst. But although Meer also referred to ""our upcoming security apocalypse"", others were focused on how intelligence can be used to predict attacks before they occur and, crucially, how to acquire boardroom backing for improved security measures. Infosec professionals often converse in a language that is not always immediately accessible to a layman (executives included), but the result of their endeavors can often be startlingly clear. ""Every single guy at boardroom level that I speak to says, 'Are we going to be the next Sony?'"" said Lord, referring to the recent devastating hack on the electronics giant. ""Everybody had a look at the Sony thing and thought, 'Oh God, I hope I'm not next.'"" Sony given 'epic fail' award from hackers . Several presentations at 44Con offered chilling demonstrations of the vulnerabilities of common business devices. Alex Plaskett, a consultant at MWR InfoSecurity, who described himself as someone who has been ""professionally breaking things"" for many years, performed a so-called ""drive-by"" exploit on a Windows 7 smart phone. Independent security consultant, Neil Kettle, performed a take-down of the much garlanded online banking security software Trusteer Rapport, running a key-logging program that replicated on screen anything a user might be entering into supposedly secure password fields. Another security expert Roelof Temmingh showcased the most recent version of Maltego, software that analyzes and compares freely available information from numerous social networking sites. Using the website of the Executive Office of the President as an example, Temmingh was able to extract specific information such as favored restaurants among White House staffers, as well as other behavioral trends. ""Even if we don't want to attack, what can we learn?"" Temmingh asked, before revealing that at least one member of the Bush administration was a fan of Moody's Diner, visited a psychic medium named ""Rosemary the Celtic Lady"" and was a keen editor of Wikipedia pages. The examples were deliberately banal and outdated, but the implication was clear. Through similar paths, hackers of more nefarious intentions could determine what versions of browsers are being used in the White House, for instance, and probe specific vulnerabilities. ""If you can exploit the browser of a leader, then you've exploited the PC of a president,"" Temmingh warned. However it was left to Alexis Conran, a former confidence trickster who appeared in a British TV show called ""The Real Hustle"", to sum up the challenges still faced by the infosec sector. ""The general public will only take steps to protect themselves if they know what the dangers are,"" he said.","Information security professionals working to beat hackers .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The State Department's initial report of last month's incident in which Blackwater guards were accused of killing Iraqi civilians was written by a Blackwater contractor working in the embassy security detail, according to government and industry sources. In this September 24 photo, an Iraqi looks at a car that was destroyed during the September 16 incident. A source involved in diplomatic security at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said a Blackwater contractor, Darren Hanner, drafted the two-page ""spot report"" on the letterhead of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the embassy's Tactical Operations Center. That office -- which tracks and monitors all incidents and movements involving diplomatic security missions -- has outsourced positions to Blackwater and another private firm, the embassy source said. A highly placed industry source said that Hanner, who was listed on the report as the TOC watch officer, was working for Blackwater at the time the report was written, just after the September 16 incident occurred. He was to rotate out of Iraq this past week, the source said. The man who approved the report was Ricardo Colon, whom the embassy source identified as the embassy's deputy regional security officer. A State Department source confirmed a Ricardo Colon Cifredo works for the State Department in Iraq. The deadly incident produced an outcry in Iraq and raised questions about the accountability of foreign security contractors in Iraq, who, under an order laid down by the U.S.-led occupation government, are not subject to Iraqi law for actions taken within their contracts. Anne Tyrrell, a spokeswoman for Blackwater, emphasized that the State Department is doing its own investigation into the incident. The FBI is sending a team of agents to assist the U.S. investigation at the State Department's request, FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday. Blackwater -- which provides security to U.S. diplomats -- says its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on a convoy. The State Department ""spot report"" underscores that scenario and doesn't mention civilian casualties. However, those accounts are at odds with what the Iraqis are saying. A senior Iraqi National Police official participating in the Iraqi governmental probe of the shooting said the Blackwater gunfire was unprovoked and the guards fired randomly, killing several civilians and wounding others.  Watch Iraqi police video of the incident aftermath » . Tom Casey, deputy State Department spokesman, noted that a spot report ""is a first-blush account of those on the scene"" and that the ""report has no standing whatsoever."" ""It was not intended to be used as an analysis, investigation, review or any detailed assessment of the situation,"" Casey said. ""To assert that (it is) is untrue,"" Casey said. The embassy source said after the spot report was completed and approved, a State Department agent took sworn statements from the participants in the shooting. The senior Iraqi police officer said that Blackwater team members were questioned by Iraqi police immediately after the incident and initially said they opened fire in response to a mortar attack. However, he said, they then changed their story at least twice during the 90 minutes they were held. Erik Prince, the CEO of Blackwater, was to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

"(CNN) -- Drug cartels, whether in Colombia or Mexico, cannot function without massive assistance from compromised officials at all levels. Corruption is the oxygen that keeps organized crime alive. I know something about corruption and organized crime. I spent more than six years in the biggest, richest syndicate in the history of crime -- the Cali cartel. And I know that Mexico, like Colombia, can't succeed against its drug gangs without choking off much of the bribery and intimidation that sustain them. First, some background: I used to be Jorge Salcedo. I left my name in Colombia when I entered the U.S. witness protection program 16 years ago. I also left a home, a country, friends, family, even my past. But maybe my experience will help show the importance of fighting corruption as a way to fight the cartels. My primary job in the Cali cartel was security for one of four godfathers, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the daily operations boss. Others were more directly involved in routine bribery, but I still managed to deliver nearly a million dollars in payoffs. And I witnessed many, many millions more. The biggest bribe I ever handled personally was a half-million-dollar payoff to a Salvadoran air force colonel. I was buying four U.S.-made bombs -- 500-pounders -- that the bosses wanted to drop on Pablo Escobar. It was a very bad idea, but they sent me anyway. The cash was disguised as a birthday present, about the size of a large shoebox, wrapped in red paper with gold trim. I'd never seen so much money. I remember that it was surprisingly heavy. Then there were the two checks signed by Miguel worth about $50,000. As instructed, I took those to a bank near the Cali airport and deposited one into the account of a sister and the other to the mother of a captain in the Colombian anti-narcotics task force. It was a bonus for the captain's help getting the boss away from a police raid. In those days, hundreds of high-ranking and lower level police were on the cartel's secret payroll -- tens of thousands of dollars paid every month for inside tips or for looking the other way. The youngest boss, Pacho Herrera, sometimes liked to use local police as sentries at his home. The cartel had important friends in the military, too -- from helicopter pilots to generals. One well-placed insider was the sergeant and chief of staff to the military commander of the anti-narcotics task force. He cost $20,000 a month. Between sources like the army sergeant, the police captain and others, my bosses and I were kept informed about dates, times and places for raids and such things as which cartel cars were being followed and what phone numbers were being tapped. On one occasion, we knew that Miguel had time for lunch and a shower before the raiding party was scheduled to arrive. Both the sergeant and the captain were among hundreds of police and military officers fired for corruption. Besides law enforcement, the cartel bought a piece of Colombia's justice system with payoffs to prosecutors who lost evidence, misplaced paperwork, blocked search warrants or released prisoners before they could be questioned. Some judges became overnight millionaires. I see police and judicial corruption as the biggest price of organized crime. Politicians were considered a long-term investment. It seemed sometimes that they all had their hands out. The bosses handed out $20,000 checks like hospitality gifts. I was there when campaign officials for a presidential candidate came for help. Eventually, a total of $6 million in secret donations made Ernesto Samper our president. After top campaign aides acknowledged receiving cartel funds, Samper insisted that if such contributions were made, it was without his knowledge. And I was there when Cali cartel lawyers were allowed to rewrite our national constitution to outlaw extraditions of Colombian traffickers to the United States. You may be skeptical when I tell you, but no true Colombian could have watched that spectacle of democracy for sale without suffering some heartache. When I agreed to assist U.S. drug enforcement agents 16 years ago, the Cali cartel was making $7 billion a year. Cartel documents turned over to Colombian authorities exposed a vast network of corruption. There was public outrage. Widespread arrests and firings followed, and the grip of corruption was broken. That's what brought down the Cali cartel, and it can make a difference in other countries where a culture of acceptance makes corruption especially stubborn. The Mexican public needs to express its outrage. And, then, Mexican leaders need to sweep out officials at all levels who have sold their souls to organized crime.

"(CNN) -- Iran says it has decoded and released footage from a U.S. drone that it downed more than a year ago. The black and white aerial footage, which Iran claims was from a RQ-170 spy plane, was aired by Iranian news agencies and placed on YouTube. A man, identified in Iranian media as Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, narrates parts of the footage. Key U.S. official defends use of drones . ""This aircraft has carried out many operations in the countries around Iran,"" the narrator says. ""In the operations taken place in Pakistan, this aircraft guided many of the clashes ..."" The narrator also says that some of the footage shows the drone near Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan. CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the video. Also CNN could not immediately reach Pentagon officials for comment. Iran had said it downed the drone on December 4, 2011, near Kashmar in the country's northeast, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan. A dangerous new world of drones . At the time, U.S. officials acknowledged that the drone was missing and President Barack Obama asked Iran to return it. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said later that month. At the time, Iranian military officials vowed not to return the plane. This claim from Tehran comes at the same time that the U.S. drone program is being heavily debated in Washington. John Brennan, Obama's pick to head the CIA, has been one of the architects of the drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies for the past four years. Senators will get to grill on him Thursday at his confirmation hearing. Also Thursday, the Senate Intelligence Committee will receive a classified drone policy document that seeks to justify the administration's policy of targeting Americans overseas via drone attacks, a topic that has stirred controversies recently.

"(CNN) -- Smart, successful, funny and handsome. Robin Williams seemed to have it all. And yet, today he is dead. Apparently, by his own choice. But why? What went wrong? The joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. In his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. I didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do. Complete coverage on Robin Williams . Those who are suffering will do just about anything not to feel the pain anymore. And in those moments, their brains become their worst enemies. It often takes an outside force to provide light, to make sure those dark thoughts aren't, as in the case of Robin, our last thoughts. According to the Centers for Disease Center, suicide rates increased from 2000 to 2011 from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 to 12.3 deaths per 100,000. The rate of suicide is higher and rising among men. In 2011, 78.5% of suicides were by men, at a rate of 20.2 deaths per 100,000. The rate of suicide is rising in all age groups except 85 and older and is highest in individuals 45 to 64, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. We know and feel that the stigma of mental health is making it even harder for those of us who need support to reach out and get it. Living with depression is isolating and demoralizing and often reinforces the pain that we are in. We can't let these tragedies continue. The ripple effect is immeasurable. Now, his loss has to change how we move forward. When someone dies, it is tragic. But when someone dies by suicide, there are so many competing emotions from all who are touched that there is no understanding the impact. We all wonder 'why?' No two lives are identical and to make judgments about another's choice is often more destructive than helpful. But we have to remember that everyone is dealing with their own stuff behind their own mask. We don't know what's really going on, so we must be careful not to judge. Too many are dying because of the deafening silence. Everyone you know goes through or is going through the fire, and that's the truth. For me, depression has been part of my journey for a very long time. Long before I knew what to call it, there it was walking with me, side by side. There it was, holding my hand, invading my thoughts causing me to sleep longer, eat more and rarely smile whenever I spent time alone with myself. I learned to dance the dance, to smile for my friends, for my parents, for the audience, for the camera. I smiled, all while inside a hurricane was sweeping me into an ocean of darkness. You are ashamed. I was ashamed. We are all somehow very ashamed to admit to others our feelings of doom. There is no one size fits all reason for depression's presence. For some it is childhood demons. For others, a chemical imbalance. It can be brought on by stressful situations or hang around forever in the background like a stubborn gray cloud. Just as there is no single explanation for this emotional predator, there can be no one-size-fits-all solution. It starts with sharing and admitting the pain. Nothing can be fixed until we admit that it is broken, until we acknowledge that there is a problem. From that point forward, we must work toward our healing solutions, because we are fighting for our life. My battle with depression has diminished greatly, although I'm not sure that it will completely disappear. What I do know is that having it gone completely is a personal goal that I've set and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to accomplish it. Writing my book ""Black Pain: It Just Looks Like We're Not Hurting"" was part of the journey. I wanted to help other people better understand what they were going through. Now I've co-founded with Madeline McCray the New Legacy Leaders Project to carry the mission forward. The mantra of the initiative, ""Our Vision Our Journey, Beyond Depression, Obesity and Poverty to Wellness and Prosperity."" How can we stop our best and brightest, our loved ones, from killing themselves when alone in that darkness? How can we make a difference? First, we have to take off the mask. We must begin to share our pain. By talking about it, everyone will realize that they are not alone. And they do not have to go through this journey alone. Next, we must get involved and demand that our elected representatives support legislation that make resources available for everyone to get the support and help they need. Lastly, we've got to reach out to each other. When you see someone struggling, don't just ignore them, write them off or assume they'll just ""snap out of it."" Call them, visit them, keep an eye on them. Have a cup of coffee and just listen. We all have a shared responsibility in the health and well-being of our society, one friend at a time. Robin Williams' death is a stark reminder to all of how much work there is to do. He was brilliant, and he brought joy to so many others. Yet it seems that inner peace escaped him. But he is at peace now. Still, those he left behind -- his family and friends -- are left to try to make sense of it. Videos: The world according to Robin Williams . It might not ever make sense.

"(CNN) -- When several health setbacks sapped my 77-year-old dad's zest for life, I had to do something. My friend Diane came to my rescue when she showed off her Fitbit, a small wearable digital device that logs every step you make and nudges you to keep moving. It also tracks your calories to help watch how much you eat. I was intrigued. My dad, Vesselin Vassilev, loves gadgets, so I thought a Fitbit could get him off the couch. Six months later, he's still moving. He's lost weight and feels more energized, but what happens when the novelty wears off? Can digital monitors really help people like my dad kick unhealthy habits blamed for growing global obesity rates? A health study published in January by a UK-based think tank says over-eating and sedentary lifestyles are causing an ""explosion"" of obesity around the world. The Overseas Development Institute's ""Future Diets"" study found that in 2008, one in three adults was overweight or obese, a 23% rise from 1980. In the same time, obesity had spread faster in the developing world than richer countries. People are gaining weight because they're eating more meat, sugar and fat -- and in bigger portions. And doctors say obesity puts us more at risk of some of the leading causes of preventable death -- like heart disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Doctors say we need to eat less and move more to maintain a healthy weight. But getting us moving has been an uphill battle. Few people are able to stick with a fitness routine for long. Gold's Gym in the U.S. says 50% of their members eventually return to their sedentary lifestyle. You've probably noticed how gyms get crowded by the ""New Year Resolution"" people in January, only to get back to normal by spring. Many people just can't stay motivated for long. So does technology stand a better chance? Digital activity monitors seem to offer a technological solution to solving both problems, eating too much and moving too little. They all work in a similar way, using a sensor to track movement, heart rate and body temperature. They nudge you to move when you sit too long and give you feedback on whether you're meeting your goal. You can wear them as a bracelet or pin them to your belt or clothing. They can connect to websites where you can check your daily activity, log your calories and compete with other users. Some of the monitors can tell you how well you've slept, by tracking your moves at night. Among the most popular brands are Fitbit, Jawbone UP and Nike FuelBand. They cost between $60 and $200, depending on the features. According to NPD, a consumer market research group which tracks sales, Fitbit had 67% share of the U.S. retail market, Jawbone UP accounted for 19% and Nike FuelBand, 10%. Fitbits are now sold in 30,000 stores across 28 countries around the world. And Jawbone has announced plans to expand in Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. Last year Fitbit made inroads at CNN. Several staff gave it a try, including my colleague Courtney Perkins. ""Little did I know, that would be the one thing, after countless diets and resolutions and short-lived exercise programs, that finally works,"" she said. So I surprised my dad with a Fitbit when I went to see him in my native Bulgaria. Associate Professor Katie Siek, who studies wearable digital devices at Indiana University's Informatics Department, says monitors have taken off because they are easy to use and actively track progress towards goals. But is this another passing fitness fad? Health economist Jane Sarasohn-Kahn believes they have lasting power because they meet the needs of our modern lives. She says do-it-yourself monitoring will become more important in healthcare, both as a way for people to manage their health and get feedback from their doctors. Courtney is still using her Fitbit more than a year later, while dad has been wearing his for six months. Dad says: ""I move two to three times more than before and I'm more energized and feel stronger. ""I walk three to five miles a day and want to do even more."" But Courtney is our newsroom Fitbit star. She lost 30 pounds (13kg) in eight months. She went from being overweight to being in the normal range and has kept the weight off since last November. But they have their struggles. Dad is still used to putting his feet up. Courtney's biggest challenge is life's special occasions, ""the perfect excuse to slack off."" She says: ""I have to work hard to maintain my no-excuses policy while still cutting myself some slack every once in a while. It's a tough balance to strike. ""Also, vacations -- when I take a week off from work, the routine is broken. I really have to make sure I'm wearing the Fitbit and logging calories every day or I'll fall off the wagon."" For now Courtney and dad are determined to stick with their Fitbits. But even if they lose interest, they all say they've gained one lasting benefit, more awareness of how much to move and eat to stay healthy. Sarasohn-Kahn says awareness helps us adopt good habits. ""Over time, your daily life flow changes and these movements become more automatic. ""These actions can be mutually-reinforcing, in particular the more you move, the more you burn calories, so that informs the food choices you make on a daily basis."" The Endeavor Partners research firm found that 50% of consumers stopped using their digital tracking devices within six months. But device use could go up as more employers provide them to cut healthcare costs. And scientists are testing ways to tweak digital activity trackers to help people stay with them longer. The biggest benefit to me is how it helped my dad regain his zest for life. But I'm a little apprehensive about getting a monitor. I worry about becoming too controlled by a gadget always keeping a wary eye on me. Besides, my ""low-tech"" routine has worked well for more than six years now. But seeing how much fun people are having with their monitors, it might just be enough to nudge me to join in the fun.","Do-it-yourself fitness monitoring is a growing trend .

"London (CNN) -- Until last year, James Murdoch was widely regarded as heir-apparent to his father Rupert's global News Corp. media empire -- a remarkable turnaround for a college dropout once viewed as the family's black sheep. But that aspiration took a hit following revelations that -- while he was boss of News Corp. Europe and Asia -- the group's British Sunday tabloid the News of the World eavesdropped illegally on politicians, celebrities, army veterans and even a teenaged murder victim in search of stories. The scandal has exposed collusion between journalists, media groups, politicians and police, claiming the jobs of top police officers, newspaper executives and Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman, while dozens of people have been arrested. Despite his insistence, in his testimony to the Leveson inquiry investigating the matter, that he knew little of the scale of the hacking by News of the World employees, James Murdoch has also paid a price professionally. In February he resigned as executive chairman of the British newspaper division; in April he stepped down as chairman of News Corp.'s UK-based broadcasting arm BSkyB, and subsequently relocated to the United States. Murdoch, 39, said he was resigning to try to shield the satellite broadcaster from fallout from the newspaper scandal. ""I believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization,"" he said . Yet despite his corporate leadership having been heavily criticized by UK media regulator Ofcom -- which found his actions in relation to the hacking scandal ""repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman"" -- Murdoch may have suffered only a momentary career setback. In September, UK media reported that he was set to take over the running of Fox Networks, prompting angry responses from News Corp shareholders. One shareholder quoted in a UK newspaper called the news a ""slap in the face for shareholders, not to mention victims of the hacking scandal."" As its deputy chief operating officer and head of international operations, Murdoch was the third most senior figure at News Corp., wielding considerable influence through the stable of newspaper titles at his command. Murdoch finally succumbed to the turmoil that for a time threatened to engulf the entire company, even after it stepped away from a controversial bid to acquire full control of its UK-based broadcasting arm, ending any possibility of him succeeding his father at the helm of one of the most powerful media empires in the world. James Murdoch's close links to the papers at the heart of the phone-hacking scandal were pivotal. It was he who announced the closure of the News of the World amid public fury about the paper's tactics. He always denied being aware of the phone-hacking activities -- although he did authorize payments to appease victims. In evidence to a UK parliamentary hearing in July 2011, Murdoch said he could not recall seeing a key document known as the ""for Neville"" e-mail. It implied that the practice was being conducted by more than one journalist, but this statement was directly contradicted by two of the company's senior employees and may be the focus of fresh questioning. Days after his appearance, Cameron said Murdoch had ""questions to answer in parliament"" over his evidence. It was another intriguing chapter in a varied career to date. The third child from his father's second marriage, Murdoch once appeared to be the least likely of the media tycoon's offspring to succeed, despite his evident intelligence. Born in London, but raised in New York, he attended Harvard University, where he studied film and animation before dropping out in the mid-1990s to help launch a hip-hop music label, Rawkus Records. It wasn't long before Murdoch was brought into the family business. Rawkus was eventually bought by News Corp. and in 1996 Murdoch was persuaded to take over the company's nascent internet operations, with mixed results. By 2000 Murdoch was in charge of News Corp's Asian satellite business, Star TV, where he appeared to find his feet. In 2003 he took over its UK-based sister operation, Sky, quickly dispelling doubts about his business acumen by meeting ambitious profit targets. Murdoch continued to rise through the ranks, taking on his News Corp executive roles in 2007. At the time, Rupert Murdoch described his son as a ""talented and proven executive with a rare blend of international perspective and deep hands-on experience."" His new position handed him overall control of News International, an umbrella company that includes the Sun newspaper, the Times and the defunct News of the World -- the paper whose activities triggered the current UK media crisis. Although regularly cited as one of the most influential figures in Britain, Murdoch's political allegiances have never been clear. A 2007 profile in the Observer newspaper said Murdoch was ""unimpressed"" by then opposition leader Cameron. The Telegraph, meanwhile, described him as a ""close confidant"" of Cameron. Murdoch himself told the Financial Times in 2007: ""I don't comment on politics."" Murdoch, who has two children with wife Kathryn Hufschmid, is said to be a black belt in karate. He is also proficient at corporate combat. In 2006 he steered BSkyB into the acquisition of a 17.9% stake in UK broadcaster ITN, blocking a rival move by Virgin Media. But it was his and News Corp.'s plans to acquire full ownership of BSkyB that put them on a collision course with British lawmakers in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, with the company eventually deciding to back down under government pressure.","James Murdoch once regarded as heir-apparent to father Rupert's News Corp. empire .

"(CNN) -- ""You've probably seen them bagging groceries,"" said the geneticist attempting to explain to my wife and me that our 1-day-old daughter, Ellie, had Down syndrome and what that meant for her future. Her age was measured only in hours and already, expectations for Ellie's potential had been capped. Earlier, we were sitting in a recovery room holding Ellie, hosting visitors, e-mailing pictures along with requisite weight and length statistics and basking in the afterglow of a seamless delivery and the addition of a beautiful, healthy daughter. Then Ellie was carted off to the ""well baby"" nursery for a routine examination by a pediatrician. My wife and I exhaled and exchanged a silent smile. A brief window of unmitigated joy. We did not know our calm would soon break. As we would learn, Ellie had been relocated to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit because of a heart condition suspected by the pediatrician. Her prognosis was encouraging, but her immediate condition was tenuous -- she needed supplemental oxygen and medication to help her heart and lungs work properly. And, we were told, a geneticist would visit us to discuss an additional diagnosis. That ""additional diagnosis"" was hardly the afterthought it sounded at the time. What is Down syndrome? Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of a third copy of the 21st chromosome. It is the most common chromosomal condition, affecting more than 400,000 Americans, according to the National Down Syndrome Society. Down syndrome is associated with delayed cognitive ability and physical growth. I secretly hoped that it was all just a bad dream. But instead of awaking to relief, each morning was greeted with pounding guilt for wishing that Ellie was any different than the miracle she was destined to be. Learn more about Down syndrome . We coped with the stress of her heart complication, from which she recovered by the time she was 3 months old, and we began to accept the challenges associated with Down syndrome that lay ahead. But the visual painted by the geneticist of Ellie as an adult, wearing a name tag and struggling to load a milk carton into a grocery bag, was etched in our minds. That description of Ellie's diminished outlook, delivered as a foregone conclusion, was difficult to accept. Her promise, stolen. It was an injustice that took time to fully appreciate and gnaws at me even today. Ellie, now almost 5, has tackled life head on, making friends and enjoying childhood while enduring endless hours of physical, occupational and speech therapies to track milestones that come naturally for her older brother. Ellie has braved ""two-a-days"" her entire life, showing up on time and ready to play. A dad's confession: I almost left my disabled daughter . Never have I been more proud than witnessing Ellie walk for the first time. Knees wobbly and body trembling, she reached to the outstretched arms there to support her while shooting a look that signaled, ""I've got this."" In the nearly five years since Ellie's birth, we've experienced vast misunderstandings about the potential for individuals with Down syndrome. Too often, people look at Ellie and see ""disability."" They see ""can't."" Even highly educated clinicians are not immune to misconception, electing to chart her against diminished benchmarks of success and suggest that Ellie should settle for less because ""that's just the way most kids with 'Downs' are."" A long list of possible accomplishments . And yet, we've met adults with Down syndrome who can check boxes for successful student, accomplished athlete, productive employee, prom king or queen or husband or wife. And while scientific breakthroughs and novel therapies should further advance the potential of Ellie's generation in the long-term, her daily accomplishments demand that we discount her disadvantages now. They demand that we focus on her abilities and expect more from her. The contradiction between Ellie's accomplishments and the geneticist's projection has shaped how we parent all three of our children (Ellie now also has a younger brother). We believe that children, whether they have Down syndrome or not, tend to perform to the level of expectations placed upon them. Expectations are often misconstrued as setting a floor on performance. Rather, we believe expectations serve as a ceiling, so we've learned the trick is to set high expectations balanced with reassurances that it is OK to fail. And the only true failure is not testing the boundaries of our capabilities, wherever that may be. From early on, we've educated Ellie's brothers about Down syndrome and what that means for her -- ""Ellie can do everything you can do; it just may take her longer or require extra help, but she'll get there eventually."" Her older brother, then 3, retorted, ""Can she go to the moon?"" ""Yes,"" we responded. ""Maybe someday she can go to the moon."" Of course, it's important to recognize challenges and provide resources to address them. It's true, Ellie needs support, and lots of it. But, too often, people focus on her disadvantages and lose sight of her strengths. Even school administrators try to classify her, listing her deficits, setting expectations low and building a case to separate her from her typically developing peers despite numerous studies that would suggest including her with her peers is mutually beneficial. But pigeonholing her is the path of least resistance. Low expectations are, after all, the easiest to meet. Behind that cute face is steely grit . The people closest to Ellie know the truth. They know that she is capable of much more than what most expect of her. That they shouldn't be fooled by her infectious smile, capable of lighting up a room, because behind that cute facade is a fiercely determined girl. Ellie proves that every Saturday during her rock climbing class. Sure, she is intimidated by the 30-foot walls, struggles with the climb and rarely makes it all the way to the top. But after a brief break, she'll look at me and say, ""Again, Daddy."" And, equally importantly, the people closest to Ellie also know she is just like most of the 4-year-old girls in her preschool class. She is a princess at heart who loves to host play dates and go swimming. She enjoys playing catch with her brothers and occasionally catches flak for teasing them. She's more alike than different. Recently, we asked Ellie's older brother, ""Do you remember what it means for Ellie to have Down syndrome?"" ""Yes,"" he answered. ""It means she can go to the moon. But it's not fair, why does Ellie get the extra 'chrome?'"" He was referring to Ellie's extra copy of chromosome 21, the defining characteristic of Down syndrome. If only our society could look through that same lens and focus on abilities rather than disabilities. A prenatal screen pegged the odds of Ellie having Down syndrome at less than one in 3,000, so we like to think Ellie has defied expectations from the very beginning. And we trust she will continue to do so from here on out. Though we hope, one day, she won't have to. We hope one day our expectations of her, as a society, are more limitless than they are limited. Ellie has taught us many lessons about parental love, but perhaps the most important of which is not letting societal expectations dictate all that a child can be. As we enter the new year, we tend to make lots of resolutions -- most of which are forgotten long before February. I'm hoping Ellie's story can help us make a more lasting resolution, together, to recalibrate our societal expectations. Let's recognize the disadvantage, but not overcompensate for it by setting the bar too low. Let's, for this new year and all that follow after, see the ""can"" in those children affected by Down syndrome. In fact, let's do that for all our children -- extra chromosome or not. And, as for Ellie, she'll see you on the moon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bret Bowerman.","Bret Bowerman's daughter, Ellie, is 4 and was born with Down syndrome .

"(CNN) -- The Australian company GeoResonance claims it has found the wreckage of a plane in the Bay of Bengal. The company is not saying that what they found is missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but it is urging official searchers to take a look. So far, Malaysian officials say they are investigating the credibility of the claim, while Australian searchers and a satellite company say they are confident that the plane is in a different area. What is GeoResonance? GeoResonance specializes in geophysical surveys. The company's technology has been used to find oil and gas, groundwater, uranium, even diamonds. The technology the company uses was originally created to search for nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry under the ocean or beneath the earth in bunkers, said David Pope, the company's director. ""Subsurface exploration has never been so precise -- we detect the nuclei of targeted substances,"" the company says on its website. In addition to finding natural resources, the company has also used its resources to located submerged structures, including ships and aircraft. What technology is the company using? According to an Australian newspaper account, GeoResonance makes use of former Soviet defense technology that has since been demilitarized. It analyzes super-weak electromagnetic fields captured by airborne multispectral images. ""And what we do is we look at the nuclei of an atom, copper or nickel or iron. And so we knew we had the tools to search for the plane,"" Pope said. For their search of MH370, the company began by looking for aluminum, which makes up about 70% of the Boeing 777, Pope said. Once it got a hit for aluminum, it looked for other metals such as titanium, copper, steel, nickel, iron and chromium, he said. The result is a set of images that show what could be the parts of an intact plane. Where is this site? Pope declined to give the precise coordinates for GeoResonance's find, but said it was about 120 miles (190 kilometers) south of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal. The search officials do have the exact location, he said. The current official search area is in the southern Indian Ocean, and is being coordinated by the Australians. The site where GeoResonance says it found the wreckage is several thousand miles away in an area that was ruled out weeks ago. Pope said his company began searching that area at a time when search efforts were in the Bay of Bengal. The search moved on, but his team sent their findings to officials repeatedly, he said. Did officials ignore the company's findings? According to GeoResonance, yes, its e-mails and phone calls to the official searchers went unanswered. That is one of the factors that pushed the company to release its findings publicly. Pope says he did not want to share the findings publicly at first, but it was possibly the only way to get heard. ""We're a large group of scientists, and we were being ignored, and we thought we had a moral obligation to get our findings to the authorities,"" he said. The strategy appears to have worked, according to Pope. On the same day he released the findings, Malaysian officials reached out and listened to a 1Â½-hour technical presentation by his team. Malaysian acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Malaysia ""is working with its international partners to assess the credibility of this information."" Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre, which is leading the multinational search, dismissed the claim. The officials are ""satisfied"" with data that show the plane likely is in the southern Indian Ocean, and not in the Bay of Bengal. CNN's Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","Australian company is urging official Flight 370 searchers to revisit Bay of Bengal .

"(CNN) -- Nadir Lalani, arrived in the United Kingdom in the recession-hit 1970s from Tanzania and started a small corner shop. Since then, he has expanded his successful budget retail business '99p Stores', throughout the country. The stores, where everything is sold for 99 pence and are equivalent to dollar stores in the United States, have grown rapidly especially during the global downturn. Lalani now operates more than 100 stores in Britain and serves around 1.5 million customers each week. Times are tough on the British High street but Lalani has managed to open 40 new stores in one year as a growing number of consumers go on the hunt for a bargain. Lalani, who is of Pakistani origin, shares his experience of building a recession-proof business with CNN's Erin Maclaughlin in this edited version of their conversation below. CNN: How successful is this business? Nadir Lalani: I would say we are very very successful today. Our growth is very, very good compared to anybody else. We bring 2,000 people, customers to our store minimum. 2,000 customers a day is a lot. And once people do come, they stick with us. Because we sell very, very cheap quality good stuff. CNN: You have gone from running a corner shop to a massively successful business in the middle of economic downturn. What are some of the secrets to your success? Nadir Lalani: Key to our success is 'buying'. We make very fast decisions. Whatever people want to sell. They say we want to get rid of this stock. And we buy those stocks straight away. So no, we don't mess about it. CNN: What is your strategy? How do you get your prices so low? Nadir Lalani: The prices we sell at, nobody can match us, we sell much cheaper than any of the multipurpose -- the brand we bring in, the price -- so people just come in, you will see in just a few minutes, hundreds of people, hundreds of people literally. See also: Worst of times prove best for luxury brands . CNN: How has Britain's economic downturn been a catalyst for your success? Nadir Lalani: With the downturn, we find it more and more...the middle class people are coming in our store and then they come in and they are surprised what they have been paying Tesco. The prices are so much cheaper, and it is the same brand. Because we sell a lot of branded products. CNN: Do you think the economic downturn has helped your business model in some ways? Nadir Lalani:  Yeah...to certain extent, yes, definitely. Like, if you look at November, Britain's retail sales were down. We were seven percent up, like for like, which is very, very good in this climate. There are very few companies who would have achieved that. CNN: And why is that? Nadir Lalani: It's just the product. What we offer to our customer, is unbelievable value. Even a multimillionaire likes a bargain. CNN: How has your experience in Africa aided the growth of your business? Nadir Lalani: You see in Africa, when you do business, it's more trading, and the trading element helps us a lot here. We are just traders. Buy cheap, sell cheap. See also: Agriculture must play 'critical role' in Africa's future . CNN: How do you view the African market? Nadir Lalani: I would like to go back and invest there. CNN: And why do you think it's a good place to invest? Nadir Lalani: Because the market is still young. There are a lot potentials there. I am looking for a moment to invest there you know. Manufacturing, that's what they need. Because they don't want to spend their currency, foreign exchange importing. They need manufacture locally, they need industry in Africa. So they can be more dependable on themselves.","Nadir Lalani, founder of 99p Stores talks about growing a business in recession .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Justin Ross Harris apparently called himself RJ on a social media personal networking site through which he met a woman that police say he was messaging on the day his son was dying in a hot SUV outside his office building. On a profile on the Skout website, ""RJ"" posted three profile photos, all of which appear to be Harris. The Georgia father has been charged with murder and child cruelty in the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. The Skout user says he is a married man from Smyrna, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. It lists his age as 27. Harris, who is 33, lives in nearby Marietta. ""Just looking to talk. Message me, I'm harmless,"" the profile creator wrote. The profile was last updated five months ago. There is a post on the page from a year ago, but it is was not possible to determine how long the profile had been up or to say with certainty that Harris had created the profile. A message left with Ross Harris' attorney, H. Maddox Kilgore, was not immediately returned Tuesday night. Police say Harris left son Cooper strapped into a car seat in his SUV for seven hours while he went to work on June 18. Records show that the mercury topped 92 that day, and police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father's workplace. Kilgore said at a hearing last week that his client forgot Cooper was in the car. Harris has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Who is Justin Ross Harris? Death highlights key role of digital evidence . Harris messaged six women, one of whom was underage, and exchanged explicit texts from work while Cooper Harris was dying, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a probable cause hearing last week. Harris allegedly sent explicit photos, including one of an erect penis, to an underage female. Stoddard said Harris was using a messaging service called Kik and one of the women had told him she met Harris on Skout. Kilgore repeatedly objected to the testimony being used at the hearing. But the judge allowed the testimony. Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox found probable cause to move forward on murder and child cruelty charges. ""For him to enter the car ... when the child had been dead and rigor mortis had set in, and the testimony is the stench in the car was overwhelming at that point in time, that he -- in spite of that -- got in the car and drove it for some distance before he took any action to check on the welfare of his child, I find there is probable cause for the two charges contained in the warrant,"" Cox told a packed courtroom. Harris remains in jail. His wife, Leanna Harris, visited Tuesday, according to WXIA, an Atlanta TV station and CNN affiliate. It is unclear whether she was able to see her husband. A series of documents released Monday revealed more details of the investigation. The documents, which include applications for search warrants and eight actual search warrants in the case against Harris, seek the medical records of Harris and his late son, a DVD, a 2-gigabyte memory card, a 32GB thumb drive and an external hard drive. 5 questions about mother in toddler's hot-car death .

"(CNN) -- Casey James Fury simply didn't want to be at work, and in the process cost the Navy nearly a half-billion dollars and one attack submarine. Fury admitted to setting fire to the USS Miami, a nuclear sub, in May 2012 while it was in dry dock. He was sentenced to 17 years in federal prison in March and ordered to pay $400 million in restitution -- roughly the cost of the damage. The Navy won't see anything close to that amount from Fury, of course, but neither will it from Uncle Sam. On Tuesday, the Navy announced that despite the demand for attack submarines being ""as strong as ever,"" the Miami is being inactivated. The reason: Under sequestration, the federal government's forced budget cuts, the Navy simply can't afford to make the repairs. ""The type of damage was unlike anything we'd seen in recent memory,"" Rear Admiral Richard Breckenridge, director of undersea warfare, said on a Navy Live blog post. ""The anticipated scope of work is four times greater than any previous submarine repair due to damage,"" the post continued. Military shows Congress where mandatory cuts will hit home . Breckenridge blamed across-board budget cuts, saying, ""Sequestration pressures remove the needed foundation of stability to support an endeavor of this magnitude."" Fury was working inside the Miami on May 23 as a painter and sandblaster while the Los Angeles-class attack submarine was at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine undergoing a massive overhaul. Initial investigations by the Navy found that the fire may have been started by a vacuum cleaner. But a federal criminal complaint said Fury admitted to setting fire to a pile of rags near a vacuum cleaner in a stateroom in the submarine. Seven people were injured in the blaze, including three shipyard firefighters. The sub's reactor was not operating when the fire broke out and remained unaffected and stable throughout, Capt. Bryant Fuller, commander for the shipyard, said at the time. Fury also admitted to starting a second fire at the dry dock three weeks later, according to federal court documents. The second fire was started in an area underneath the submarine where Fury was working. In both cases, he told investigators that he started the fires because he was having extreme anxiety and was trying to get out of work, according to federal documents. U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, expressed their disappointment at the announcement, saying in a statement that inactivating the Miami, ""will mean a loss to our nuclear submarine fleet -- yet another unfortunate consequence of the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. We will continue to work together to find a responsible budget solution that replaces sequestration."" Japan launches largest warship since World War II . The Miami was commissioned in 1990 and was one of 42 Los Angeles-class subs in the U.S. fleet. It carried a crew of 12 officers and 98 enlisted personnel, according to the Navy, and was capable of carrying Tomahawk cruise missiles and Mark 48 torpedoes. No weapons were on board at the time of either fire, according to the Navy. This is the second warship the Navy has lost this year. The USS Guardian, a minesweeper, ran aground on the Tubbataha Reef in the Philippines in January, damaging an estimated 43,000 square feet of the UNESCO World Heritage site. To prevent further damage to the reef, salvagers had to cut it into pieces to lift off. It was struck from the fleet in February.

"(CNN) -- I've never understood how someone can eat just one Oreo. In my mind, those scrumptious cookies are supposed to be eaten in groups of six or eight or more, and it would be a culinary sin not to wash them down with a large glass of milk. My name is Ron Cothran, and I am a food addict. I used to fill up on stuff, not really knowing what I was eating but just going through the motions until I got my ""fix."" Most of the time I was left with guilt, gas and a growing stomach to accompany my gluttony. People would tell me simply ""don't eat that"" or ""just don't buy it"" or ""leave it alone."" Once in a while, it would work. But most of the time, there was an almost uncontrollable urge to indulge -- I just had to have whatever it was that I thought my taste buds were craving. My name is Ron Cothran, and I am a food addict. Is it possible for a person to be addicted to something that they need to sustain life? Modern science tells us that the nicotine in cigarettes can be as addictive as heroin. We know that alcoholics are always susceptible to their drink of choice. But what about food? There's compelling research to suggest certain foods affect the brain's pleasure centers the same way addictive substances do, but experts disagree on whether the cravings rise to the level of addiction. Diabetes took my teeth but not my life . After my gastric bypass surgery, I had to eat only soft foods for two weeks. During that time, a national chain was advertising its chicken-fried steak sandwich. That was the last thing I needed after what I had just put my body through. But the urge was so strong that I ended up going to the restaurant, ordering the sandwich, and bite by bite, chewing each morsel, then spitting it out back into the bag. How stupid was that? I could have endangered myself if I had swallowed, but I felt I had to satisfy the craving. My name is Ron Cothran, and I am a food addict. I know now that my addiction to food was a symptom of a much deeper problem. I can't tell you when it started, but food had become my confidant. It wouldn't openly condemn me; it wouldn't make fun of me. It made me feel good (while I was eating it), and it was always there when I wanted attention. It was my little secret -- my reward for working so hard for everybody else. Fit Nation: Too young not to run . I didn't realize this about myself until I had gone through my surgery and was forced to find a new way to deal with difficult circumstances. I no longer could eat to feel better; I needed to find a healthier way to deal with life. I chose to make a healthy lifestyle my goal, and notable successes I found along the way became the warm fuzzies I needed to validate that I was a worthy individual. I believe that my food addiction is real. I have been ""sober"" now for six years and two months, and I feel great. Here's the good news: As long as you have breath, you have the ability to change. It is not a battle of the tongue, but a battle of the mind. Yes, I used weight loss surgery to start the process, but it is only a tool, not a cure. I had to hit rock bottom before I realized that I have the ability to decide each day how my life is going to go. Once I made the decision to live the second half of my life better than the first, a new journey began. It has been rough at times. I still get a craving now and then, but the difference is in how I respond. I have let things into my life that have so much more value than the satisfaction of a chicken-fried steak sandwich. Nothing tastes as good as the feeling of good health. More from Ron: That dying patient could have been me .","Experts disagree on whether food cravings rise to the level of addiction .

"(CNN) -- I would like to think that the horrific killings of Israeli and Palestinian children in recent days -- and the ongoing escalation between Israel and Hamas over Gaza -- will force a moment of truth, more rational thinking and real options to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But I know better. There is still not enough pain and prospects of gain to warrant that. Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, Israelis and Palestinians have entered another yet violent cycle of reaction and counterreaction. Here are five essential elements to keep in mind as we watch another sequel in this tragic and long-running movie: . First, we're not on the verge of a third intifada. True, the situation is raw, tense and full of passion, with a kind of ""there will be blood"" atmosphere. But a sustained uprising or military confrontation on the part of West Bankers and Gazans along the lines of the first or second intifadas is likely not in the cards. The Palestinian public's priorities are economic and social development. Unlike Yasser Arafat, PLO head Mahmoud Abbas really has given up the gun. And Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation seems to be holding. Hamas' motives are more suspect, and it may well have a stake in escalation in the West Bank. But Hamas cannot provoke a sustained uprising on its own without broad public support. Israel's success in breaking the second intifada is still a fresh memory. Moreover, Hamas suicide attacks badly undermined the Palestinian image, and Palestinians don't have much stomach for a return to such tactics. Second, the conflict has become personalized. It's always been characterized by a perverse intimacy driven by the reality of proximity. One way to view it is the old chestnut that the lack of peace is because the Israelis and Palestinians don't really know one another. The other more cynical and real view also applies: They know one another only too well. And they don't like what they see. Unlike Israelis and Egyptians or Israelis and Jordanians, Israelis and Palestinians are living on top of one another as occupier and occupied. And although the murder of innocents, particularly children, makes today's situation worse, we've been through grimmer periods: two intifadas; two Israeli-Hamas confrontations over Gaza in which civilians died, including children; and many acts of terror and violence. Indeed, horrific acts have long characterized Israeli-Palestinian interaction. In 1994, an Israeli settler massacred some 30 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In May 2001, the bodies of two Israeli teens were discovered in a cave in the West Bank -- their skulls crushed with rocks, their killers never found. Third, Gaza is exploding (again). The conflict in Gaza is real and dangerous. We've also seen this movie before. In 2008 and 2012, we watched sustained confrontations with airstrikes, rockets and artillery between Israel and Hamas. And the results were predictably the same. No clear winner and no clear loser. Israel has never been willing to invade Gaza, reoccupy it or supplant the Hamas government there. And Hamas' high-trajectory weapons have increased in range, lethality and precision, guaranteeing the organization a certain amount of leverage. It's likely Israel does not want to mount a serious ground incursion and is hoping that airstrikes in Gaza and 40,000 troops mobilizing the border will be enough to get Hamas to back down and restore calm. Hamas' end game isn't altogether clear. They have posited demands for calm that include the release of prisoners arrested during the Israelis' recent sweep of the West Bank and have called upon Egypt to open up the Rafah crossing from Gaza into Egypt. No matter how this latest escalation ends, one thing seems pretty certain. It will not end in a definitive solution. Hamas is likely to remain ensconced in Gaza unless the Israelis are prepared to uproot it. And that will require not only a ground invasion but reoccupation. The notion that Israel could invade Gaza, kick out Hamas and then put Abbas' Fatah in charge strains credulity to the breaking point. It's highly unlikely, particularly if an Israeli invasion led to significant Palestinian civilian casualties, that Abbas could ride to victory on the back of Israeli tanks. Fourth, the U.S. role. There's not a great deal that the United States should or could do at this point. With Israel in the middle of its Operation Protective Edge, a mediation effort has no point. The problem isn't between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abbas; it's between Israel and Hamas. And the Egyptians and Israelis have a demonstrated track record in finding ways to calm the situation, assuming Hamas is interested. Should the situation get to the point where Israel and Egypt need U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to intervene, the importance of a U.S. role might grow. But the last thing Washington needs right now is Kerry in Israel unable to stop Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rockets. As for the situation in the wake of the killings of Israeli and Palestinian teens, it's hard to imagine what the U.S. could do. What is essential is that both Israel and the Palestinians work to calm matters -- and they don't need U.S. talking points to grasp how dangerous the situation is for them. Fifth, what happens when this phase of violence passes? It's hopeful to think Israelis and Palestinians would see that it's urgent to find a way not only to de-escalate, but to resolve their conflict. But this is highly unlikely. It would be one thing if this were a two-way conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. But it's three-way, including Hamas. And the faux unity deal reached between Hamas and Abbas will not survive. Hamas will remain a spoiler, lacking the power to disrupt a real peace process but always a potential troublemaker. But even without Hamas, the upshot of Kerry's 10-month peace process effort reveals just how far apart Abbas and Netanyahu are on the core issues, such as Jerusalem, refugees and security. And so far, little in the current situation indicates that is likely to force a recalculation. Not enough pain or prospects of gain outweighs the reality -- however inconvenient -- that Abbas and Netanyahu believe that the risk of changing the status quo is more dangerous than maintaining it. The peace process is like rock and roll. It will never die. And I'm certain that sometime before the end of the administration, Kerry will make another serious run. But unless there's a fundamental change in Israeli or Palestinian views, it's highly likely that Washington -- and the parties too -- will remain trapped between a two-state solution that's just too hard to implement and yet too important to abandon.","Aaron Miller: Five elements to keep in mind in this Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush on Monday said he reluctantly accepted the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, whose ""good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons."" Alberto Gonzales and his wife, Rebecca, have lunch with President and Laura Bush at the Bush ranch Sunday. After months of standing by his top prosecutor and ""close friend,"" Bush spoke briefly in Texas to praise Gonzales, saying the attorney general endured ""unfair treatment that has created harmful distraction at the Justice Department."" Bush said it's ""sad that we live in a time when a talented and honorable person"" is impeded ""from doing important work."" Solicitor General Paul Clement will serve as acting attorney general, Bush said, until a nominee has been confirmed by the Senate. Earlier in Washington, Gonzales announced his resignation, saying, ""I have lived the American dream."" The first Latino to helm the Justice Department said his ""worst days as attorney general have been better than my father's best days.""  Watch Gonzales on his ""worst days"" as top prosecutor » . Gonzales  described public service as ""honorable and noble"" and thanked Bush for his friendship. ""Yesterday I met with President Bush and informed him of my decision to conclude my government services as attorney general of the United States effective September 17."" Neither Bush nor Gonzales took questions from reporters. Some senior administration officials floated Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff as a possible replacement, but others waved CNN away from Chertoff, saying that his nomination could run into problems because of his role during Hurricane Katrina. A congressional source familiar with deliberations about Gonzales' replacement told CNN that the successor will not be Chertoff and that senior administration officials are ""playing you guys,"" referring to the media. A source close to Chertoff said of a possible nomination, ""this would be a surprise to Mike."" New York Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also suggested that a Chertoff confirmation hearing would be contentious. ""I would say there are a lot of questions about Michael Chertoff that will have to be answered."" Schumer said. ""I wouldn't say yes; I wouldn't say no.  It's an open book.  It's possible, but its hardly a slam dunk.  There are some names who could be a slam dunk."" Schumer, one of Gonzales' chief critics, appealed to the administration ""to work with us to nominate someone whom Democrats can support and America can be proud of."" Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee who has criticized Gonzales' leadership of the Justice Department, called his resignation ""a major helpful turn of events."" Specter suggested current or former senators, or someone well-known to the committee would be a good nominee to replace Gonzales. ""There has to be somebody with very solid professional qualifications, somebody who's an experienced lawyer and has demonstrated the kind of judgment that the attorney general is called upon to display,"" Specter said. A senior administration official ""aware of discussions"" said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten is looking for a Washington establishment-type, in the model of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and White House counsel Fred Fielding. Another name that emerged is Larry Thompson, a former deputy attorney general who currently serves as vice president and general counsel for PepsiCo. But a spokeswoman for the company said, ""We are very fortunate and pleased, but he is very happy in his role here."" According to senior administration officials, when Thompson has been approached in the past to return to the government he has turned down offers, saying he is happy in the private sector. Aides at the highest level and other top officials received no warning about the Gonzales announcement, Justice Department sources told CNN. They were not informed until a meeting Monday morning, sources said, when Gonzales acknowledged he would be reading a statement later in the day. Although Bush had long stood by Gonzales, many members of Congress from both sides of the aisle had called on him to quit after the firing of several U.S. attorneys in 2006 -- terminations which were alleged to have been politically motivated. Senior Justice Department officials say Gonzales' resignation is not expected to affect the scope or pace of an ongoing internal investigation into the U.S. attorneys' dismissals and other issues. ""Alberto Gonzales was never the right man for this job,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday. ""He lacked independence, he lacked judgment and he lacked the spine to say no to Karl Rove."" Rove, another longtime Bush official and his top political adviser, also resigned this month. ""This resignation is not the end of the story,"" Reid warned. ""Congress must get to the bottom of this mess and follow the facts where they lead, into the White House."" Throughout Gonzales' time as attorney general, controversies surrounded his positions on issues such as U.S. interrogation techniques and the wiretapping of conversations between Americans and suspected terrorists overseas. In the probe into the U.S. attorney firings, the Senate Judiciary Committee looked into whether the administration may have fired some or all of the U.S. attorneys for political reasons. In his testimony before the committee on multiple occasions, Gonzales repeatedly seemed to contradict himself, other members of his department or Justice Department documents. Gonzales also was at the center of a dispute over the controversial no-warrant eavesdropping program authorized by Bush and his testimony that there was no dissent among administration officials over the program. Gonzales later sent a letter to Senate leaders acknowledging he ""may have created confusion"" in his testimony. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- New York restaurants can continue selling large sugary drinks after an appeals court sided Tuesday with a lower court ruling that found the city's restrictions on such beverages to be ""arbitrary and capricious."" The Supreme Court's Appellate Division found that the city's Board of Health ""failed to act within the bounds of its lawfully delegated authority"" when it moved to ban sugary drinks of more than 16 ounces in New York City restaurants, movie theaters, and other food service establishments. New York appeals soda-cup decision . The court declared the regulation to be a violation of the principle of separation of powers doctrine. The doctrine establishes the boundaries between the legislature and an administrative agency. Since legislative power rests in the legislature, according to the appellate decision, the board members cannot engage in broad-based public policy determinations and ""cannot exercise sweeping power to create whatever rule they deem necessary."" The 11-member Board of Health is empowered to modify the health code only with ""respect to all matters to which the power and authority of New York City Department of Mental Health and Hygiene extend,"" the appellate court said. This includes Article 81 of the health code, which sets forth rules regulating ""food service establishments."" Sugary drinks linked to 180,000 deaths worldwide . Mayor Michael Bloomberg firmly disagreed. ""Today's decision is a temporary setback, and we plan to appeal this decision as we continue the fight against the obesity epidemic,"" he said. On the other hand, the American Beverage Association welcomed the ruling. ""We are pleased that the lower court's decision was upheld,"" said Christopher Gindlesperger, senior director of public affairs at the American Beverage Association.

"(CNN) -- Amos Yadlin, formerly chief of Defense Intelligence for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), observed this week that the Israeli public typically goes through wartime ""cycles"": first showing sweeping support and then, as civilian and military deaths begin, growing impatient and putting pressure on politicians to end hostilities. Therefore, as Yadlin put it, ""the ability of the Israeli home front to withstand a campaign that lasts for more than a week is a key factor in the outcome."" In recent years, though, Israel's missile defense system, Iron Dome, has had a significant impact on that home front's resilience -- and therefore on the calculus of Israel's leaders. Of course, Israel's overwhelming military superiority over Gaza-based militants ensures that Israeli deaths in Gaza wars have always been relatively low. Nine Israelis were killed in the two-week ground offensive in 2009, Operation Cast Lead, compared to well over a thousand Palestinians. The November 2012 airstrikes, Operation Pillar of Defense, resulted in six Israeli deaths compared to 167 Palestinians. But the political impact of rocket attacks is greater than these numbers suggest, particularly when usually safe areas come under fire. In 2012, Hamas' longer-range rockets targeted both Tel Aviv, causing air raid sirens to sound there for the first time since Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles towards the city during the first Gulf War two decades previously, and Jerusalem, which had not been struck since 1970. Although no casualties were inflicted, Hamas demonstrated its ability to threaten Israel's two largest and most important cities. It has done so again in the past week, and additionally promised to target Ben-Gurion International Airport. Although Hamas faces difficulties in importing its most sophisticated rockets, owing to the new Egyptian government's demolition of key tunnels connecting Gaza with the Sinai Peninsula, Israel's head of Military Intelligence Analysis estimates that the group has still managed to double its stockpile since the 2012 war, to approximately 10,000 rockets, suggesting that it could sustain attacks for months. The Israeli leadership therefore faces twin pressures. On the one hand, as Yadlin suggests, an open-ended campaign of airstrikes that fails to suppress rocket attacks or demonstrate other strategic achievements could meet with increasing public opposition. On the other hand, a successful rocket attack that inflicts deaths -- particularly in a symbolic area, like Tel Aviv or Jerusalem -- could put sudden pressure on Israeli leaders to escalate, and send ground troops into Gaza. Any such invasion, involving urban combat in a densely populated urban environment that Hamas knows well, would result in higher IDF casualties, extremely high Palestinian casualties, enormous damage to civilian infrastructure, and the prospect of Israeli troops being taken hostage. This is why, despite getting his Cabinet to authorize the enlistment of 40,000 reservists last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has refrained from launching a ground assault. Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, which came to prominence in the 2012 conflict, affects this dynamic in important ways. Although there is intense debate over its effectiveness -- critics argue that the system is knocking rockets to the ground without detonating them, and that it destroys fewer than half -- Israel says that it has successfully intercepted 90% of those rockets that it engaged in this campaign. Even if this is exaggerated, Iron Dome's ability to shield population centers and key infrastructure has two important effects. First, it buys time for Israel to continue airstrikes without facing popular impatience. Second, it lessens the prospect that a rocket will inflict deaths in a way that forces the government to launch a costly ground invasion it doesn't truly want. Taken together, this suggests that Iron Dome gives the IDF more time to strike Gaza from the air, and therefore to weaken Hamas, with less pressure to put boots on the ground. It is important to note that even if Iron Dome is highly effective, there are still other sources of pressure on the Israeli government. Calling up tens of thousands of reservists in a country of just 8 million people places strain on the domestic economy, and pressure quickly mounts to demobilize those forces. Moreover, international pressure also grows over time. For instance, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah el-Sisi is hostile to Hamas and has refrained from commenting, but a mounting Palestinian death toll would draw him further into the conflict, possibly persuading him to open land borders with Gaza. Finally, the longer the conflict drags on, the greater the likelihood that Iron Dome's imperfections will be revealed, and that a rocket will get through. These factors mean that the clock is still ticking for Netanyahu -- though perhaps at a slower pace than it used to. How Iron Dome blocks rockets from Gaza, protects Israelis .

"(CNN) -- We moved to suburban Akron in January 2003, just months before LeBron James graduated from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers. My teenage sons were 3 and 5 years old when we became Cavaliers season ticket holders during James' rookie year. We were faithful Cavs regulars for eight seasons. Four years ago, my son, now 16, was devastated when James took his talents to Miami. He still has a Cavaliers' James Fathead poster in his room. James' house is within walking distance to ours. Our sons went to the same school. My 13-year-old is a bit older, but would chat with and high-five James' son, LeBron Jr. James Sr. played basketball with the middle school boys when the school opened a new gym. He talked to the children in the halls, often urging them to do well in school. We'd see him shopping at Target or Best Buy, but we would give him his space. You see, my sons like James. They grew up with James. He's their neighbor. And now he's home. Friday's announcement that James is returning to northeast Ohio capped off a spectacular week of Cleveland in the national spotlight. On Monday, thanks to the diligence of hardworking local organizers, the Republican National Committee announced its 2016 convention would be hosted in Cleveland. The city is experiencing a renaissance and the world is taking note, even if national media is having a hard time embracing it. For those who hadn't noticed, things are indeed hot in Cleveland. A new convention center recently opened, hotels are being built, businesses are moving in, the biotech industry is thriving. The Cleveland Browns have a hopeful new star and the prodigal son is coming home. The sun has never shined as bright in Cleveland as it did Friday. As a crowd gathered Friday afternoon in front of Quicken Loans Arena, home of the Cleveland Cavaliers and host of the RNC's 2016 convention, residents celebrated. ""Stuff like this doesn't happen to Cleveland,"" several fans said, repeatedly. Clevelanders have endured the departure of its athletic stars, the failure to win championships of its teams and the mockery that has come from political and sports analysts about why a political convention or the NBA's biggest star would go to Cleveland. Yes, Cleveland was heartbroken when James announced his decision to go to Miami. But the city's wrath was never as extreme as the national media played it. Everyone wasn't intoxicated and burning jerseys as the ongoing loop on sports television suggested. We were, however, a city scorned. Many, if not most, understood the decision but hated the way it was delivered -- especially the people of Akron. But even then, kids bought the Heat jerseys or James sneakers and followed @KingJames religiously on Twitter. Some men, young and old, even bought plane tickets to watch James play in Miami. Still, James' departure stung. It hurt. It was personal. He had loyalty tattooed on his chest. For Clevelanders, that was supposed to mean something. Months later, I wrote a personal letter to James that I never mailed. In it, I told him that the choice was his to make but his departure method had made me cringe. The mother in me wished he had gone to The 'Q to shake the hands of the security guards, custodial staff and the kitchen staff and to look in the eyes of Cavaliers leadership while thanking them for unwavering support. I wanted to tell him how much he had bruised our local children. I wanted him to set a better example. I wanted him to know there were still boys in Copley, Bath and Akron who were looking up to him. But today is a new day. Cleveland is standing proud and tall. It's distinguished by its passion, a passion that outsiders don't always understand and those of us who live here don't always appreciate. No other city has greater cheerleaders or bigger fans. As political analysts second-guessed this week's RNC choice rather than the selection of Dallas and as sports analysts complained about having to spend more time working in Cleveland rather than sipping mojitos on South Beach, the people who live here have a deeply affectionate relationship with the city. As Rachel Talton, a local business owner tweeted, ""It's been an amazing week for our beloved Cleveland. RNC and LeBron. So exciting."" What the world is witnessing is true civic pride. The kind of pride that comes when you believe you've worked hard and someone else has finally noticed. Ours is pride that comes from feeling like someone has finally stood up for you. On Friday, LeBron James stood up for Cleveland, for Akron, for northeast Ohio. I never mailed my letter to Mr. James, but I think he has long since gotten the message. Welcome home LeBron.

"(CNN) -- It sounds like the plot from an old movie: airline crew members make this passenger announcement, ""Is anyone on board a pilot?"" That was the situation last December when Air Force Capt. Mark Gongol and his wife and daughter were traveling from Des Moines to Denver aboard a United Boeing 737. ""I looked at my wife and she looked back at me and she said, 'I think you should ring the call button,'"" Gongol told CNN on Tuesday. Gongol, who pilots B1B Lancer bombers, already could tell something was wrong. Flight attendants were rushing to the front of the aircraft. One was carrying a first-aid kit. When Gongol reached the cockpit, it was clear the captain was in trouble. Passengers and crew were helping him out of the cockpit. A cot had been set up. The captain looked pale and clammy from an apparent heart attack, Gongol remembered. Gongol stepped onto the flight deck and came eye to eye with the first officer. ""There was a moment,"" he recalled. ""We both had about five seconds to size each other up. She was wondering about my level of experience. Was I a Cessna driver -- or a professional pilot? ""I wanted to make sure she was OK. I had a feeling she was -- she was better than OK. She had already made the decision to turn the plane toward the nearest airport."" Gongol strapped himself in and did what he could to help get the plane to the airport in Omaha. Never taking the controls, Gongol acted as a backup for the first officer. He worked the radio, communicating with air traffic controllers -- updating them on the condition of the captain, passengers and the aircraft. Although he never suspected he would have to fly the plane, piloting a B1B bomber isn't too different from a 737, Gongol explained. ""A plane is a plane,"" he said. ""It's like the difference between driving a pickup truck, or a sedan. The same skills transfer."" After landing, the airliner taxied as near a terminal gate as possible -- and ground crew maneuvered a rolling stairway to one of the plane's exits. The captain was rushed by ambulance for treatment. After Gongol and his family got off the aircraft, they simply ""slinked out the back door,"" with the Air Force pilot feeling confident he'd done all he could to help. Gongol's story never surfaced until recently, when the Air Force received requests from news reporters. Later Gongol received some good news: the captain had survived -- and recovered. ""The captain called me up a month or two later,"" Gongol remembered. ""He said it was a really rotten event, but fortunately a lot of things fell into place."" And what did Gongol's wife say after this memorable flight? ""She said, 'Good job,'"" Gongol laughed. ""She's a woman of few words. She was happy that I was there.""

"(OPRAH.com) -- A year ago, writer Lori Gottlieb set off a firestorm -- that's what Meredith Vieira called it on the ""Today"" show -- with an essay in The Atlantic titled ""Marry Him!"" Her argument: If you're a woman on the cusp of 30, you should suck it up and settle down with Mr. Good Enough, as waiting for Mr. Right probably means missing out, resigning yourself to a purgatory of depressing dates and meaningless flings until, finally, no one bothers to call anymore because you're, gulp, too old. In a generation of women coming off the bacchanal of ""Sex and the City"", Gottlieb's article hit like a horrible hangover. It entered the pantheon of incendiary articles about women and marriage that pop up in every era -- like the outrageous (and later debunked) claim, in Newsweek in 1986, that a 40-year-old woman was more likely to be killed by a terrorist than marry. Gottlieb's piece polarized readers. Some said her argument was common sense, that women must confront the biological realities that suggest they're most marriageable when they're young and fertile. Other readers said she was telling women to sell out their dreams and shut down their hearts. Oprah.com: 6 love decisions we've made for you . In time for Valentine's Day, Gottlieb is back, with an entire book devoted to her theory. Part ""The Rules"" and part Malcolm Gladwellian sociopop, ""Marry Him: The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough"" is surprisingly, unnervingly convincing. Gottlieb interviewed an array of experts -- sociologists, behavioral economists, social psychologists, and statisticians -- who presented evidence about why online dating doesn't work, what women can really expect when they're in their 40s (there are only 72 single men for every 100 women in the 45-to-65-year-old demographic, according to a U.S. Census figure she cites), and why women are fundamentally the choosier sex. ""There are so many really wonderful men out there, men who want commitment, who want to be married, who are attractive and smart and interesting,"" Gottlieb says. ""They may not be movie-star attractive, they may be awkward at first, they may not fit our cultural image of who Mr. Right or who Prince Charming is. But we shouldn't pass them up. Look what happened to me."" What happened to Gottlieb? Educated and independent, she is gorgeous, vivacious, and sharply witty. She went to Stanford Medical School; she has written several books, two of which have been optioned by Hollywood. In other words, she is such a fantastic catch that she assumed she would never have to settle, that a Superhusband -- romantic, brilliant, baggage-free -- would emerge from the ether and sweep her into an eternally fulfilling marriage. But, she says, she missed the boat -- several times -- by focusing on potential mates' flaws and expecting too much. Now 42, she has a 4-year-old son, courtesy of a sperm donor. ""We are taught as young women in this culture that compromise is a bad word,"" she says. ""We tell each other: 'You go, girl. You get the best. You deserve the best.' It's not so much narcissism as a false cultural perception of our worth. We want the ten, because we think we're a ten. But we're missing the fact that we're not. Nobody is. Men have flaws, but we have flaws, too."" Oprah.com: What woman learned from dating 100 men . Surely, some women will find ""Marry Him"" more than a little off-putting. Its subtitle makes the prospect of marriage sound like a life sentence. And sometimes Gottlieb's call to arms sounds so pragmatic as to be loveless. Readers may also ask, what is an unhappily single woman doing, telling us how and why to get married? But maybe the question is, who better? For a woman who once wouldn't have thought of dating a short man in a bow tie, she has come a long way. (In the book, Gottlieb described dating just such a guy, and you root for the pair, until he moves to Chicago.) She is currently ""accepting invitations from men everywhere,"" she says with a laugh.

"Eckernfoerde, Germany (CNN) -- It is almost totally silent, radiates virtually no heat and is constructed entirely from non-magnetic metals. Meet the U212A -- an ultra-advanced non-nuclear sub developed by German naval shipyard Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft, who claim it to be ""the peak of German submarine technology."" And few would argue. The super-stealth vessel is the first of its kind to be powered by a revolutionary hydrogen fuel cell that lets it cruise the deep blue without giving off noise or exhaust heat. That's important, because according to Bernd Arjes, a captain in the German Navy, silence keeps submariners alive. ""We operate in coastal waters around Europe and this submarine is specially designed for finding submarines. If you want to find other submarines of course you have to be quiet,"" he said. With this latest technology, he added, ""the boat is virtually undetectable."" But being indistinguishable is not the only thing that sets the U212A apart. Unlike conventional subs, which need air to combust diesel, the fuel cell doesn't require oxygen to operate. This means it can remain submerged for many weeks -- holding its breath many times longer than its gas-guzzling cousins. You'd expect a boat like this to pack a punch, and you'd be right. The 212A is armed with 12 heavyweight wire guided torpedoes, each capable of destroying a war ship or disabling an aircraft carrier. ""An aircraft carrier might not break with one torpedo but probably gets hit at the rudder or something. And then he probably can't maneuver into the wind to use his aircraft,"" said Arjes. Germany, which has no nuclear weapons or nuclear-powered ships of its own, is the world's third largest exporter of defense goods. HDW began developing the technology for the U212A in 1994, with the first vessels reaching market in 2003. Export editions have already been sold to the navies of Greece, Portugal and South Korea. But sub-aquatic sailors around the world should think twice before getting too excited over this new toy. With a high degree of self-automation, the sub requires only a small crew and there is extraordinarily little in the way of creature comforts for those few on board. And so it seems that even with all this state-of-the-art technology, a submariners life still remains one of confined living quarters and shared bunks.","The U212A is an ultra-advanced non-nuclear sub developed for the German Navy .

"(EW.com) -- Greendale may not have closed its doors for good after all: Hulu is currently in talks with Sony Pictures TV for a sixth season of the recently cancelled ""Community,"" a source close to the show tells EW. (Deadline first reported the news.) Sony and Hulu aren't commenting, and another source stressed caution about such a deal, but a proposed plan would likely include a 13-episode new season of the community college meta-comedy, with creator Dan Harmon in the fold. If by chance an agreement were reached, it would push the show past the 100-episode milestone (it's at 97), and, of course, bring it one crucial step closer to fulfilling fans' rally cries of ""six seasons and a movie."" EW: 'Community' canceled . Hulu is a logical destination for the show, as it already owns the exclusive digital rights to the ""Community's"" first five seasons. (The off-network rights belong to Comedy Central.) The streaming service is committed to expanding its original programming, which currently includes shows like The Awesomes, Deadbeat and East Los High, as well as Casey Wilson's upcoming Real Housewives parody The Hotwives of Orlando, but original episodes of Community would put HuluPlus — with its six million subscribers — on the map in a bigger way, much like the revival of Arrested Development did for Netflix. Earlier this month, NBC officially cut bait on ""Community,"" whose fifth season averaged 3.8 million viewers and a 1.6 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic, including DVR playback. Harmon has kept expectations in check about the possibility of the show — which had made scoring a last-minute renewal from NBC an annual rite — finding a second life elsewhere. Responding to the cancellation news on his blog, he said he was open to making more episodes (""I'm not going to be the guy who recancels cancelled Community"") but also noted: ""[T]here are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult.

"(CNN) -- Everyone knows Hong Kong as the buzzy island city home to over seven million people perpetually on the move. But it may be a surprise to learn that many of the residents in this bustling city don't spend much time foraging in their pockets for change, especially on public transport. Instead, they whip out their Octopus, a contactless smart card with a chip that communicates with a fare processor in less than a second. It has been in use in Hong Kong since 1997. According to the company, around 95 percent of people in Hong Kong between the ages of 16-65 have an Octopus card, and their transactions add up to about 18 million dollars every day. But what's new about Octopus is that recent advances in technology mean that it's being used with phones too. ""Now with the advance of smart card technology, we've been able to embed the Octopus mobile SIM inside a smartphone,"" explained Octopus CEO Kevin Goldmintz, in an interview with CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Trains, buses, trams and ferries are all popular places to get around with Octopus, whether it's on a card, a phone or a watch. Since the Octopus card was released nearly two decades ago, its use has branched off into much more than just transport. Forgot your wallet, purse or cash? Not to worry. The Octopus can buy your coffee, a movie ticket, clothes, groceries and even allow you to shop online. Another new venture is that Octopus has recently partnered with Taobao, China's e-commerce answer to eBay or Amazon. Though purchases have to remain relatively small with a current ceiling of $130 on each card, Octopus says it allows the customer to easily interact for a purchase. Shoppers simply need to make a purchase on Taobao by putting their phone with the Octopus mobile application up to the screen and tapping to make that transaction happen. Octopus has broadened its reach into mainland China with a dual card in Guangdong province and another in Shenzhen. ""We're able to put a Hong Kong dollar purse inside the card, as an e-wallet,"" said Goldmintz. Octopus says its vision for the next ten years includes tackling the physical/digital convergence and growing its e-commerce strategy. ""And I think the other side of it will also to be exporting the knowledge that we've accumulated over 17 years of doing contactless smart card, and deploying that knowledge in other cities around the world,"" Goldmintz told Stout. As for the future, Octopus is optimistic that a cashless society will spread to other areas, particularly in its own patch of the Asia-Pacific area. ""You know I buy my lunch with my Octopus. I pay for drinks on Octopus. I buy coffee with my Octopus,"" said Goldmintz. ""So I think there will be day when both Hong Kong and other cities around Asia-Pacific particularly will be looking towards a cashless society,"" he said. ""I think we're going to make huge in-roads in the next five to ten years in this."" The best way to experience Hong Kong?

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Soldiers from outside Beijing called to the Chinese capital to boost troop numbers ""were laughing"" as they shot randomly at protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, according to declassified U.S. documents. The documents were among 25 Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) records released to mark 25 years since Chinese authorities sanctioned a brutal crackdown that killed hundreds, if not thousands, of pro-democracy protesters. Each typed report is clearly marked as ""not finally evaluated intelligence,"" and some contain obvious inaccuracies including claims from the U.S. source that Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping had ""died of heart failure."" The source even went as far as to quote a Chinese official who reportedly said Deng's final words were: ""Originally, I did not want to use force."" In fact, Deng died almost 10 years later, in February 1997. Still, the existence of a separate set of observations helps build a picture of the confusion and anger in China as authorities attempted to arrest and silence student protesters. Soldiers shot 'at random' According to one report, a source, whose name has been redacted, claimed members of the ""27th Army"" shot ""'at random at any assembly of persons they encountered' whether demonstrators or not."" Another information report is said to contain details of an exchange between a U.S. source and a female doctor who worked the night shift at Beijing's Capital Hospital on June 4. The doctor said the hospital's director stepped in to prevent the release of any more bodies after they discovered corpses were being cremated soon after being handed over to the Public Security Bureau, the report said. Hospital staff then started photographing the dead so they could later be identified. The doctor told the U.S. source, 85% of the hospital's doctors had been trained in the U.S., and they were confident ""friends in the U.S."" would protect them from persecution by Chinese authorities. In the same report, the U.S. source said ""the real heroes of the massacre were the flatcar pedicab operators who volunteered their services to transport the wounded and dead from Tiananmen Square area to the hospital at the risk of losing heir own lives in the process."" 'Very calm in Beijing' Information filed back to the U.S. also described the atmosphere in Beijing in the months after the crackdown when the city was still under martial law. ""On the surface, Beijing appears very calm,"" one report said. ""Shattered glass windows in buildings have all been replaced, but in the area of the foreign diplomats' apartment houses, one can still see marks on the streets left by tanks."" Standing guard at Tiananmen Square were martial law forces, the report said. The ""neatly dressed"" troops ""looked sharp"" and stood at ""rigid attention,"" according to the report, which noted that it was the first time in recent years that the source had ""seen such well disciplined People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers."" However, outside Tiananmen Square the report said other martial law troops were seen hanging around in groups of three or four ""chatting or smoking, slovenly dressed, and appeared to lack discipline."" After the crackdown, China's leaders were said to be on alert for a possible terror attack. One report claimed leaders rarely left their homes and the license plates on their cars were changed ""as an added security precaution."" The report noted that in the past observers could tell who was at a conference by checking the Mercedes Benz cars parked outside. There was division, the report claimed, within ""the top level of the party"" as to whether the search should continue for students who had taken part in the protests. At that stage, the government had ""more arrested students than they have prison space,"" the report said. Exit checks seemed to have been stepped up at Beijing International Airport, the report claimed, and were ""especially strict for any Chinese who happened to look like a student or an intellectual.""","U.S. releases classified documents to mark 25 years since Tiananmen crackdown .

"(CNN) -- Kashmiri separatist leaders on Monday slammed New Delhi's decision to call off talks with Pakistan, scheduled for August 25 in Islamabad. New Delhi called off the talks after Pakistan's New Delhi-based high commissioner, Abdul Basit, invited Kashmiri separatist leaders for consultations ahead of the summit. ""The Indian foreign secretary conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner today, in clear and unambiguous terms, that Pakistan's continued efforts to interfere in India's internal affairs were unacceptable. It was underlined that the Pakistani high commissioner's meetings with these so-called leaders of the Hurriyat undermines the constructive diplomatic engagement initiated by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi in May on his very first day in office,"" according to a statement from India's External Affairs Ministry. A statement from Islamabad replied, ""It is a longstanding practice that, prior to Pakistan-India talks, meetings with Kashmiri leaders are held to facilitate meaningful discussions on the issue of Kashmir. The Indian decision is a setback to the efforts by our leadership to promote good neighborly relations with India. The prime minister of Pakistan has clearly articulated the vision of peace for development."" ""It seems a knee-jerk reaction,"" said moderate Kashmiri separatist leader Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq. ""We have been meeting the Pakistani officials, including the country's New Delhi-based high commissioner, for the past 20 years. I don't know what happened today. It is a backward step. ""The decision lacks political maturity and cannot be termed as far-sighted."" Mirwaiz is flying to New Delhi on Tuesday to meet with Basit. Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani described the decision as unfortunate, saying it proved that ""New Delhi was never serious to resolve Kashmir peacefully."" Geelani also said he will be meeting with the Pakistan high commissioner in New Delhi on Tuesday. Even mainstream political parties have expressed dismay at the cancellation of the talks. ""It is not a good development. The separatists have been meeting Pakistani officials. They even met the then-Pakistan president, Parvez Musharraf,"" said Ali Mohammad Sagar, a senior ruling National Conference leader and minister. During his visit to Indian-administered Kashmir this month, Modi condemned ""the continued proxy war by neighboring Pakistan."" Addressing army officers and soldiers in the frontier Ladakh region bordering China and Pakistan, Modi said that ""the neighboring country has lost the strength to fight a conventional war but continues to engage in the proxy war of terrorism."" Modi's criticism Islamabad came against in the backdrop of reported cease-fire violations by Pakistani troops on the border and increased militant attacks in Kashmir. Five Indian paramilitary soldiers and police officers have been killed in militant attacks and several others wounded since Modi's visit August 12. The two nuclear armed neighbors had agreed to a bilateral cease-fire on the border in November 2003, but it has seen severe breaches since early 2013. Kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence since 1989; officials say it has claimed 42,000 lives, but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the number at twice that.","India and Pakistan had scheduled talks for next week in Islamabad .

"New York (CNN) -- The Occupy Wall Street demonstrators will leave the confines of Lower Manhattan Tuesday and head uptown, organizers said. An afternoon march will take them past the homes of well-to-do folks like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, billionaire David Koch and News Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch. Nearly four weeks into their protests, demonstrators typically have not strayed too far from downtown, where a home base of sorts has been established at Zuccotti Park. Protesters plan to hop on the subway, emerging at 59th street near Central Park, where they will start their tour just after noon, according to organizers. On Monday, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, music star Kanye West and the Rev. Al Sharpton added their celebrity to the Occupy Wall Street cause. Their visits came as the burgeoning movement continued to echo from coast to coast, voicing impassioned sentiments on a range of topics while commonly railing against what protesters describe as corporate greed, political ineptitude and the inordinate power wielded by the United States' wealthiest people. ""We are here today because we agree 1% should not be controlling the (nation's) wealth,"" Sharpton said on his nationally syndicated radio program. ""These (demonstrators) are regular people trying to feed their families, trying to pay their rent and mortgages, trying to survive."" Police in Boston arrested about 60 people associated with the protests late Monday and early Tuesday, Elaine Driscoll of the Boston Police Department said. Protestors have been occupying Dewey Square Park in downtown Boston, but had expanded to the neighboring Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway on Monday night. Protestors were given a 1:30 a.m. ET deadline to move back to Dewey Square. Those who did not were arrested. The nationwide movement has been largely peaceful, though it has led to some skirmishes with police and arrests, particularly in New York and Washington. It has also stoked fervent public debate, including among politicians. Democrats have generally offered sympathy for protesters' concerns while several Republicans, among them 2012 presidential candidates Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich, have described the demonstrations as ""class warfare."" New York Mayor Bloomberg, an independent, appeared Monday to soften his stance about the protests. Last Friday, he said on WOR radio that some demonstrators were ""trying to destroy the jobs of working people in the city"" and suggested it could only be a matter of time before officials potentially put an end to the Zuccotti Park encampment. Yet, speaking to CNN affiliate WCBS at a Columbus Day parade, the mayor said the city now plans to allow the protesters to stay indefinitely. ""The bottom line is, people want to express themselves, as long as they obey the laws, we'll allow them to,"" he said. The Occupy movement shows few signs of slowing down. Rallies and marches have been held in numerous towns and cities in recent days, with many more planned. That includes a ""Call to Action Against Banks,"" which New York's Occupy Wall Street announced on its Facebook site will happen Saturday. ""No longer will banks take our homes. No longer will banks rob students of our future. No longer will banks destroy the environment. No longer will banks fund the misery of war. No longer will banks cause massive unemployment. And no longer will banks create and profit from economic crisis without a struggle,"" according to the online message Monday. It then urges people to ""visit your local Bank of America, Wells Fargo or Chase (branches) and let them know, we will not allow business as usual."" ""We. Will. Occupy. Everywhere,"" the posting ends. CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report .","NEW: New York's mayor says protesters can stay at the park where they're camping out .

"(CNN) -- Two lawmakers have joined the debate over the name of the Washington Redskins football team, writing a letter to the National Football League calling for a name change and threatening to hold hearings on the subject. The name Redskins is ""an insult to Native Americans,"" according to the two lawmakers, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington state and chairwoman of the Indian Affairs Committee, and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, who is a member of the Chickasaw Nation. ""This term does not honor -- but rather disparages -- Indian people and tribes,"" they wrote in their letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""The National Football League can no longer ignore this and perpetuate the use of this name."" Cantwell said the advocacy of the National Congress of American Indians, including a video made by the organization, was part of what prompted her letter to league officials. NFL officials ""have heard from the leading representatives of Native Americans in our country,"" she said. ""So are they going to change the name, or are they going to continue to use an offensive name?"" The owner of the Redskins, Daniel Snyder, has defended the name and vowed to keep it. Tony Wyllie, a senior vice president with the team, had the following response to the lawmakers: . ""With all the important issues Congress has to deal with such as a war in Afghanistan to deficits to health care, don't they have more important issues to worry about than a football team's name?"" And in an apparent dig at Cole, he added, ""given the fact that the name of Oklahoma means ""Red People"" in Choctaw, this request is a little ironic."" The team also pointed to letters from Redskins fans of Native American descent who support the name, such as Arthur Dymond, who said he went to every game this season. ""I'm proud of being a Redskin. I'm proud of being a Native American,"" he said in an interview. ""It's honorable. The Redskins team plays honorably; they fight hard, as did the 'redskins' of the past."" He also objected to members of Congress getting involved in the issue. Cantwell said she was ready to make an issue of the tax-exempt status the NFL enjoys and plans to push for Senate hearings on the subject. ""With our tight economic budget, we can't afford to have tax breaks going to organizations that basically have terminologies that are offensive to the American people,"" she told CNN. The NFL did not have an immediate reaction to the letter from the lawmakers, but Goodell was asked about the controversy 10 days ago. ""Let me remind you, this is a name of a football team that has had that name for 80 years, and has presented the name in a way that honored Native Americans,"" he said. ""We recognize that there are some that don't agree with the name, and we have listened and respected that.""","Two lawmakers urge the NFL to change the Washington Redskins name .

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles. The board voted eight in favor, with one abstention. ""It's time to face the facts: obesity is one of America's most deadly problems, and sugary beverages are a leading cause of it,"" said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a statement earlier this month. ""As the size of sugary drinks has grown, so have our waistlines -- and so have diabetes and heart disease."" Bloomberg's visionary move against obesity . But the move is expected to draw further protest from the soda industry and those concerned about government involvement in their personal choices. ""What we need in New York are sensible solutions to the obesity issue that focus on a comprehensive approach to tackle an extremely complex problem,"" said Eliot Hoff, a spokesman for a beverage industry-sponsored group called New Yorkers for Beverage Choices. ""New Yorkers are smart enough to decide for themselves what to eat and drink."" Critics, including McDonald's and Coca-Cola, have assailed the ban as ""misguided"" and ""arbitrary,"" though Bloomberg has billed it as both a health and fiscal initiative. New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor said in an earlier statement. Big Gulp? Meet Big Brother . One in eight New Yorkers also suffer from diabetes, a disease often linked to obesity, his office noted, calling sugary drinks ""the single largest driver of these alarming increases in obesity."" About 58% of New York City adults are considered overweight or obese, the mayor added. In 2007, the Bloomberg-appointed health board adopted a regulation that forced restaurants to all but eliminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads, the main sources of trans fats in the U.S. diet. Thursday's decision is expected to take effect in six months and be enforced by the city's regular restaurant inspection team, allowing restaurant owners nine months to adapt to the changes before facing fines. ""6 months from today, our city will be an even healthier place,"" Bloomberg tweeted on Thursday. The ban would not apply to grocery stores.

"(EW.com) -- The major broadcast networks are deep in the trenches of upfronts week, rebuilding their fall lineups for the future.

Rumors immediately began to circle that ""Community"" would get picked up for a long-prophesied sixth season by someone â€” Hulu, or Comedy Central, or I guess now WGN America is a thing? Those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that Community showrunner/messiah/demonic inspiration Dan Harmon didn't actually want ""Community"" to continue.

"(CNN) -- The National Security Agency is reportedly capturing millions of images per day to feed facial recognition programs. Citing top-secret documents obtained by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the New York Times reported the agency 's reliance on such technology has grown in recent years. New software allows the NSA to ""exploit the flood of images included in emails, text messages, social media, videoconferences and other communications,"" the newspaper said. ""The agency intercepts 'millions of images per day' â€” including about 55,000 'facial recognition quality images' â€” which translate into 'tremendous untapped potential,'"" the newspaper reported, citing documents from 2011. Facial recognition is a computer-based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source that is then matched to information stored in a database. The technology is powerful, but not always straightforward. According to the New York Times: ""It has difficulty matching low-resolution images, and photographs of people's faces taken from the side or angles can be impossible to match against mug shots or other head-on photographs."" The newspaper said it was unclear how many images have been acquired, nor was it clear how many people have been caught up in the program. An NSA spokeswoman defended the program. ""We would not be doing our job if we didn't seek ways to continuously improve the precision of signals intelligence activities -- aiming to counteract the efforts of valid foreign intelligence targets to disguise themselves or conceal plans to harm the United States and its allies,"" NSA spokeswoman Vanee M.

"Jakarta (CNN) -- Indonesia will impose a moratorium on sending workers to Saudi Arabia, effective August 1, the country said late Wednesday. The move comes after the Gulf kingdom beheaded an Indonesian worker without first informing the Indonesian government. ""The government has decided to impose a moratorium on the placement of informal Indonesian migrant workers to Saudi Arabia effective August 1, 2011, until an Indonesian-Saudi memorandum of understanding on the protection of migrant workers is signed and a bilateral joint task force is established,"" the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration said on its website. Public furor erupted after the beheading on June 16 of Ruyati binti Satubi, a 54-year-old migrant worker. Ruyati was executed for killing her employer's wife. Indonesia says it was in the process of seeking her clemency. Late Wednesday, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Tene told CNN that Saudi Arabia had apologized for not informing Indonesia before the execution was carried out. Indonesia filed a diplomatic protest with Saudi Arabia and summoned its ambassador in Jakarta for clarification. It also recalled the Indonesian ambassador to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, authorities scrambled to save another Indonesian migrant worker from execution in Saudi Arabia. Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it paid about $525,000 or Rp 4.7 billion, as compensation to the family of a Saudi man whom the migrant worker said she killed in self-defense. She said her employer tried to rape her. The family agreed to spare her life in exchange for the money, said Abdul Wahid Maktub, an adviser to the Indonesian ministry. Prior to the announcement of the moratorium. Migrant Care Executive Director Anisa Hidaya had said it would represent ""momentum for improvement"" and emphasize ""a firm stance on the part of Indonesia towards Saudi Arabia."" Twenty-three other Indonesians are on death row in the Arab kingdom and an estimated 345 have been condemned in Malaysia. ""It is important that Indonesia is sending a strong message to Saudi Arabia,"" Human Rights Watch Senior Women's Rights Researcher Nisha Varia told CNN. ""That it is not acceptable for Saudi Arabia to execute one of its nationals without informing them."" However, Varia said the latest incident was not a surprise, given Saudi Arabia's treatment of its foreign workers. It also highlights, she added, that Indonesia needs to better protect its citizens who seek employment abroad. Anger has been brewing in recent years over allegations of abuse of Indonesian workers by employers, particularly toward domestic helpers. Activists are demanding the Indonesian government review its policies and regulations in the recruitment and deployment of migrant workers. But the moratorium will not stop Indonesians from illegally entering these countries and might expose them to more risks, Varia said. Indonesia would benefit from working with other countries like the Philippines, whose government sends representatives abroad to demand better employment conditions for its workers. Of the 4.3 million documented Indonesians working overseas, some 1.2 million are in Saudi Arabia and another 1.2 million are in Malaysia. An estimated 3 million others are undocumented, according to the Indonesian Placement and Protection of Overseas Workers agency. Indonesia had already begun negotiations with Saudi Arabia on a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that would stipulate better protection and employment conditions for its workers, Maktub said. The moratorium may speed the signing of the agreement, which had been expected by the end of the year. ""There is a huge reformation internally and the demand for Indonesian workers in Saudi Arabia is very high,"" Maktub said. Arrangements with other labor recipient countries will also be reviewed, he added. After a two-year suspension, Indonesia has just signed an MOU with Malaysia and resumed sending workers there. The impact of the moratorium on Indonesia and on the millions of Indonesians looking for better paying jobs overseas is unclear. According the World Bank, remittances from migrants to the country exceeded $7 billion last year.","NEW: The moratorium goes into effect August 1 .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court for now is staying out of the hot-button issue of concealed weapons laws. The Justices on Monday declined to review two cases brought by the National Rifle Association that deal with whether those age 18-20 can buy and then carry handguns in public for self-defense. The justices gave no reason for denying those cases and a third gun-control appeal on out-of-state weapon transfers. The decision not to intervene means the state and federal laws at issue will remain in effect, and are at least a temporary setback for gun-rights advocates. The NRA had hoped the court was prepared to address a broader, politically explosive issue-- whether there was a fundamental constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public. The Supreme Court in 2008 said the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have a handgun in the home to protect life and property. Both current handgun cases originated in Texas, which included a challenge to state restrictions over ""concealed carry"" permits. At issue in NRA v. McCraw (13-390) was whether the right to bear arms in public for self-defense extends to responsible, law-abiding 18- to 20-year-olds. State law permits those 21 and older to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. Many states have similar restrictions, citing concerns over crime rates among certain young adults, and whether they have the necessary level of maturity and responsibility to carry a handgun. The second legal challenge dealt with a 1968 congressional law that restricts sales of handguns by federally-licensed firearms dealers only to those 21 and older. Those 18-to-20 may still be allowed to purchase shotguns and certain type of rifles, or receive handguns as a gift. Two young Texas gun owners-- Andrew Payne and Katherine Taggart-- had brought the original lawsuit in NRA v. ATF (13-137). Again, the nation's most powerful gun rights group failed to convince the high court to address whether a nationwide, class-based, categorical ban on meaningful access to exercise the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense violated the Second Amendment. The justices also turned down a more narrow appeal in Lane v. Holder (12-1401), denying gun owners in Washington D.C. the ability to sue over city laws making it hard to legally transfer weapons purchased in nearby jurisdictions. Since the nation's capital does not have any federally-licensed gun shops, residents seeking a handgun typically have to go to nearby Virginia or Maryland. Once the high court established an ""individual"" right to keep a handgun in the home, it has been reluctant to broaden that right in a variety of subsequent challenges to other firearm restrictions. The Justice Department estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the United States. In 2005, the last time figures were available, three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns. Paul Clement, a Washington lawyer challenging the federal restrictions on handgun sales to those under 21, expressed frustration at that reluctance. ""Given the number of laws enacted by the federal government, states, and localities in the years when a mistaken understanding of the Second Amendment held sway, one would have expected a major reconsideration of extant firearms laws to have occurred,"" said Clement in a brief filed with the court. ""Instead, jurisdictions have engaged in massive resistance to the clear import of those landmark decisions, and the lower federal courts, long out of the habit of taking the Second Amendment seriously, have largely facilitated the resistance,"" he said. Efforts to craft compromise gun-control legislation have stalled in Congress despite the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since. The high court six years ago -- for the first time -- affirmed an individual's right to own a firearm, when it struck down Washington D.C.'s handgun restrictions. But the court confined its analysis just to the home, leaving in place other gun control laws, including those ""forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools."" While the court for now is staying out of the concealed carry issue, it may be forced back into the debate. Federal appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have issued opposite rulings in recent weeks.","Court declined to review two cases brought by National Rifle Association .

"(CNN) -- Running along the banks of the Seine Sunday, I take a lap around the giant hot air balloon in the south of Paris hovering gently over the Parc André Citroen. Essentially a giant weather balloon, its LEDs sparkled green -- Parisian air quality is just fine, a significant change from just two days before, Friday March 14, when the light flashed ominously red. Friday's visibility levels were so bad that most Parisians couldn't even see the balloon -- let alone the Eiffel Tower. Warmer temperatures and scarce winds caused particulate levels to reach record highs, spurring the city into action. Paris' City Hall launched unprecedented policies aimed at reducing traffic in and around the city. According to Laure Bencheikh of the RATP, Paris's transit authority, for the first time ever public transportation including the metro, regional trains, trams and buses were all free. Supplementary trains added 600,000 to 1 million seats across the various lines. It cost the city around €4 million ($5.6 million) per day. The measure, Bencheikh said, encouraged those who would normally take their cars to opt for public transport. The city also waived fees for the popular bike-sharing program, the Vélib, as well as the electric car share, Autolib. Both services saw 61% and 31% increases respectively during a five day period, according to City Hall. But do these measures ever actually help to improve air quality long-term? Varied results to date . There are some precedents. A 2013 study suggests that Beijing's particulate levels dropped by 20% thanks to its 2008 driving restrictions. Excessive restrictions during a religious celebration reportedly cut 30,000 tons of carbon emissions in Bali by abstaining from almost all carbon-producing activities. However, a partial car ban in Mexico City actually increased air pollution according to one study, as drivers bought extra vehicles. Parisians were warned to avoid strenuous activity as a result of the air, but runners weren't about to ditch the final weeks of marathon training before the Paris Marathon on April 6. Théo Bayssat organizes group runs through Jogg.in, but Thursday night's event just before the pollution hit its peak on Friday was an ordeal. ""We really felt it. It was impossible to breath,"" Bayssat says. By Sunday, the air cleared up and I joined dozens of runners huffing along the riverbank. For the rest of Paris, free transport was the cherry on top of an otherwise perfect Sunday as the air quality improved -- momentarily. Jessica Walker, an American living in Paris, took advantage of the system, though said the smog was unbearable on Friday as she rode a Vélib. On Sunday, she took the RER C train to Versailles for some sightseeing at one of the world's most famous chateaux. ""I went for the first time in over a year. The free ride facilitates things enormously,"" she says. Come Monday, it was a different story. Pollution flared again, and as Parisians headed to work, a system was implemented to allow only those cars with odd number license plates within Paris, with free parking for even numbered plates. Certain exceptions were noted on the city's website, including electric and hybrid cars, and vehicles carrying three or more people. The short-term improvements in air quality are most likely due to changing weather conditions, and not temporary car bans, says Charlotte Songeur, an engineer at Paris's air quality control Airparif. Nevertheless government intervention is still positive, she says. ""Every solution that can reduce emissions is good for air quality,"" she says. ""For one day, it's a good emergency solution."" Long-term measures required . A study in San Paulo and other cities concluded that certain restrictions can alleviate extreme spikes in pollution, but only long-term measures will actually improve air quality. Twitter erupted with Parisians complaining about the restrictions as disruptions hit regional trains to the suburbs including the RER C and RER D. Around 4,000 defiant drivers were stopped on the way into the city at check points like the Place Vendome and Trocadéro by an added force of traffic police and fined €22 ($31). For those who couldn't drive, RATP maintained its free transport through Monday evening, and the measures ended Tuesday. The effectiveness of the free transportation will be hard to measure, and may be speculative at best. At many stations, access doors were simply left open, preventing an official count of those going through turnstiles or scanning passes, Bencheikh said. With no official figures available, she said that traffic volume on RATP facilities felt normal. Commuters echoed her observations. The situation has, however, opened the door for the inevitable capitalization by politicians vying for votes in this month's elections. Socialist candidate Anne Hidalgo called for electric buses to replace diesel ones on RATP lines, as well as implementing an electric scooter-sharing program, dubbed Scootlib. UMP candidate Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet used the pollution to criticize Hidalgo's party for a lack of environmental action. Even Nissan chimed in, using the event to push its 100% electric cars as a response to the driving restrictions with a well-placed Twitter ad. While some may be capitalizing on an otherwise discouraging few days, this weekend has been a wake-up call for Parisians, making air pollution a concrete issue for the first time. And Paris is not alone, as parts of southern France are reporting increasingly poor air quality. Jérôme Giacomoni, cofounder of Aerophile, the agency that designed Paris' weather balloon, said that the weekend's spike in pollution is rare, but everyone is participating in the conversation now. ""Friday was the worst I've ever seen,"" he said, ""but I think people are finally paying attention to air quality.""

"(CNN) -- The man leading the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 says the search is the most difficult in human history, but modern technology greatly increases the chances of finding the missing plane. The four underwater signals that search teams detected are still ""the most promising lead"" investigators have in the search for the Boeing 777, Angus Houston told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday. But are they all pings from the plane's data recorders? A Wall Street Journal report Monday said authorities increasingly believe only the first two signals detected are relevant to the search. And a U.S. Navy source told CNN that Navy officials assisting in the search are sharing the signal data with U.S. agencies and consultants for ""re-analysis,"" adding that searchers have more confidence in the first two pings detected. Houston told CNN it's still too soon to rule out any of the signals. ""Analysis on all four detections is continuing,"" he said. ""At this point in time, it is too early to discount any of the acoustic detections."" The pings have played a key role in shaping the search for the plane, which went missing March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people onboard. Houston told CNN the hunt for the plane is even more difficult than that for Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. ""The big difference between Air France 447 and MH370 is that the last known position, in terms of MH370, is at the top of the Malacca Straits, and then the aircraft continued to fly for an extended period after that,"" Houston told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday. ""Whereas Air France, they had a very good last known position, which then turned out to be very close to where the aircraft was eventually found."" But he said searchers are performing ""groundbreaking work"" with satellite analysis, which has helped isolate the search area in the Indian Ocean. ""Without that, we would be essentially searching the whole of the Indian Ocean, and I think the chances of finding the aircraft in those circumstances would have been slim,"" Houston said. ""I think by having this defined search area ... I think eventually we will find the aircraft."" Houston is the chief search coordinator for the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, based in Australia. He said his greatest concern throughout the two-month search has been the families of those on board. ""To have a set of circumstances where you don't know what's happened to your loved ones in circumstances such as this, it's just a terrible, terrible emotional trauma of all of those involved,"" he said. ""And beyond that, the wider public has a great interest in what happened here because we all fly in airplanes, and we all fly long distances over water, and a lot of people want to know what happened and why it happened."" Hunt for MH370 gets deeper, broader, pricier . About criticism of Malaysia . Since the plane disappeared on March 8 with 239 people on board, the Malaysian government has been criticized for its response and accusations that it has not been transparent. Houston said he believes Malaysia has been forthcoming. ""I think some of the commentary about what the Malaysians have done, I don't think is as fair and objective as it might have been,"" Houston said. ""People are looking for answers, and there are no answers at the moment. That's the difficulty."" 'It just disappeared' Houston said he understands why many families are frustrated by the lack of information. ""Initially, the aircraft -- well, simply put, it just disappeared. And I guess in this day and age, that surprised a lot of people,"" he said. But such a disappearance is quite possible if the transponder or anything on the aircraft that transmits signals is turned off. ""I think that's something that we, as a world community, have to correct as soon as possible,"" Houston said. ""We need to have jetliners that are equipped with some sort of tracking device that can't be turned off, that can be tracked all of the time.

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN) -- A DNA match linking Raymond J. Clark III to Yale student Annie Le led to his arrest on murder charges, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. Raymond J. Clark III, 24, was arrested and charged with murder. His bail was set at $3 million. On Thursday, New Haven Police Chief James Lewis described Le's killing an instance of ""workplace violence,"" but he did not elaborate. Clark, 24, has been charged with Le's murder, and bail has been set at $3 million, Lewis said. Thursday morning, police arrested the Yale lab technician in the strangulation of Le, whose body was found in the wall of an off-campus research building. Hours after his arrest, Clark appeared in court and did not enter a plea. Standing with chains on his ankles and his palms on the table, he looked only at the judge and spoke only to acknowledge that his rights were read to him. A court date of October 6 was set.  Watch report on Clark's background » . Le, a 24-year-old pharmacology graduate student, was last seen alive September 8, the day she appeared in a surveillance video as she entered the four-story lab at 10 Amistad St., about 10 blocks from Yale University's campus. Her body was found inside the basement wall of the building Sunday, on what was to have been her wedding day. She had been strangled, the Connecticut medical examiner's office determined. The night she was killed, a fire alarm in the building was pulled, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. When investigators reviewed security tapes from that night, the source said, they began to focus on Clark, who was seen looking distraught and holding his head in his hands. Clark's initial attorney, David Dworski, said in a statement released before Clark's arrest, ""We are committed to proceeding appropriately with the authorities with whom we are in regular contact."" The public defender's office is now representing Clark.  See timeline of case » . Yale University President Richard Levin said that although the school's administration is ""relieved"" by the news of Clark's arrest, ""we must resist the temptation to rush to judgment."" Clark, of Branford, Connecticut, is not a Yale student but has worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004 after graduating from high school. He lived with his girlfriend, who is also a Yale lab technician, according to police. Clark had nothing in his employment history at the university that ""gave an indication that his involvement in such a crime might be possible,"" Levin said in a statement issued Thursday. A faculty member described Clark's job in the Animal Resources Center as maintaining colonies for animals used in research. The lab is in the basement of the building where Le's body was found.

"Washington (CNN) -- First the attackers blew up bombs outside a Pakistani prison. Then they scared off people in the area and used loudspeakers to call out specific inmates they were trying to release. Shiite prisoners left inside were killed. ""It was a well-planned assault,"" noted CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen, who provided details Monday of the July 30 prison break in northwest Pakistan. Other similar operations in the past two weeks in Iraq and Libya successfully freed hundreds of convicted or suspected Islamic terrorists, a known strategy of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Bergen and other analysts cited the prison breaks as one of several reasons the United States has dramatically heightened its security stance by issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing almost two dozen embassies and consulates on Sunday, with 19 of them remaining shut for the rest of the week. The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an ""abundance of caution"" over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week. 'Do something' An intercepted message among senior al Qaeda operatives in the last several days further intensified concerns already heightened by increased terrorist chatter detected by intelligence agencies, as well as the prison breaks. A message from al-Zawahiri to his second in command in Yemen told him to ""do something,"" CNN has learned. U.S. and Yemeni officials had already spent weeks watching a rising stream of intelligence about the possibility of a major terrorist attack in Yemen, so the message caused them to fear imminent terrorist action. CNN had the information over the weekend and decided not to report the details about al-Zawahiri's involvement based on U.S. government concerns about the sensitivity of the information. Now that it has been widely reported in other media, including the New York Times and McClatchy, CNN has now decided to report it as well. And U.S. officials cautioned that there may be multiple sources of intelligence, including intercepts of electronic information from phone calls and web postings and the interrogation of couriers or other operatives. Opinion: What's behind timing of terror threat . Asked Monday about the prison breaks, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf called them ""a concern for the international community"" that is ""separate and apart"" from the U.S. concern about the latest specific terrorist threat. Bergen, however, noted that al Qaeda ""actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults -- a couple of which have been quite successful."" Prison breaks . A senior official with Iraq's interior ministry told CNN on condition of not being identified that top officials of al Qaeda in Iraq, including Adnan Ismail Najim Abdullah al-Dulaimi, escaped from Abu Graib prison during the jailbreak there last month and remains at large. Bergen noted that a 2006 prison break in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, led to the creation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the terrorist organization's most virulent affiliates. Although the prison breaks are not the main reason for the raised terror threat, said CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank, ""it is part of the background music."" Prison breaks can often strengthen terrorist groups because ""some of these guys are likely to be seasoned operatives,"" he added. To CNN National Security Contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, the timing of the prison breaks and increased intelligence chatter building up to the end of Ramadan signaled heightened al Qaeda activity that required precautionary steps in response. She noted that in the run-up to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, ""the government failed to connect dots."" ""These seem like dots that ought to be connected,"" said Townsend, a former homeland security and anti-terrorism adviser to the Bush administration. ""You can figure out later whether or not you were right."" Is rash of brazen prison breaks related? Interpol wants to know . Another dot she cited was that al-Zawahiri recently appointed Nasir al Wuhayshi, the Yemeni leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, to be the new general manager of the global al Qaeda network. CNN has learned al-Zawahiri's message for action was sent to Wuhayshi. A high-profile attack orchestrated by Wuhayshi would cement the Yemeni's new position in the al Qaeda hierarchy, Townsend said. Yemen is an area of particular concern. Three sources said the United States has information that members of the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. According to a U.S. official with access to the latest intelligence, Wuhayshi's appointment as a top global al Qaeda figure would almost certainly have required back-and-forth communication between AQAP and al Qaeda central. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that while U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, the threat still posed ""has shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP."" Over the weekend, Interpol warned that al Qaeda has been tied to the prison breaks on July 23 in Iraq, on July 26 in Libya and four days later in Pakistan. End of Ramadan . Another factor prompting the embassy and consulate closures is the end of Ramadan. Depending on when a new crescent moon is seen, the Muslim holy month could end Wednesday or Thursday. Ramadan's end is celebrated with the Eid al-Fitr festivities -- a three-day holiday in most Muslim countries. The State Department, in announcing its closures, alluded to this, saying that ""a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the Eid celebration at the end of Ramadan."" Britain also announced its embassy in Yemen will remain closed through the end of Eid ""due to continuing security concerns."" Strategic reason . Townsend said there could be a strategic reason for shutting down the diplomatic offices. ""Once you take targets away, it buys you additional time to try and disrupt, to identify the cell, the operators in country and the region, and work with your partners in the region to try and ... get them in custody or disrupt the plot,"" she said. ""So, some of this operationally is about buying time."" List of closures . A total of 19 U.S. embassies and consulates will be closed Monday through Saturday. The following 15 were part of the original list: . U.S. Embassy Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates . U.S. Embassy Amman, Jordan . U.S. Embassy Cairo, Egypt . U.S. Consulate Dhahran, Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- It had been a little more than four months since completing my second space shuttle mission, STS-59, on the shuttle Endeavour. I was finishing my annual flight physical at the Johnson Space Center Flight Medicine Clinic. The words from the flight surgeon were as expected: I was in great condition with nothing of note. Then I asked the doctor to look at my right shoulder because my racquetball game was suffering. He asked if I had pain. I told him I wasn't in pain, but my right arm did not swing naturally when I walked. This comment must have set off some alarm, because he observed my walk down the hall and quickly said he would take me downtown to the Texas Medical Center the next day. I remember saying, ""I don't believe we can see an orthopedic surgeon that quickly."" He merely noted that we were going to a neurologist. Little did I know that next day would change my life so quickly. The neurologist spent five minutes with me before saying that I had Parkinson's disease. He added I would have to undergo several separate tests to prove that I didn't have some other neurological disorder. Parkinson's disease is diagnosed by the process of eliminating other possible diseases. After several tests, the diagnosis was confirmed. This was December 1995. Beat goes on for music producer diagnosed with multiple sclerosis . To their credit, the flight surgeons asked me what I wanted to do about flying. I quickly said I wanted to continue with all activities, including standing in line for another space shuttle mission. I kept my condition a secret to all, except my wife and my children. I assumed senior NASA management were told, but no one ever spoke to me about the disease. They protected my privacy. I continued my normal duties and was subsequently offered my third shuttle mission -- STS-76, which included a planned space walk. The mission was highly successful. One year after that mission, I left NASA for a job in the private sector supporting human space flight. With the exception of my closest friends and family, I kept my condition a secret for almost 15 years. My reason for secrecy was simple: People did not need to know. Now I'm an advocate for Parkinson's disease awareness. Having Parkinson's disease is no reason to stop living life to its fullest extent. Yes, as the disease progresses I have had to change the way I do certain activities, but I continue to do them. I have a keen awareness now of the stress my disease places on my loved ones who provide me encouragement and tender loving care. The caregivers to a person with Parkinson's are the people who give so much of their lives to care for a loved one. My wife is my caregiver and I am acutely aware of her sacrifices. Parkinson's disease affects more than just the patient. The patient needs to understand the caregiver is there to help. So do not let Parkinson's disease control your life. You may do things slower, or you may not be able to do things you once did as easily. It is not the end of the world.

"Athens (CNN) -- The DNA of a girl authorities think may have been abducted by a Roma couple in Greece doesn't match any profile in Interpol's database, the international law enforcement agency said Tuesday. In a case that has generated huge interest in Greece, authorities have charged the couple with abducting the child they call Maria. Interpol said Greek authorities have asked for its help in solving Maria's identity. ""Until now, a comparison of the girl's profile against Interpol's global DNA database has not produced a match,"" Interpol said in a news release. Interpol said it would make the database available to authorities in countries where someone who claims to be a possible blood relative to the child has submitted a DNA profile. The agency has more than 600 missing people listed on its website, 32 of whom are 5 or 6 years old. A spokesman for a Greek children's charity said about 10 cases of missing children around the world are ""being taken very seriously"" in connection with Maria's case. ""They include children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France,"" said Panagiotis Pardalis of the Smile of the Child charity. The couple who had Maria until last week appeared Monday in court and were remanded into custody pending trial. A lawyer for the couple says the pair adopted the child from her biological mother. The Smile of the Child said the girl, who was found Thursday in a Roma community near Larissa, central Greece, is being cared for in a group home. Medical tests indicate she is 5 to 6 years of age, slightly older than initially thought, said Pardalis. Police have said they suspect the records the couple provided for the child and for other children in their care may be false. In addition to the abduction charge, the couple is accused of falsifying official documents. Four officials, including the head of the registry office that issued Maria's birth certificate, have been suspended while a police investigation is under way, the media office of the Athens municipality said Tuesday. The girl received the document this year, it said. It is unusual for a birth certificate to be issued years later. 1,000 years of Roma discrimination . Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blond hair, while her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, a race descended from Indian nomads, who face widespread discrimination in Europe. Haralambos Dimitriou, head of the local Roma community, said the couple took in the girl because her Bulgarian mother couldn't keep her. He said Maria was raised like a ""normal"" child. Pardalis said Sunday that she was found in ""bad living conditions, poor hygiene."" Calls about the girl . Thousands of calls poured into Greece after authorities released photos of the girl last week. Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, whose daughter Lisa Irwin was 11 months old when she vanished two years ago from their home in Kansas City, Missouri, asked the FBI to contact the Greek authorities about the case. ""There is no such thing as a tip too small,"" said Bradley, whose hopes were raised despite the apparent disparity in age between their missing daughter and Maria. ""I am not sure there are enough similarities between the girls,"" a federal law enforcement official said. Still, the official added, the FBI is working with Greek authorities to determine whether the girl could be Lisa Irwin. A top official with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in Virginia said the center works with law enforcement groups to collect data, biometrics information and DNA that can be used to compare with samples from Maria. ""Frankly, right now ... it does not appear that this may be any of our children. But again we want to confirm one way or the other,"" Robert Lowery, the senior executive director of the organization's missing children division, said. He added that a definitive comparison could be done ""rather quickly."" Interest has popped up elsewhere . In Canada, a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said its Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains had been contacted by Interpol to aid in identifying the girl, though there was no information that she is Canadian. ""We are going through the files that we have and we are developing a list of possible children that could meet that criteria,"" said Sgt. Lana Prosper. ""We are currently looking at an age range of about 2 to 8 years old, we don't want to exclude anybody. The files we currently have to look through number in the thousands, but they include boys as well."" Once that number has been narrowed, police will contact local authorities to assist, ""if needed,"" she said. Police: Couple kept changing story . Authorities released photos of the two adults charged Monday in the case -- Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, and Christos Salis, 39 -- in hopes that the publicity would reach someone who can provide more information about them. Interpol said it was issuing what it calls a ""blue notice"" asking authorities in other nations if they have any additional information about Dimopoulou or Salis. Police said the blond child looked nothing like the man and woman with her, and DNA testing confirmed that they were not her biological parents. A police statement said the couple ""changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child."" A government news agency said police found suspicious birth and baptism records as well as family registrations that claimed the woman had given birth to 10 children and the man was the father of four more. ""I used to see the mother, she would come to the square here to beg with the child,"" a man in the Larissa region told the Reuters news agency. ""At one point, I had asked her how she got such a blond angel. She told me she had conceived it with a blond man."" Prejudice against the Roma . Prejudice and discrimination against the Roma are widespread in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, Amnesty International says. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Pardalis mentioned such a possibility, saying, ""We don't have any other information if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets."" The government news agency also raised ""the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to Greece from Bulgaria and then taking their children for sale."" The agency cited past reports that empty coffins had been found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in Athens. Photo blog: The plight of the Roma .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A 9-month-old Pakistani boy bawled as he was fingerprinted and booked in Lahore on an attempted murder charge after his family members allegedly threw bricks at police trying to collect an unpaid bill. The ordeal started February 1 when several police officers and a bailiff went to a home hoping to get payment for a gas bill, said Atif Zulfikar Butt, a senior police official in Lahore. A scuffle ensued, during which the infant's father, one of his teenage sons and others in the residence severely injured some of the officials by tossing bricks their way, according to Butt. That led authorities to seek out those in the house. An official document aired by CNN affiliate GEO News shows charges of stoning and attempted murder. How and why the baby was implicated was unclear, though the Lahore police official acknowledged that the child appeared in court Wednesday and was booked as his grandfather held him. ""The police filed a wrong, false arrest charge sheet and brought this innocent 9-month-old into this court room for an appearance,"" the family's lawyer, Irfan Tarar, said. Following media coverage of the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif directed police to immediately suspend a Pakistani official for registering the case against the baby boy, according to police. CNN's attempts to contact the family members were not successful.","A 9-month-old boy was booked and fingerprinted in Lahore .

"(CNN) -- If word had leaked out, Bowe Bergdahl would have been killed. That's what Obama administration officials told senators at a classified briefing Wednesday in defense of the decision to not notify Congress about the deal to free the captured Army sergeant in exchange for releasing five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay. The question of what legislators should have known and when has helped propel a broader controversy over whether bringing home a soldier accused by comrades of deserting his unit was worth releasing the alleged terrorist leaders. Under fire from conservative Republicans for making the deal, as well as politicians from both parties for not notifying Congress as required by the National Defense Authorization Act, the White House has argued President Barack Obama had the legal authority and moral high ground to do both. ""I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents,"" Obama told reporters Thursday at the end of the G7 summit in Belgium. ""... We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated and ... we saw an opportunity and we seized it, and I make no apologies for that."" Asked whether he was surprised at the backlash, Obama said ""I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington,"" and he reiterated what he called a time-honored U.S. principle that ""we do not leave anybody wearing the American uniform behind."" ""... We don't condition whether we make the effort to get them back."" 'Dead silence' Meanwhile, the administration made sure word got out of the threat to Bergdahl's life if any information on the swap went public ahead of time. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told CNN that administration briefers made clear both the threat to Bergdahl from a leak and that he could talk about it. ""They had intelligence that, had even the fact of these discussions leaked out, there was a reasonable chance Bowe Bergdahl would have been killed,"" King said. ""And that was one of the pieces of information that we learned yesterday that gave it some credence in terms of why it had to be kept quiet so long."" A Senate aide took that further, telling CNN on condition of not being identified that senators were told in Wednesday's classified briefing that the United States had credible information that leaked word of the deal meant death for Bergdahl. The new details enhanced the perception of a White House scrambling to respond to congressional anger over the exchange announced Saturday in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House with Obama and Bergdahl's parents. As part of the classified briefing, senators were shown the so-called proof of life video of Bergdahl, which the administration has said shows the soldier in deteriorating health. ""He could barely talk. He couldn't focus his eyes,"" King said, adding the video had an effect on the room full of senators. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was among those who saw the video. ""I think he looked a little strange to me. It was hard to tell. It was very brief. He was up close,"" he told CNN. ""I don't expect anybody who's being held in prison to look like they're in great shape, to tell you the truth."" Other senators who saw the video at Wednesday's classified briefing said Bergdahl looked drugged, not sick. But King noted ""there was a dead silence in the room"" after it played. Bergdahl 'life' video shown, senators still skeptical . Price too high for critics . Conservative critics call the price for Bergdahl's release too high, noting that his Army colleagues say he deserted his post in Afghanistan. The Obama administration and Democratic supporters have pushed back, saying Bergdahl's life was under threat in captivity. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the information . There was no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted, because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. Some soldiers involved in operations to find Bergdahl have said at least six soldiers were killed searching for him. But a U.S. official told CNN that Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims, and ""right now there is no evidence to back that up."" At the same time, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl. Still, former Army Staff Sgt. Justin Gerleve, Bergdahl's former squad leader, told CNN's ""The Lead With Jake Tapper"" that he believes Bergdahl is at least partly to blame for the soldiers' deaths. ""I can't really say I blame Bergdahl to fullest extent, but if he wouldn't have deserted us, these soldiers very well could have been in a different place at a different time,"" he said. Gerleve also said he heard radio intercepts that an American ""was running around looking for people to speak English and wanted to seek out the Taliban."" The accusations of Bergdahl's desertion caused some GOP legislators to question whether the United States should have exchanged Taliban terror suspects for him. ""It's very interesting to me that they would be willing to release five extraordinarily dangerous Taliban members in exchange for this soldier who apparently left his post,"" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told CNN on Thursday. Bergdahl's showing sign of improvement . Bergdahl is resting and showing signs of improvement as he recovers at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. While Bergdahl is conversing in English and is described as being more engaged in treatment, he has not yet spoken to his parents, Warren said. In Washington, the back-and-forth over the Bergdahl release took on increasingly political overtones, with Republicans who once called for getting him out saying the swap released hardened Taliban commanders who could attack American forces and interests. Consideration of such a deal dates back several years but failed to gain traction when the possibility first emerged in 2011, according to sources. Bergdahl backlash surprises White House . A Defense Department official familiar with the thinking of Robert Gates told CNN that Obama's first defense secretary opposed the idea back then, as did his successor, Leon Panetta, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. With combat operations in Afghanistan set to end no later than December, the U.S. thinking changed. The imminent conclusion of hostilities raises issues about the status of war captives, with adversaries traditionally exchanging prisoners. King noted that the Taliban figures involved in the swap may have been freed soon in any event. End of war was a factor . ""There is a reasonable legal argument that these five guys would have had to be released any way within the next year under the law of war,"" he said. ""They were being held in Guantanamo as enemy combatants. Under the law of war, when hostility cease, enemy combatants have to be released."" According to King, ""This may have been the last chance to get Bergdahl where these guys had true value to us as a negotiating tool because if they had to be released anyway, we'd be in the same situation without Bowe Bergdahl home."" At the same time, King said the Obama administration erred by failing to notify Congress ahead of time about the swap. ""There could have been notification that would have been somewhat more secure than a widespread notification to Congress. I think that's where there were mistakes made,"" King said.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has disputed reports that accuse Iraq of torturing and abusing people in a secret prison. ""There are no secret prisons in Iraq at all,""Al-Maliki said in a Monday interview with state-run Al-Iraqiya TV. Allegations of torture and abuse at the prison, named Muthanna, were first reported by The Los Angeles Times April 19. Amnesty International has urged Iraqi officials to investigate the claims. Human Rights Watch released a report on the issue Tuesday, saying the detainees are routinely beaten, shocked and sodomized by their interrogators. Al-Maliki continued to deny that there was a secret prison and called the reports ""a smear campaign in which embassies and media organizations took part and it was perpetuated by Iraqi politicians because it serves their interests to say that there are secret prisons."" The prime minister said the Muthanna facility was not secret, it was publicly known and had seven judges working there. He said there are a small number of cases of abuse in jails but he said that happens in all parts of the world. Al-Maliki said he knows that some members of parliament visited the facility and directed the inmates to make false accusations about torture and give themselves scars. The report by Human Rights Watch was based on interviews conducted with 42 prisoners who had been held at a secret facility in west Baghdad's old Muthanna airport since late 2009. The men were among 300 detainees who were transferred in recent weeks to another detention center after the existence of the Muthanna prison was revealed, Human Rights Watch said. Detainees interviewed by the human rights group this week said that while at the facility, they were handcuffed, blindfolded and hung upside down using two bars, one placed behind their calves and the other against their shins. They said they were then kicked and beaten with heavy cables by their interrogators, who also are said to have placed plastic bags over detainees' heads to cut off their air supply. Detainees also described multiple incidents of alleged sexual abuse, the group said.","Human rights group releases interviews with 42 men who'd been kept at secret prison .

"(CNN) -- It has become a permanent fixture on the football calendar, and as the NFL prepares to descend on London once again, it seems a permanent touchdown is fast approaching. As the New England Patriots and St. Louis Rams jet in for Sunday's sixth annual regular season clash at Wembley Stadium, there is a growing sense that an NFL franchise could be based fulltime in the British capital before this decade is out. With the league having voted to persist with the experiment until at least 2016, and the Jacksonville Jaguars committing to four years of visits to London, the NFL is hoping to build on the spike in interest since landing firm feet on foreign shores in 2005. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed at the announcement of this new affirmation to overseas football that the latest deal would increase the swell of support for the game -- likely to be necessary if a franchise is to flourish across the Atlantic. NFL's St. Louis Rams play 3 home games in London . But if a team is to base itself in Europe, be it in London or anywhere else, it must commit to ingraining the culture of the game in the city it adopts as a new home and guard against antagonizing U.S.-based fans, according to sports business expert Simon Chadwick. ""Successful overseas expansion will require the NFL to create and embed a culture of American football in overseas territories which will need them to successfully engage with local stakeholders,"" he told CNN. ""As for us fans, it is important they see that the sport's core values and traditional markets are not being compromised or undermined by overseas expansion. ""Moreover, I think the NFL has to 'sell' expansion to existing fans as being important for the future sustainability and success of the sport."" Building a fan base . If a franchise was to touch down in London, its success would hinge on the following it attracts -- something the league has been trying to build since the first regular-season match between the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins drew a crowd of 81,000 to Wembley in 2007. But the figures are promising. According to the NFL, there is a fan base of 11 million in the UK, which represents a 32% increase in the last two years. More people are playing the game at amateur level too. Television numbers are also on the rise, with Sunday games showing a 154% increase in viewers, while the amount of people watching the showpiece Super Bowl has gone up by 74% since 2006. Goodell has admitted that part of the NFL's reasoning for extending its period of moonlighting in London is to pave the way for a future franchise. ""If we can play multiple regular-season games there, that gives you a better opportunity to be successful if you choose to put a franchise in London,"" Goodell said, in comments sent to CNN by the NFL. ""But again, that is the other reason for putting two games in London -- we are trying to build that fan base in London. We welcome the fans coming from other parts of Europe. ""But this is a way to really build that fan base right now in London, which will be critical if you did have a franchise there."" Capital attraction . According to Goodell, NFL teams are clamoring to visit London as they bid to spread the word about their teams and their cities, attract new fans and to tap into potentially lucrative new revenue streams. Minnesota Vikings owner Mark Wilf said his team's clash with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013 would offer acute exposure of ""Minnesota's impressive business community and tourism industry,"" as well as offering the franchise's Europe-based fans a chance to see the team in action. But Chadwick says it will be difficult for the NFL to fully infiltrate a country that has a fervent following of its major three sports -- soccer, cricket and rugby -- because of its intrinsically American nature. ""The NFL is one of those sports that is deeply socio-culturally embedded -- it is quintessentially American, which means it only has limited appeal outside its core markets, in much the same way as a sport like cricket,"" he said. ""Attendances for NFL games in cities like London have been healthy and are likely to generate a financial return for the NFL. Yet how sustainable such revenue streams might be across a season are open to question. ""Hence, games in overseas territories are about building a fan base with a view to generating long-term financial return. The sustainability of sports such as the NFL requires both a culture shift and the implementation of an appropriate strategy. ""The culture shift needs to place in the hearts and minds of potential customers; the strategy needs to acknowledge that a different approach to the marketing the NFL in the UK is needed compared to the United States."" A need for new markets . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is certainly a fan of the idea, as his outfit prepare for their second visit to Wembley. In quotes on the NFL's international website, Kraft says the game is in danger of ""tapping out"" in the States due to increased popularity. ""If you look at the last Super Bowl in this past season, we had over 180 million people watching -- that's almost two-thirds of America,"" he said. ""So for us to grow the game, we have to expand globally. I think I said that the last time we were over here in 2009 and before this next decade is out, I hope we have a team here. ""I think that would be right for the NFL and this fan base has proven they deserve it."" The NFL isn't the only U.S. sport to travel to Europe in search of greater riches. The NBA staged its first regular season game in London in March 2011 -- the 16th it has played on foreign soil in countries such as Japan and Mexico. The NHL has also dipped its toe in the Thames, holding the first regular season match in 2007. International competition . It's not just American sports seeking worldwide expansion, but some of these plans haven't gone down as well as the NFL's proposal. Soccer club Barcelona, for example, refused to play the preseason Super Cup in Beijing, despite the Spanish league having signed a deal with a Chinese promoter. Barca said China was too far away for club members who might want to attend the game, though it did acknowledge China represents an ""attractive market."" There was a strong backlash against the idea of a 39th English Premier League match to be held overseas when the possibility was mooted several years ago, as domestic fans bridled at the prospect that administrators might tamper with their beautiful game. But Italian sides Juventus and Napoli had no such qualms, as they contested the Italian Super Cup in Beijing's Bird's Nest Stadium back in August. Chadwick added: ""Increasingly, it is a trend for sports to take their domestic games abroad, from Italian football's Super Cup, to Formula One with races in places like India. The long-term sustainability of some sports increasingly appears to be dictated by an ability to successfully internationalize and globalize. ""The Premier League clubs already do this themselves; the Premier League trophy has been held in Asia, and UEFA market the Champions League heavily in other countries. ""Nevertheless there is a sense of inevitability about the previously mentioned 39th game that it will return to the agenda sometime soon. ""For the Premier League to compete with other sporting properties, it will be looking at overseas markets and how best to take advantage of the opportunities they potentially present.""","NFL returns to Wembley on Sunday as New England Patriots play St. Louis Rams .

"(CNN) -- ""Talladega Nights"" actor Luke Bigham, 20, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence harassment after a fight between him and his mother, Lorrie Crumley, on July 8. According to Lt. Jeff Bridges of Trussville Police Department, Bigham ""pushed his mother into the stairs"" in her Alabama home. When police arrived at the scene, Crumley, 42, said she was in pain from the attack, but did not wish to get medical attention. This is not Bigham's first brush with the law. In June, he was arrested on charges of reckless driving. Accused of driving at speeds of over 80 mph in a 35 mph zone, Bigham was in an accident, injuring himself and two others. In that case, Bigham turned himself in to Trussville City Jail, where he was later released on a $1,000 bond. Bigham is best known for his role as the 10-year-old version of Will Ferrell's character, ""Ricky Bobby,"" in the 2006 comedy ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" Bigham's most recent work was on HBO comedy ""Eastbound & Down"" in 2009. Bigham's court date is scheduled July 11 if he has not yet been released on a bond set at $1,000 for the misdemeanor.

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- A militant Islamist group claimed responsibility Monday for bombings the day before that the Nigerian Red Cross said left 50 people dead at three Christian churches in Nigeria. Boko Haram said the attacks Sunday in the Nigerian cities of Zaria and Kaduna were retaliation on Christians for destroying mosques and, according to the group, turning others into ""beer parlour and prostitution joints."" ""Let them know that now it's the time for revenge God willing,"" the group said in a statement. ""From now on, they either follow the right religion or there will be no peace for them."" Government and Red Cross figures on the death toll in Sunday's attacks differed. However, the bombings at two churches and a third in Kaduna left at least 50 people dead and 131 wounded according to the Red Cross. Kaduna state officials loosened a 24-hour curfew imposed after the attacks, saying people could be on the streets from 2 to 6 p.m. However, resident Anthony Majindadi said most people were staying indoors and his area still looked like a ghost town. The series of attacks began when a suicide bomber drove at high speed through a barricade at the EWCA Goodnews Wusasa Zaria church around 9 a.m., congregation member Lucy Bello said. A Kaduna state official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said that blast killed at least 24 people and injured 125. The Nigerian Red Cross Society, however, reported that two people died and 22 were injured in the attack. Within minutes, another explosion occurred at the Christ the King Catholic Church in Zaria, according to Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency. At least 10 people died and more than 50 were injured in that attack, the state government official said. Again, the Nigerian Red Cross Society offered a conflicting report, saying 16 people died and 31 were injured in the attack. Later, at least 10 people died in a bombing at a church in the city of Kaduna, Red Cross spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo said. The Red Cross said 32 people died and 78 were injured in the third blast and ensuing reprisal attacks by Christians on Muslims. Christian youths in Zaria and Kaduna burned mosques and property belonging to Muslims, according to the Vanguard newspaper in Nigeria. Military forces patrolled the streets Sunday in an effort to control retaliatory violence, the Vanguard reported. Kaduna state spokesman Reuben Buhari asked residents Monday to remain calm and cooperate with security forces. The bombings are the latest in a string of violence directed at Nigerian churches. A week ago, a car bomb killed five people during services at a church in Jos, also in northern Nigeria. Angry crowds wielding makeshift clubs fought with police after chasing security forces away from the destroyed church. Three more people died in the clashes. And two weeks ago, two church bombings in the region killed at least 15 people. Boko Haram has previously carried out attacks, including at churches, according to government officials. The group, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" has referred to itself as the ""Nigerian Taliban."" It seeks to overthrow the government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers and Nana Karikari-apau and journalist Safiya Akau contributed to this report.","Militant Islamic group says it's behind three attacks Sunday in cities of Zaria and Kaduna .

"(CNN) -- As Republican presidential candidates move closer to the key tests for their party's nomination, the highly charged topic of Israel and its conflict with Palestinians has come up with increasing frequency in speeches and debates. Most recently, Newt Gingrich sent a jolt through the discussion with his description of Palestinians as ""an invented"" people. His rivals, without disagreeing, accused Gingrich of speaking irresponsibly and potentially hurting Israel. Most people in the U.S. and around the world interpret the campaign pledges of love and support for Israel as an effort to win the Jewish vote. But the Jewish vote has little to do with it. The Republican candidates' passionate vows to support Israel have two objectives. First, they aim to capture the pro-Israel vote in a country where the vast majority of people side strongly with Israel and in a party where the most reliable primary voters, conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, express intense feelings on the subject. Second, they seek to make President Barack Obama look weak on foreign policy with an issue people care about and where the GOP thinks it might score some points. There are many things you can say about how Obama handled the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The one thing you cannot say is that it succeeded. His early missteps managed to make Israelis and Palestinians feel betrayed by Washington. The very public pressure Obama exerted on Israel, has, according to some polls hurt his standing among Jews and among Israelis. But the president's change in tone later helped him with both groups. Most Israelis now say they view him favorably. Among American Jews, Obama's approval may have sunk significantly to the low 50s, but that is still considerably higher than the approval he enjoys nationwide. Despite the views of serious analysts and the calculations of conspiracy theorists, Jewish voters are hardly the point. The numbers confirm that a Republican fight for the Jewish vote would mostly amount to wasted energy. The number of Jewish-American voters barely registers when compared with the size of the pro-Israel vote. Barely 2% of American voters are Jewish compared with more than 60% who consider themselves pro-Israel. Worse for Republicans, a large and consistent majority of Jews vote Democratic. Obama won the Jewish vote by an incredible 78% in the last election. Most American Jews have voted for Democratic presidents for decades. Even if half of them voted for a Republican this year, the prize during the primary is hardly worth the effort. The pro-Israel vote is another matter. Americans support Israel so strongly that for every Jew in the U.S., there are at least 30 non-Jews who say they side with the Jewish state. Support for Israel is at near-record highs, making a pro-Israel position a winning formula for Republicans and Democrats. It's not just Republicans candidates who proclaim their commitment to Israel. Despite his strained relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Obama frequently asserts support. He expressed that sentiment in June at a Democratic National Committee event, saying that ""Israel's security will always be at the top tier of considerations ... because it's the right thing to do, because Israel is our closest ally and friend ... it shares our values and it shares our principles."" Those are words pro-Israel voters, Jewish or not, want to hear. If Republican candidates were trying to help Israel rather than chasing votes, they might stop using it as a political issue. The most damaging change they can bring to the Jewish state's security is to turn support for Israel into a partisan matter. Until now, it is one of the few issues on which bitterly divided Republicans and Democrats usually agree. In fact, Gingrich's recent comments about Palestinians would not make him a lot of friends among Israelis. His incendiary remark -- that Palestine was never a state and Palestinians identified themselves as Arabs until recently -- does nothing to advance the cause of peace. However long Palestinians have seen themselves as a ""people,"" they now share a common history and view themselves as one. The obvious response to Gingrich's rhetorical Molotov cocktail is, so what? Gingrich seemed to imply Palestinians do not deserve a state. But the best conceivable way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is creating two states. That's why a majority of Israelis support the two-state solution. But for now, Republican candidates are worried about rounding up primary votes. One way to do that is by appealing to those with the most intense feelings and the greatest anxiety about Israel's security. More than 60% of conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center, consider it ""a very important goal"" to protect Israel. For evangelicals, in particular, the issue could decide their voting choice. That's why Michelle Bachmann, for example, has spoken in almost mystical terms, saying ""as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with Israel."" Mitt Romney says his first trip as president will be to Israel. All candidates -- except Ron Paul, who wants to cut all foreign aid -- make support for Israel a cornerstone of their foreign policy. Once the Republicans choose their candidate and the race becomes a two-person contest, both sides will try to show they are the most committed to maintaining the strongest of ties and the greatest commitment to Israel's security. It will be a quest for the backing of Jewish voters, but more importantly, an effort to entice the much larger pool of Americans who consider themselves supporters of Israel.","Frida Ghitis says GOP candidates avow support for Israel more and more frequently .

"Alamo Heights, Texas (CNN) -- Valerie Redus has spent much of her time crying, since her son Cameron was killed by a campus police officer in Texas last week. For now, she and her husband Mickey are withholding judgment about who was at fault for his death -- their 23-year-old son or Cpl. Christopher Carter, who shot him Friday. ""We wish that everybody else would do the same, would reserve judgment until facts are known,"" Mickey Redus told CNN's George Howell late Tuesday. The official account has left the Reduses in disbelief. ""It just seems very inconsistent with ... the young man that we knew,"" Mickey Redus said. Now that the popular honor student is dead, everywhere his parents look, people remind them of how upstanding he was, he said. About 100 students turned out to a vigil to mourn his loss Saturday at the Catholic school. The Reduses don't see how their son could have done anything so wrong as to deserve being shot. Police say that Redus heavily resisted arrest and even assaulted Carter, a campus police officer at University of the Incarnate Word, a Catholic school in Alamo Heights that Redus attended. Carter gave him multiple warnings before using his weapon. He fired six shots, hitting Redus five times, said Alamo Heights police Chief Richard Pruitt. Redus was later pronounced dead at the scene. Mickey Redus said that he and his wife are not sad for their son's sake. ""We believe him to be in heaven beginning the greatest adventure ever. But for ourselves there's pain,"" he said, as his composure gave way to sobs, ""because there's this huge hole that's left by his presence here with us."" In spite of heaven, they wish he was still with them. ""I'd give anything if he'd walk right through that door,"" Valerie Redus said. A traffic stop . It started with a night out, and student Robert Cameron Redus, who went by his middle name, had some drinks. One of his friends later confirmed she had been barhopping with him. Someone took pictures of the outing. Redus' mother studied them. Everyone was smiling; she can't imagine how the night ended so tragically. ""I was glad that he was able to spend it with his classmates,"" Valerie Redus said. At the end of the night, Redus was headed in the direction of his apartment, when he drove past Carter, who was patrolling in a campus police pickup truck, Pruitt said. The student sped into a construction zone in ""bad weather conditions,"" he said. Carter followed him. Redus struck a curb on the right, Carter reported, then swerved left into the opposite lane of traffic, so the officer switched on his emergency lights and pulled him over, Pruitt said. Redus pulled into the apartment complex where he lived, and Carter said he followed, but he made a fateful slip. He reported the wrong street location to police dispatchers, which caused his call to be routed to a police department farther away. Alamo Heights police could have made it there to assist him sooner, but his call went to their San Antonio counterparts. This caused a delay of several minutes in response time, Pruitt said. He was left alone with Redus, and things went wrong. The two men fought. Had Pruitt's officers, who were closer, been called to respond, Redus might still be alive, the chief said. The scuffle . Investigators have Carter's report on the matter, and some witnesses heard or saw parts of his confrontation with Redus. One of them called police. A dash cam captured the audio, but there is no video, since the camera's mount was broken. The lens was pointed in the wrong direction. But the sound of the scuffle was revealing, police have said. Carter ordered Redus to put his hands on his vehicle, the campus officer later told police. At first, he obeyed. But when the officer pulled out his handcuffs, the student refused to cooperate, Pruitt said. The two scuffled for more than six minutes. ""Officer Carter instructed Robert Redus 14 times to place his hands behind his back, and informed him three times that he was under arrest, and to stop resisting 56 times,"" Pruitt said, referring to the recording. Carter pulled his baton, but Redus took it away and beat him with it, Pruitt said. Pruitt said the officer had injuries on his arm and head that corroborate his account. Carter was able to wrestle the baton away from Redus. But then the student charged at the officer with his arm raised, police said. Carter warned him four times that he would shoot if Redus did not stop, Pruitt said. Carter opened fire. He is on administrative leave after the shooting, which is standard procedure. He is taking the incident very hard, Pruitt said. ""This is not an easy thing for him, I can assure you."" Disbelief shared . Friends at the school say the Cameron Redus they knew wasn't the type to attack police. They knew a student who made the dean's list at college and had been co-valedictorian at a Christian high school back home in Baytown, Texas, east of Houston. ""He is one of the nicest, most caring, compassionate guys ever. Not a mean bone in his body,"" Redus' friend Jonathan Guajardo said. Guajardo believes deadly force was unnecessary and grilled Pruitt on the topic at a news conference. He questioned whether Redus was a real threat to Carter, who Pruitt conceded was much taller and heavier. People trusted Cameron, Redus' mother said. His former boss turned over to him the keys to his business and computer passwords, she said. His managers came to his vigil to talk about how hardworking he was. Cameron did good deeds, his father said. He regularly helped an elderly man do his shopping. His son had a knack for people, he said. He backpacked across South America. He stayed with indigenous people and took on odd jobs for room and board while he picked up Spanish. They couple looks at photos of his adventures to remind themselves of how intensely he enjoyed his life. When they do, the tears come rushing back.

"(CNN) -- Things have never been more exciting in Africa than they are now. The continent's rising economy and burgeoning tech space is all anyone can talk about. At a recent South by Southwest panel, ""Africa or Bust! Content, Monetization, Opportunity,"" it was made clear that mobile and connectivity is also changing the content game. Reportedly, around 140 million people in Africa have access to the internet, which represents about 13% of the population. That number is set to explode in the next few years. By 2020, internet penetration in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to reach 24.7%. Read also: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . For Africans, the internet is not just a way to connect with the rest of the world, or even with friends -- it's a content enabler. It is also a commerce facilitator. The African consumer is on the rise; they are hungry for interaction, hungry for e-commerce purchases and they are hungry for content. As a society, Africa is learning what it means to spend money on content delivered via a mobile device and computer screens, especially content that is designed for the continent. Large numbers of devices are shipped into the continent from the United States and Asia annually helping grow this new taste for spending. ""Africans want their own content, content that's by them and for them ... There is a lot of cool stuff happening in this space,"" said Richard Essex, partner in East Africa Capital Partners, quoted in the Financial Times last month. According to a Nielsen report, mobile video is increasingly popular in emerging market regions such as Africa. That report stated: ""Mobile video is particularly prominent in Asia-Pacific and Middle East/African regions, where 74 and 72% of online consumers, respectively, report watching video on mobile phones at least once a month, and almost 40% (38% and 37%, respectively) say they do so at least once a day."" Africa's biggest play into online content consumption to date is iROKO Partners, a platform that provides Nigerians in the diaspora with Nollywood films. Dubbed ""Africa's Netflix,"" the company is streaming not just movies but also music through its iRoking music-streaming platform. The success of iROKO has given rise to a new breed of consumer. These are people who've found that now that content comes to them, they are interested in having access to it. Currently iROKO delivers Nigerian content to the world but what about the rest of Africa? Read also: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . Africans in the diaspora aren't exposed to other content from the continent and somehow it seems that the rest of Africa isn't producing the same addictive content as the rest of the world. Southern Africa is catching up and getting ready to begin providing content to Africans in the diaspora. Wabona is a new startup hoping to replicate the success of iROKO by building its own online pay-per-view video streaming service designed to deliver African and international video content to the African Diaspora and Africa as a whole. Content is everything and technology is its biggest enabler. One of the key factors that have been identified about mobile devices is their role in content creation. Focused on local made-for-mobile content, Bozza is a South Africa-based startup that provides an application that offers artists, filmmakers and entrepreneurs a mobile platform through which to distribute their content. According to Bozza, its mission is to connect content and technology in Africa. Its website states that: ""Content drives the uptake of technology; yet despite the global increase and focus on the value of content, there continues to be a lack of locally generated, contextually relevant content for the African market."" The African consumer gets it as well. Mobile social networks like Mxit and 2Go understand the importance of content. Partnerships are beginning to emerge between the platforms and the content providers. Mxit has created a movie portal that allows its users to watch feature-length pieces in five to six parts.

According to former Mxit CEO Alan Knott-Craig, Africans are so hungry for content that those of them that have not previously had access to free content online are more willing and likely to pay for it that those with more access and means.

"Washington (CNN) -- When French President Francois Hollande flew to Washington this week for a state visit, he brought along a lot of baggage -- and it's not his country's famous Louis Vuitton. Hollande left France amid sinking popularity ratings and swirling reports that he cheated on his partner of seven years with a younger movie actress â€” making this week's trip something of an escape for the embattled president. The former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler -- whom Obama said in November he was looking forward to hosting -- isn't coming to the White House now that Hollande has announced their split. French President's alleged lover nominated for acting award . He says his private life is private, but Hollande's not denying the affair. Now he's in America solo for one of Washington's most tradition-bound events, where protocol dictates nearly everything and a slip-up, however unlikely, could wind up offending a top ally. Obama and Hollande: A strong alliance . ""The protocol that dictates how state visits are handled is something that's steeped in hundreds of years of history,"" said Anita McBride, a former chief of staff to Laura Bush who helped plan state dinners. Over time, formal arrival ceremonies and high profile press conferences have become a part of the multi-day affair. Finding ways to accommodate foreign leaders, even those with ""it's complicated"" relationship statuses, is just another aspect of the highly choreographed state visit, said people with experience organizing them. It's not the first time a French president has come to Washington alone. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, attended a formal dinner at the White House shortly after announcing his split from his wife. And at least Hollande is showing up; when Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff caught wind of National Security Agency spying, she canceled altogether. ""There are so many changes that take place, some that are more prominent in the news than others,"" said Capricia Marshall, who until August was the U.S. chief of protocol. ""You have to be flexible, you have to be prepared, and you just sort of change course."" But questions such as who will sit next to Obama are still up in the air. Typically the partner of the visiting head of state gets the chair next to America's president. When that position is vacant, U.S. officials must consult their counterparts and even have the president himself weigh in. It's not necessarily a hard task, said McBride, because plenty of people would jump at the chance to sit next to Obama. The designee doesn't have to be French, though it wouldn't be unexpected if he or she is. It's just another piece of planning that requires painstaking attention to detail. ""I'm sure that they will have an imaginative way of doing their seating that's absolutely appropriate,"" said Marshall. It may seem antiquated to treat a guest so gingerly, but state dinners have always been about formality and gentle manners. They've grown so much that they no longer fit in the State Dining Room. Instead a sturdy white tent on the South Lawn holds the hundreds of invited guests, who usually include some top donors and key allies in Congress. This year they'll take trolleys from the White House East Wing down to the structure. No detail spared for French president's arrival at the White House . Once there they'll dine on four courses of American-grown haute cuisine â€” osetra caviar and quail eggs, a winter salad ""served in a wonderful glass bowl to make it look like a terrarium,"" Colorado-raised beef, and a chocolate dessert sourced from Obama's native Hawaii. On Monday the White House released the names and vintages of the wines poured at each course â€” a change from the last few state dinners, which listed only ""American"" bottles lest the price tag shock taxpayers. Reds from California and Washington State, and a sparking wine from Virginia, are the selections. None retail for over $50 a bottle. It's a much-sought-after invitation -- so much so that a Virginia couple faked one to attend Obama's event honoring the Indian prime minister, Monmohan Singh, in 2009. Michaele Salahi's red-and-gold sari is likely forever imprinted in the mind of Desiree Rogers, the former White House social secretary who stepped down shortly after the incident. That kind of glaring fissure in the evening's decorum isn't typical, said McBride, who did recall an incident during a visit by the Chinese premier she said was marred when a journalist shouted a question at the formal arrival ceremony. And while the details still matter for staunch allies like France, a slip-up on protocol isn't likely to throw the United States' now-solid relationship with the country into jeopardy. France, to the Obama administration's pleasure, has taken a more interventionist stance in global conflicts, a turnaround from the days when Americans responded to France's opposition to the Iraq invasion with boycotts of French (or just French-sounding) products. ""Let's just say that we've come a long way from Freedom Fries,"" was how one senior administration official described the relationship Monday. In Libya France took a leading role in the mission that ended with Moammar Gadhafi's death. And in Mali, French troops are working to prevent Islamists from taking over in the northern part of the country. France was ready in September to launch air strikes in Syria as Obama was trying to rally support, making the country one of a few foreign allies to back the U.S. plan after Britain's parliament voted against it. Obama eventually went to Congress for approval, but the issue never came to a vote. While Hollande, like most other European leaders, has expressed outrage at allegations of NSA spying, the dust-up isn't likely to make any major dent in French-American relations. The same can be said for what Hollande calls ""tax evasion"" by U.S.-based tech firms (after Washington, the French President heads to Silicon Valley). Hollande, a socialist elected in 2012, is more closely aligned in policy with Obama than the center-right Sarkozy. His fluency in English might make him an easier dinner companion than his predecessor, as well as a more conversant travel buddy on the trip to Jefferson's Monticello the pair took Monday.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said last week his Blues were title contenders in the Premier League. With the amount of money Chelsea continues to spend on players, many would say he was stating the obvious. And while Chelsea didn't play a fellow title contender Monday in its season opener, the club's display would have done little to alter Mourinho's view. Buoyed by new signings Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, Chelsea quickly overturned a 1-0 deficit to beat Burnley 3-1 on the road at Turf Moor. Costa, Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic scored for Chelsea. ""I think overall, (we had) very good control of the game and some moments in the quality and style we want to play,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. Burnley's manager Sean Dyche suggested his newly promoted side couldn't match the budget of some teams in the Championship. Chelsea, though, wasn't taking the Clarets lightly -- they upset Manchester United at home early into the 2009/2010 campaign and earned another stay in the top flight last April thanks partly to a stingy defense. ""We dropped too many points away from home last year to the lesser sides,"" Chelsea defender John Terry told Sky. ""We had to come here and fight and want it more than them and I think we had that. But more in abundance we had plenty of possession and quality play."" Mourinho has never been shy to tinker with his lineup, and in the off-season out went Chelsea greats Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole. Another stalwart, Petr Cech, was the backup to Thibaut Courtois -- who returned from his loan spell at Atletico Madrid -- on Monday. But Terry, dubbed 'Mr. Chelsea,' completed the 90 minutes for Chelsea in the heart of the defense and he was joined on the pitch by much loved striker Didier Drogba when the latter came on with less than 10 minutes remaining. Fabregas moved to Chelsea following a mostly unfruitful stint at Barcelona, and having previously played for Arsenal, his adjustment to the pace of the Premier League was seamless. He played a role in all three Chelsea goals. ""He really was the maestro,"" said Mourinho. ""He controlled the tempo of the game. He was the man that dictated the speed, intensity and direction of the game."" Fabregas engineered the pass of the evening when he set up German World Cup hero Schurrle in the 21st minute to give Chelsea a 2-1 advantage. Only seven minutes earlier, Scott Arfield's thumping finish handed Burnley a dream start. Costa proved in La Liga that he was one of the best finishers around, and he didn't miss from close range in the 17th minute after the ball had come off the post. Fabregas' fellow Spanish international is being counted on to score in abundance in the wake of Chelsea's strikers struggling last term. Costa, though, received a yellow card for diving, despite replays showing he was clipped by goalkeeper Tom Heaton. ""His play, movement and interaction with Eden (Hazard) and Schurrle and Oscar was very, very good,"" said Mourinho. ""I feel very sorry for him because it was a penalty and never a yellow card."" Ivanovic, a defender, converted from a Fabregas corner in the 34th minute as Chelsea became the only team in the first round of fixtures to find the net three times. Chelsea eased up in the second half and Burnley elevated its game -- Courtois pulled off a great save to deny Arfield a second in the 49th minute. But Chelsea cruised to three points to match Manchester City, the defending champion and Mourinho's major rival this season.","Chelsea beats Burnley 3-1 in the teams' opening game of the Premier League season .

"(CNN) -- It's expected to be a monster of a movie this weekend, but what's the buzz on ""Godzilla""? Director Gareth Edwards' film, starring Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Ken Watanabe, has been eagerly anticipated by fans (some of whom still haven't gotten over the 1998 version with Matthew Broderick), and critics are sounding off. The new ""Godzilla"" focuses on an engineer (Cranston) determined to solve a yearslong mystery and his frustrated son (Taylor-Johnson), who just wants his dad to let it go. And of course, there are monsters. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly found that mix of stories to be disjointed, saying the film ""feels like two movies Scotch-taped together."" ""In one, Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is his estranged soldier son, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition-spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind's hubris,"" he wrote. ""In the other, mammoth CG beasts knock the snot out of one another. Only one of these movies is any good. Thankfully, it's the monster one."" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone seemed to agree. ""It would take an insomniac to wade through all these plot complications without dozing,"" Travers wrote. ""The actors are top-tier, but they over-emote to sell a human drama that never rises above soap opera. Cranston deserves better than a script that confuses hysterics with breaking bad."" The New York Daily News' Joe Neumaier said that ""60 years after he first stomped on Tokyo, the big green lizard has been given fresh scales for the rebooted 'Godzilla.' Yet despite a few fiery breaths, there's mostly hot air from a lot of serious actors slumming it."" Drew McWeeny of HitFix found much to praise in the scenes featuring the monster. ""For better or for worse, depending on how you like the end result, Edwards has made a film that stands apart from how pretty much anyone else would have handled this, and I like that he remembered how important 'awe' is to something that hopes to be 'awesome,' "" McWeeny wrote. The Verge's Bryan Bishop said that Edwards delivers as a director. ""Rather than reaching for the low-hanging fruit of wall-to-wall action, Edwards conjures up a mix of slowly escalating tension and visual-effects wizardry,"" he wrote. ""The result may not be the monster movie some audiences are expecting, but it's something better: a summer blockbuster that actually leaves you wanting more."" Speaking of wizardry, here are some fun facts about ""Godzilla"": The sound design team of Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn used a Rolling Stones tour rig with a 100,000-watt speaker about the size of a city block that they then pumped the monster's sounds through so they could capture recordings in cars, rooftops and other places to get the most realistic echo possible. But what you think you are hearing with that Godzilla roar may be deceiving. The roar is actually octaves beyond the human range of hearing, so the design duo used special Japanese microphones to slow the sound so it falls within audience's hearing range.","Some complain that ""Godzilla"" is disjointed .

"Obesity shaves two to four years off the average lifespan, while being very obese can shorten your lifespan by 8 to 10 years, according to a new analysis of 57 studies including nearly 900,000 people. Men and women with BMIs between 22.5 and 25 were the least likely to die during the study's follow-up period. ""This is scary and something that we should pay close attention to,"" says Ali Mokdad, Ph.D., a professor of global health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. The new findings actually underestimate the true impact of obesity on society because they don't address the costs of obesity-related illness and other factors, says Mokdad, who was not involved with the current study. The study, published online March 18 in the journal The Lancet, was conducted in part by the eminent epidemiologist Sir Richard Peto of the University of Oxford. Peto and his colleagues in the Prospective Studies Collaboration, a team of dozens of researchers from around the world, say they did the new study to figure out exactly how body mass index (BMI) relates to mortality. Researchers also investigated how smoking influenced this relationship and how excess weight affected death risk from specific causes. Their analysis included 894,576 people, mostly from North America and Western Europe. Most were age 46 when the study started and were recruited in 1979; the average BMI for all participants was 25. The researchers eliminated deaths during the first five years of their analysis to avoid including people who were excessively thin because of illness. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal (that translates to weighing between 114 and 149 pounds if you're 5 feet 5 inches tall); overweight is 25 to 29.9 (150 to 179 pounds if you're 5 feet 5 inches tall); and obese is 30 or more (180 pounds-plus on a 5-foot-5-inch frame.) You can figure out your BMI at the National Institutes of Health Web site. Men and women in the new analysis who had BMIs between 22.5 and 25 were the least likely to die during the follow-up period, which averaged eight years. But every additional 5 BMI points boosted mortality risk by 30 percent. The increase was strongest for deaths due to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney, and liver disease; cancer deaths also went up with increasing BMI, but not as much as other diseases. Health.com: How to find your healthiest body mass index . People with BMIs below 22.5 had a higher mortality risk during the study than those who weighed slightly more, largely because of respiratory illnesses, such as lung cancer. The researchers say this is probably the result of skinny people who were smokers. The researchers calculate that having a BMI of 30 to 35 takes to two to four years off the average lifespan compared with having a BMI of 22.5 to 25. Having a BMI between 40 and 45 (for example, being 5 feet 5' and weighing 240 to 270 pounds), they say, reduces one's lifespan by eight to 10 years. This reduction in lifespan is on par with being a heavy smoker. Health.com: Dietary fats can help -- or harm -- your heart . This isn't too far out of line with research conducted by Katherine M. Flegal, Ph.D., a senior research scientist and distinguished consultant with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In a 2005 study, Flegal and her team reported that while being obese (having a BMI of 30 or above) shortened lifespan, those who were overweight (a BMI of 25 to 29.9) were at no greater risk of death, and may actually have had a lower mortality rate in a given time period than their normal-weight peers. Health.com: How to cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions . While the study kicked up a lot of controversy -- some people thought the findings minimized the health effects of excess weight -- several other studies have also found no greater mortality risk associated with being overweight (but not obese), and possibly lower mortality, Flegal notes. Given the difficulty of losing weight, the authors of the new study say, it may be best if people are motivated to prevent the weight gain in the first place. For example, a person who held their BMI steady at 28 rather than going up to 32 (typical of the increase seen in middle age) could extend their life by two years, the researchers say, while a young adult who maintained a BMI of 24 rather than going up to 32 could add three years to his lifespan. Health.com: BMI success story: How one woman lost 44 pounds . For this to happen here, Mokdad notes, the United States government is going to have to do a much better job of supporting prevention efforts. A ""bailout"" for such efforts that translated to healthier American and workers could be a pretty effective economic stimulus, he added. Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Health - CLICK HERE!

"(CNN) -- Lavish weddings on soap operas are commonplace -- beautiful, wealthy characters united amid copious tears, heaps of flowers and exquisite attire. Actresses Tamara Braun and Eden Riegel take part in the wedding as depicted on ABC's ""All My Children."" Monday's ceremony on ABC's ""All My Children"" was much the same, except for the couple: Bianca Montgomery and Reese Williams, both wearing designer dresses, united in daytime television's first lesbian wedding. ""When my character did first come out of the closet, there was a lot of negative reaction,"" said Eden Riegel, the actress who plays Bianca. Her character is the daughter of Erica Kane, a longtime mainstay on the show played by Susan Lucci. ""People were very protective of Erica Kane's daughter, and I think that the beauty of the show is that we were able to reach people and get people sort of used to the idea,"" Riegel said.  Watch the actress talk about her character and the wedding » . The ceremony, portions of which were posted on a Web site dedicated to ABC daytime television and SOAPnet.com, featured both women wearing designer dresses and holding red roses. ""I promise to love you and devote myself to you,"" says a tearful Reese, played by Tamara Braun, during the ceremony, her hands in Bianca's. ""Because standing here with you, it's where I belong."" Lucci said, ""Once Bianca came out and said she was gay, Erica said, 'But no! You won't get married!' Well, now that Bianca is getting married, you know, the other part of Erica is like, 'Hooray!' You know? 'I get to plan my daughter's wedding after all!' "" At least one religious group, however, expressed its disapproval of the nuptials. ""I think it is really important to understand that there are a lot of things that people don't really want to see and don't want coming into their homes, and lesbian weddings are certainly one of them,"" said Glenn Stanton of the group Focus on the Family. But gay and lesbian groups hailed the televised wedding as a victory. ""It's reality,"" said Neil Giuliano, president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). ""So when we see a lesbian couple getting married on daytime drama, it simply reflects what's happening in the real world."" Actress Braun said, ""If you are brave enough to want to get married, especially with the divorce rate as high as it is, then you should have that right no matter what sex you are, who you love, what color you are, how many extra toes and feet you have ... equal rights for all people."" Recent high-profile same-sex weddings included that of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and her partner, actress Portia de Rossi, last August. However, same-sex marriage remains a hot-button issue in many states -- particularly California. The state was one of several to ban same-sex marriage in the November 4 elections. But unlike the others, California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since a May 15 ruling by the state Supreme Court legalized the unions. However, California's Proposition 8, the measure outlawing same-sex marriage, passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote. Three groups -- the American Civil Liberties Union, gay-rights group Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights -- filed a legal challenge to the vote, asking the state Supreme Court to rule the ballot-initiative process was ""improperly used"" to strip away a right protected by the state constitution. The court has said it will hear the appeal, but will not block the implementation or enforcement of the law in the meantime. Arguments in the case could be heard as early as next month. Same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Rhode Island recognizes same-sex marriages from other states, and Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry is officially single again after splitting with Cressida Bonas, his girlfriend of two years. The two had been widely tipped to marry in the next big royal wedding. Speculation became feverish after they appeared at their first official appearance together last month, kissing and hugging at a charity event at London's Wembley Arena. Harry, fourth in the line to the British throne, and Bonas had been spotted several times on private dates in paparazzi shots that appeared in British newspapers. A source close to the couple told CNN they remain ""best of friends."" The source said: ""It's very, very sad that they have decided to split. It's very amicable but they have decided to go their separate ways."" One reason for the breakup is that Bonas, at the age of 25, had her own ambitions that were increasingly being overshadowed by her high profile relationship. She recently completed a one-year contemporary dance course at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire in London and now has a marketing job. She never seemed comfortable with all the attention that came with being linked to one of the world's most eligible bachelors. Rumors of marriage had heaped pressure on Bonas, and prompted an increasing amount of media intrusion into her personal life. Who should Harry date next? Harry, in previous interviews, has raised the question of who would want to take on such a high profile boyfriend. People have often scoffed at the notion, filling up social media with marriage proposals for the Prince, but in some way he may now feel vindicated. They will both hope that by separating they will end the media interest in Bonas and give her the privacy she wants to pursue a career in her own right. Harry was introduced to Bonas by his cousin, Princess Eugenie. Bonas' mother is socialite and 1960s ""It Girl"" Lady Mary-Gaye Georgina Lorna Curzon. It's worth noting that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also split up at one point in their twenties, prompting speculation that Harry and Bonas could get back together in the future, if things settle down and they both feel ready. Harry is reportedly heading to Memphis this weekend for the marriage of his close friend Guy Pelley to hotel heiress Elizabeth Wilson. He'll be hoping to keep a lower profile on this trip -- on his last private visit to the U.S. as a single man, he was caught on camera stripping at a party in Las Vegas.

"(CNN) -- No guts no glory, or so the saying goes. But perhaps the vanquished United States soccer team can rest in the knowledge that if the World Cup was decided on guts, it would surely be lifting the trophy in Brazil. For 120 minutes of Tuesday's ultimately unsuccessful last-16 clash with Belgium, each one of Jurgen Klinsmann's men left everything on the field in Salvador. From the second the Americans went 2-0 down in extra time thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, the rearguard action started. Substitute Julian Green's goal offered the nation a lifeline and energized its fatigued players with a quarter of an hour to play. And you could almost hear the sigh of despair from New York to Nevada as late chances for Jermaine Jones and Clint Dempsey were agonizingly spurned. The final whistle signaled tumult at either end of the emotional spectrum as Belgium advanced to a quarterfinal with Argentina on Saturday and the U.S. departed. Beaten, yes, but not bowed. ""It's hard for us to end up on the losing side after 120 minutes of giving absolutely everything,"" Klinsmann told reporters. ""But this game had everything, it was a thriller. We had chances to equalize, but congratulations to Belgium. ""I'm proud of the players not just for what they've done tonight, but what they've done throughout the tournament. They've made the country proud."" With every passing minute of its participation in the World Cup, the United States had drawn soccer a little closer to its heart. And though its harrowing exit will cut deep, if ever there was a football match to ignite one nation's passion for the beautiful game this was it. Buoyed by progress from a tricky group, if the U.S. thought Belgium might represent a simpler prospect than Germany it took less than a minute to dispel that notion. The Red Devils poured forward like the Red Arrows in the game's fledgling stages as a pass from Kevin De Bruyne, of German outfit VfL Wolfsburg, sent teenager Divock Origi scampering through on goal. His effort was powerfully struck but just like a succession of German players had found in their final group game, Tim Howard was in parsimonious mood, and blocked with his legs. Save for a clutch of enterprising moments in three successful group games, Belgium had failed to live up to its pre-tournament tag of dark horse. But though the Europeans bristled with intent during the opening exchanges, the United States would not be cowed and created its first openings after 20 minutes. Dempsey narrowly failed to connect with a corner before a marauding run from Michael Bradley, son of former USMNT coach Bob, presented the Seattle Sounders star with a clear sight of goal. But just as Howard had in the opening minute, Belgium's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was equal to the task. Respite proved brief though, as Belgium resumed its front-foot role. Jan Vertonghen was twice involved as the Red Devils spurned a pair of chances in quick succession. First the defender, who plies his trade for Tottenham in the English Premier League, pinched the ball in midfield and fed De Bruyne but he dragged a shot wide. Then Vertonghen profited down the left channel but hesitated momentarily before pulling the ball across the face of goal, allowing DaMarcus Beasley to clear from inside his own six-yard box. The pattern continued after the interval, the USA adopting a more open style than in its previous encounter but at the same time struggling to counter the pace and dynamism offered by Belgium. Origi again gave notice of his menace by glancing a header from a Toby Alderweireld cross onto the crossbar with Howard reduced to the role of spectator. Despite being pinned inside its own half for long spells, the United States remained a threat on the counter attack, and from one such downfield break Graham Zusi was inches away from connecting with a volley. Dempsey also tested Courtois with two attempts from range but in the main, the red wave continued. Kevin Mirallas was the next man to try and pierce USA's rearguard as he sauntered into the area -- defenders in white petrified of upending him -- before the ball ran loose to Origi. Yet again, Howard earned his stripes and made the block. The goalkeeper, a long standing servant of English club Everton, had USA fans in raptures again moments later as he diverted another goalbound effort from club colleague Mirallas after he had sprung the offside trap. Origi stung Howard's palms with a rifled shot from outside the box before Hazard rippled the side-netting as the pressure intensified with the end of normal time in sight. A measure of the attacking swarm Belgium had adopted came with the sight of captain Vincent Kompany picking the ball up in his own area and charging upfield to prompt Howard into another save, as his flick lurched for the bottom corner. Deep in stoppage time, the moment the United States had been waiting for arrived. A knockdown inside the area found substitute Chris Wondolowski eight yards out with only the goalkeeper to beat. A nation held its breath and then howled as he launched the ball over the crossbar. An incorrect offside flag from the linesman spared his blushes, as the crowd in Salvador roared their approval at the conclusion of 90 minutes. For those recently converted to the joy of soccer it surely proved how thrilling a scoreless draw can be, but the deadlock was broken a matter of minutes into the added 30-minute period. De Bruyne played the role of destroyer, dancing away from three white shirts inside the area before angling a shot beyond the seemingly unimpeachable Howard. When substitute Romelu Lukaku added a second 12 minutes later it appeared as if the game was up. But if anything, the Chelsea striker's goal only served to inspire Klinsmann's troops. Chasing a lifeline, their game plan went out of the window, an all-out approach paying dividends when teenager Green -- a controversial pre-tournament selection in place of U.S. legend Landon Donovan -- volleyed home superbly to halve the deficit. From that point on, all hell broke loose. The Americans were nearly level within seconds of Green's strike as Jones hooked a shot that dropped tortuously wide of the far post. Then Lukaku squandered a chance to seal the tie once and for all, as Howard made his 14th save of the night -- the most in any World Cup match since 1966. The final act of a game that will live long in the memory saw a neatly worked free kick send captain Dempsey in on goal but when it mattered most, Courtois stood tall to make the block and repel the last effort the USA could muster.","Belgium finally ends United States' World Cup dream with a 2-1 victory in Salvador .

"(CNN) -- A foreign minister clearly frustrated with some of his own countrymen has taken to Facebook to expose some of the stranger requests received by consular staff. ""Can the government get involved if a Singaporean gets illegal sexual services overseas, but is not satisfied and wants a refund? The answer seems obvious,"" writes K. Shanmugam, the country's minster for foreign affairs, with an almost audible sigh. The exasperated minister went on to list other examples with the plea: ""We have to draw the line between what is personal responsibility and what's not."" Where to draw the line? Personal responsibility could include the lovelorn citizen who asked the foreign office to convince his girlfriend to marry him. And then there was the KFC customer who alleged racial discrimination over the size of his fried chicken. ""He wanted MFA to investigate this instance and seek justice in that foreign country for the unfair treatment he claimed to have received. We told him we could not do that,"" the minister writes. Nor could the country help the Singaporean living in Indonesia who requested the foreign office help ship a computer ordered online from the United States. Singapore's consular officials handled 3,000 cases last year, filed by Singaporeans who made some seven million trips abroad. That number is dwarfed by the volume of requests received by larger countries including the United Kingdom, whose Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) handled more than 52,000 cases the same year. It's not just Singaporeans . In what seems to have become an annual warning to potential time-wasters, the FCO released a list last May of some of its most misdirected queries. They include the man who asked consular staff in Rome to translate a phrase for his new tattoo, and a woman who complained about the poor quality of football boots ""made in China."" So bizarre were some of the requests made to the foreign office in Australia that it was suggested the country consider charging a fee for consular assistance. In a policy brief, ""Consular Conundrum,"" published in March 2013, author Alex Oliver lays out the case for a charge, nothing that ""expectations of what our diplomats can or should do for distressed travelers overseas are climbing, and in some cases becoming more unrealistic."" According to the report, some of the stranger requests to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) include: ""Will the sand in Egypt upset my asthma?"" and ""Could DFAT feed my dogs while I'm away?"" In the past, Canadian officials have also found the need to remind travelers of what they can and cannot do. In 2011, the then minister of foreign affairs Diana Ablonczy spelled it out in a press release: . ""Consular officials CANNOT (her capitals): ask your mother-in-law to leave your house, purchase tickets for a musical or entertainment event, settle disputes between you and your partner (and), pickup your dog at the airport.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunmen fired on a children's aid group in Pakistan's tribal region Monday, leaving three staffers dead and at least one critically injured, the organization said. Pakistani paramilitary soldiers patrol in Quetta, the Balochistan capital. And earlier Monday a suicide bomber struck Pakistan's military headquarters in Rawalpindi Monday, killing at least eight people, including the army's top ranking medical officer and himself, military officials said. Lt. Gen. Mushtaq Ahmed Baig, the army surgeon-general, was among those killed in the blast in Rawalpindi, the officials said. The non-governmental organization, Plan, said that at around 4:15 p.m. up to a dozen men carrying guns and grenades entered the office in Mansehra, in the North West Frontier Province -- Pakistan's lawless tribal region bordering Afghanistan. The gunmen began firing and detonated three explosive devices. Video from the scene showed the building engulfed in smoke and flames as staffers tried to escape from windows. Others were carried out by hand or on stretchers. The fire destroyed the building. Plan's chief executive, Tom Miller, said the office immediately shut down as security teams looked into the incident. ""Our primary concern is for our staff and the families of those hurt in the attack,"" Miller said in a written statement. The motive for the attack remains under investigation. Officials were not aware of any prior threats to the office, Plan spokesman Jon Slater told CNN. Slater said 21 full-time and seven part-time employees work at the office, though it's unclear how many were present at the time of the attack. Most of the employees are locals. Plan, which helps Pakistani communities provide education and other opportunities to children, has had a presence in the region for more than a decade. The group says it was deeply involved in the relief effort following a major earthquake in 2005 that left nearly 3 million people homeless. At least 20 others were wounded in the Rawalpindi suicide bombing which happened along Mall Road, a heavily traveled thoroughfare in Rawalpindi, according to Pakistani officials.  Watch the aftermath of the suicide bombing » . The government promoted Baig to lieutenant general last January and he assumed his role as army surgeon-general the following month, according to a news release at the time. Baig, who graduated from a Lahore medical college, was an ophthalmologist. Rawalpindi, which lies just outside Islamabad, is a closely guarded city and home to Pakistan's military headquarters. It has, in recent months, experienced several suicide bomb attacks -- including the recent assassination of Benazir Bhutto. The government blames the attacks on militants operating out of the country's northwest tribal areas that border Afghanistan. In early February, a suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle into a van carrying army medics, killing at least four people. Opposition leader and Pakistan's former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed at a rally in the city on December 27. A bomber blew himself up near her limousine, and videotape showed a gunman firing toward her vehicle as she left the rally. Both the Pakistani government and British investigators concluded that she died from the suicide blast, not from a gunshot wound. Violent riots in the wake of her death forced the postponement of parliamentary elections. The government contends that Bhutto's killing was orchestrated by Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban who has ties to al Qaeda. The CIA reached the same conclusion. Two months before Bhutto's assassination, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive near the army headquarters -- which houses President Pervez Musharraf's office -- killing six people and wounding 10 others. Musharraf who was inside his office at the time of the blast was not injured. Musharraf survived two assassination attempts in the city in 2003. And in September, two suicide bombers blew themselves up, killing at least 25 people. One attack targeted a bus carrying government employees. The other involved a suicide bomber who crashed his motorcycle into cars. E-mail to a friend .","NEW: Raid on children's aid organization in Pakistan's tribal region kills three .
