A celebrated sculptor is designing a statue in tribute to a doctor who performed pioneering plastic surgery on his father's burned face saving him from a lifetime of horrendous disfigurement. Martin Jennings' father Michael suffered horrific burns during the Second World War and was discovered in hospital by surgeon Archibald McIndoe. A lieutenant in the 15/19 Hussars he had suffered the devastating effects of a tank blaze in October 1944 which had melted the skin on much of his face and hands. Tribute: Martin Jennings' (pictured) father Michael was . horrifically burned during the Second World War and was discovered in . hospital by surgeon Archibald McIndoe who went on to transform his melted face . Now Mr Jennings, who created the sculpture of Sir John Betjeman in St Pancras Station, is creating a lasting memorial to the surgeon, who he credits with saving his father's life. When it's finished the statue will sit in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where McIndoe was based at a small cottage hospital. The town became known as 'the . town that did not stare', as his disfigured and recovering patients went about trying to rebuild their lives. Mr Jennings junior, from Oxfordshire, said he only fully . appreciated what McIndoe had done for his father when he visited the hospital recently and saw . photographs of his father's face before and after surgery. His father rarely spoke of the devastating blaze but once described the way fire filled the tank as 'like a Pentecostal wind' when the shell hit it. He was awarded the Military Cross as he went back to the burning tank to get medication for his men which made his injuries all the worse. Cheers: Sir Archibald McIndoe having a drink with a group of his Guinea Pigs at an early 1940's reunion party . McIndoe had found him bandaged from . head to toe with only a hole for his mouth, in a Birmingham hospital and . immediately ordered him to be moved to West Sussex where he began to treat him. At the time Mr Jennings thought his life was over, but after surgery he remarkably went on to become a teacher and . then headmaster, having 11 children in total. Mr Jennings junior told the Guardian: 'Without Mac none of us might be here'. Faced with injuries that surgeons at the . time had little experience of, New Zealander McIndoe came up with . innovative ways of treating injured airmen who, because of the . experimental nature of the work being done on them, became known as . Guinea Pigs. The Guinea Pig Club, which by the end of . the war had 649 members, was formed and was McIndoe's effort to make life easier for . the soldiers by getting them to integrate with local people. Life-changing: Martin Jennings' father as a young serviceman, left, before the blaze and right, after surgery . Now in their 80s and 90s, they were . regularly seen about town defying their injuries, attending dances, . drinking in pubs and watching films. Many went on to marry local girls . and nurses who treated them. When . the war began, the cottage hospital in East Grinstead, essentially a . prefabricated building, expanded and became known as the Queen Victoria, . establishing a specialist burns centre, which remains so today. McIndoe, who died in 1960 aged 60, created the Blond McIndoe . Research Foundation, a medical research centre based at the hospital which specialised in skin . wound repair. It opened a year after his death. Jacquie . Pinney, chief executive of the foundation, said: 'People in the . hospital know of McIndoe and his work but there is no permanent memorial . to him in the town which was so much a part of his work and the . rehabilitation of these men.' Many of the . techniques McIndoe developed, when plastic surgery was in its infancy, . are still used to save the lives of burns patients. His . major innovation was his method of removing dead skin and replacing it . with skin taken from other parts of the patient's body. McIndoe . believed cutting away the unhealthy skin within two weeks under . anesthetic produced better results  -  this is something that has become . standard procedure. The . surgeon also recognised the need to deal with the psychological trauma . of his patients, many of whom would be in hospital for years.

She's back: Sally Bercow has reactivated her twitter feed after closing it down following a string of high profile blunders . Sally Bercow has reactivated her Twitter account after she closed it following a string of high profile blunders which left her in legal hot water. Despite admitting that she had her 'a**-whipped' by her lawyer and husband over her Twitter activity when deleting her account a little over  week ago, the Speaker's wife said that she was 'humbly' reactivating her feed as she has learnt lessons and 'will not screw up again'. Last night she Tweeted: 'Humbly reactivating account on #Levesoneve *grabs tinsel & mince pies* coz learnt lesson, miss Twitter & will not screw up again. Hello!' She later said: 'Better add *fingers crossed* to last tweet actually....' Mrs Bercow closed her account on November 20 after her most recent high profile error - naming a British runaway schoolgirl protected by a court order. The breach prompted calls for her to 'turn off Twitter' to avoid any more legal problems. Her exit from Twitter also came just a fortnight after she used the site to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine following a BBC2 Newsnight report which alleged a senior Conservative figure from the Thatcher era was a child abuser. He was not named on the programme but was identified quickly online. It later emerged that he was the victim of mistaken identity. Lord McAlpine, who settled with the BBC for £185,000, is now said to be suing Mrs Bercow, although she insists that what she said on Twitter was ‘mischievous’ rather than ‘libellous’. Legal experts had urged her to turn off the account after she referred to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a 30-year-old teacher in Eastbourne, East Sussex, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September after allegedly running away with a schoolgirl. He had been charged with abducting a child and remanded in custody at a court hearing a week before the Tweet when the court made a Section 39 Order under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, banning the naming of the teenager.

On best behaviour: Mrs Bercow later added that she has her fingers crossed that her Tweets won't land her in any more hot water .

Final tweet: In a message to her thousands of followers Mrs Bercow revealed she had a telling off after naming the girl and that she hoped to be back . Legal experts said at the time that using a social networking site such as Twitter to comment does constitute publication, meaning Mrs Bercow, a Labour activist, could face a fine. Sarah Webb, a media lawyer with the firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: ‘The contempt of court requirements will apply to her just the same as any newspaper or broadcaster. I would advise her to be very cautious. ‘I would certainly urge her to turn off her Twitter account at the moment. Reference: The Labour activist was referring to the case of Jeremy Forrest, a teacher in Eastbourne, who was arrested in Bordeaux in September.

Legal action: Earlier this month she used Twitter to name former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine, following a Newsnight report which alleged a senior Tory figure was a child abuser . 'She may not know the law, but equally most people who have an understanding of these things know that in respect of actions involving children and things like that, you can’t go around naming them.

"By . James Salmon . PUBLISHED: . 11:05 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:52 EST, 30 August 2012 . Scandal-hit Barclays has appointed insider Antony Jenkins on a package of up to £8.6million to replace disgraced former chief executive Bob Diamond. Mr Jenkins, 51, from Stoke-on-Trent – who is described by colleagues as the 'nice guy' of banking – admitted it was 'not a job for the faint-hearted'. Announcement of his appointment came just hours after the bank admitted it faces a criminal investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office for its dealings with Qatari investors. Boss: Antony Jenkins has vowed to overhaul the bank after being named as immediate successor to Bob Diamond . The probe concerns payments made to the Middle Eastern investors at the height of the financial crisis when they backed a rescue deal that gave Barclays a £4.5billion lifeline. Mr Jenkins most recently was head of Barclays's retail and business banking arm, looking after 50million customers and 90,000 staff worldwide. He promised to put customers 'at the centre of what we do', and admitted Barclays had made grave errors, including mis-selling PPI loan insurance that cost it £1.3billion in compensation. 'We have made serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with our stakeholders' expectations,' he said. The keen marathon runner and married father-of-two is a veteran of Barclays, having joined its management development programme in 1983. He returned to the bank in 2006 to run Barclaycard after a 16-year spell at rival US bank Citigroup, which this week paid £373million to settle a legal dispute with shareholders over claims it lied over its huge investments in toxic loans. Former boss: Bob Diamond was once described by Lord Mandleson as the 'unacceptable face of banking' and was forced out of his job after the Libor rate-rigging scandal earlier this year . Barclays has endured one of the most . turbulent periods in its history after it was fined £290 million by UK . and US regulators for manipulating Libor, an interbank lending rate . which affects mortgages and loans . He will not enjoy the same riches as . his predecessor, who scooped £17million last year, but critics . complained he has still hit the jackpot. Mr . Jenkins will receive a basic salary of £1.1million and an annual bonus . of up to £2.75million, as well as shares in Barclays's long-term . incentive plan worth up to £4.4million and a cash allowance of £363,000 . instead of a pension. Deborah Hargreaves of the High Pay Centre . think-tank said: 'By anyone's standards this is still a massive amount . of money. Educated at Oxford University, Mr Jenkins, 51, began his career at Barclays nearly 30 years ago, when he completed the Barclays Management Development Programme before going on to hold various roles in retail and corporate banking. He moved to Citigroup in 1989, working in both London and New York and most recently held a senior role in the credit card division. He re-joined Barclays as chief executive of Barclaycard in January 2006 and was appointed chief executive of retail and business banking, with a seat on the executive committee, in November 2009. Married for 28 years and a father of two, he comes from Stoke-on-Trent and spends his spare time running marathons. Where his predecessor Mr Diamond was regarded as a brash, American investment banker - once described by Lord Mandelson as the 'unacceptable face of banking' due to his lavish pay deals - Mr Jenkins is a far more conservative choice. 'If Barclays is really serious about . cleaning up its act there needs to be a fairer pay policy, with people . at the bottom given a fair wage and those at the top showing more . restraint.' Mr Jenkins admitted his salary is 'a . lot of money' but claimed his basic pay was 'slightly below the  median' for bosses in the FTSE 100 index. Mr Diamond was forced to quit in July . after the bank was fined £290million in a separate scandal over rigging . crucial Libor interest rates. Chairman Marcus Agius also resigned. It is thought Barclays made a . conscious effort to steer clear of hiring another 'casino' banker' to . replace Mr Diamond, after the revelations of traders promising each . other champagne to fiddle the rates caused the lender's reputation to . sink to a new low. The bank's chief financial officer Chris Lucas is . one of four individuals being investigated by the Financial Services . Authority over Middle Eastern transactions. Critics pointed out Mr Jenkins was at . the helm at Barclaycard while it mis-sold payment protection insurance . to customers alongside credit cards. He yesterday insisted the worst of the mis-selling occurred before he joined. However, he was also boss of the . retail bank when it was fined £7.7million in January last year for . luring thousands of elderly customers into risky investments. Marc Gander, of the Consumer Action . Group, said: 'How on earth does Barclays expect to restore public . confidence unless it brings in someone from outside the bank with clean . hands? Jenkins was in the thick of a number of important scandals.' The Financial Services Authority was . already investigating Barclays over concerns surrounding rescue deals . totalling £11.5billion with Qatar and Abu Dhabi. It is one of a number . of banks under investigation over Libor rigging.

"By . Shari Miller . PUBLISHED: . 07:35 EST, 13 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 13 August 2012 . Police stopped nearly 700,000 people on the streets of New York last year, compared to 90,000 in the aftermath of 9/11. Nearly 87 per cent were of black or Hispanic ethnicity. Of these, half were frisked and ten per cent were arrested. Under fire: NYPD officers were left in a stand-off with a machete-wielding man after they stopped him in Times Square on Saturday . The figures come in the wake of a terrifying stand-off in Times Square at the weekend, in which a machete-wielding knifeman repeatedly lunged at New York Police Department (NYPD) officers before being fatally shot in front of shocked tourists. Darrius Kennedy, a 51-year-old black man who appeared to be smoking marijuana, had become agitated on Saturday afternoon when officers approached him near West 44th Street and Seventh Avenue, one of the city's busiest tourist destinations. Critics of the stop-and-frisk policy claim officers use racial profiling and have unfairly stopped a number of people. US district judge Shira Scheindlin . said there was 'overwhelming . evidence' that police have conducted thousands of unlawful stops based . on flimsy justification such as 'furtive movement'. She berated the NYPD for displaying 'a deeply troubling apathy toward New Yorkers' most fundamental constitutional rights'. In January, Bronx . teenager Jateik Reed, 19, was brutally beaten by police officers in what his attorney called 'a stop-and-frisk gone terribly wrong'. Officers alleged he was carrying plastic bags with drugs, but video footage showed Mr Reed moments before his encounter with the police, . walking down the street with his hands out by his sides. Mr . Reed was stopped on January 26 by officers and thrown to the . ground, handcuffed and taken away, before being charged with a variety . of crimes. All charges have since been dropped by the Bronx district . attorney, Robert T Johnson. Under arrest: Mr Reed, right, was stopped by police because they claimed he had drugs in his hands . In May, a judge granted class-action status to a lawsuit brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights on behalf of four black men, meaning thousands of others who have been stopped over the years could potentially add their names to the complaint. The New York Civil Liberties Union also rolled out a Stop and Frisk Watch smartphone app in June that allows bystanders to record police stops and instantly alert others to where it is taking place. Police commissioner Raymond Kelly has since announced changes to officer training and supervision, and the number of stops has since declined dramatically. Keeping watch: New York Civil Liberties Union have released an app, Stop and Frisk Watch, to keep people informed of where police searches are being carried out . But the commissioner and mayor Michael Bloomberg fiercely defend the aggressive policing and credit it with transforming New York into one of the safest big cities in the US. They say the stop-and-frisk programme has helped prevent thousands of deaths by taking guns off the street and deny allegations of racial profiling, saying more blacks and Hispanics are stopped because many minority neighbourhoods have the highest crime rates. Mr Bloomberg said: 'Nobody should ask Ray Kelly to apologise - he's not going to and neither am I. 'And I think it's fair to say that stop, question and frisk has been an essential part of the NYPD's work.' Other cities have adopted policies similar to New York's, provoking the same debate. Last year, officials in Philadelphia placed its 'stop and frisk' programme under court supervision to settle a federal lawsuit alleging racial profiling. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee faced a backlash when he raised the possibility of adopting 'stop and frisk' to get guns off the streets. Mr Lee announced last Tuesday that he was no longer considering it. In New York, the police department, whose officers were hailed as heroes in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, has seen its approval ratings soar as homicide rates plummet, from a high of 2,245 killings in 1990 to 515 last year. A poll in March found that 63 per cent of New York City voters approve of how the country's largest police force is doing its job. But New Yorkers are divided about 'stop and frisk'. Art of the matter: A woman walks past a street mural in New York with her children which depicts a person's rights during a stop and frisk . While 49 per cent of voters disapproved of the policy, only four per cent approved. The poll also revealed deep splits along racial lines. While nearly 60 per cent of white voters were in favour of the tactic, 68 per cent of black people were opposed. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union, 168,126 black males between the ages of 14 and 24 were stopped - more than the 158,406 people who are in that group. The 'stop-and-frisk' policy dates back to the 1990s when mayor Rudy Giuliani adopted a 'zero tolerance' approach to policing. Mayor Giulliani claimed that cracking down on minor offences would help reduce serious crime. Pressure has now been building in the . city against the practice. Thousands . of New Yorkers took part in a silent march against the policy, while a New York Times editorial called on the Bloomberg administration to stop . fighting the lawsuit and 'reform its abusive stop-and-frisk' policy.

Mary Bousted said the start of Shakespeare's plays leave many pupils bored and 'gritting their teeth' Children should skip the ‘slow’ opening scenes of Shakespeare’s plays and go straight to the ‘dramatic’ parts in the middle, a teaching union leader has said. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the start of the Bard’s plays left many pupils bored and ‘gritting their teeth’. Instead, teachers should give children edited highlights of the best bits of his plays ‘like a film trailer’ to keep them interested, she said. Her comments were attacked by educational campaigners, who accused her of ‘promoting ignorance’ and dumbing down. In the Times Education Supplement, Dr Bousted wrote: ‘The trouble with teaching Shakespeare is not the distance between our contemporary use of language and Shakespeare’s Elizabethan English. ‘Nor is it the complex (and often, frankly, ridiculous) plots of his plays. No, the trouble with teaching Shakespeare is that the Bard is given far too much respect. Is it any wonder that so many students grit their teeth, learn the lines and, when the exam is over, remember Shakespeare only as something that had to be endured in pursuit of an exam pass?’ Dr Bousted said Shakespeare’s genius lay in taking ‘mundane, plodding material’ and transforming it into compelling drama. ‘These tricks are used today in soap operas around the world, with their mix of high drama, tragedy and comedy,’ she said. ‘Students will approach Shakespeare more confidently if they are able to make connections between what they already know and the unfamiliar world that they are about to enter. Mary Bousted suggested children should watch an edited highlights of Shakespeare 'like a film trailer' instead . ‘So don’t start at the beginning. Taking inspiration from film trailers, give novice Shakespeare readers a taste of the most highly dramatic scenes in the play.’ Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said Dr Bousted’s position was ‘incredible’ and ‘disturbing’. He said: ‘I think she’s promoting ignorance and she’s dumbing down. The whole point of studying drama and Shakespeare included is that you understand the whole play, not just parts of it. ‘It’s the computer games mentality that you only have what are seen to be action and excitement but Shakespeare and most dramatists are about far more than that. But Jacqui O’Hanlon, director of education at the Royal Shakespeare Company, said: ‘We completely agree that the best way to introduce Shakespeare to students is not necessarily to start them with Act I Scene i. ‘Instead, we can ignite their curiosity about the characters and their dilemmas by using a particular moment as a starting point.’","Mary Bousted said many of Shakespeare's plays left pupils bored .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:19 EST, 13 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:19 EST, 13 June 2012 . In the stables at a prominent quarter horse track in New Mexico, workers quietly nicknamed Jose Trevino Morales's stables as the 'Zetas' stables' and said they often saw people show up with bags of cash to buy the horses. Authorities raided those stables on Tuesday and a horse ranch in Oklahoma, accusing Trevino and others of running a sophisticated money-laundering operation connected to one of Mexico's most powerful and ruthless drug cartels. Federal authorities accuse Trevino's older brother, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, a key figure in the Zetas drug operation, of setting up the horse operation that the younger brother ran from the sprawling ranch near Lexington, south of Oklahoma City. Links to the underworld: Jose Trevino Morales (center) is believed to have laundered money through his ranches in Oklahoma for the powerful and feared Mexican drug cartel, the Zetas . Millions of dollars went through the operation, which bought, trained, bred and raced quarter horses throughout the southwest United States, including the famed Ruidoso Downs track in New Mexico. Jose Trevino, his wife and five others were arrested. Seven others, including another Trevino brother, were charged but remain at large. Richard Weber, the chief of the IRS' criminal investigation unit, said: 'This case is a prime example of the ability of Mexican drug cartels to establish footholds in legitimate U.S. industries and highlights the serious threat money laundering causes to our financial system.' The indictment, unsealed Tuesday, described how the Trevino brothers and a network quietly arranged to purchase quarter horses with drug money at auction and disguise the source of the funds used to buy them so that the Zetas' involvement would be masked. They would often pay in cash, or use fake names, which helped keep the owners and money a secret. Corruption: Police take a horse away from the stable area at Ruidoso Downs Racetrack and Casino in Ruidoso, New Mexico as they arrested the owner for his links to drug cartels . Protection: The FBI stayed on the Oklahoma ranch to stop the horses being taken to Mexico after the owner was suspected of ties to a drug cartel . Since 2008, the operation racked up millions of dollars in transactions in California, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, prosecutors said. The New York Times first reported the raids and the alleged connection to the Zetas cartel, citing  months of investigation and several anonymous sources. The operation, Tremor Enterprises LLC, started small, but worked in plain sight. Some horses carried names with drug references, like Number One Cartel and Coronita Cartel. Over time, the horses and the operation earned a place on some of the most elite stages in the industry. One horse named Mr. Piloto won a $1 million prize at Ruidoso Downs on Labor Day 2010, going off at odds of 22-1. His trainer, Felipe Quintero, 28, was one of the seven arrested Tuesday. The Zetas are one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels, with a reputation for willing to commit atrocities including kidnapping, decapitating and dismembering enemies. The elder Trevino is the second-in-command and one of the U.S. and Mexican governments' most wanted men, known for his brutality. One technique favored by Miguel Angel Trevino Morales is the 'guiso, or stew, in which enemies are placed in 55-gallon drums and burned alive. Champions: Owner Jose Trevino, left, talks on a cell phone as jockey Esgar Ramirez and horse Mr. Piloto are led to the winner's circle after winning the All American Futurity horse race at Ruidoso Down in 2010 . Underscoring the threat of the Zetas, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico issued a travel advisory today, warning the arrests could result in some form of retaliation and urged U.S. citizens in Mexico to maintain a low profile. Jose Trevino and his horse operation in the United States appeared to work with little fear of getting caught by authorities. Three stable workers at the Ruidoso Downs Race Track and Casino said that Trevino's stables were known as the 'Zetas' stables,' and two of the workers described seeing people from Mexico show up to the stables with duffel bags of cash to purchase horses. The workers, who refused to give their names, spoke anonymously because they feared retaliation from the Zetas cartel. It wasn't just the cash purchases that caught the attention of those in the quarter horse racing industry. The amount of money Trevino and his network paid for horses also raised eyebrows. Debbie Schauf, the director of the Oklahoma Quarter Horse Racing Association, said Jose Trevino showed up a few years ago and quickly earned a reputation for always paying his bills and shelling out handsome prices for some of the top horses in the country. Gruesome: Nine bodies have been found hanging from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico - the heart of a drug war where Los Zetas cartel are powerful players . Quarter horses are smaller but more muscular than thoroughbreds and can run short distances faster than other horses. 'They were also recognized for taking care of their business. They paid their bills and didn't cause any trouble. You didn't have a food vendor or veterinarian calling to say they couldn't get these guys to pay their bills. They were good citizens in the horse industry,' she said. While it was common for buyers based out of the country to pay cash for horses, she said several transactions were noteworthy for their value. 'It didn't raise a lot of eyebrows when these guys came to the sales and started paying cash. What raised eyebrows was the quality of the horses they were buying and the amount of money these mares cost,' Schauf said. The defendants, including Jose Trevino, were each charged today with one count of money laundering and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors asked that no bond be set for Trevino fearing he would either flee or intimidate witnesses. Neither Trevino nor his lawyer, Tony Lacy, commented and a lawyer for Zulema Trevino said he knew little about the case. U.S. Magistrate Robert Bacharach said he would appoint lawyers for the pair after they said the government was trying to seize all their property. 'I don't have any assets as of today,' Trevino told the judge. During the raids on Tuesday, dozens of federal agents swarmed the New Mexico race track, wearing bulletproof vests and collecting evidence. At least two horses were taken away. Shaun Hubbard, general manager of the Ruidoso Downs Race Track and Casino, said the track officials are cooperating with federal authorities. Seizure warrants were issued for 41 horses deemed the operations' most valuable, in an effort to prevent them being taken to Mexico. Among those was Mr. Piloto. The government sought an order to ensure the care of 384 other horses at the ranch, which sits among rolling hills about 40 miles south of Oklahoma City. At least a half-dozen agents wearing military-style fatigues and baseball caps emblazoned with FBI stood by at the ranch Tuesday afternoon as horses roamed on crisply manicured lawns. Telephone messages left at the ranch were not immediately returned. Neighbors said the ranch changed hands about a year ago, but few knew the couple well. Chelsey Krueger, a student at Oklahoma City Community College who lives just south of the ranch, said she had never met the owners but knew when they were around. 'They were always in a Suburban, driving around with really loud music.

A mother-of-two has won almost £10,000 in damages from cosmetics firm Avon after she was unfairly dismissed after being told 'If you wish to have a family life then this is not the job for you'. Shauna Connelly told an employment tribunal she felt pressured into working 60-hour weeks despite only being contracted for 40 - and said the firm's 'hypocritical' treatment of her flew in the face of its slogan: 'Avon - the company for women.' The tribunal, in Newcastle, found that she was unfairly dismissed . from Avon and that the firm covered up evidence of 'bullying' when . investigating her grievance. She has been awarded almost £10,000 in damages. Tribunal: Shauna Connelly has won almost £10,000 in damages from cosmetics giant Avon after being unfairly dismissed. The tribunal heard her line manager made derogatory comments towards her . The 46-year-old, of West Denton, Newcastle, had worked at Avon for nine years and says that initially she 'absolutely loved' her job. She spent five years working for the company on a freelance basis as a sales representative. But in 2008, Mrs Connelly, who has two boys now aged 18 and 13, became employed by Avon as an area manager on a permanent contract - and that was when the problems began. She said: 'I had been number one for sales in my area, I was good at my job. I really believed in Avon as a company, and I loved the products. 'I was told that I'd be working around 40-hours a week in my new position. However, pretty much as soon as I started I was told I needed to work 60-hour weeks if I wanted to reach my targets.' In August 2011, with the recession in full-swing, she, along with other area managers working for the company, failed to meet some of her targets. She was called to what she was told . would be an informal 'chat' at a hotel but was shocked when she turned . up and discovered it was in fact a meeting held to discuss her . performance. Mrs Connelly . had assumed the meeting would be held in private, but was distressed . when it was conducted in the foyer of a busy hotel in full view of . guests. The tribunal ruling . states: 'The background to the complaint of unfair dismissal was the . conduct of Ms Armstrong in relation to the complainant. 'We considered that the former must have known that the discussion on August 2 would amount to a concern meeting. Colleagues: Mrs Connelly with her former line manager Joan Armstrong (left). She claims staff made derogatory comments about Miss Armstrong and the comments were never revealed to her . 'However, her failure to notify the . claimant in advance of that fact or to arrange a more private venue than . the main reception area of a large hotel accorded with the respondent's . usual practice in these situations.' The . tribunal accepted the meeting itself did not amount to bullying on that . occasion, but Mrs Connelly says it was at this point that she claims she was told . that if she wished to have a 'family life' with her partner and two boys . then the job was not for her. She . said: 'After the meeting I started to feel really ill, I went to see a . doctor who told me if carried on working, I was in danger of having a . stroke. My blood pressure was sky high. 'I felt I had no choice but to go off sick.' She . put in a formal grievance about her treatment that same month and . colleagues of her line manager Joan Armstrong were asked to give feedback about her . (Miss Armstrong's) performance. One member of staff described Miss Armstrong as: 'Inconsistent, Jekyll and Hyde, some managers are frightened of her.' Problems: Mrs Connelly, pictured when she worked for Avon, had worked at Avon for nine years and says that initially she 'absolutely loved' her job until she was handed a permanent contract and struggled to meet targets . The colleague added: 'She has no respect or consideration for work, life balance. She can have an aggressive manner on the phone. She tells managers to work nights and weekends. 'She is unapproachable and untrustworthy and lacks empathy.' There were also number of positive comments including one response from a staff member which said: 'Allows you to make your own mistakes then supports you afterwards, available at any time' and added that she is 'no pushover and doesn't make things personal'. However, the majority of responses were negative. Despite a number of meetings between Avon and Mrs Connelly the nature of some of the feedback about Miss Armostrong was never revealed. She was repeatedly told there was no evidence of bullying, but only some 'development' issues. In February 2012 Mrs Connelly resigned, as she said she felt she was being misled by Avon and had no choice. The tribunal panel ruling stated 'The matter, to adopt a cliché, was to be swept under the carpet. 'The claimant - who, so far as they knew, was not aware of the results of the anonymous questionnaire - was to be told, as before, that there were some 'development' issues which were being pursued with Ms Armstrong but there was no evidence of bullying. 'That was simply not the case.' Mrs Connelly was awarded £9,500.88 in compensation after the ruling in January this year, but said that she has been left in debt after being forced to resign from her £333 a week job with Avon. She represented herself throughout the hearing and said she was 'terrified' but happy with the outcome, after which Avon's barrister shook her hand. After the tribunal, which concluded in January, a spokesperson for Avon said: 'As the company for women, Avon believes in treating our Independent Representatives and employees equitably, with fairness and respect. 'We have a firm commitment to fair play and equal opportunities and as a company our commitment sits at the heart of everything that we do. 'Whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, we are naturally very disappointed at the tribunal's outcome.'","Shauna Connelly said she felt pressured into working 60-hour weeks despite only being contracted for 40 .

Psychopath Sutcliffe said: 'Dr Murray turned down several medium secure units willing to accept me.' Patients in high secure . hospitals, such as Broadmoor are classed as a grave and immediate danger . to the public who require a significant period of treatment. Patients in medium security units, of . which there are around 30 around the country, still present a . significant danger, but will remain in treatment between two and five years. Face of a killer: Sutcliffe has claimed he is 'cured' and will one day be able to 'pop to the shops' in taped conversations. He is pictured right on his wedding day in 1974 . According to the recordings Sutcliffe, who was jailed for life in 1981 after admitting killing 13 women and attempting to murder seven more, has been deemed a 'low risk' prisoner as long as he takes his medication. During the calls, which the Sun reports were made every Tuesday and lasted 15 minutes, he also defends Jimmy Savile, as police investigate 300 cases of alleged abuse by the former BBC star across three decades. He claimed the victims were talking 'rubbish' and insisted his old friend was innocent.

Sutcliffe, who once reached 20 stone while in the secure unit, said he was in good health and said he was a believer in going to bed early, and waking up early. In the chats with his brother he also discussed his opinions on general topics such as marriage, which he believes is dying out as an institution, university fees, which he has deemed to expensive when there is no guarantee of a job at the end, and celebrations such as New Year's Eve, 'just an ordinary day'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 14 January 2012 . Chief Operating Officer of the UK business division of Tesco, Noel Robbins, sold off shares days before value plunged . A senior Tesco executive sold shares just over a week before a profit warning sent their value plunging. Noel ‘Bob’ Robbins, the supermarket chain’s UK chief operating officer, sold 50,000 shares at 404p on January 4, netting around £202,000. Had he sold at yesterday’s much lower closing price, he would have been more than £40,000 worse off. His sell-off came eight days before Tesco reported its biggest drop in sales for decades – triggering a 16 per cent fall in its share price. It was also just three days before the end of the period covered by its trading statement. UK listing rules say directors should not buy or sell shares in their company while in possession of unpublished, price-sensitive information. The regulations, policed by the Financial Services Authority, also require directors and senior managers to obtain board-level approval before selling shares and forbid trading in shares during so-called close periods between the end of a financial period and the reporting of results. One shareholder watchdog described the sale as troubling. ‘It doesn’t look very good, especially in this case, when you are head of UK operations,’ said Simon Wong, of corporate governance watchdog Governance4Owners. Tesco insisted it and Mr Robbins had operated within the rules. A Tesco store sign. Underlying takings fell 2.3 per cent for the chain over Christmas . ‘Bob Robbins sold less than 5 per cent of his substantial shareholding in Tesco for necessary family expenditure,’ a spokesman said. ‘We are confident that Bob was not in possession of any price-sensitive information at the time the sale was approved.’ Mr Wong said however that operating within the letter of the law was not enough: ‘If these companies say it’s still within the rules, then I think the rules may need to change, because this is a concern and it damages confidence.’ The FSA says its listing rules are designed not only to avoid abuse but also to ensure that the right thing is seen to be done. Companies are given the freedom to impose even stricter guidelines should they deem it necessary. A Tesco store worker pushing a trolley oustide one of the chain's many stores in Ilfracombe, North Devon . Under Tesco’s rules, directors were barred from trading company shares from January 7 to January 12. Other retailers opted for much longer close periods ahead of their key Christmas trading updates. Those of Marks & Spencer and J Sainsbury, for example, both ran for about four weeks. The importance of keeping to the spirit, as well as the letter, of rules on personal dealings was highlighted last week when Swiss National Bank chairman Philipp Hildebrand resigned, saying he could not prove he had been unaware of a currency trade made by his wife. A Tesco veteran, Mr Robbins was appointed UK chief operating officer on March 1 last year, having previously worked as chief executive officer for central and eastern Europe and strategy and development director in Asia. The 54-year-old sits on the group’s executive committee, one level below its main board. Another executive, Ken Towle, sold nearly £155,000 of shares shortly before Christmas. The head of Tesco’s online arm would have been £28,000 worse off had he held on until yesterday, when the shares closed at 316p. With its profit warning, Tesco said underlying takings fell by 2.3 per cent at Christmas, the most crucial trading period of the year. A flagship promotion, called the Big Price Drop, failed to bring in enough shoppers, while bosses admitted that a decision to cut back on vouchers and meal deals was wrong. Tesco’s share of the Christmas grocery market dipped below 30 per cent for the first time in six years. One City analyst said it was the ‘nightmare scenario’.","Chief operating officer Noel Robbins would have been £40,000 worse off if he'd sold shares after the share price dropped .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 12:12 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:42 EST, 3 May 2013 . Children who were aggressive or cruel had reduced brain activity in response to images of others in pain . Brain scans can be used to identify children who may be potential psychopaths, new research has shown. Scientists have found that certain areas of a psychopath's  brain showed a reduced activity in response to images of . others in pain. The regions affected are those known to play a role in . empathy, the ability to relate to other people's feelings. Scientists say the patterns could act as a marker to single . out children at a risk of becoming adult psychopaths. A total of 55 boys aged 10 to 16 were assessed in the study. Of these, 37 met the criteria for children with 'conduct problems' (CP) according to questionnaire answers provided . by parents and teachers. CP children display a plethora of antisocial traits . including aggression and dishonesty. Like the central character in Lionel Shriver's novel We Need . to Talk About Kevin, they can be callous and cruel. Youngsters with conduct problems are not likely to follow in . Kevin's footsteps and commit a school massacre, but the research findings . suggest at least some could grow up to be psychopaths. 'Our findings indicate that children with conduct . problems have an atypical brain response to seeing other people in pain,' psychologist Professor Essi Viding from University College London said. 'It is important to view these findings as an indicator . of early vulnerability, rather than biological destiny. 'We know that children can be very responsive to . interventions, and the challenge is to make those interventions even better, so . that we can really help the children, their families, and their wider social . environment.' About five per cent of children qualify for a diagnosis of CP, but . little is known about the condition's underlying cause. Participants in the study underwent functional magnetic . resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while being shown images of other people's hands . and feet in painful and non-painful situations. Some psychopaths display disturbing symptoms from a young age, such the main protagonist in Lionel Shriver's book We Need to Talk about Kevin. A distinct difference was seen in the brain responses of . children with and without CP. In children with conduct problems, brain activity in three . key regions was reduced when looking at the pictures. They were the bilateral anterior insula, the anterior . cingulate cortex, and the inferior frontal gyrus. All are regions associated in previous studies with feelings . of empathy for others in pain. The scientists wrote in the journal Current Biology: 'We show that callous traits in particular may underlie atypical neural . responses to others' pain in CP, which may represent an early neurobiological . marker for later psychopathy. 'It remains an empirical question whether empathic . responding can be normalised in children with CP.' Not all children with conduct problems displayed a . vulnerability to psychopathy, the researchers stressed. 'This raises the possibility of tailoring existing . interventions to suit the specific profile of atypical processing that . characterises a child with conduct problems,' Prof Viding said.","Researchers at University College London found that children diagnosed with 'conduct problems' react abnormally to seeing people in pain .

"By . Jill Reilly and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:45 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:01 EST, 2 May 2013 . Acknowledging the uncertainty that lies ahead, President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. will cooperate with Mexico in fighting drug-trafficking and organized crime in any way Mexico's government deems appropriate. He recommitted the U.S. to fighting the demand for illegal drugs and the flow of illegal guns across the border with Mexico even as the southern neighbor rethinks how much access it gives to U.S. security agencies. 'I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve,' Obama said at a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. 'It is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations — including the United States.' Arrival: President Barack Obama waves as he arrives to Benito Juarez International airport in Mexico City, Thursday . Agenda: To sell his immigration overhaul back home, Obama (center) needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president willing to help him secure the border . Shaking hands: U.S. President Barack Obama (right) and his Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto shake hands as the president arrives in Mexico City . Obama's remarks come as Pina Nieto, in . a dramatic shift from his predecessor, has moved to end the widespread . access that U.S. security agencies have had in Mexico to help fight . drug-trafficking and organized crime. The White House has been cautious . in its public response to the changes, with the president and his . advisers saying they need to hear directly from the Mexican leader . before making a judgment about the new arrangement. Pina Nieto, speaking at the news . conference in Spanish, downplayed the notion that the new arrangement . would mean less close cooperation with the United States. 'There is no . clash between these two goals,' he said. He said Obama had said the U.S. will 'cooperate on the basis of mutual respect' to promote an efficient security strategy. The two leaders met Thursday at Mexico's National Palace on the first day of Obama's three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. To sell his immigration overhaul back . home, Obama needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president . willing to help him secure the border. He arrived in Mexico City eager to promote Mexico's economic success and the neighboring country's . place as the second largest export market for U.S. goods and services. Mexicans will be hanging on the American president's words, but Obama also has in mind an important audience back in the United States. Though the role played by Latino voters in last year's U.S. presidential election gets much credit for the current momentum for potentially changing immigration laws and providing a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, another reason for the change in attitudes is that stronger border protections and the recession have been disincentives to cross into the U.S. Tour: President Barack Obama (L) gets a tour of the National Palace in Mexico City from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (right) Meeting: US President Barack Obama (L) and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto make their way to their seats for a bilateral meeting . Cruising: The presidential limousine with President Barack Obama inside drives past the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City's main plaza, the Zocalo . As a result, illegal immigration has declined. 'With Mexico, first and foremost, . they are critical to our ability to secure the border,' said Ben Rhodes, . an Obama deputy national security adviser. 'All . the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on . securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for . immigration reform.' Even better than a strong border is an economy that keeps people from fleeing. 'If . the Mexican economy is growing, it forestalls the need for people to . migrate to the United States to find work,' Rhodes added. Eager to focus on the economy and immigration, the administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking and organized crime under his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. Still, the changes are likely to be a subject during the two leaders' private talks. Pena Nieto took office in December, and for Obama the trip is an opportunity to take his measure of the Mexican leader early in his tenure. 'It's really important to go there . while this new president is forming his own plans and judgments about . what he's going to do about the border, about where he's going to be on . immigration, about where he is on trade,' U.S. Chamber of Commerce . President/CEO Thomas Donohue said in an interview. The . chamber long has worked to improve U.S.-Mexico trade, noting that now . about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on commerce with Mexico. Drugs: A Mexican federal police officer stands next to packages, believed to be marijuana. The administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking . Striking the right note on border security is key, Donohue said, because it is a central to winning support in Congress for the rest of the immigration legislation. 'That's what everybody wants to hear, and we have to do that in a way that makes these guys down there feel like we're doing it in conjunction with them and for them, so we can do this thing on immigration well, so we can expand our trade, so we can deal with our political issues as they are trying to deal with theirs,' Donohue said. Still, with 33 million U.S. residents of Mexican origin, Obama's message in Mexico is also bound to resonate in the U.S., where Latinos could increase pressure on Congress to act. 'It helps keep these passions alive as far as an issue to promote for the administration,' said Carl Meacham, a former senior Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But Meacham, now director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that despite some bipartisan support to create a path to citizenship in the immigration bill, there is skepticism in Latin America. 'They've been brought to the altar so many times by different American administrations that there's a little bit of a lack of trust,' he said. For Pena Nieto, Obama's visit is a chance for him to showcase his country's economic gains. After suffering along with the U.S. during the recession, its economy is now growing at a better clip than that of the U.S. Per capita income has gone from an annual $7,900 two years ago to $10,146.","Obama needs growing economy in Mexico to sell immigration overhaul .

Police in Chicago are searching for three parachutists who broke into the city's Trump International Hotel and Tower, went to the roof of the nearly 1,400-foot-tall building and jumped off. The jump must have been successful, as no injuries were reported. Daredevils: police say these three men jumped off the top of the Trump International Hotel and Tower early Thursday morning . 1389 feet: the Trump building in Chicago is one of the tallest buildings in the city . According to authorities in Chicago, the three men broke into the building, located at 401 Wabash Avenue, about 12:30 a.m. Thursday using a 'cutting device to gain entry.' It's unclear how long the men were in the building before jumping off of it, and no items were reported stolen. It appears authorities found out about the break-in - and the jump that followed - is because surveillance footage from inside the building showed three men walking up a stairwell towards the roof, and a witness on the ground said she saw people parachuting off the building. Jumping from the top of a skyscraper is one of the more daring forms of B.A.S.E. jumping - which stands for buildings, antennas, spans (bridges) and earth (cliffs, etc.) - where parachutists throw themselves off of stationary objects with parachutes strapped to their backs.

Authorities say the incident is still under investigation.

The controversy over the leaked pictures of Prince Harry naked in Las Vegas has focused fresh  attention on the role of the two police protection officers who were in charge of him at the time. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that one of the Prince’s most long-serving protection officers, who has worked for the Royal Family since 1995, was in charge of Harry’s security. The round-the-clock protection officer accompanied the Prince to Vegas and was photographed with Harry at the Wet Republic pool party at the MGM hotel. A close rapport: Harry and his favourite protection officer, who was on duty in Vegas when the prince was pictured naked, cheer on . England at a rugby match in France during the 2007 world cup . The bodyguard, who wore sunglasses and a straw hat, was pictured surrounded by girls in bikinis, but he was in fact on duty. Together . with another  colleague, the protection officer, who is one of the . Metropolitan Police’s elite SO14 team, was also in charge of the Prince . when he was partying in the private suite at the exclusive Wynn Hotel, . where the naked pictures were taken. A . source told this newspaper that, since their return, both protection . officers are likely to have been questioned over what happened in Las . Vegas. At Clarence House, . the official residence of Prince Harry and the Prince of Wales, there . are concerns that the young Royal and his chief protection officer have . become overly friendly. Harry always requests his favourite protection officer for overseas trips and the two men have a close rapport. Prince William is also said to get along well with the amiable officer, who was a guest at last year’s Royal Wedding. The . officer, who is in his early 40s and married with a young daughter, . gets on well with the Princes’ friends and usually accompanies Harry . when he goes away on holiday. The prince who can't stop partying: Harry, in hat and sunglasses, amid a gaggle of young women during his long weekend in Las Vegas . Prince Harry frolics around in Las Vegas wearing a 'Let's Go Wild' singlet which he borrowed off a female partygoer . On . his Facebook page, which has now been deleted, he has posted a series . of pictures of himself with Harry, who he refers to as ‘Spike’. In . one he is photographed on Everest waving a Union Jack flag during the . Walking with the Wounded expedition that Harry took part in earlier this . year. In another, he . is on holiday in the Okavenga Delta in Botswana with Prince Harry. In . the picture the officer, who is stripped to the waist, is fishing. One of his friends posted the comment: ‘Hard at work – again.’ A source said: ‘Harry and his protection officer get along very well. 'If Harry has a boring event he’ll take any protection officer, but when it comes to parties and going away he wants his No 1 man with him because he is very much one of the boys.’ Neither of the SO14 protection officers who were with Harry in Las Vegas are expected to face disciplinary action. Despite the pictures being deeply embarrassing for the Royal Family, Harry was at no point in any danger. Bernard Hogan-Howe, the  Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has said it was not  the job of the royal protection officers to oversee the Prince’s behaviour. ‘Royal protection officers are there to protect him for security reasons, they are not there to regulate his life,’ Mr Hogan-Howe said. It was, however, unusual that the protection officers did not vet Harry’s guests. There were at least 15 girls  at the private party in the  hotel suite who Harry did not know. It is, say friends,  customary for party guests to hand over their digital cameras and mobile phones. ‘On some occasions the  protection officers will ask to delete any potentially  compromising pictures in order to protect the prince,’ says one of Harry’s entourage. ‘The rule is “lots of fun but no pictures”.’","Long-serving bodyguard is 'very much one of the boys’

Rebels fighting to hold Syria's economic hub from government forces are facing an enemy their AK47's cannot target. A virulent flesh-eating disease known as 'Aleppo boil' is sweeping the city as the destruction of its infrastructure has led to a breakdown in sanitation systems. Also known as the 'Aleppo evil' or, to give it its proper name, cutaneous leishmaniasis, it causes painful lesions which can become secondarily infected, often leading to permanent disfigurement. Smashed city: Damaged buildings in the Karm . al-Jabal neighbourhood of Aleppo, an area controlled by Syrian rebel . fighters, where a flesh eating disease known as 'Aleppo boil' is on the . rise due to breakdown in sanitation . Scenes of destruction: Smoke rises from Al-Sakhour neighbourhood in Aleppo's frontline . The sandflies which spread it flourish in waste and sewage which can now be found almost everywhere in the heavily bombarded city, where sewer systems have been blasted open by artillery shells. The World Health Organisation is monitoring the spread of the disease which, despite its gruesome symptoms, is generally not fatal, and reported 1,047 cases across Syria in May. That may well be a massive underestimate, since the frequent movement of Syrians displaced by the conflict to other regions inside and outside the country make figures hard to pin down. And as U.S. promises to supply heavy weapons to rebels currently on the back foot against the better armed government forces, the problem is only likely to get worse. Russia's foreign minister said today that Washington is sending contradictory signals on Syria that could derail an international conference intended to end that country's civil war. Virulent: The parasite which causes the disease is spread by sandflies which flourish in waste and sewage. Right, a stock image shows the kind of boil those affected with the 'Aleppo evil' suffer from . Sergey Lavrov, speaking in an interview with The Associated Press and the Bloomberg news agencies, warned that U.S. talk about a possible no-fly zone would only encourage the rebels to keep fighting. He also criticised demands that Syrian President Bashar Assad step down. 'Not because we like the regime, not because we want the regime to stay, but because it's for the Syrians to decide,' said Mr Lavrov. 'And to say you must capitulate and deliver the power to us is just not realistic.' And he dismissed allegations by the U.S., Britain and France that Assad's regime has used chemical weapons. Russia has been the key ally of Assad's regime throughout the Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 93,000 people, shielding it from U.N. Security Council sanctions and continuing to provide it with weapons. Still opposed to Assad: A photo distributed by a . rebel media source shows anti-regime protesters holding banners and . chanting slogans during a demonstration in the neighborhood of Bustan . Al-Qasr in Aleppo . The harder edge of opposition: Abu-Ossayad, the . leader of the artillery and mortar battalion in the al-Tawheed brigade, . uses a knife to prepare a handmade mortar shell in the al-Kindi hospital . frontline in Aleppo . A photo distributed by the rebels shows members . of the free Syrian Army preparing their weapons, in the neighborhood of . al-Amerieh in Aleppo, amid rumours they have received a shipment of . arms from Gulf allies . Russian President Vladimir Putin has confirmed that his country signed a contract for the delivery of state-of-the-art S-300 air defence missile systems to Syria, but said it hasn't been fulfilled yet. Mr Lavrov defended the S-300 deal, pointing to the deployment of U.S. Patriot air defense missiles and fighter jets to neighbouring Jordan. 'The contract on S-300s is absolutely legal, it's transparent and it's fully in line with the international norms and with the Russian export control legislation,' he said. 'Second, the contract hasn't been yet finalised. Third, the Americans are leaving Patriots after this exercise in Jordan, together with F-16 planes, and no one is asking them not to do this. 'The region is really full of weapons, including offensive weapons which have been supplied in the past to the countries of the region, and some of these weapons are infiltrating into Syria.' He said supplies of weapons to the Syrian opposition, which have been promised by Washington and are being considered by the European Union, would be a 'very big mistake.' Hearts and minds: A Syrian colonel speaks to children on a street in Suleiman al-Halabi neighbourhood . Uncertainty: Government soldiers are on the verge of retaking the city, but promised shipments of weapons from the U.S. could prolong the fighting . Modern warfare: Forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad aim their weapons towards Al-Sakhour neighbourhood, an area controlled by rebel fighters . Mr Lavrov was asked if Russia is warning the West in particular against providing the rebels with shoulder-fired air defense missiles that could challenge Assad's air dominance. He replied: 'We believe this is absolutely illegitimate, and we aren't going to legitimise it by starting discussing some conditions on which these supplies could be justified.' Mr Putin, speaking to reporters after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a business forum in St. Petersburg, argued that Western weapons, if they are supplied to the opposition, could fall into the hands of the al-Qaida-linked militants who form part of the rebel force and eventually be used against the West. He also warned that if President Assad steps down, that could lead to the vacuum of power that would be quickly filled by al-Qaida-connected rebels. 'How can we avoid it? There are well-armed, and very aggressive,' he said. Mr Lavrov said during today's interview that while the U.S. says it favours sponsoring a Syria peace conference in Geneva, it has made statements that have sent a conflicting signal to the rebels. He said that the U.S. talk about a possible no-fly zone in particular has encouraged the opposition to step up fighting instead of sitting down for talks. 'The message the opposition is getting: Guys, don't go to Geneva, don't say you are going to negotiate with the regime, soon things will change in your favour,' Mr Lavrov said. 'It's either the conference or the instigation of the opposition not to be flexible. I don't think it's possible to do both at the same time.' Brandishing his weapon: A Kurdish fighter from the Popular Protection Units shows his weapon decorated with his party's flag, as a fellow fighter looks on in Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsoud neighbourhood . The Islamists aren't going to like this... Female fighters from the Popular Protection Units patrol the blasted streets of their city . Kurdish fighters from Aleppo have joined the Free Syrian Army to fight against forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad . The date and location of the international conference on Syria haven't been announced yet, but it's already being dubbed 'Geneva 2' because a similar event was held there a year ago. 'If our goal is the conference, then we must avoid any discussions and, of course, any action designed to establish a no-fly zone. We must avoid confrontational debates and one-sided resolutions in the (United Nations) General Assembly and in the Human Rights Council because all this isn't helping to create the atmosphere necessary to convene a conference,' Mr Lavrov said. He shrugged off the U.S., British and French statements about the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime as ungrounded, saying they 'smack of politics and speculation.' 'We have been told by the Americans, by the French, by the British that they have proofs,' he said. 'What they showed to us is absolutely unconvincing. It's not based on facts, and it can't be taken as a proof.' He said that a new international probe must determine the truth and added that after the conflict is over, Syria could be encouraged to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles.","Breakdown of sanitation in smashed city is exacerbating the problem .

"By . Simon Walters And Brendan Carlin . PUBLISHED: . 19:31 EST, 20 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:46 EST, 24 April 2013 . Britain is in danger of being forced by European judges to allow US-style political advertisements to be shown on television. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) is due to rule tomorrow on a test case brought by a  British-based animal rights group. Insiders fear the verdict will go against the Government, meaning any political group can buy time on British television. The European Court of Human rights will rule on whether it's right to ban an advert by an animal rights group about the abuse of apes. A win for the group could pave the way for political 'attack' adverts in Britain . But Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night vowed to resist the threat. Any change would mean that organisations and individuals ranging from rich businessmen with  outspoken views to unions, animal rights groups and campaigners on both sides in the abortion and climate change debates could win air time to promote their views, win votes or change the law. A ruling in favour of political advertisements will also spark  fresh controversy over whether the ECHR has the right to overrule MPs at Westminster. Mr Grayling told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have very serious misgivings about the fact that the court considers this issue to be within its remit. It raises major questions about the role of the ECHR in Britain. ‘The ban on political advertising was put there for a purpose: to protect the integrity of our democracy. Any change should be a matter for the UK Parliament, not the ECHR.’ Mr Grayling is ready to veto any ruling in favour of political advertisements by the ECHR, triggering a re-run of the still unresolved battle with the European court over its demand that Britain gives votes to prisoners. The 2003 Communications Act bans all television advertisements ‘of a political nature or directed towards changing the law; influencing elections, Government policy or public opinion on controversial matters; promoting a political party or in connection with an industrial dispute’. The UK law is being taken on by animal protection organisation, Animal Defenders International. The group has launched several legal challenges, after it was banned from broadcasting a TV advert as part of its ‘My Mate’s a Primate’ campaign. The advert focused on the abuse of apes and featured a young actress and the voice of comedian Alexei Sayle. The advert being ruled on features a young actress caged like an ape. If the Animal Defenders win their case, it will pave the way for further adverts by charities, animal rights groups and political parties . Critics of the ban, which prohibits a wide range of adverts by charities and campaigners as well as political parties, say it is being challenged because it contravenes the ECHR guarantee to freedom of expression. At present, the main political parties are allowed a set number of party political broadcasts, shown mainly in the run-up to elections and based on how many votes they won at the last Election. They are not classed as political advertisements. Some officials say the Strasbourg-based ECHR may decide to maintain a narrow ban on advertisements by political parties. But it would still leave a huge scope for commercials that directly or indirectly play a role in domestic politics, bringing British media laws more into line with the US, where single-issue groups play a crucial role in elections. Billions of dollars are spent on political advertisements in America. Most are negative, based on personal and often distorted claims about an opponent. One lawyer said: ‘Commercial companies are free to advertise on television, regardless of whether their products are any benefit to society as a whole. Yet there is a total ban on charities. That is completely illogical and unjustifiable.’ A Conservative source said: ‘If  the ECHR goes against us on this it will cause as big a row as votes for prisoners. It will make us even more determined to pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights. ‘Political adverts give the rich the chance to influence elections. ‘Most people would be horrified by the prospect of US-style political campaigns on our screens. ‘They would also be a gift to union barons who could use their coffers to drum up support  for strikes.’ Some Labour MPs fear a change could benefit the Tories who have a greater number of wealthy donors. But the stance of Labour and the Lib Dems could be affected by their strong support for the ECHR. A spokesman for Maria Miller, Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, said: ‘The Government successfully defended the ban on political advertising in the UK courts and we are confident that  the Government’s firm stance on this issue is correct. Political adverts are – and have always been – banned on British TV and radio. ‘That ban has wide support and has helped sustain the balance of views which is at the heart of British broadcasting – and ensures that advertising broadcast into our homes is not determined by those who have the deepest pockets.’","European Court of Human Rights to rule on advert by animal rights group .

Second chance: Brian Banks has another shot at football with the Atlanta Falcons - 11 years after he was falsely convicted of rape . Brian Banks has officially been given another chance at football glory after signing with the Atlanta Falcons - 11 years after he was falsely convicted of rape and kidnapping charges. The former Southern Cal recruit's dream was derailed when he was convicted of rape and kidnapping charges at age 17. The linebacker will participate in Atlanta's offseason workouts with a chance to resume his career. Banks, now 27, has been trying to get back into football since he was cleared on May 12, 2012, of a rape conviction. Banks tweeted today: 'I feel good this morning.' The Falcons are the first NFL team to sign Banks, but he has had chances with other teams, including the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers and Seattle Seahawks. He took part in the Seahawks' minicamp last June following workouts in Kansas City and San Diego. Banks was 16 and had a scholarship offer from USC when a Long Beach Poly high school classmate accused him of the rape. He spent five years in jail and five years on probation. The woman recanted her claim and offered to help Banks clear his name after he was out of prison. Win: Brian Banks, pictured with his mother after he was exonerated in May, has signed with the Atlanta Falcons . Redemption: Banks is pictured during his tryouts with the Seattle Seahawks last year . That helped lead to the conviction being overturned by a California court and Banks' record cleared. Banks has become a spokesman for the California Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongly accused. Banks is expected to be there when the Falcons hold their first offseason workout on April 22. Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement: 'We are pleased to have Brian join our team. We had a chance to work him out last year and have been monitoring his progress since then. 'He has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last year and he has shown us that he is prepared for this opportunity. We are happy that Brian will have a chance to live out his dream of playing in the NFL and we look forward to seeing him on the field.' Four months after he was cleared of the charges, the linebacker signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. Banks was 16 and had just been offered a scholarship to USC when Wanetta Gibson accused him of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2002. A life shattered: Banks had been recruited by colleges and offered scholarships before the accusation . He . was on the way to the school office to talk about his college . applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went . to a stairwell to make out, his attorney Justin Brooks said. He . explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on . bad terms. She later accused him of kidnapping her, dragging her across . the school and raping her in the stairwell. Investigators . tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks . maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been . consensual. Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the . promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, . warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted. Expecting he would serve just 18 . months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was . put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his . NFL dream. Determined: Banks never gave up on his dream to play football and had been in full training since October 2011 . Future: Banks is expected to be there when the Falcons hold their first offseason workout on April 22 . He told ESPN last year that he has been seriously training since October 2011, saying: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.' He was exonerated in May after Gibson added him as a friend on Facebook when he left prison . with a tag a few months earlier. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be . bygones.' Brooks said his client met Gibson and caught her on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no . rape, and would help him clear his record. Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she . would have to return a $1.5million payment she won after her mother . brought a suit against Long Beach Schools. Freed: Once a standout football star, Brian Banks, pictured weeping after his rape conviction was dismissed last year, was just 16 when a classmate accused him of kidnapping and raping her . She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but . it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me, . I don't want to have to pay it back.' The Los Angeles Times also reported . that Gibson had been worried the admission would affect her . relationship with her two young children. Banks said he would not pursue legal action against his accuser, and Los Angeles . prosecutors have said it is unlikely Gibson will be charged with making . false accusations. After . the exoneration, Banks added: 'My only dream in the world . is just to be free... For years, I felt like a toy with the switch cut . off, sitting on the shelf.' Remorse: .

The Coalition was hit by a new split last night following claims that George Osborne is blocking plans by Business Secretary Vince Cable to save the ailing British pub. Liberal Democrat Mr Cable wants to launch a new watchdog to combat allegations that big pub companies are driving tied landlords to the wall by charging too much for beer and rent. The new rules would give landlords the right to free themselves from brewers. Community: The Coalition is at loggerheads over how to save the ailing British pub . But the Chancellor has stepped in amid Treasury claims that the changes could strangle the industry with red tape and put up the price of a pint. Mr Osborne has vetoed plans by Mr Cable to launch a public consultation this week, in the run-up to the introduction of new laws later this year. Mr Cable says the best way to save pubs is to set up a statutory code governing the relationship between pub companies and publicans, backed up by an independent adjudicator. Pubs are currently closing at the rate of 20 a month, and nearly 29,000 of the 55,000 pubs in Britain are tied. Conservative MP Brian Binley, who backs the new curbs, said last night: ‘The large pub owners have, quite literally, been drinking in the last-chance saloon for too long. These new controls are vital because some landlords have been brought to tears and the brink of bankruptcy by unfair terms. We treat post offices as a vital part of the community and it is time pubs were regarded in the same way.’ The rift between Mr Osborne and Mr Cable has fuelled fresh claims that the Chancellor has ‘sold out’ to big corporations and brewers at the expense of local communities. In the past the breweries were big donors to the Conservative Party, and close links remain in some areas. At war: Vince Cable has proposed plans to create a watchdog to help British landlords but they have been vetoed by Chancellor George Osborne who believes it will result in too much red tape . The two biggest pub owners, so called pubcos, are Enterprise and Punch Taverns. Other pubs are owned by local breweries. One insider said: ‘The pubcos have organised a highly expensive and sophisticated lobbying organisation and it seems as though it has had a big effect on Tory Cabinet Ministers. ‘The pubcos bought pubs when property prices were high and now prices have slumped they are trying to exploit landlords. All landlords want is the right to a fair rent and to serve the beer their customers want at fair prices.’ Mr Cable said earlier this year: ‘There is some real hardship in the pubs sector, with many pubs going to the wall as publicans struggle to survive on tiny margins. Some of this is due to pubcos exploiting and squeezing their tenants by unfair practices and a focus on short-term profits. ‘I hope my new measures mean publicans are given a fairer chance at running their pubs.’ He added that he had given the pubcos one last chance to change their behaviour last year, but it was clear the self-regulatory approach was not enough. Mr Cable’s code includes rents and the prices publicans pay for beer. The adjudicator would have the power to investigate and deal with disputes between pub companies and publicans, and impose fines. Pubcos own thousands of pubs and bars and decide where tied landlords can buy beer from and at what price. The code would prevent tied licensees being forced to pay up to 50 per cent more for beer than other licensees.","Vince Cable wants to create new watchdog to help landlords from breweries .

Google should be forced to stop people flouting privacy injunctions online by censoring its search results, an influential report said today. So far the search engine has refused  requests to filter out results that breach court orders like the one obtained by footballer Ryan Giggs. But a cross-party committee of MPs and peers blasted the internet giant for its 'totally unconvincing' objection to weeding out illegal information. Google is under pressure from MPs to crack down on the breach of privacy injunctions online . It follows increasing concern about a series of high-profile cases last year where High Court privacy injunctions were repeatedly breached online. In the Giggs case, the  Manchester United and Wales star took out an injunction in April to prevent reporting of allegations that he had an extra-marital affair with model Imogen Thomas. But details and speculation about that injunction were spread so widely on social networking site Twitter that eventually Lib Dem MP John Hemming 'outed' him in the House of Commons. Mr Hemmings used parliamentary privilege to name the player, saying 75,000 people had already identified him on Twitter. In December, the footballer settled his action against Ms Thomas, 28, when he admitted his allegations that the former Big Brother contestant blackmailed him were untrue. In May last year, a committee was set up by Prime Minister David Cameron to examine privacy and free speech after . the controversy. Details of an injunction brought out by Ryan Giggs, pictured here with his wife Stacey Cooke, was spread over the internet despite the court order banning the use of his name . Imogen Thomas outside the High Court in December, when Ryan Giggs accepted that there was no basis to accuse the reality star of blackmail . In its report out today, the committee said sites like Google, Facebook and Twitter present numerous challenges to the rule of law in the UK. It added: 'Google and other search engines should . take steps to ensure that their websites are not used as vehicles to . breach the law and should actively develop and use such technology. 'We recommend that if legislation is necessary to . require them to do so it should be introduced.' MPs and peers argued injunctions should routinely apply to websites such as Twitter and Facebook as well as newspapers. Google had claimed that such a policy could threaten the unfettered flow of information online. The committee heard from former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley, centre, who claimed he has spent £500,000 trying to remove a video from the internet . The company's associate general counsel Daphne Keller said a mechanism that identified banned pictures or text would 'not be a good idea' because it could not assess the context. But the committee concluded: 'We find their objections in principle to developing such technology totally unconvincing. 'Google and other search engines should take steps the ensure that their websites are not used as vehicles to breach the law and should actively develop and use such technology. 'We recommend if legislation is necessary to require them to do so, it should be introduced.' Last month Cabinet minister won a gagging order to hush up 'private information' concerning her teenage son. Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman was granted the High Court injunction banning publication of a story about 17-year-old Jonny, a promising rugby player. The nature of the story cannot be disclosed, but Mr Justice Lindblom said it contained 'sensitive personal information' regarding which the boy was entitled to privacy. However he refused the minister's application for her family to remain anonymous in the proceedings, citing the principle of open justice. It is thought to be the first time the courts have suppressed a story about the child of a cabinet minister since 1997, when then Home Secretary Jack Straw's son Will bought drugs from an undercover reporter. Mr Straw famously led his son to a police station to report his misdemeanour. In this case, there is no suggestion that privately educated Jonny, who has represented England at under-16s rugby, has done anything illegal. The committee heard evidence given by Max Mosley, the ex-Formula One boss who said he had spent at least £500,000 in 23 countries attempting to remove traces of a video filmed covertly by the News of the World video from the internet. It also urged the Attorney General to be . more willing to launch contempt of court claims against internet users . if they are suspected of breaching privacy injunctions online. The Joint Committee on Privacy and Injunctions said people who 'actively seek publicity' should accept there is 'enhanced interest in their private lives by the media'. However, the report stopped short of arguing for a new privacy law and instead set out recommendations for an 'enhanced' press regulator. In a series of recommendations on the . future of press regulation, the committee said a reformed Press . Complaints Commission should have the power to fine newspapers and . determine the prominence of printed apologies. It . urged advertisers to withdraw funding from newspapers and major blogs . that opt out of the reconstituted regulator, and threatened 'statutory . oversight' from a body such as Ofcom if the industry cannot agree a . credible package of reforms. John . Whittingdale MP, chair of the committee, said: 'The committee spent . some time debating whether additional laws to clarify the right to . privacy were necessary or desirable. 'However, . we concluded that the existing position, where each case is judged by . the courts on an individual basis, is now working reasonably well. 'We . are concerned that individuals with grievances about invasion of . privacy should have an alternative to costly legal action available to . them. 'It is clear that . media self-regulation under the PCC did not work. We therefore wish to . see a stronger self-regulatory system that is seen to be effective and . commands the confidence of the public.' A . Google spokesman said: 'Requiring search engines to screen the content . of their web pages would be like asking phone companies to listen in on . every call made across their networks for potentially suspicious . activity.'","Report blasts giant for refusing to filter information breaching court orders .

The last portrait of Margaret Thatcher, showing her relaxing on a deckchair in the London garden of the Chelsea Pensioners’ Home, is revealed today. It is a far cry from all previous imposing official paintings of the Iron Lady with her steely blue eyes radiating power. Here, she is like any other pensioner, frail but at ease, whiling away her last days rereading one of her favourite books, with a comforting blanket draped over the back of the chair in case the sun goes in. The last portrait of Margaret Thatcher, which shows her relaxing on a deckchair in the London garden of the Chelsea Pensioners' Home, has been revealed today . Most poignant of all, it is also the spot where her ashes will be buried, alongside those of her beloved husband, Denis. The portrait is the sixth of Lady Thatcher by artist Richard Stone, a postman’s son who became her close friend during scores of sittings over more than a decade. Bizarrely, it led to Thatcher and Stone making a private visit to the gorilla enclosure at Regent’s Park Zoo in London after she became transfixed by one of his other subjects, a 22-stone gorilla. The former Prime Minister stood in the zoo’s ‘Gorilla Kingdom’ as one of the silverbacks charged the glass screen behind which she was standing, unflinching. Mr Stone, 61, known for acclaimed portraits of the Queen and Nelson Mandela, described how the ‘in retirement’ portrait of Lady Thatcher came about. ‘I always thought there was a softer, more retiring side to her that was worth recording and whenever I went to see her without my brushes, she would look crestfallen. So we came up with the ‘‘in retirement’’ theme. I thought it would be lovely to paint her outside, in the sun surrounded by flowers. Artist Richard Stone proudly shows off the portrait of Margaret Thatcher . ‘When we mentioned it to her, she said, “Retirement?” in that formidable way of hers. But she soon warmed to the idea.’ The book she is reading is Robert Harris’s biography of her No 10 press secretary, Sir Bernard Ingham. ‘She knew all the stories about her, but liked reading them again,’ said Stone. The setting of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a retirement and nursing home for ex-British soldiers, the so-called ‘Chelsea Pensioners’, was chosen because Lady Thatcher and husband Denis used to worship in its chapel every Sunday. Lady Thatcher and Richard Stone visit the gorilla enclosure at London Zoo in 2007 . In 2009, she established the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary there. A portrait of Lady Thatcher by Michael Noakes hangs in the  125-bed infirmary, which is the hospital’s care home, hospice and GP surgery. It was through Stone that Lady Thatcher became intrigued by gorillas. He told her how he had spent three years flying back and forth to San Francisco to paint a portrait of Koko, a 42-year-old gorilla who communicates to humans via sign language. He said: ‘She was absolutely fascinated and it led to us going together on a private visit to the London Zoo’s Gorilla Kingdom early one morning. Lady Thatcher stood at the glass wall, completely unperturbed as a giant silverback hurled itself at the screen. It was remarkable.’ Stone said of his friendship with Lady Thatcher: ‘We used to talk about our upbringing, home cooking, making a Sunday roast last for half the week, the joys of Welsh rarebit, all sorts of things. ‘When I showed her a recipe for Welsh rarebit, she noticed it included beer and said, “I don’t have any beer in the house, would gin do?” When I went to America I brought back a sheet of new stamps with Ronald Reagan on them and gave them to her. She asked to keep them because “he was a very nice man”. ‘We would talk about her favourite shows, South Pacific and Carousel, and I would get her Doris Day videos. She would often sing to me, totally unabashed.’ Stone acted as a go-between for Lady Thatcher and another of his subjects, Nelson Mandela. ‘I would take greetings from her to Mandela, and when I saw him in South Africa, he would ask me to return the compliment.’ Stone’s five previous portraits of Thatcher have raised more than £330,000 for her favourite causes. His ‘in retirement’ painting is to be auctioned to raise funds for one of her favourite non-political charities, to be decided in the next few weeks.","Portrait is the sixth of Lady Thatcher by artist Richard Stone .

Supermarket bread contains 20 per cent less salt than it did a decade ago, according to new research. Some of the most popular branded products also trail supermarket's own packaged loaves, with less than half meeting Government guidelines on what is a healthy amount. And a group of scientists behind a new study insist that more work needs to be done to drive down the amount of salt in our bread and help lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Health boost: Supermarket own brand breads contain 20 per cent less salt than they did a decade ago, according to new research . Bread is the biggest contributor of dietary salt in the UK, providing almost a fifth of the total derived from processed foods. The recommended daily intake for UK adults is a maximum of 6g, compared with the current average of 8.1g a day. Salt levels in packaged bread in supermarkets across the UK fell around a fifth from 1.23g per 100g in 2001, to 0.98g per 100g in 2011, according to findings published in the online journal BMJ Open. Researchers examined 40 products in 2001, and 203 in 2011 for the study by the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine in London. Overall, the number of products meeting the Department of Health's 2012 target - of less than or equal to 1g of salt per 100g - rose from under a third in 2001 to almost three-quarters in 2011. Guilty pleasure: Bread is the biggest single contributor of salt to the British diet accounting for almost a fifth of the total from processed foods . But wide variations in salt content persist between supermarket own-label and branded products, the results showed. In 2001, 38 per cent of supermarket own-label loaves met the 2012 target compared with just 17 per cent of branded products. By 2011, the equivalent figures were 89 per cent and 42 per cent respectively. Little difference in salt content was found between white, wholemeal, and brown loaves despite the common perception that wholemeal and brown bread are healthier alternatives to white bread. The scientists behind the research said: 'A wide variation in salt levels was found, with many products already meeting the 2012 targets, indicating that further reductions can be made. 'This requires further progressive lower targets to be set, so that the UK can continue to lead the world in salt reduction and save the maximum number of lives.' Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of Consensus Action on Salt and Health (CASH), and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, said: 'A reduction in population salt intake is one of the most cost-effective measures to improve public health, as lowering salt intake lowers blood pressure and reduces the number of people suffering and dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. 'So we are really pleased that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of salt in bread and are continuing to work with industry, through 'he Responsibility Deal, to help people reduce their salt intake. 'Many foods contain higher levels of salt than we might expect so it's important to check the label. 'To make it easy for everyone to keep track of what they eat and make healthier choices, we will soon be announcing a simple and clear system for front-of-pack labelling that everyone can use to help people make healthier choices.'","Almost 90 per cent of supermarket loaves meet Government 'healthy' target .

A couple who left their four-month-old baby to die of pneumonia while they threw a drunken all-night party have been jailed. Matthew Atherton, 23, and Anne Turnbull, 30, left their son Liam near their open back door while they and three guests made their way through 60 cans of lager, Jack Daniels whiskey and wine. Liam had been diagnosed with a cold that day but was left in a downstairs room while the door was open to let cigarette smoke filter outside. Anne Turnbull and Matthew Atherton have been jailed for child neglect following the death of their son Liam . Despite the youngster suffering a seizure, his parents ignored pleas by their guests to call an ambulance and partied until 7am the next day. Liam was found lifeless in his Moses basket at 11.15am when Turnbull went to check on him and was later pronounced dead in hospital. Atherton and Turnbull were yesterday sentenced to 24 weeks and 21 weeks respectively after admitting child neglect. Police who went to the house in Blackburn, Lancashire, following the baby's death in January 2011 found a wheelie bin full of empty lager cans and wine bottles. The kitchen worktops were also covered with empty alcohol cans. Blood tests ordered by the police showed Atherton was three times the drink drive limit at the time Liam was discovered. The day before Liam’s death he had been seen by the local health visitor who had diagnosed colic but noted that he was 'thriving', Preston Crown Court heard. Social services had also decided to reduce their level of monitoring of Liam on the same day, although that decision was not criticised by the court. The court heard that the couple had a history of alcohol misuse that dated back to February 2009 and were part of the Blackburn Family Intervention Team, who supported them practically and financially. Jailing the couple, Judge Christopher Cornwall said: 'This is not a sustained course of neglect. 'The case against you is that you made a single and utterly terrible decision during the early hours of January 14 2011 not to seek medical advice. 'The reason you made that decision is because you were both so intoxicated that you deprived yourselves of the ability to think sensibly and rationally about Liam’s position. 'I accept that the condition came upon him quickly and suddenly but nothing takes away from the fundamental point by reason of the fact that you thought it appropriate to drink and drink and drink.' Liam was born prematurely in September 2010 and spent his first few weeks of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit at the Royal Blackburn Hospital. His early arrival meant the boy was taking special medication to encourage his development. Despite his vulnerable condition his parents decided to throw a party. Turnbull invited her sister Zoe Heap and her partner to join them at their terraced house. Miss Heap found Liam asleep in a cold front room and became angry after noticing he was hungry and in a wet nappy. She changed and fed her nephew, then passed him to her partner for him to settle. But Liam then suffered a ‘fit or seizure’. The couple refused to call an ambulance for their sick son but found his lifeless body in his basket the next morning . Atherton put the fit down to his son having a cold and the boy was put back in his Moses basket. Police began investigating the couple after being told of Liam’s sudden death by a nurse at the Royal Blackburn. A post-mortem examination at the time did not reveal any significant injuries but a coroner later ruled Liam died from pneumonia. His parents were charged with neglect three weeks later. Atherton initially denied wrongdoing but pleaded guilty on the second day of his trial. At the time of the boy's death neighbours said they saw Turnbull shouting and screaming in the street after dialling 999. One said: 'She had gone to sleep on the couch, with the baby put in his rocker. But when she woke up, he wasn’t breathing. 'Then there was a lot of commotion. It is devastating news. You just think of your own children at a time like this - I couldn’t live through something like that.' A spokesman for Blackburn with Darwen Council said: 'This is a tragic case.

But hidden behind Nick Wilson’s surburban home lies a tropical wonderland. The bamboos, palms, banana trees and lush greenery would not be out of place in a steamy Far Eastern jungle. There is even a wooden ‘jungle lodge’ to complete the garden’s exotic feel. Secret garden: Nick Wilson, 57, has created this stunning jungle garden at his home in Leeds, Yorkshire . Where the wild things are: The tropical garden is filled with banana trees, bamboo plants and palm trees . The tropical garden even has a wooden hut in the middle of it where Mr Wilson can entertain his guests . When Mr Wilson, 57, and his wife . moved into their house in Roundhay, Leeds, 25 years ago their back . garden was simply a long and narrow lawn. The prospect of many hours of mowing inspired the software salesman to transform the turf into something far more interesting. He planted various shrubs every year, put down timber walkways and constructed ponds which he filled with koi carp. Over two decades the foliage thrived . and grew to fill the 85ft by 30ft garden. Mr Wilson built the thatched . lodge six years ago at a cost of £2,000. The best things are worth waiting for: Nick Wilson shows his neighbour Sue Tuffin around the garden which has taken him 20 years to complete . Adapting: Despite temperatures in Yorkshire often dropping below freezing in the winter months, Mr Wilson says his tropical plants manage to British weather surprisingly well . Delivery: Mr Wilson transporting gunneras ready to plant in his exotic garden . Transformation: The garden started off as a regular back yard before its metamorphosis . This Sunday he is opening the space . up to the public as part of a ‘garden trail’ designed to inspire . visitors with ideas  of how to transform a small piece of land. Visitors would be forgiven for thinking they have been whisked away to the South Pacific rather than a suburb in West Yorkshire.

I had always wanted a garden with wooden walkways . and koi carp and lush planting.’ Towering over the jungle: Nick Wilson's outdoor hut has views across his garden . Under construction: Nick Wilson has spent years - and thousands of pounds - constructing his garden paradise . As well as bamboos and palms, a variety of ferns, gunneras and hostas combine to create the tropical effect. The garden copes well with the northern climate, except the banana plants, which are kept inside during winter. Mr Wilson added: ‘There is no special skill. It’s basic carpentry skills, a bit of pond digging … and putting plants in.’ Transformation: The keen gardener used wooden blanks and poles to give his paradise an authentic jungle feel .

Terminally ill people should turn to Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper instead of Jesus to take their minds off death, according to a retired minister. The Rev Ian Gregory says the dying should read bodice-rippers and bonkbusters rather than the Bible to resurrect 'joyful, rude memories' in their final days. The retired Congregational minister, best known for founding the Polite Society, makes his recommendations in The Great Adventure, a pamphlet about preparing for death. The novels of Jackie Collins, left, and Jilly Cooper, right, could help the terminally-ill take their minds off death . He suggests that the Bible's talk of sin, judgment and eternal damnation could be unsettling for those living with a terminal illness and recommends reliving romantic highs instead. Mr Gregory said: 'When people are told they are dying reading the Bible might be the last thing they want to do. 'But they shouldn't be afraid to read a rude or lively book... something a bit saucy. 'The subject of death is still a bit taboo, like sex used to be, so why not? 'It might trigger some happy, joyful, rude memories.' A book like Jilly Cooper's Riders could trigger 'happy, joyful, rude memories', says the Rev Ian Gregory . Racy novels, which could include Collins's Chances or Cooper's Riders, could cheer the soul, he said. Mr Gregory, who used to celebrate mass at the Basford Congregational Church in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, was inspired to write the pamphlet after he was approached by a terminally-ill stranger. The man had three months to live and wanted Mr Gregory to conduct his funeral. The retired minister told the Daily Telegraph: 'I had thought about airing some of the material in my brochure before, but that chance meeting triggered me off. 'I have been approached by people to take their funerals several times, usually because they want it done by someone who knows about them, but this was a stranger. 'The man was obviously in distress because he had just been told about his condition and was trying to prepare for his demise. I have spoken to him a few times since and we have been over some of the things included in the brochure but I haven’t asked him what he thinks.' Mr Gregory founded the Polite Society, which later became the Campaign for Courtesy, in the mid-1980s to promote good manners. The campaign counts Esther Rantzen and June Whitfield among its patrons. He later had a Stoke-on-Trent pub, The Polite Vicar, named after him.","The Rev Ian Gregory has written a pamphlet about preparing for death .

The Met Office have issued yellow weather warnings for the south-east and south-west with up to half a months rainfall expected in the space of three hours today. In London and the south-east up to 40mm of rain could fall compared with an average June rainfall of 73mm. Poor visibility: Downpours across the South East has led to poor driving conditions on the A130 at Chelmsford, Essex . Weather warnings: The Met Office warned of electircal storms and heavy rain today. Cars are pictured in Essex . Thunder warning: Heavy rain and storms are expected in the south-east and south-west today. Here lightning bolts can be seen in Kingsdown, Kent, yesterday morning . Wet weather alert: The Met Office have issued a yellow weather warning for the south-east and south-west with heavy rain expected. Up to 40mm could fall in places . However, although some areas of the country will have thunderstorms, it will be highly localised with many places staying dry. The outlook is no better for the weekend, with more downpours expected ahead of the Wimbledon championships which start on Monday. Met Office forecaster Tim Thorne said: 'There has been a light band of rain across parts of Wales this morning but nothing too substantial with around 5 or 6mm of rain. 'Heavier showers will hit later and the south-west will probably see the worst of it this morning and until mid-afternoon. The south-east will also see some heavy stuff moving up from the continent.' A warning on the Met Office website said that in the south-east, East Anglia and the Midlands there could be some heavy rain. 'These could give 15-20 mm of rain within an hour and 40 mm within 3 hours very locally. However many places could stay dry,' it said.

Downpour: the south-east, Wales, the north-west and Scotland are hit by rain shortly after midday today. There are isolated pockets of rain elsewhere . Brendan Jones, senior forecaster at Meteogroup, the Press Association's weather division, said: 'At the moment based on our forecasts, it's not actually too bad for the opening week. 'I don't think we're going to have any hot weather like we are this week, the temperatures will be close to average. 'There is likely to be quite a lot of dry weather but there will be some rain interruptions no doubt - at least next week we can be reasonably confident there won't be any huge deluges.' He said there could be a few showers on Monday as they drift across the country, but the chances of catching one at the All England club would be fairly small. 'It should hopefully be generally dry with just a few showers coming through,' he said. 'People will see some tennis, and they might well see some sunshine if they're lucky.' Temperatures are likely to be in the low-20s, possibly the high teens, he said, with the second week of the tournament looking at the moment like it could be quite similar.

Desperate to shed its image as one of the world's rudest cities, Paris has embarked on a campaign to improve its reputation and better cater to the needs of tourists. Waiters, taxi drivers and sales staff in the French capital all too often come off as impolite, unhelpful and unable to speak foreign languages, say local tourism chiefs, who are handing out a manual with guidelines on better etiquette. A six-page booklet entitled 'Do you speak Touriste?' contains greetings in eight languages including German, Chinese and Portuguese and advice on the spending habits and cultural codes of different nationalities. One of the most romantic cities in the world, Paris has now decided to show its tourists some love . 'The British like to be called by their first names,' the guide explains, while Italians should be shaken by the hand and Americans reassured on prices. Of the Chinese, the fastest-growing category of tourists visiting the city, the guide says they are 'fervent shoppers' and that 'a simple smile and hello in their language will fully satisfy them'. France is the world's top destination for foreign tourists, with Paris visited by 29 million people last year. The business tourists bring to hotels, restaurants and museums accounts for one in 10 jobs in the region and is a welcome boost to the economy at a time of depressed domestic consumption. Paris's service industry staff have been criticised for not welcoming foreign tourists sufficiently . The Paris chamber of commerce and the regional tourism committee have warned, however, that growing competition from friendlier cities such as London meant Paris needed to work harder to attract visitors, especially from emerging market countries. Some 30,000 copies of the handbook on friendly service are being distributed to taxi drivers, waiters, hotel managers and sales people in tourist areas from the banks of the Seine river up to Montmartre and in nearby Versailles and Fontainebleau. Setting realistic linguistic ambitions, it suggests offering to speak English to Brazilians - who it describes as warm and readily tactile and keen on evening excursions.","Six page booklet entitled Do You Speak Touriste? is being distributed .

Faultless: World number one Novak Djokovic shows off his torso, delighting fans in Buckinghamshire . It was more strip poker than tennis - but the ladies at Boodles were certainly not complaining as Novak Djokovic and Grigor Dimitrov compared torsos in a Wimbledon warm-up match yesterday. World number one Djokovic interrupted proceedings between games, getting the crowd to slow-clap him as he removed his top, swinging it above his head and flexing his muscles. And his ambitious young contender duly hit back with a fine return, stripping and throwing his top into the crowd. Dimitrov, the 22-year-old boyfriend of Maria Sharapova, is fast becoming better known for his looks than his ability with a racket, making headlines for showing off his body during a previous match just three days ago. The brief moment of light entertainment came during a match at the Boodles tennis competition in Buckinghamshire yesterday afternoon. After Djokovic, 26, beat his opponent 5-7, 6-3, 10-6, he proceeded to taunt him by making fun of his girlfriend. Prompted to treat the crowd with his notorious impression of Sharapova, Djokovic shouted out: 'I haven't done my Maria impression for a while now, but I think Grigor is probably better at it than me now.' Dimitrov took the goading well and agreed to compare Sharapova acts for the crowd, saying: 'I'll do the walking' as Djokovic replied: 'I'll do the serve.' Bulgarian Dimitrov, who stands at 6ft . 2in tall and is ranked 31st in the world, proceeded to skip and storm . across the field with his head down, causing fans to erupt into cheers . and laughter. Making a point: The Serb sits down and challenges his young opponent Grigor Dimitrov to follow suit yesterday . But the larger applause came for Djokovic, who pranced around the court before sticking out his bottom and pretending to tuck long hair behind his ears, steadying himself to serve. He then threw the ball in the air and hit it, grunting like a wild animal. 'It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a sports match,' said John, 30, who was in the audience. 'He is such an entertainer. He was flicking his hair and grunting really loudly. It was like When Harry Met Sally. Dimitrov took it well and joined in. I'd love to know what Sharapova thought.' Earlier Djokovic removed his top before pointing dramatically to his opponent so he could do the same. Oh I say: The crowd are loving it as Dimitrov dares to bare (left), before the Bulgarian's strip is complete (right) The fan added: 'The crowd went wild. It . was full of middle class women - the Range Rover brigade - but they . loved it and got out their cameras to take pictures. 'It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen in a sports match' John, 30, crowd member . 'At first Dimitrov wouldn't take his top . off because he didn't have another one with him. But a ball girl got . him one and he took his other one off and threw it into the crowd.' Djokovic also performed an impression of a ball girl for the crowd before having a rally with a five-year-old on a neighbouring court. The world's top player has form for stripping for the crowd. After beating Andy Murray in the final of the Australian Open in January he celebrated by dramatically ripping off his shirt. Dimitrov, meanwhile, has been proudly showing off his gorgeous Russian girlfriend. Love all: Dimitrov proved popular with members of a ladies' tennis club in Buckinghamshire earlier this week . They were spotted cannoodling in Madrid last month and at The Queen's Club in west London last week, Sharapova cheered him on as he competed in the Aegon championship. 'I haven't done my Maria impression for a while now, but I think Grigor is probably better at it than me now' Novak Djokovic . After yesterday's match, Djokovic said: 'Everything is going according to plan and hopefully I can get in the best possible shape for the start of Wimbledon. 'There's no bigger motivation than playing in the most prestigious tournament in the world in our sport, the one that I always dreamed of winning. I won it two years ago and it's definitely been the highlight of my career. I love playing at Wimbledon.' Dimitrov added: 'It's a great feeling to play against him. Especially today. I hope we had an entertaining match but at the same time a very positive match.'","World number one Djokovic got crowd to slow-clap as he removed top .

Eurostar passengers could see reduced fares after the European Commission warned France and Britain they faced court action unless charges for passenger and freight trains using the Channel Tunnel were reduced. The Commission said the illegally high track access charges result in higher ticket prices for passengers of the high-speed Eurostar service linking London with Paris and Brussels. Both countries have been given two months to respond to the request. Good news: Eurostar passengers could see a reduction in fares . A spokesman for the Commission said today: 'Passengers are paying over the odds for . their tickets, freight operators and their customers are being . overcharged, and overall the current regime is stifling growth in the . rail sector.' She added the high charges meant only 43 per cent of the tunnel's capacity was used. Tunnel operator Eurotunnel charges a reservation fee of 4,320 euros one way for Eurostar trains and 16.60 euros per passenger. EU officials said the charges should be roughly half that amount. EU officials said if the charges were lower, the tunnel could make up the difference through increased freight traffic, forecasting a doubling of the amount of daily freight trains. Under EU law, rail companies are only allowed to charge fees consistent with the amount of wear caused by a train journey. Clampdown: The European Commission has said passengers are paying over the odds for their tickets. A Eurotunnel freight train is pictured emerging from the Channel tunnel . But the officials said the Commission investigation found operators of the Channel Tunnel were charging more than necessary and using the income to subsidise the operator's car shuttle service, which does not pay such charges. Officials said the tunnel had sought an exception to levy higher access charges to pay construction costs. They said the investigation did not find evidence to support this, and noted that Eurotunnel's financing costs declined significantly after a write-off in 2007. In addition to access charges, Commission regulators found that a 65-year usage agreement that reserves 50 percent of traffic for French national rail operator Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer and Germany's DB Schenker, a unit of Deutsche Bahn, violated EU rules because of its length. The tunnel's own rail regulator is also too weak, they said, and the railway operators have too much control.","France and Britain told to reduce  charges for trains using Channel Tunnel .

Captured: A prison picture of Simon Hennessey, who was held by detectives in Australia after spending 15 years on the run . A British fugitive who escaped from prison after stabbing his aunt 70 times in a frenzied murder has been recaptured after 15 years on the run. Simon Hennessey, who was 14 when he was convicted of killing his elderly relative in a brutal knife attack, was arrested by Australian detectives investigating a credit card scam in Queensland. Hennessey, 49, was arrested in April and initially charged with 50 counts of fraud under a false name, authorities unaware that they were dealing with the wanted killer. He originally claimed to be from New Zealand and according to Australian media appeared in local courts several times under that identity before police realised he was not who he purported to be. A spokeswoman for Queensland Police said he had been arrested earlier this month in the Sunshine Coast town of Maroochydore. He appeared before Maroochydore Magistrates' Court on June 17 and is currently in custody pending his next hearing in July. 'There is not much more we can say because of the court situation but we are aware that he is a wanted criminal in the UK,' she said. Hennessey's arrest is understood to be related to a sophisticated credit card scam running to tens of thousands of Australian dollars.He could face a lengthy prison sentence if convicted in an Australian court, but Avon and Somerset police have already contacted the authorities in Australia to discuss his extradition . He escaped from the Leyhill Open Prison in Gloucestershire in 1998, just three days after being transferred from the secure mental unit where he had served 20 years of a life sentence for manslaughter. Originally from Plymouth, Hennessey had pleaded guilty to killing 72-year-old Mary Webber at his 1978 trial on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Detectives said they believed he had travelled between Thailand, New Zealand and Queensland during his years on the run, using a series of stolen identities and false passports. 'He had not been seen or heard of until he was picked up at Tewantin,"" Sunshine Coast CIB chief Daren Edwards was quoted as saying by the Sunshine Coast Daily. 'We knew there was more to him and it appears he has used several identities. 'We believe he has moved between Thailand, New Zealand and Australia. Paradise: Hennessey was jailed for murdering his aunt in 1978 but escaped after he was transferred from a mental health unit, fleeing to Australia and living on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland . 'It looks like he has been coming and going from Australia since about 2003.' Hennessey is currently in custody in Queensland and faces his next court hearing on July 15. If found guilty of the fraud charges he could be jailed in Australia, or be extradited back to the United Kingdom. Avon and Somerset police said they had been in touch with the Queensland authorities and hoped to begin extradition proceedings.","Simon Hennessey, 49, captured on Sunshine Coast in state of Queensland .

It may not have been a Harrods or a Harvey Nicks, but Paul and Kelly Turner-Mitchell were proud of their successful fashion boutique. For six years, business had boomed at 25 Ten while other shops in the recession-hit northern town of Rochdale closed. But now they have joined the exodus from the high street – forced out by sky-high business rates that saw them charged more than Harrods. Paul Turner-Mitchell said that he and his wife's store 25 Ten was forced to close down by sky-high business rates . They say they could no longer afford the £20,882 a year cost and were shocked to find that their bill was based on a valuation of £375 per square metre. It meant they were charged double the £189 per square metre that Harrods pays, although the huge Knightsbridge department store’s total bill is obviously far higher. ‘It is just wrong,’ said Mr Turner-Mitchell, 38, whose boutique sells mostly to women aged 18 to 35 and has Michelle Keegan, who plays Tina McIntyre in Coronation Street, among its customers. They had survived on Rochdale's main shopping street for six years before they received the bill . ‘Any form of taxation has to be fair and equitable. Harrods should not be paying a business rate charge which is half of what they are in Rochdale. ‘It just cannot be right. The business rates system is not fit for purpose.’ He and his 35-year-old wife are moving 25 Ten to Littleborough, three miles away, where their business rates will be substantially lower. The couple were not the only victims in Rochdale of the much-hated rates        system – a nearby fish and chip shop has its rates based on a charge of £945 per sq m, five times higher than Harrods. Mr Turner-Mitchell says hard-hit high street traders across the country are subsidising big London retailers. Small firms say business rates – the commercial equivalent of the council tax – are forcing them out of business. For most, the rates bill is their third biggest expense, after rent and staff costs, and is regularly cited as the biggest hurdle they face. Many are furious that, while ministers boast about cutting corporation tax, business rates are going up every year. Dr Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘We have long known that the business rates system is flawed. ‘It is a tax on business, even before you start trading, whether you are in a northern suburb or the heart of London. The Government cannot ignore the plea [to look again at the tax] any longer. We need to see action.’ Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk has called the system ‘unfair’ and said that ‘it cannot be right that Rochdale has to subsidise places like Regent Street and Knightsbridge’. Business rates were introduced in 1988 when the ill-fated poll tax replaced domestic rates. The system is notoriously complicated. It involves the Government’s Valuation Office Agency setting the value of the business based on its rentable worth per square metre. They were charged double the £189 per square metre that luxury store Harrods pays . This is then multiplied by the uniform business rate, an inflation-linked figure set by the Government, to calculate the total bill. But because the valuation of a premises is based on zones – with the 20ft nearest the front window rated highest, followed by the next 20ft and so on – smaller shops are often disproportionately affected. Values are set every ten years but the last, in 2010, was calculated using data from April 2008 at the height of the property boom. And the next valuation, which could help businesses in areas where property prices and trade have slumped, has been put back from 2015 to 2017. The money is collected by local councils but paid directly to central government and is currently worth £27billion a year, the same as council tax. The Valuation Office Agency said: ‘If the ratepayer thinks their rateable value does not reflect the rental value of the property, they should contact us to discuss it.’","For six years, business had boomed at 25 Tenon Rochdale's high street .

The court ruled that the 21-year-old's death was a 'sex . game gone wrong' and ordered the couple back for trial. This has resulted in Sollecito launching a desperate $500,000 online appeal for donations to fund his retrial. The . computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for . 'legal expenses' but added anything raised above the target he would . 'donate to a research foundation'. In an appeal posted on his Facebook page Sollecito wrote: 'Well Guys, the problem for me now is pretty tough. 'I'm deeply concerned not just for the issue I'm facing and most of you already know about, but also because I don't have resources anymore to fight this injustice. 'I badly need to be able to hire experts, when needed, or pay my attorney fees, documents fees, and so on when the new appeal will start. 'I hope to not bother you, but I need your collaboration to face this ordeal. Otherwise I don't want to forced to give up just for financial reason. 'I hope you will understand. I'm just asking if you, buddies, know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation. Big Hugs, Raffaele Sollecito.' Sollecito is thought to have been paid $1 million for American TV news interviews and an advance on his book Honour Bound My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox, which was published last year. Crime scene: This is the flat in Perugia where Meredith Kercher was found dead . However a sizeable proportion of that was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including Italy's high flying Giulia Bongiorno who is said to have the highest fees in the country. On his Facebook page he invites potential donors to help him out via a page called Gofundme.com and on it he adds: 'This new Trial will take other 6 or 7 years more with witnesses, transfers, documents, experts and everything will be discussed all over again. 'I'll use and certify all the expenses paid with this funds. If in the future, I will not need this funds anymore for legal expenses, I'll donate the rest of the funds to a research foundation. Please help.' His urologist father Francesco Sollecito said: 'This is an initiative of Raffaele's but it has my full support. I'm no longer in a position to fund a trial which could last another two years. 'Witnesses will have to be reheard and there is a good chance that new forensic tests will have to be carried out and as such experts and consultants will have to be paid. 'We are both very grateful for the high attention that has been paid to this case by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno and Luca Maori.' Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are pictured outside the rented house shortly after Miss Kercher was found dead . As of early today, 31 people had donated with the largest amount being $1,000 from an anonymous donor and the total standing at more than $4,000 - at that pace he will have made his target by the time the trial starts. The site was also subject to fierce criticism with several people posting comments expressing their outrage one woman Silvia Pavan wrote in Italian: 'Why don't you ask Amanda Knox for money ? Or better still why don't you kill yourself ??? Murderer.' Another called Lucia Rossi said: 'Scandalous. A killer asking for money...where have we ended up.' The Supreme Court on Tuesday said the ruling was full of 'deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions and ordered the new appeals court to look at all the evidence to determine whether Knox helped kill the teen. In March, the Court of Cassation overturned Knox's acquittal in the 2007 murder of flatmate Meredith Kercher and ordered a new trial. On Tuesday, the high court issued its written reasoning for doing so. Kercher's body was found in November 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian town popular with foreign exchange students. Knox, now 25, and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 29, were initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, but a Perugia appeals court acquitted them in 2011, criticizing virtually the entire case mounted by prosecutors. Decision: Italy's judges have ruled that the possibility that Meredith Kercher died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again . The appellate court noted that the murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and that prosecutors provided no murder motive. A young man from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in a separate proceeding and is serving a 16-year sentence. In the 74-page Cassation ruling, the high court judges said they 'had to recognize that he (Guede) was not the sole author' of the crime, Italian news agency LaPresse reported. The judges though said he was the 'main protagonist'. They said the new appeal process would serve to 'not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime, but to possibly outline the subjective position of Guede's accomplices'. It said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher 'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'. The high court faulted the Perugia appeals court for 'multiple instances of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions. The new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities, it said. Knox and Sollecito denied wrongdoing and said they weren't even in the apartment that night, although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded. Miss Kercher was found semi naked and with her throat cut in the . bedroom of the house she shared in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia . with his American former girlfriend. He . was given a 25 year jail term while Knox was given 26 years but in 2011 . the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal. However, three months ago Italy's highest court ruled there should be a fresh trial for both of them.

The mother of the girl abducted by Jeremy Forrest said she was grieving  because the daughter she knew ‘had died’. She sat in the public gallery yesterday as her harrowing victim impact statement describing the breakdown of their relationship was read to the court sentencing the teacher. In it, she said her relationship with the girl would ‘never be the same again’. She added: ‘I feel like the daughter I know has died and I’m grieving for her and it upsets me beyond words. I feel completely useless most of the time. Topless: Jeremy Forrest took images on a mobile phone of himself and sent to the . 15-year-old he had a sexual relationship with before abducting her . ‘I feel I have failed as a parent. I can’t understand how someone could do this to my child and I had no idea. ‘I feel like the worst mother in the world, whatever anyone else says it doesn’t matter. That is how I feel. ‘Someone got to my child. I never saw it coming or saw it once it was happening. ‘I feel like part of my daughter’s childhood has been stolen from me. ‘She has aimed all her anger at me that she has to give evidence and attend court. ‘Somehow that is all my fault and she feels she cannot trust me and she has gone to live elsewhere.’ The schoolgirl and her mother sat apart and completely ignored each other on the day the sobbing teenager gave evidence. Now 16, the girl has used Twitter to say she will wait for Forrest’s release from prison. In January she said ‘I’ll always be . waiting for you’ and shortly before the trial she posted: ‘After all . this time, I’m still into you’. I feel completely useless most of the time. I feel I have failed as a parent. Can’t understand how someone could do this to my child and I had no idea. I feel like the worst mother in the world, whatever anyone else says it doesn’t matter. That is how I feel. Someone got to my child. I never saw it coming or saw it once it was happening. I feel like part of [my daughter’s] childhood has been stolen from me. I missed her last day at school, dressing her in her party dress and seeing her off to the prom has all been taken from us. My relationship with her will never be the same again. She has aimed all her anger at me that she has to give evidence and attend court. Somehow that is all my fault and she feels she cannot trust me and she has gone to live elsewhere. I feel like the [daughter] I know has died and I’m grieving for her and it upsets me beyond words. Mobile phone: Forrest was today sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail for the abduction of the 15-year-old . When a Twitter user asked her on . Tuesday whether she wanted their relationship to resume, she replied: . ‘Can’t talk about that until after the trial, sorry.’ She also used the social networking . service to criticise the prosecution at Forrest’s trial for saying her . relationship with him was ‘not a case of Romeo and Juliet’. She said: ‘Of course it’s not! That’s a tragedy and they both f***ing died. How moronic.’ She also disputed a court claim that . she and Forrest had sex up to eight times a night: ‘That is  completely . misconstrued. I’m not sure who’d have the stamina!’ She later added: ‘Honestly don’t know . whether to laugh or cry.’ The court also heard allegations of illicit . communication between Forrest and the girl that may have allowed her to . change her evidence. In a police interview following her . return to Britain, the girl suggested they had agreed to flee to France . last September after detectives had seized her phone containing intimate . pictures of them. But, giving evidence during the . trial, she told the court she had effectively persuaded the teacher to . accompany her, amid concerns she might kill herself if he did not. Off to prison: Jeremy Forrest is led out of Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex after he was jailed for five and a half years. His victim's mother said today his crimes took her daughter away . Sombre: As he considers the fact he will not be released for some time, Jeremy Forrest is pictured sitting in his prison van . Richard Barton, prosecuting, told the . court there was ‘material that indicates communication through a known . third party and the police are aware of that’. Judge Michael Lawson QC said: ‘It may be a matter that should be looked into.’ Passing sentence, the judge told . Forrest: ‘You have contested the abduction charge raising a spurious . defence, so that she had to give evidence, evidence very different in . content from her original account and designed to support it. ‘She had clearly received assistance in relation to what she should say.’ A Sussex Police spokesman said: . ‘Before the judge made his comments in court today the matter had been . raised with Sussex Police and this is being looked into. We will release . more information when it becomes available.’ Forrest’s sister sprang to his . defence yesterday. Carrie Hanspaul, who is a mother of three, said: ‘We . always have been and will be behind him 100 per cent. His relationship . with the girl has been totally misconstrued. He has been misunderstood.’ Change: Jeremy looked very serious as he was guided into a prison van this afternoon . Caught on camera: Forrest and the girl aboard a ferry from Dover to Calais last September, and she clearly still has feelings for him despite his abduction conviction . She described the case as a ‘sorry episode for all concerned’, saying Forrest was ‘very sorry for his actions’. She also said the family hoped the failure to stop the relationship would be investigated. ‘Despite the verdict and today’s . sentence, there are many factors in this case which need to be examined . and addressed, including the failure to properly act on early warnings,’ she added. ‘We sincerely hope that these are sensibly looked into and . not simply swept under the carpet.’ Mrs Hanspaul had wept in court as her character reference for her brother was read out. She said: ‘He’s very good natured and extremely mild mannered,’ claiming depression may have contributed to his behaviour. She added: ‘Jeremy had been in a very . difficult relationship for the last six years but didn’t want to worry . anybody, especially our parents, with his problems. Instead he withdrew . more and more and I believe he became more and more depressed.’ Mrs Hanspaul and Forrest’s parents, Jim and Julie, had attended every day of the trial. His father had to be taken to . hospital after collapsing outside the court before the verdict on . Thursday and missed yesterday’s sentencing.

The European Union has spent £850,000 moving and upgrading a visitor centre even though it only received 50,000 people a year. In contrast, the Pencil Museum in the Lake District town of Keswick, receives more than 80,000 visitors a year, who pay up to £4.25 a head for entry. Attendance at the free European Commission Visitor Centre dropped in 2012 by 5 per cent on the previous year. Upgrade: Relocating and renovating the European Commission Visitor Centre cost taxpayers £853,000 (1million Euros) Hub: The new visitor centre is based inside the European Commission's Charlemagne Building in Brussels . But despite the decline in numbers, the EU lavished taxpayer's money on relocating the centre to a different Brussels street this spring. The new centre, which is now opposite the Commission's headquarters, opened in May. It sits just half a mile from the European Parliament's Visitor Centre, which opened in 2012 at a cost of nearly £18million. But actually visiting the Commission's Visitor Centre is no easy task. People wanting to go must to book at least 10 weeks in advance using an online application form and go in a group of 15 or more. No children are allowed as access is limited to people aged 15 and over. Mrs Yannakoudakis said: 'The EU thinks that it can win over citizens . with extravagant visitors’ centres such as those hosted by the European . Commission and the European Parliament. 'The parliament lavished a shameful £18m on its temple of . EU propaganda and now we learn that a further million Euros has been . spent on another centre half a mile away. 'The EU needs to rein in the outlandish budget for publicising itself. If it buckled down and did a better job, including by cutting back . waste, it might find it needed less money to spend on hype.' Success: The Pencil Museum in Cumbria receives more than 80,000 visitors a year - 30,000 more than the European Commission Visitor Centre . Attraction: Visitors pay up to £4.25 a head entry for the Pencil Museum, while the European Commission centre is free . In response to the MEP's written question, Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding said: 'The Visitors’ Centre is an integral part and key instrument of its communication strategy. 'It provides an opportunity for citizens, including high-profile groups and key multipliers, to visit the Commission at its headquarters. 'The Centre aims to give visitors an insight into how the Commission works and also explain its policies and programmes.' The centre had 50,576 visitors last year, down from 53,245 in 2011.

Making history: Five-month-old Evie-Mae was christened in the Edwardian gown last weekend in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire . Giggling Evie-Mae Lowe is only five months old, but already she has made history. The baby girl, from Church, Lancashire, has become the fifth generation of the same family to be christened in an Edwardian gown, hand-stitched more than 100 years ago. The unique garment has been passed around an estimated 17 members of her extended family in that time. The 103-year-old dress is made of fine cotton with a pink tuck top and a white tier . skirt embroidered with cotton lace. And last weekend it was Evie-Mae's turn to wear it during a service at St Mary's RC Church in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire. She follows in the footsteps of her father Ryan, grandfather Graham, great-grandmother Margaret and great-great-grandmother Madge to be christened in the gown over the past century. Her grandmother Gillian Lowe, 49, said the family wants to keep the tradition going as long as possible. She said: 'It’s kept safe by Evie’s . great-grandma Margaret who washes it in a special liquid and keeps it . safe in a special box. There are no stains or holes. It has kept. 'Evie-Mae is the fifth generation in her family line to wear it but there have been 17 in total if you take into account other cousins and great-uncles and people like that down the years who have worn it. Family heirloom: Evie-Mae's grandfather Graham in the gown in 1963, left, and her father Ryan, when he was christened, right . 'It’s a very nice, unique and a special thing to have in our family. I would like my other son to use it when he has a child one day.' Victorian and Edwardian christening gowns are seeing a resurgence in popularity in recent years following the success of period drama TV shows such as Downton Abbey and The Paradise. Linda Patrick, owner of bespoke christening wear business Little Doves, said recently she has seen an upsurge in the number of enquiries about authentic gowns. Christening gown gained popularity during the Victorian era when families were often large and it was useful to pass them down from one sibling to the next. The Church insisted that babies were christened in white as a symbol of purity and innocence of a child. The Royal family used the same christening gown, first commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1841, for 167 years. Thought to have been made from the same Spitalfields silk as the Queen's wedding dress, it was kept in an air tight container and washed in sanitised water to try and preserve it for future generations. In 2008, it was finally retired and the Queen commissioned a replica gown to be made for James, Viscount Severn, the infant son of the Duke and Duchess of Wessex. It is expected to be used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the christening of their first child, due in a month's time.

There is also fury about Government corruption and the amount being spent on hosting sport rather than improving public services. In one of several reported protests, about 200 people blocked the Anchieta Highway that links Sao Paulo and the port city of Santos.

A November report from the government raised to $13.3billion . the projected cost of stadiums, airport renovations and other projects . for the World Cup.

Last night, about 50,000 people demonstrated outside Sao Paulo cathedral. While mostly peaceful, the demonstration followed the rhythm of protests that drew 240,000 people across Brazil the previous night, with small bands of radicals splitting off to fight with police and break into stores. Fernando Grella Vieira, head of the Sao Paulo state public safety department, said 63 people were detained during Tuesday's protests. He told the Globo TV network on Wednesday that police would guarantee the right to demonstrate but would 'repress all forms of vandalism.'

Thousands of Brazilians took to the streets to voice their anger against high public transportation costs and the billions of dollars spent on the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio . Despite some concessions from the government, protests have continued across the country . Mass protests have been mushrooming across Brazil since demonstrations called last week by a group angry over the high cost of a woeful public transport system and a recent 10-cent hike in bus and subway fares in Sao Paulo, Rio and elsewhere. The local governments in at least four cities have now agreed to reverse those hikes, and city and federal politicians have shown signs that the Sao Paulo fare could also be rolled back. However, it not clear that the concessions with calm the protests. Protester Yasmine Gomes, 22, said: 'What I hope comes from these protests is that the governing class comes to understand that we're the ones in charge, not them, and the politicians must learn to respect us,' President Dilma Rousseff, a former leftist guerrilla who was imprisoned and tortured during Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship, hailed the protests for raising questions and strengthening Brazil's democracy. 'Brazil today woke up stronger,' she said in a statement. Yet Rousseff offered no actions that her government might take to address complaints, even though her administration is a prime target of demonstrators' frustrations. The protests have brought troubling questions about security in the country, which is playing host this week to soccer's Confederations Cup and will welcome Pope Francis in July for a visit to Rio de Janeiro and rural Sao Paulo. The demonstrations have united huge crowds around a central complaint about the woeful public services in the country despite the economy growing. Protestors destroy ATM machines at a local a bank.

The Brazilian Tax Planning Institute think tank found that the country's tax burden in 2011 stood at 36 per cent of gross domestic product, ranking it 12th among the 30 countries with the world's highest tax burdens. Yet, The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found in a 2009 educational survey that literacy and math skills of Brazilian 15-year-olds ranked 53rd out of 65 countries, behind nations such as Bulgaria, Mexico, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, and Romania. Many protesting in Brazil's streets hail from the country's growing middle class, which government figures show has ballooned by some 40million over the past decade amid a commodities-driven economic boom. They say they have lost patience with endemic problems such as government corruption and inefficiency. Attorney Agatha Rossi de Paula, who attended the latest protest in Sao Paulo along with her mother, called Brazil's fiscal priorities 'an embarrassment.'

Professor's son Alfred Saunders, 21, stabbed Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22,in the face, neck and chest in a frenzied attack at an idyllic rainforest eco-farm owned by a Briton in December 2011. It later emerged that Saunders had managed to enter Costa Rica from Nicaragua despite the fact he was the subject of a green Interpol alert describing him as a 'violent individual' likely to commit acts of barbarism. Frenzied: Alfred Saunders, 21, seen left at the start of his trial in Costa Rica, has now pleaded guilty to the murder of Czech backpacker Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22, right, in a frenzied knife attack in a tent . Dangerous: Saunders, seen outside court in Upala in January 2012, was the subject of an Interpol alert linking him to sex attacks and possession of explosions . Saunders pleaded guilty to murder at a private hearing in Upala after spending 18 months on remand, the Sun reported. The court was told there was a 'high possibility' Saunders will serve his prison term in a 'maximum security unit'. After crossing the border from . Nicaragua the day after Boxing Day 2011, Saunders - the son of King's . College professor Max Saunders and his former wife, psychoanalyst Catia . Galatariotou - turned up at the remote farm run by Nic Donati. Idyllic: Miss Drbohlavova, 22, had been volunteering at the farm in Upala for just two weeks when she was stabbed to death by Saunders . Mr Donati took pity on Saunders, who had almost no possessions, and gave him a tent for the night. But later that night Saunders had to be overpowered by relatives of Mr Donati alerted by the screams of Miss Drbohlavova. 'Sweet and kind': Miss Drbohlavova, 22, was volunteering at the farm in Costa Rica during her Christmas break from studying at Miami University . The philosophy graduate and volleyball player, who was stabbed 15 times in the face, neck and chest, had been volunteering at the farm for just two weeks when she was attacked. Friends said she had been pursuing her studies further at Miami University, and had travelled to Costa Rica during her Christmas break to carry out research. One friend, who described Miss Drbohlavova - nicknamed Sasa - as a 'kind, sweet person', said at the time: 'She was always so calm and peaceful - the horror of this is beyond words.' Costa Rica's judicial police force told MailOnline after the murder at the end of 2011 that officials became aware Interpol was on Saunders' trail when he entered the country the day after Boxing Day. Marisel Rodriguez said at the time: 'The man being held over the murder of the Czech woman is the subject of a green Interpol notice.'It's a warning mechanism Interpol uses and makes available to other countries' law enforcement agencies and border control organisations.In Saunders' case, she said, the warning related to 'sex crimes, assault resulting in death, torture or acts of barbarism and the possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives'. The Interpol notice described Saunders as a violent individual suffering from a mental illness who, as well as being a suicide risk, was liable to commit sexual crimes against minors and could be armed, she explained.","Alfred Saunders, 21, pleaded guilty to murder of Alexandra Drbohlavova, 22 .

An emotional courtroom in Tennessee heard a jury find mother Lindsey Lowe guilty of the first degree premeditated murder of her newborn twin sons today. After deliberating for only two hours, Lowe, 26, was found guilty on two counts each of felony first degree murder and felony premeditated murder and was sentenced to two-life terms for her crimes. And as Judge Dee Gay revoked her bond and placed her into immediate custody Lowe turned to her distraught family members and mouth 'I'll be alright. I love you all', as she was escorted from the courtroom. Lindsey Lowe turned to look at her family as the jury announced that she was guilty of all the charges against her . In all, the jury of seven men and five women convicted Nashville resident Lowe of felony murder, premeditated murder and aggravated child abuse. Lowe will return for sentencing on the two counts of aggravated child abuse on April 26th. Lowe, who was often emotional during the trial, kept a stony-face as she was convicted of killing her twin boys at her parents home on September 12th, 2011 - after keeping her pregnancy secret from her friends and family. At trial, jurors saw a video of Lowe telling police she had given birth alone in the bathroom of her parents’ home on September 12th, 2011, and smothered the babies soon after. The bodies weren’t found until two days later. A family member discovered one baby dead in a laundry basket at the home in Hendersonville, 20 miles northeast of Nashville. Lowe stood to attention with her defense team as Judge Dee Gay presided over the jury's guilty verdict against her . The defendant turned to family members in the courtroom after the verdict was announced and told them, 'I¿m OK. I love you all. He¿s with me,' as she pointed toward the sky . When police arrived to investigate, officers found the second body under a bloody sheet in the same basket. Lowe was engaged at the time but became pregnant during an affair with another man, jurors were told. She hid the pregnancy from her family and friends, and the defense and prosecution offered competing arguments as to why. Hendersonville Police Detective Steve Malach testified that Lowe told him during an interrogation that she had kept her pregnancy secret so as not to disappoint her fiance or add to the stress of a family member’s illness. In a video of the interrogation, Lowe said she 'maybe' smothered them when she put her hand over the mouths of the babies. 'I was just trying to keep them quiet,' she said on the video. Malach testified that police searched the home thoroughly but found no evidence that Lowe had made any plans for the birth. Lindsey Lowe's parents, Paula, (left), and Mark Lowe, and her sister, Lacey, react as they listen to the jury return a guilty verdict for Lindsey during her murder trial today . The defense said Lowe wanted to block out the idea of being pregnant and said she didn’t even know she was giving birth until one of the babies came out in the toilet. 'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' defense attorney John Pellegrin told the jury. Psychiatrist Dr. William Kenner testified for the defense that Lowe had blocked out her pregnancy then suffered shock and delirium from blood loss after she gave birth. Prosecutor Ray Whitley countered that by presenting evidence of Internet searches on Lowe’s iPhone for information on inducing labor and pornography involving pregnant women. Family, friends and church members, who have rallied to support Lowe, were sobbing after the verdict. Paula Lowe, (left), hugs her daughter, Lindsey Lowe, before the jury returned a verdict in Lindsey's murder trial today . Lindsey Lowe listens to her attorneys during a break in her murder trial today - before she was found guilty of killing her two twin sons after they were born . Her father, Mark, and sister, Lacey, testified on behalf of Lowe, both saying no one knew she was pregnant. The sister said they both had been in a wedding just days before the birth and Lindsey Lowe didn’t appear pregnant when she undressed in front of other women in the wedding party. The defendant didn’t testify. 'I just don’t feel like I can emotionally handle it,' she told the judge Monday, while fighting back tears. And yesterday the jury was shown photographs taken two days before Lowe gave birth to twin boys at her parents' home, smothered them and dumped their dead bodies in the laundry. She was pictured as a bridesmaid at a wedding in Lebanon, Kentucky on September 10, 2011, just two days before the murder of her two sons in Hendersonville, Tennessee. The images how Lowe in a strapless, floor-length gown that she had been fitted for six months earlier - and her sister testified that no one ever suspected she was pregnant at the ceremony. Secret: The jury in the case of Lindsey Lowe have been shown pictures of her as a bridesmaid (center) two days before she gave birth to twin boys and smothered them to death . No sign: Family said Lindsey's weight often fluctuated so they did not suspect she was pregnant . Speaking on the stand on Monday, Lacey Lowe said that her sister's weight often fluctuated so she did not think anything of it when she started to put on weight. She added that Lindsey changed clothes in front of the other women at the wedding and no one ever thought she was pregnant, Channel News 5 reported. Lacey, 23, who shared the bathroom where her sister gave birth to two healthy boys, said Lindsey told her she had an upset stomach the morning after she gave birth. She only found out that her sister had been pregnant when she was told by a police chaplain, she said. Emotional: Lindsey appeared on the stand briefly on Monday to say she would not be testifying in the trial . No clue: Her sister Lacey said that no one at the wedding two days earlier suspected she was pregnant . Also testifying on Monday, their father, Mark Lowe, described the moment he saw the dead body of one of his grandchildren - and how he was in so much shock, he waited 15 minutes to call for help. He said his wife, Paula, found one infant on the morning of September 14, 2011 and called him with 'some panic in her voice' to come upstairs. 'She said there was a newborn child in Lindsey's room and at that point I looked at the child and was frankly not sure what I would do next,' he told the court. 'I was pretty much in shock... I really did not know who to call or what I should do.' About 15 minutes passed before he called an attorney friend, who advised him to call a pastor. Discovery: Lowe's parents found the bodies of the newborn twins in this laundry basket as she was at work . Scene: She gave birth in this bathroom that she shared with her sister at their parents' home . House of horror: Lowe's parents found the bodies and called police to their home in Hendersonville . He then called Hendersonville police and said he asked them to take Lindsey, who was at work at the time, to the hospital. He said he also asked for his daughter to be allowed to have an attorney when she talked to police, but he said he was told this would not be possible. Lindsey Lowe also made a brief appearance on the stand to explain that she was waiving her right to testify. 'I just don't feel like I can emotionally handle it,' she said. Testimony: Her father, Mark Lowe, described the moment he saw the dead babies in the laundry . On trial: Lindsey Lowe could get life in prison without parole if she is convicted of first-degree murder . Last week, prosecutors showed pictures . of Lowe's home after the babies were discovered, including the bathroom she cleaned and the laundry basket where their tiny bodies were found. The jury also heard details of the autopsies, in which the Medical Examiner . said both boys were healthy and alive when they were born. Prosecutors have said that she told police that she smothered the twins so her parents would not hear their cries. The jury will now deliberate. If convicted of first-degree murder, Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said previously they would not seek the death penalty.","A jury found  26-year-old Lindsey Lowe guilty of murder for the 2011 smothering deaths of her newborn twins today .

But when charity chiefs asked the three party leaders to pose with thumb and forefinger just a couple of inches apart, they were merely hoping to spread their message that the world was ‘this close’ to eradicating polio. However, David Cameron and Nick Clegg turned down the request, for fear of media mischief-makers  taking the pictures out of context. David Cameron with MP Nigel Evans holding an End Polio Now poster. Cameron refused to pose for the 'This Close' campaign . Ed Miliband, on the other hand, readily . agreed – even though his brother David never lived down the infamous . photograph of him holding a banana. For all of them, it was a calculated political gamble: weighing up the chances of facing humiliation for striking a pose that wags could misconstrue as a smutty joke about a man’s endowment, against the clear benefits of publicly backing such a good cause. Only time will tell which of the leaders made the right call. Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg also refused for fear of the photographs being taken out of context . As one Government insider said: ‘In the age of mass media, what  politicians look like can be as important as what they say. ‘Photos can be used to ridicule them . for years to come over any political or personal issues. It is not the . PM’s job to provide Private Eye magazine with front-cover photos making . him look stupid. Ed  Miliband may regret posing in the long run.’ But . allies of Mr Miliband defended his decision, saying: ‘Cynics may choose . to laugh, but getting rid of polio is far more important.’ Instead of making the gesture, the Prime Minister and his deputy posed behind posters promoting the campaign. However, it seems that they might have been overly cautious – as both have previously been photographed inadvertently making the gesture in entirely unrelated, and innocuous, circumstances. The ‘This Close’ campaign is headed . by Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has given more than £400 million to . the worldwide drive to eradicate polio, led by Rotary International. Scores . of politicians, businessmen, religious leaders and celebrities have . posed with their thumb and forefinger apart to promote the campaign – . ranging from South Korean pop star Psy to South Africa’s Archbishop . Desmond Tutu. Although polio has been conquered in . most Western countries, it is still endemic in Afghanistan, India, . Nigeria and Pakistan. Mr Gates has spoken movingly of its impact. He . said: ‘I was in India and saw what this horrible disease does to . children. I was in a slum in Delhi, and I held a nine-month-old girl . named Hashmin in my arms. She obviously didn’t understand why people . were poking her legs and looking so serious. ‘But she’ll never be able to kick a ball around, never be able to play hide-and-seek with her friends, because she has polio. As I held Hashmin, I thought, “We can end this.” ’ Ed Miliband agreed to pose for the charity campaign. Allies of Miliband argue that getting rid of Polio is more important than a photograph . Various celebrities are part of the global initiative to end polio posing with their finger and thumb showing the small step needed to reach the goal of an end to polio . Rotary International has set up a website featuring photographs of people performing the thumb-and forefinger-gesture, which it bills as ‘the world’s biggest commercial’. The charity says: ‘After nearly 30 years, and after immunising more than two billion children against polio, we are on the brink of making history. We are This Close to ending polio for ever. You can take action by showing your support. Snap a photo of yourself making the This Close sign and upload it. ‘Your involvement will help convince world leaders that support for polio eradication is global.’","Charity asked the three party leaders to pose for the 'This Close' campaign .

Little Ireland Nugent's parents have been trying to tell her their 2-year-old daughter that her legs have been amputated but they're having a hard time. Three weeks ago, an horrific lawn-mower accident in Palm Harbor, Florida severed both of her legs below the knees. Her mother Nicole Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times that they were trying to find the words in the the hope that she would understand. Scroll down for video... Still my little girl: Jerry Nugent hugs his daughter, Ireland, in a Florida hospital. Just three weeks ago he accidentally cut off his daughters' legs after running her over with his lawnmower . Brave: Ireland's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb . Brave: Her parents are adament that their little girl, Ireland, will walk again . 'We were playing with Mr. Potato Head yesterday and taking the feet on and off and I said, 'This is going to be like you, Ireland. We're going to take your feet on and off.' She doesn't really understand. She's honestly so little that I don't really think she gets that.' Brave Ireland has asked virtually no questions about the past, but her parents worry about what is to come. So far she's already had to undergo seven operations and now her parents, Jerry and Nicole are looking into prosthetic-limb providers and group therapy for themselves and their other children. Incredibly, Ireland is managing to smile through it all and is keeping far calmer than her parents. Simplicity: Ireland's mom, Nicole, is trying to get her daughter used to the idea of prosthetic leg. She told her that she was going to be like Mr Potatohead . Harrowing ordeal: Ireland, seen here in her hospital bed, has had to undergo seven surgeries since her accident three weeks ago . She is heavily drugged-up with pain medication and one of her arms is in cast. However, when media were allowed to visit the girl for the first time yesterday, they reported that Ireland appeared to be awake, alert and full of curiosity with her cheeks sporting a healthy glow. She was given a package of Play-doh and animal-shaped cookie cutters. It's Ireland's smile that helps strengthen her family. 'She's just happy and spunky and it keeps us going,' her mom, Nicole said. 'She's been very strong through this whole process. In fact, it's been hard for us to even read that she's in pain at times. I kind of have to read her physical cues because she just doesn't cry.' On Tuesday, her dad said that he was rubbing the ends of his daughter's legs. The idea was to alleviate the 'phantom limb' sensations that trouble many amputees. 'I love your little legs,' he told her. 'Thank you, daddy,' she replied. Comforting: The family are trying to make things as normal as possible for the little girl, even while she is still in hospital . Support: The family say the support from the community has been overwhelming. Her hospital room is awash with cards, toys and balloons . Support: Ireland Nugent's mom and dad have been with her every day since the accident on April 11th . The little girl was injured on April 11th when she ran after her father, Jerry, as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home. Her mother, Nicole, frantically waved at him to stop, but he misunderstood and put the lawn mower in reverse backing over his child. Both her legs were severed below the knee. Her hand was also cut and her thumb broken. The Nugents say the financial and moral support they've received from the community has been overwhelming. Balloons, toys, and cards fill her hospital room. A fund established for Ireland's medical care and expenses at Trinity Presbyterian had raised about $85,000 and the family are continuing to raise money.

The family is already making plans to have Ireland fitted for prosthetic limbs in Orlando. Two funds have been set up to accept donations for Ireland Nugent's family. • .

They will have to make adjustments to the family home in order to make life as easy as possible for the little girl. Her siblings may also need some counseling as they adjust to life without Ireland's legs. Later today, doctors will do a final check of two skin grafts to make sure they've healed. If they have it would mean Ireland is one step closer to coming home. Her mother told WSTP: 'This has been the biggest nightmare of my life, honestly. I never imagined that this would happen to her, but through this have come so many blessings,' Nicole says. 'First, she lived, and we didn't know when it first happened if that was going to happen.'

A dowdy young farmer teased for being an 'ugly duckling' at school has swapped her wellies for stilettos and is now set to become one of Europe's top models. Nicole Skinner, 21, spent most of her teenage years in boots and overalls helping muck out on her parents' farm in Lincolnshire. The shy teenager only had two friends at school, where she was shunned for her unkempt appearance, and spent most of her time with her horses. Beauty: Farmer Nicole Skinner has made an astonishing transformation from ugly duckling to top model . Shunned: Nicole was rejected by classmates for being unkempt and preferring to spend time with her pony . But after discovering make-up on her 18th birthday, Nicole started to turn heads in her local pub and with her confidence boosted, decided to take up modelling because she 'needed another hobby'. And her hobby has paid off. Just three years into her modelling career, she stunned friends and family by winning the prestigious Europe's Perfect Cover Model 2013 award last month and will now represent Britain in Orlando, Florida, in the world finals in August . Council administrator Nicole said: 'It's all been a bit overwhelming because up until a few years ago I had no confidence in myself whatsoever. 'I was called an ugly duckling at school. I was always on the farm in my overalls and slacks. I didn't really discover make-up until I was about 18 when I got some on my birthday - I didn't even know how to put it on. 'When I went out I suddenly got people noticing me and telling me I looked nice. I realised I liked looking good and it just went from there. 'My friends suggested I had some professional pictures done and the photographer said I was a natural. He made some calls to modelling agencies and it went from there. Who's laughing now? Pretty Nicole will now represent the UK in the Perfect Cover Model 2013 final in Florida . Model: Nicole originally took up modelling as a hobby but it's now turning into a lucrative career . 'Then I had to learn how to walk in high heels because I was only use to wellies from mucking out the horses. 'I never had any self confidence, I was shy and I only really had two friends at school. I got to 18 and I thought I need a new hobby. So I thought sod it, let's try modelling.'Along with the Europe's Perfect Cover Model 2013 award, Nicole has triumphed in other modelling competitions, including Miss Galaxy Lincolnshire in 2011 and United Kingdom's Perfect Cover Mode the following year. The former farmer also models for swimwear designer Sandstorm Luxury. She added: 'I felt like the outcast at the first competition. Most of the girls are a little bit different from me. 'But the second time I was much more confident and now I've really come out of my shell - I never dreamed I would be modelling swimwear. 'It's safe to say I'm not as shy and reserved as I used to be. Boys never used to notice me before - but they sure do now.' Low maintenance: Nicole didn't get to grips with make-up until she received some for her 18th birthday .

Abdul Miah, 19, from Elswick, Newcastle, appeared at the city's Crown Court via video-link and pleaded guilty to three counts of rape and one of robbery. He attacked his victim on waste ground in Elswick, in Newcastle's West End, on December 18. Abdul Miah, 19, from Elswick, appeared at The Law Courts on Newcastle upon Tyne's Quayside via video link. He admitted three counts of rape and one of robbery . The horrendous attack was overheard by the victim's mother, who had called the teenager's phone when she did not come home as expected, according to reports. When the manhunt was still on, the girl's aunt told the Evening Chronicle newspaper: 'She rang her daughter and she could hear his voice in the background, but she didn't know where she was or what was happening.' The girl was expected back at 9.30pm and, when she did not return, her mother rang her. The mother called police after she heard Miah's voice over the phone. He had approached her and robbed her at knifepoint, taking two mobile phones and money, before taking her to waste ground to rape her.

A green tax that comes into effect today will drive tens of thousands of families into fuel poverty, experts warn. The ‘carbon price floor’ is designed to ensure suppliers use less gas, coal and oil – but has been described as a ‘stealth poll tax’ on individuals and businesses. Analysts say the levy on the production of electricity from fossil fuels will account for an 8 per cent rise on household bills in just two years. The IPPR think that households will pay more than 10 per cent of disposable income on heating and lighting . It will raise billions for the Treasury, but a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research found it is likely to hit economic growth. The IPPR estimates that the tax will push up to 60,000 more households into fuel poverty – when more than 10 per cent of disposable income is spent on heating and lighting – this year alone. This will rise to 90,000 a year by 2020, as the tax rises sharply in successive Budgets. The think-tank predicts that wholesale electricity price will rise by around 17 per cent in three years due to the tax, which will equate to around an 8 per cent rise on energy bills. Critics have said that the green tax is nothing but a way for The government, including the Chancellor George Osborne, to raise money for the Exchequer . By contrast, subsidised companies selling electricity from wind farms and nuclear power stations will receive a £1.2billion boost over the next three years, as they benefit from the effect on the fossil fuel market. Tony Cocker, boss of E.ON UK, said the carbon price floor is ‘pretty close to a stealth poll tax’. He added: ‘It’s not based on ability to pay, it’s based on the requirement to keep warm and light your house. It was put in place with the stated objective of encouraging investment in low-carbon energy but it certainly doesn’t achieve that objective. It’s just a tax for the Exchequer.’ The IPPR’s report notes that ‘the environmental case [for the tax] is threadbare at best’, but adds it will raise £4.42billion for the Government over three years – more than the bill for cutting corporation tax, or increasing the personal tax allowance. Ministers claim that the public could actually save money by buying energy efficient appliances . Last year, the all-party energy and climate change select committee warned that the tax would place British companies at a disadvantage compared with international rivals. However, the Treasury said: ‘The carbon price floor is vital in reducing uncertainty and creating incentives for investment in low carbon electricity generation now so we have lower emissions in the future.’ Last week, the Government admitted that the cost of green taxes will more than double by 2020 to almost £300 a year. However, ministers claim that families will end up paying less based on assumptions that they will cut their energy use by more than a quarter, largely by buying efficient appliances, over the same period.","The ‘carbon price floor’ will ensure suppliers use less gas, coal and oil .

The da Vinci, used to treat cancer and other prostate problems, has been credited with reducing the side-effects of surgery. But it is now being investigated over reports of problems, including several deaths that may be . linked with it. There also have been several disturbing, . freak incidents: a robotic hand that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped . during surgery and a robotic arm hitting a patient in the face as she . lay on the operating table. The widely-used da Vinci robot is under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over reports of problems, including several deaths that may be linked with it . The da Vinci has four spider‑like . arms, controlled by the surgeon, which hold cutting instruments to make . tiny incisions and remove the prostate or the cancerous part using . images from the telescope to guide the surgeon. It also features a tiny telescope which is placed inside an incision in the patient’s body. The telescope takes images from two points, which are relayed back to a console so the surgeon has a 3D image on-screen while he operates. Previous evidence has shown that using these robots mean significantly less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and probably a shorter overall recovery time. For surgeons, who control the robot . while sitting at a computer screen rather than standing over the . patient, these operations can be less tiring - and robotic hands don't shake. A 2002 study in the journal European Urology found prostate cancer surgery done by da Vinci robots had better outcomes for continence and cancer control than keyhole approaches done by the human hand. The robot is also now used for heart bypass surgery, heart valve repair and hysterectomy. But an upcoming research paper suggests that problems linked with robotic surgery are underreported, with some American doctors saying there is not enough robust research showing that robotic surgery is at least as good or better than conventional surgeries. Previous evidence has shown that using these robots, rather than surgeon's hands,results in less blood loss, reduced risk of blood transfusion and a shorter overall recovery time . There are also cases of 'catastrophic complications', said Dr Martin Makary, a Johns Hopkins University surgeon who co-authored the paper. 'The rapid adoption of robotic surgery ... has been done by and large without the proper evaluation,' he told Associated Press. Now the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is looking into a spike in reported problems during robotic surgeries. Earlier this year, the FDA began a survey of surgeons using the robotic system. The agency conducts such surveys of devices routinely, but FDA spokeswoman Synim Rivers told Associated Press that the reason for the most recent investigation 'is the increase in number of reports received' about da Vinci. However, she added that the increase may simply reflect more awareness among doctors and hospitals about the need to report problems. It may also reflect wider use. Last year there were 367,000 robot surgeries in the U.S. versus 114,000 in 2008, according to da Vinci's maker, Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Sunnyvale, California. A search for the company's name in an FDA database of reported problems related to medical devices brings up 500 reports since January 1st, 2012. Many of these are said to have come from Intuitive Surgical. There's also no proof any of the problems were caused by the robot, and many didn't injure patients. Reports filed this year include a woman who died during a 2012 hysterectomy when the surgeon-controlled robot accidentally nicked a blood vessel, a Chicago man who died in 2007 after spleen surgery and a robotic arm that wouldn't let go of tissue grasped during colorectal surgery. 'We had to do a total system shutdown to get the grasper to open its jaws,' said the report filed by the hospital. The report said the patient was not injured. Complications can occur with any type of surgery, and so far it's unclear if they are more common in robotic operations, but that's part of what the FDA is trying to find out. Intuitive Surgical disputes there's been a true increase in problems and says the rise reflects a change it made last year in the way it reports problems. The da Vinci system 'has an excellent safety record with over 1.5 million surgeries performed globally, and total adverse event rates have remained low and in line with historical trends,' said company spokeswoman Angela Wonson.","The da Vinci robot is increasingly used by surgeons due to its accuracy .

An army Captain who led a doomed reconnaissance patrol at the start of the 2003 Iraq War claims his unit was 'abandoned and betrayed' by military chiefs after the mission went disastrously wrong. David Blakeley, 33, has broken almost a decade of silence to reveal how his nine-man patrol became surrounded by hundreds of Iraqi troops from Saddam Hussein's feared Republican Guard. Travelling in lightly-armoured Land Rovers, his pathfinder unit had been sent to assess an airfield hundreds of kilometres north of British positions to determine if it was suitable for an airborne insertion of paratroopers. (File picture): An army captain has lifted the lid on a disastrous mission at the start of the 2003 Iraq war in which he claims his unit was 'abandoned and betrayed' by military chiefs . Although they had been given intelligence reports claiming the area was free from enemy units they found it was actually swarming with hostile troops. Realising they were trapped, they called in for air support but were told nothing was available. Their only option was to fight their way out. After numerous skirmishes with the enemy they eventually made it back, their vehicles riddled with bullet holes. The unit earned two Military Crosses. Army code requires that soldiers never reveal details of such operations to the public and for nine years Captain Blakeley kept the disastrous mission a secret. But he has now revealed all in a new Book Pathfinder: A Special Forces Mission Behind Enemy Lines. Captain Blakeley, who was injured in a later mission but recovered before leaving the army, claims he felt compelled to speak out in a bid to prevent any similar disasters in the future. He told the Independent newspaper: 'We were massively outnumbered. We were abandoned and betrayed by higher command. 'I think it is the biggest secret of the war. 'I know I am going to get some snipes from people who think I should have kept quiet. It has been a lonely journey but morally it was the right thing to do. 'The key reason was to learn lessons from the mistakes.' (File picture): Captain Blakeley claims his unit was denied air support and were left to fight their way out after being surrounded on all sides . Captain Blakeley's team of six Pathfinders and three Royal Engineers were sent across the American front line to Qalat Sikar airfield - 120km north of Nasiriyah in the south east of the country. Nasiriyah had seen the US Marine advance thwarted and 29 men lost after they encountered unexpectedly strong resistance from the Republican Guard. As they reached the city, the Brits, in their three Land Rovers armed with six machine guns, had just 12 hours to complete their mission. They quickly moved across the front line encountering dozens of shell-shocked American Marines and soon found themselves surrounded by enemy forces and fire from all sides. Realising they were boxed in from all sides they decided their only option was to call for air support. Captain Bleakley explained: 'I was told instantly by a senior officer there was no air. 'It was like swallowing acid. It was crushing, devastating.  We were totally on our own, abandoned.' After fighting their way back through five ambushes, they finally arrived at the American position where they passed on grid references of all the Iraqi units  they had encountered. Captain Bleakely added: 'The mission had failed but we had done our damnedest. When I thought of these amazing guys and what we had contributed to the intelligence picture, I was shaking with anger.'",Nine-man reconnaissance patrol was surrounded by hundreds of Iraqi troops but denied air support .

A haunted ruin where the ghost of King Charles I's executioner is said to roam at night is going under the hammer for £75,000. Almost 250 years old the Grade II listed building has been described by estate agents as a folly - a building in the form of a castle or temple originally constructed to satisfy a fancy or conceit. The ruins, in the village of Dinton, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire are rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of John Mayne. This haunted ruin where the ghost of King Charles I's executioner is said to roam at night is going under the hammer for £75,000 . The ruins, in the village of Dinton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire are rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of John Mayne . Mayne, who was also known as the Dinton Hermit, used to live in a nearby cave in the 17th Century. He was once secretary to Oliver Cromwell and local legend has it that he executed Charles I on January 30, 1649. Mayne fell out of favour with Charles II during the restoration and was stripped of his wealth. His ghost is now said to shelter within the crumbling walls of the octagonal folly constructed on a Saxon burial ground. The octagonal folly was built on a Saxon burial ground by Sir John Vanhatten in 1769 to store his collection of fossils . Originally the folly was three storeys high with a newel staircase in the east tower, a fireplace on each floor in the west tower and was used by servants . Much interest has already been shown in the ruins, which are due to be auctioned by Michael Anthony estate agents next month . The folly was built in 1769 by the former owner of Dinton Hall, Sir John Vanhattem. He used it to store his collection of fossils unearthed in the local chalk quarry and some are incorporated in the limestone walls. Originally the folly was three storeys high with a newel staircase in the east tower, a fireplace on each floor in the west tower and was used by Sir John's servants.

Accused: David Engle, coach of Maple Valley youth baseball team, is accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the boy over a period of six years . A youth baseball coach has been accused of repeatedly raping a boy on camera days after he was charged with buy child pornography. David Engle, 49, coach of Maple Valley youth baseball team, is accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting the boy over a period of six years. Prosecutors allege that Engle recorded himself raping his struggling victim. Engle was first arrested on November 6 after agents with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and other agencies traced an online purchase of child pornography to his home and recovered photos and video that further implicates him. Engle had been heavily involved in youth baseball. He coached a Select Bronco team of 11 and 12 year olds, was president of Maple Valley Pony Baseball and Fast Pitch, and served on two regional baseball organisations. The baseball coach who was already facing child pornography production and possession charges and has now been charged by King County prosecutors with three counts of child rape. Senior Deputy Prosecutor Cecelia Gregson claimed Engle had gone to great lengths to have contact with children while amassing a large collection of child pornography. The Seattle Pi reported that Gregson told the court: 'The state has overwhelming evidence that the defendant committed countless acts of sexual assault upon his victim for years without detection.' Engle’s arrest followed an international investigation into a website dealing in 'naturist films' – a euphemism for child pornography. Postal inspectors made a series of undercover purchases from the website before law enforcement workers raided the business and seized a wealth of child pornography and business records. Further investigations of  customers who used the site led detectives to Engle who is alleged to have spent $2,300 on videos and photos sent to him by the company. Investigators said the majority of the graphic images purchased by Engle from the site showed nude, prepubescent boys being sexually assaulted. Investigators raided Engle’s home the day he was arrested, and allegedly recovered a significant amount of additional pornography to that which he bought online. Engle has been charged with having about 11,000 suspicious images on his laptop, and additional DVDs and digital storage devices were also recovered. Stunned: The accusations against Engle have shocked residents living in the quiet Maple Valley area of Washington . Investigators claim to have since uncovered photos and video of Engle raping one boy, triggering the secondary, more serious charge that he now faces. According to charging documents filed in King County Superior Court, investigators recovered photos that indicate Engle had been raping the boy for six years. Engle allegedly took more than 1,400 photos and dozens of videos of himself and the child during the sexual assaults, King County Detective Marylisa Priebe-Olson told the court. During one, the detective said in court documents, Engle was seen raping the boy while watching a baseball game on television. He said it shows the boy struggling against him and being told 'no.' Engle, who remains in custody, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making and receiving child pornography; he has not yet entered a plea to the three child rape charges he faces in state court.","David Engle accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting a boy over .

The youngster suffered 'catastrophic' brain injuries the day after the television toppled from a cupboard  while he was resting on a mat on the floor of the family home last December. On trial: Natalie McMillan, 25, from Burnley in Lancashire, pictured left, and Edward Hanratty, 41, right, appeared at Preston Crown Court to answer child cruelty charges . The court was told that Ms McMillan had been attempting to move the tv to plug in a scart lead so she could watch a DVD when it fell. Kian's father, Edward Hanratty, 41, was also under the influence of drugs at the time and had passed out on the kitchen floor earlier, the court was told. Suzanne Goddard QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution case is that Natalie McMillan was not in any fit state to look after a child. She had taken heroin and valium and an amount of alcohol. 'She chose to become intoxicated to the extent that she was not capable of caring for her child in a safe and appropriate manner.' Miss Goddard said the defendant was 'careless and drug-fuelled', and that no sober person would have failed to notice the dangerousness of a child's head lying so close to a heavy television. 'Her needs were more important than her child,' she said. 'The simple step of moving Kian would have saved his life. 'She showed careless indifference to the life of her child that night. 'This was not a tragic accident, every . parent's nightmare. This was an entirely preventable death. An accident . that should never have happened.' The . prosecution also said that Hanratty had a responsibility to Kian and . that he too was in no fit state to look after him and should have . ensured someone else did. McMillan, from Leeds, denies manslaughter by gross negligence and child cruelty. Hanratty, from Bradford, denies child cruelty. When the police inquiry started, it became clear that the defendants had had dealings with drug agencies and social services, the court heard. A history of drug abuse and relationship difficulties also soon emerged, said Ms Goddard. The pair had lived in Halifax until 2009 but McMillan ended the relationship and moved to Burnley to be closer to her family because she said Hanratty was violent and controlling. But their relationship was rekindled despite the disapproval of McMillan's family and he effectively moved in with her. The court was told that Ms McMillan, pictured, had been attempting to plug in a scart lead when the television fell . Hanratty had previously had two children removed from his care with a different partner because of his drug problems. As a consequence McMillan knew social services would be concerned and she attempted to hide the fact that he was living with her, the jury was told. She initially lied to social workers that he played a 'very little part' in her life and she was no longer abusing drugs. McMillan also concealed the relationship from health visitors. Ms Goddard added: 'The prosecution say that Natalie McMillan was clearly not being honest with healthcare and other professionals who were trying to assist her and Kian. 'She was hiding the full extent of her illicit drug use and her relationship with Edward Hanratty.' The court heard that the numerous professionals who visited the household were satisfied that Kian was healthy and being well cared for. When McMillan was interviewed by police, she told them it was an accident but she had not been using drugs at the time. Miss Goddard said the defendant was 'abusive and rude' at the custody desk when she was bailed on the night of December 6. 'Her priority seemed to be getting her cigarettes, having a shower and a change,' she said, 'rather than getting to her seriously-ill son as soon as possible.' She maintained in a second interview that she was the one who knocked the television over but in a defence statement served to the court she said it was Hanratty who dropped it and she was upstairs at the time. It was her position, said Ms Goddard, that she lied about the whole incident from the 999 call onwards at Hanratty's request. The prosecutor said that her defence 'does not hold close scrutiny' and that she was trying to shift the blame on to her co-defendant. 'What mother would be prepared to accept responsibility for the obviously serious injuries that would lead to her child's death,' she said. 'We say she told the truth about one thing - that she was responsible for moving and then dropping the television on Kian.' Hanratty told detectives he had taken two valium tablets and drunk three cans of strong lager on the night in question. He fell asleep on the kitchen floor and was woken up to be told by McMillan that she had dropped the television. The trial continues.

"By . Gerri Peev and John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 11:08 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:21 EST, 19 October 2012 . George Osborne was forced to hand over nearly £200 yesterday by a railway ticket inspector – after he sat in a first-class seat with a standard-class ticket. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was spotted on the express service from his constituency in Cheshire to London as he watched a DVD on a computer. Yesterday fellow passengers even claimed Mr Osborne had refused to leave the first-class carriage and sit with those in the cheaper seats. Going off the track: George Osborne on the train from Wilmslow to London - sitting pretty in First Class on a standard fare ticket . Instead, he agreed to foot the bill but dispatched his police protection officer to standard class while he stayed put with his assistant. The drama happened on the 3.11pm Virgin Trains service from Wilmslow, Cheshire, to London Euston and was revealed on Twitter by Rachel Townsend, a journalist with Granada TV. She tweeted: ‘Very interesting train journey to Euston Chancellor George Osborne just got on at Wilmslow with a STANDARD ticket and he has sat in FIRST CLASS. ‘His aide tells ticket collector he cannot possibly move and sit with the likes of us in standard class and requests he is allowed to remain in First Class. Ticket collector refuses.’ Reporter Rachel Townsend gave a running commentary on Twitter as the Chancellor tried to avoid paying for a First Class ticket . She later said Mr Osborne’s aide had approached the ticket collector to ask if Mr Osborne could remain in first class but the guard refused. She added: ‘The aide said Osborne couldn’t possibly sit in standard class.  The guard replied saying if he wants to stay, it’s £160. ‘The aide said he couldn’t pay and he couldn’t really sit in standard. The guard refused to budge. ‘The guard went on gathering tickets and later told me Osborne had agreed to cough up the £160.’ Her account was disputed by sources close to Mr Osborne, who insisted there was never any question of him not paying for the upgrade – and it came to £189.90 for the two tickets. As Mr Osborne’s train pulled in at Euston at just after 5pm an aide and two police officers went to the carriage door to accompany him off. Stopped in his tracks: Chancellor George Osborne is confronted by journalists as he leaves Manchester train at Euston station this afternoon . Under siege: Mr Osborne - worth an estimated £4.6m - faces fresh embarrassment after clashing with a ticket inspector who insisted he pay the full price to remain in the First Class carriage . Mr Osborne appeared surprised at the presence of journalists asking him why he had not sat in standard class as he left the train. He refused to answer questions and was quickly whisked to a service exit from the platform away from the public. All in it together: Chancellor George Osborne refused to sit in Standard Class, according to witnesses . Passengers said he had been watching a film with an aide and laughing loudly before he was challenged by the ticket inspector. Richard Warren, who works in advertising, was travelling in standard class but went into first class looking for the buffet and spotted Mr Osborne. He said: ‘He was watching a DVD on a laptop with a female aide. ‘It was obviously a comedy as they were laughing loudly. They were sharing the earphones and had one each.‘I only went down into first class because I was looking for the buffet and I spotted him. ‘I saw that he was watching a film and thought it was funny because of David Cameron’s nickname “DVD Dave”.’ A spokesman at Virgin Rail said: ‘The Chancellor caught the 15.11 train from Wilmslow. We did not know he would be on board. ‘An aide, believed to be a policeman or security officer, approached the train manager who was still going through the standard-class carriage. The policeman told the manager: “I have the Chancellor and a member of his staff in first-class, how much would it cost to upgrade?” ‘The train manager told him it would be around £200, to which the aide said, “That’s quite a lot, let me go back and check if it’s OK”. ‘He then came back and said he would pay the money, which came to £189.90 for two of them.’ A source close to Mr Osborne said: ‘The Chancellor got a different train than planned due to a diary change following a series of meetings in his constituency. ‘As he had no seat reservation on the new train which was crowded, he decided to upgrade – and obviously intended and was happy to pay. An aide sorted the ticket upgrade.’ Michael Dugher, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: ‘Another day, another demonstration of how out of touch this Government is. ‘Just like Andrew Mitchell, George Osborne obviously thinks it’s one rule for him and another for the plebs he’s so keen to sit apart from. ‘So much for “we’re all in it together”.’ MPs are not allowed to reclaim the costs of first-class tickets but taxpayers have to fund any standard-class rail travel. Last night, there was a suggestion that Mr Osborne may have tried to sit in first class with a standard ticket before. A tweet issued in May from a passenger on the Chancellor’s train said: ‘Ticket inspector on my train just got a high five: George Osborne tried to sit in 1st class with std tkt. ‘Inspector said NO.'","Millionaire MP 'argued with train staff' after refusing to leave First Class .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 12:21 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:18 EST, 24 May 2013 . Andrew Stone as he arrived at Hammersmith Magistrates Court today. He is accused of assaulting his 25-year-old girlfriend as she wouldn't listen to music with him . A reality TV star who worked with Britney Spears and Kylie Minogue punched and strangled his girlfriend in a vodka-fuelled rage. Dancer Andrew Stone, who has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother and Pineapple Dance Studios, kicked his girlfriend out of his bed, grabbed her by the throat and tried to choke her after she refused to stay up late and listen to music. Stone, 40, had drunk five double vodkas and coke at his flat in Marylebone, central London, when he attacked girlfriend Claudia Cersosimo in the early hours of January 30 this year. Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard how Miss Cersosimo, 25, was left so scared by the attack that the mere mention of Stone’s name causes an anxiety attack. Miss Cersosimo was ill with a viral infection and trying to sleep but Stone was playing loud music and kept badgering her to answer questions about the tracks he was playing. When the 25 year-old told him she just wanted to get to sleep Stone attacked her. Giving evidence from behind a screen, she told the court: 'He said if I didn’t answer him he would kick me out of the bed. Then he chucked me out of the bed and I span out. 'I don’t know how it happened because it was all so fast but he was somehow at my side wrestling me out of the bed. He used his leg, I think it must have taken two goes and then I landed on the floor. 'He wrestled me onto the bed and then he pinned me down and with his hand started strangling me so I couldn’t breathe. 'He was putting quite a lot of weight . down on me at the same time he pinned my arms down because I was trying . to push him off me. 'I was really scared at that point, I think I was just shouting ""Get off me, Get off me"".' Passing verdict at West London Magistrate's Court, Deputy District Judge Karim Ezzat said yesterday he found Miss Cersosimo a 'credible witness' and believed her version of events. He said: 'Having considered all of the evidence that I've heard and having regard to the photographic evidence I've seen I am satisfied that the injuries caused to Miss Cersosimo were caused in the manner she describes and I therefore find you guilty.' Looking downcast and surprised, Stone, 40, glanced back to his manager in the public gallery as the verdict was read out. Andrew Stone shot to fame in 2010's Pineapple Dance Studios with Louie Spence . Andrew Stone attacked his girlfriend because she refused to listen to music with him . Wearing a dark grey sparkly blazer, . black suit trousers and patent black leather shoes, Stone shook his head . as he listened to the evidence against him during the short trial. He claimed that Miss Cerosimo's injuries were self inflicted. Miss Cersosimo added that she screamed at Stone to get off her, but he lunged for her again and punched her. She said: 'As he came up he punched me in my right eye, I remember starting to scream and holding my right eye. Andrew Stone, who was on Celebrity Big Brother, denied attacking her, claiming that the injuries were self-inflicted . 'I remember getting down on the floor and crawling away from the bed. He came at me again and he was holding me by the collar of the T-shirt I was wearing. He was yanking my collar it left red marks round my neck.' Miss Cersosimo managed to kick Stone off her, and fled to the bathroom where she called the police on her mobile phone. But she didn’t lock the door and Stone followed her to the bathroom, kicked the door open and stood in the doorway blocking her way out. 'He was more calm, but he hadn’t acknowledged what he had just done, he just said ‘get off the phone’ he was really rude and abrupt. He was still aggressive in his tone,' she said.She managed to get to the front door where she tried to buzz the police in through the intercom but Stone twice hit the intercom phone out of her hand. She told the court: 'Then he got my clothes and bag and stuff and threw it by the door and that is when the police entered the property.' Following his arrest, he told police the couple had argued, and that she locked herself in the bathroom and inflicted the injuries on herself. ‘She always does that - making a big deal out of something small,’ he said. The 25-year-old met the reality TV star in a nightclub in Covent Garden, central London, a year earlier and had been dating for a few months. But the pair had a tempestuous relationship and Miss Cersosimo said she believed Stone was cheating on her. Defence counsel Tyrone Smith asked Miss Cersosimo: 'You believed he was having sex with other people.' She replied: 'Yes'. The dancer told police that he had drank four or five double vodkas that evening . Referring to a text message Miss Cersosimo has sent to Stone Mr Smith said: 'You name a girl and you believe she was smirking at you and you believe the defendant was texting her for sex.' Miss Cersosimo said: 'Yes, because I had seen the text messages. He kept telling me how he didn’t want to be sleeping with other girls anymore and telling me that he loved me, but the day (that text) was sent he was with her.' She told the court: 'I knew what he was like, that was effectively cheating on me.' Miss Cerosimo has struggled with a history of depression and self-harm and once fled to Stone’s bathroom with a kitchen knife. The dancer has a 30 years dance experience and has performed alongside Britney Spears (left) and Kylie Minogue (right) The case's prosecutor said that since the alleged attack she has been suffering from severe anxiety attacks. Jumoke Hughes said: 'Since this she has been having severe anxiety attacks. The mere mention of the defendant’s name or seeing the defendant causes her to have serious attacks.' He said Miss Cersosimo 'would like a restraining order' but the judge said this would be dealt with at sentencing and warned Stone that he faces a community service order as well. Stone declined to comment as he left court as he was released on bail and will be sentenced at West London Magistrate's Court on the morning of May 23. His agent said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome and we will be taking it further.' Stone denied common assault. Originally from Kettering in Northamptonshire, Stone boasts a CV featuring 30 years’ dance experience. He trained at the Central School of Ballet and has toured with stars including Kylie, Britney Spears, Tina Turner, and Ricky Martin. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Mr Terry Mills of Big Talent Group was Mr Andrew Stone’s agent. We are happy to make clear that this is not the case, nor did he make any comment in relation to this case.","Andrew Stone attacked girlfriend Claudia Cerosimo in January .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 07:15 EST, 28 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 29 April 2013 . Voters who back the UK Independence Party are racists and its politicians are clowns, Ken Clarke claimed yesterday. The veteran Tory Cabinet minister led attacks by all three main parties as he said UKIP is merely a protest party and those attracted to it are ‘waifs and strays’ who are simply ‘against’ foreigners and immigrants. Mr Clarke’s astonishing onslaught came as polls showed that Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic party has overtaken the Liberal Democrats and is set for its best local election results ever on Thursday, when 35 county councils and unitary authorities in England and one in Wales go to the polls. Attack: Cabinet minister Ken Clarke branded Ukip's politicians 'clowns' and some of their supporters racist . In a high-risk manoeuvre, Mr Clarke took . aim not just at UKIP leaders and their candidates, but also at voters . who are considering backing the party, many of whom are disillusioned . Tory supporters angry about David Cameron’s stance on immigration and . gay marriage. UKIP called the Conservative onslaught . a ‘morally reprehensible smear campaign’ last night – but the party has . also faced a series of damaging claims about the background of some of . its candidates. Asked whether he agreed with David . Cameron’s 2006 assessment that UKIP is packed with ‘fruitcakes and . closet racists’, Mr Clarke replied: ‘I have met people who satisfy both . those descriptions in UKIP. 'Indeed, some of the people who have assured . me they are going to vote UKIP I would put in that category. I rather . suspect they have never voted for me.' Email leak: Godfrey Bloom also complained that forging Ukip's policy platform is like 'herding cats', insisting senior figures needed to learn to toe the line . He said he was sure that ‘most of the . Ukip people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink’ but added: . ‘It is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant, . angry people, who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your . revenge on people who caused it.’ Mr Clarke dismissed UKIP as a protest . party, saying: ‘It is against the political parties, the political . classes, it’s against foreigners, it’s against immigrants but it doesn’t . have any very positive policies, they don’t know what they’re for.’ He criticised UKIP for putting up . candidates who have been exposed as former members of the racist British . National Party or the English Defence League, who have been kicked out . of the party in the past week. ‘They of course have not been able to . vet their candidates,’ he said. ‘Fringe right parties do tend to collect . a number of waifs and strays.’ Some of Mr Clarke’s comments echo . those of former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft, who said UKIP was for ‘none of . the above’ voters but privately Tory MPs voiced doubts whether Mr . Clarke, the most pro-European Tory, was the best person to make the case . against UKIP to Eurosceptic voters. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: . ‘It’s a bit rich of Ken Clarke to call UKIP clowns when he wanted us to . join the euro.’ In February, UKIP beat the Tories into . second place in the Eastleigh by-election and party strategists fear . they could take Tory seats on Thursday when they field 1,700 candidates. The Tories are defending more than 30 . councils and are widely expected to lose between 300 and 400 . councillors, while Labour are expected to pick up 300 and UKIP around . 50. The Liberal Democrats are expected to lose around 100. Discussions: In the recent exchange with Treasurer Stuart Wheeler (pictured), Mr Bloom cautioned that 'some quite senior party members are going to have to stable their hobby horses' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin . insisted the Tories have no reason to be worried about UKIP, because . Nigel Farage’s party ‘says different things to different people’. But election expert Professor John . Curtice of Strathclyde University said: ‘Some people are going from . Labour to UKIP and Lib Dem to UKIP but the biggest loss to UKIP is . suffered by the Tories. Lord Ashcroft has warned Prime Minister David Cameron that he faces defeat at the general election in two years’ time. The Tories’ biggest donor of the last decade put together a poll suggesting Labour will gain 109 seats at the 2015 election, including 93 from the Conservative Party. The predicted result by the former deputy chairman of the Conservatives would make Ed Miliband prime minister and give Labour a House of Commons majority of 84 seats. Lord Ashcroft told the Financial Times: ‘Even now, 16 years after they dismissed us from office, many people who would once have been natural supporters still do not think the party is on their side. ‘Mr Cameron faces the unenviable task of showing, at a time of austerity, that his party is not just for those who have already achieved material success, while holding on to Tory loyalists and luring back those threatening to defect to UKIP.’ ‘Polls show that 16 per cent of . Conservative voters in 2010 would vote for UKIP, while it’s 8 per cent . for the Lib Dems and 4 per cent for Labour. 'That’s an important part of . why the Tories are behind Labour in the polls.’ Lib Dem leader Nick . Clegg said  voters were only backing UKIP because they want to say ‘to . hell with mainstream politics’. Labour’s Hilary Benn said some of the party’s candidates appeared ‘pretty unappealing’. But UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall . accused the Tories of running a ‘morally reprehensible smear campaign’ against his party and boasted that their support is growing. He said: ‘We’re putting on over 100 . members a day at the moment. Membership is about 27,000 at the moment, . and we’re about 17 per cent in the polls, so I think all bets are off.’ Lord Ashcroft, who ran a poll on why . people backed UKIP at Eastleigh, said UKIP has simply cultivated voter . grievances. ‘My poll in Eastleigh found that more than four in five of . your voters there were protesting about something,’ he said. In an open letter to Mr Farage . yesterday, he said: ‘UKIP has gone from being an anti-EU movement to a . broader-based none-of-the-above party. The most successful . none-of-the-above party but a none-of-the-above party nonetheless.’","Cabinet minister Ken Clarke today brands Ukip party's politicians 'clowns'

The accident, in which the Prince was trapped under the snow for 25 minutes before he was pulled out unconscious, attracted considerable media attention at the time. His doctors said his brain was starved of oxygen while he was buried which resulted in a cardiac arrest that lasted 50 minutes. He was later flown to London for . treatment and doctors have previously said he suffered severe brain . damage and might never come out of a coma.

This is the incredible haul of luxury goods amassed by a secretary who stole £320,000 from her boss - including 32 pairs of designer shoes and Tiffany jewellery. Helen Hart, 46, from Illogan, Cornwall, blew the cash on a champagne lifestyle including expensive cars, diamonds and £8,000 hotel stays. She told her boss she had inherited the fortune from a gangland uncle who was friends with the Kray Twins. More than 30 pairs of shoes will form part of an online auction of designer items seized from fraudster Helen Hart . Gucci jewellery will start at just £1 in the auction which will take place on Monday . Brands of shoes include those from designers Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley . But in reality she was milking the . accounts at Cornish engineering firm PDP Green Consulting and left the . company facing an unpaid £271,000 tax bill in May 2011. Police spent the next year unravelling the trail of missing money before charging Hart with multiple counts of fraud, theft and deception. Helen Hart was jailed for four years for stealing £320,000 from the company where she worked . She . was jailed for four years earlier this month at Truro Crown Court after . previously admitting 25 separate charges spanning October 2005 to May . 2012. Now Devon and Cornwall Police are selling off items confiscated from Hart after her arrest. They include 32 pairs of designer shoes from Jimmy Choo, Prada, and Russell and Bromley, as well as lavish jewellery from the likes of Gucci, Harrods and Tiffany & Co. Many of the 71 items, which all have a starting price of £1, will be sold for a fraction of their high street price before the auction on the Bumblebee Auctions website finishes on Monday. A spokesman from Devon and Cornwall Police’s financial investigation unit at Truro said: 'Confiscation of assets is part of the sentencing process. Helen Hart lived an affluent lifestyle which included buying expensive items for her personal use. 'She should not be allowed to benefit from the proceeds of her crimes and this process helps that be the case. We work hard to ensure that the proceeds of crime are taken from criminals. 'Legislation means in certain cases we can go back six years to calculate what a person has earned from their illegal lifestyle.' Hart’s lavish spending included £5,990 for a return trip to Paris, £7,816 on a hotel stay in Devon and £4,752 on tickets and hospitality for a Premier League football match. She also spent £31,368 on renovation work at her home and £46,500 on a Mercedes along with buying a Porsche Boxster, Range Rover and a BMW X5. Hart bought jewellery from high-end retailers such as Gucci, Harrords and Tiffany & Co. Hart's thefts from PDP Green Consulting left the firm with a £271,000 tax bill . Guilty: Helen Hart, pictured left, admitted used money from the company owned by Philip Desmonde, pictured right with his wife Susanne, . A further £2,000 was spent on a kitchen, £4,985 on 48 bottles of fine wine and other sums frittered away on designer shopping sprees. She blew much of the money on seducing toyboy lovers including student Adam Cope, 20, whom she promised to buy a Lamborghini before being caught. Devon and Cornwall Police’s financial investigation unit has confiscated more than £350,000 since April last year. The spokesman added: 'We are proud that the confiscation amount either goes to the victim or, if there is no victim, then a proportion of the confiscation money goes back into the local community. We strive to ensure that crime does not pay.'","Brands of shoes include Gucci, Prada and Jimmy Choo .

A new flu virus identified in American harbour seals has the potential to pass to other mammals, including humans, say experts. The H3N8 strain was discovered after the death of 162 New England harbour seals last year. Post-mortem examinations of five of the animals showed they were killed by a flu infection. New threat: Flu killed more than 100 harbour seals in New England recently . The strain is closely related to one that has been circulating in North American birds since 2002. But unlike the bird strain, it has adapted to living in mammals. It has also evolved mutations known to ease transmission and cause more severe symptoms. Specifically, the virus has the ability to target proteins known as cytokines found in human lungs. This could cause the immune system to go into overdrive and attack itself, causing tissue damage. Dr Anne Moscona, from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, who led the researchers, said: 'There is a concern that we have a new mammalian-transmissible virus to which humans haven't been exposed yet. It's a combination we haven't seen in disease before.' The warning is published in the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, mBio. One cause for concern was the fact that few scientists had considered the possibility of a bird flu virus infecting seals, said the researchers. It highlighted the fact that pandemic influenza can appear in unexpected ways. 'Flu could emerge from anywhere and our readiness has to be much better than we previously realised,' said Dr Moscona. 'We need to be very nimble in our ability to identify and understand the potential risks posed by new viruses emerging from unexpected sources. 'It's important to realise that viruses can emerge through routes that we haven't considered. We need to be alert to those risks and ready to act on them.' As of January 2012, the World Health Organization has confirmed there have been 583 cases of H5N1 (avian flu) in humans leading to 344 deaths. There have been no human cases in the UK however the strain was found in a flock of turkeys in Suffolk in 2007 and in wild swans in Dorset in 2008.","The H3N8 strain was discovered after the death of 162 New England seals .

Chancellor George Osborne tours science laboratories being used to research the use of graphene, before announcing a £50m investment in the material. Its discoverers revealed another property of the substance today . A mysterious new property of graphene has been discovered by one of the British Nobel Prize-winning scientists who first created the 'wonder material.' Graphene is an ultra-thin sheet of carbon just one atom thick. In 2010, University of Manchester professors Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov won the physics Nobel prize for work that involved producing flakes of graphene using sticky tape. Both received knighthoods in the New Year Honours List. But it is also, the researchers have discovered, an incredible filter - it blocks all liquids and gases except water. 'Helium gas is hard to stop,' said . Sir Andre. 'It slowly leaks even through a millimetre-thick window glass . but our ultra-thin films completely block it. At the same time, water . evaporates through them unimpeded. Materials cannot behave any . stranger.' The research, reported today in the journal Science, . highlighted one immediate practical use for graphite oxide membranes - . distilling alcohol. 'Just for a laugh, we sealed a bottle . of vodka with our membranes and found that the distilled solution became . stronger and stronger with time,' said co-author Dr Rahul Nair. 'Neither of us drinks vodka but it was great fun to do the experiment.' Graphene is the thinnest material known and the strongest ever measured. It also conducts electricity and heat better than any other material. Potential applications include fold-away mobile phones, wallpaper-thin lighting panels, and the next generation of aircraft. Now a team led by Sir Andre has shown that graphene membranes shut out all gases and liquids except for water.As far as water alone is concerned, they are ""superpermeable"". Water evaporates through a graphite membrane so fast it is as if no barrier was there at all. The scientists studied membranes made from graphene oxide - graphene sheets peppered with other molecules. The sheets stack on top of each other to form strong, flexible laminates hundreds of times thinner than a human hair. A metal container sealed with a graphite oxide film prevented air or any other gas, including helium, to leak out. But the researchers were surprised to find that it was no obstacle to water molecules. Sir Andre added: 'The properties are so unusual that it is hard to imagine that they cannot find some use in the design of filtration, separation or barrier membranes and for selective removal of water.'","Sheet of carbon atoms blocks all gases and fluids except water .

Wal-Mart and the Gap have not. But many in the government, the industry and the rescue workers said they would not be shocked if another terrible tragedy happened. Bangladeshi garment factories are routinely built without consulting engineers. Many are located in commercial or residential buildings not designed to withstand the stress of heavy manufacturing. Some add illegal extra floors atop support columns too weak to hold them, according to a survey of scores of factories by an engineering university that was shown to The Associated Press. Focus: A series of deadly incidents at factories in Bangladesh, including the collapse of a building last month that killed more than 1,000 people, has focused global attention on safety in factories in Asia . Horrors: A survivor is lifted out of the rubble by rescuers at the site in April . A separate inspection, by the garment industry, of 200 risky factories found that 10 percent of them were so dangerous that they were ordered to shut. The textiles minister said a third inspection, conducted by the government, could show that as many as 300 factories were unsafe. Taken together, the findings offer the first broad look at just how unsafe the working conditions are for the garment workers who produce clothing for major western brands. And it's more bad news for the $20 billion industry that has been struggling to regain the confidence of Western retailers and consumers following a November fire at the Tazreen Fashions Ltd. factory that killed 112 people and the April collapse of the Rana Plaza building. But the proliferation of inspections could signal the industry is finally taking its workers' safety seriously. Rana Plaza was 'a wakeup call for everybody 'to ensure their buildings were structurally sound, said Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. 'Earlier it was not in our minds. We never, ever thought of this,' he said. But Rana Plaza wasn't the first . factory building to collapse in Bangladesh.

Incident: David Chandler, left, identified 35-year-old Ricardo Woods (right), who has now been found guilty of murdering Chandler . Eye contact: Shooting victim David Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times, opening them wide in between each blink, after he was shown a picture of Ricardo Woods and asked if he was his attacker . Chandler died a fortnight after the police interview. The defense had tried to block the video, saying Chandler's blinks were inconsistent and unreliable.Woods, who insists he is innocent, stood stoically before a Hamilton County judge on Thursday and showed no visible emotion as she sentenced him. Judge Beth Myers said the sentence she gave him was 'necessary to protect the public and punish Mr. Woods'.Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 37 years to life, the maximum, while the defense had asked the judge for the minimum, 18 years to life.Assistant county Prosecutor David Prem told the judge prior to sentencing that Woods' previous criminal history, including prison terms for attempting to kill someone and drug trafficking, should be taken into account.'He is a dangerous and violent offender,' Prem said, adding that it was time for the Chandler family and the state of Ohio to get justice.Defense attorney Kory Jackson told the judge that Woods has 'always maintained that he is not guilty and still maintains that today'.Woods nodded yes when the judge said she understood that he planned to appeal. During the case prosecutors showed jurors a videotaped police interview in which they . say Chandler blinked three times for 'yes' to identify a photo of Woods . as his shooter. The defense had tried to block the video, saying . Chandler's blinks were inconsistent and unreliable. Woods' attorney, Kory Jackson, said Chandler's condition and drugs . used to treat him could have affected his ability to understand and . respond during the police interview. Judge Beth Myers had watched the video and said that she found the . identification reliable. She noted that Chandler's identification was . made by pronounced, exaggerated movement of the eyes and not by . involuntary movements. A doctor who treated Chandler also testified that . Chandler was able to communicate clearly about his condition. Back to prison: Ricardo Woods is shown being taken from court after he was found guilty . In the video, police had to repeat some questions when Chandler . failed to respond or when the number of times he blinked appeared . unclear. But Chandler blinked his eyes hard three times when police . asked him if the photo of Woods was the photo of his shooter. He again . blinked three times when they asked him if he was sure. A jailhouse informant testified that Woods told him he shot at . Chandler because he caught him buying drugs from someone else while . still owing Woods money for drugs. The defense argued that the informant, who faced armed robbery . charges, was trying to use testimony against Woods to get a lighter . sentence for himself. The defense also said Chandler had stolen drugs . from dealers, was considered a police ""snitch"" and had many enemies. Defense: Woods had pleaded not guilty in the crime. He is seen reacting as his conviction was read . The defense insisted that Woods was a victim of misidentification and misinformation. Legal experts say such cases — where prosecutors attempt to show a . defendant was identified by a gesture — are not unheard of but are . unusual. Dying identifications relying on gestures rather than words are . often not used in trials because of concern over reliability or . differing interpretations. But some have been used in murder cases . around the country that have ended in convictions. Captivated jurors in a Cincinnati . murder trial watched video Tuesday that prosecutors say shows a dying, . paralyzed shooting victim who couldn't speak identifying a photo of his . killer by blinking his eyes.

Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Barcelona, will appear before a judge on September 17. The four-time World Player of . the Year has been accused of defrauding £3.4million through false income tax returns in Spain. The state prosecutor has taken action against the footballer and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi. Both are accused of three offences against the public purse for allegedly defrauding millions on income tax returns for 2007, 2008 and 2009. The complaint, signed by prosecutor Raquel Amado, was previously submitted for trial at the court in Gava, the upmarket Barcelona suburb where the Argentina forward lives. A judge must accept the prosecutor's lawsuit before charges can be brought against Messi and his father. The footballing star released a statement denying any wrongdoing once the allegations emerged. Reports emerged last week alleging the four-time reigning World Player of the Year and his father, Jorge Horacio, were suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2007 and 2009. The 25-year-old swiftly insisted he had done nothing wrong in a statement on his official Facebook page. It read: 'We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities. 'We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement.

Crowds of spectators have been gathering every day to watch as Wallenda and his team practice for  his 1,200ft walk without tethers or safety nets about 1,500ft above the Little Colorado River on Sunday.

At a height higher than the Empire State Building, the walk . will be the highest tightrope attempt ever for the 34-year-old. For two weeks, the holder of a half-dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of Niagara Falls, has . been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet. The stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous Flying Wallenda acrobat family is scheduled to be . shown live on the Discovery Channel on June 23. Wallenda and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the Grand Canyon. Trying conditions: Wallenda and his team use giant fans to recreate the wind speeds he is likely to encounter . One step at a time: The wire cable will stretch 1,200ft across part of the Grand Canyon . Preparations: Nik Wallenda walks on a practice wire with the Grand Canyon as his back drop, as he trains for the stunt . Although the . humid Florida heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting, the unpredictable winds that whip through the Grand Canyon have been challenging. To try to get a feel for dealing with them, Wallenda practiced walking on his wire cable as Tropical Storm Andrea battered the Gulf Coast. His team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as Wallenda walked on his hire wire. 'I'm . not scared of them,' he told the Santa Cruz Sentinel, as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him. Top of the world: Nik Wallenda walks on top of the ferris wheel at Santa Cruz broadwalk in 2011 . Dream: The member of the Flying Wallenda act achieved his childhood wish of crossing Niagara Falls last year . Stunt: Nik Wallenda crosses a wire to entertain crowds at the Nascar spring cup series in North Carolina . 'I have to respect it, but I would never do what I do if I . was scared,' he said. Wallenda, who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the Grand Canyon for years, says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking. 'Once I get on that wire I get very peaceful ...  I look down and look at my surroundings, I hear crowds, I hear people in the audience.' Since his first wire walk at the age of four, Wallenda he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole. His first experience on a wire came before he was even born, when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant. In the final moments before starting one of his walks, he prays, then hugs his wife and three children, telling them he will see them in a few minutes. 'The first couple of steps are the hardest, so there's a lot of anticipation,' Wallenda, who proposed to his wife Erendira as they performed 30ft above crowds in Montreal, Canada, said. Legend: Karl Wallenda, Nik's great grandfather and source of inspiration, crosses the Tallulah Gorge in 1970 . Family act: Nik Wallenda and his sister Lijana learned to sky walk from a young age . He added: 'The hard part about doing live TV is waiting till the director says go.' The wire walker, who has written about his feats in his book Balance, uses a specially made cable, more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats. His balance pole, which weights 43lb, is a vital piece of equipment, increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground. Despite his positive thinking and training however, Wallenda is well aware of the dangers of the stunt. His great-grandfather and legendary sky walker, Karl Wallenda, fell to his death at the age of 73, during a hire wire walk in Puerto Rico in 1978. The legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for Wallenda, who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four. His grandfather's belief that 'Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,' has stayed with Wallenda since childhood, and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats. Focused: Nik Wallenda says when he steps on the wire he feels calm and relaxed - even over a 1,300ft drop . The televised sky walk over Niagara last year was watched by more than 13 million Americans on ABC. However, the safety clause in the network's contract meant Wallenda had to wear a harness. 'It was my dream to walk over Niagara Falls since I was about 5 or 6 years old, but part of that dream was taken away because I had to wear that harness,' he said. 'The exciting thing about this event is that I will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever.' Discovery will be filming the live stunt on Sunday in a remote section of the Grand Canyon national park, which is run by the Navajo Nation.","Nik Wallenda will perform daredevil high wire walk live on television .

'I want to go home': Dame Helen Mirren still fantasises about 'walking on the wild side', but is simply 'too tired' to become a rebel again . She has famously portrayed the Queen twice, on screen and on the stage, to great acclaim. But there is one role that Dame Helen Mirren won’t be reprising, no matter how much she would love to – that of rebellious wild child. The 67-year-old star has revealed that she still fantasises about ‘walking on the wild side’, but is simply ‘too tired’ to become a rebel again. She said: ‘I was always rather attracted by a walk on the wild side when I was younger: I think that I’d love to still walk on the wild side, but I’m just too tired. I want to go home, I want to be in bed by 10.30pm. ‘But I guess to a certain extent I’m still sort of attracted by it.’ In 2008 she hinted at her rebellious past after revealing that she used to take cocaine when she was a rising star. She claims she stopped taking it in the early 1980s after realising that a fugitive Nazi war criminal had lived off the proceeds of the drug. And she recently admitted she was ‘very, very drunk’ when she got a tattoo on her hand as a young woman, adding that she got the body art because she wanted to cause controversy. Dame Helen courted notoriety in her early career with a string of nude roles in movies such as Caligula and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover. She disrobed again in the 2002 movie Calendar Girls and two years ago she posed topless for a magazine to publicise her role as a brothel madam in the film Love Ranch. In an accompanying interview for New York magazine, she declared: ‘I’m still the good girl who wants to be a bad girl.’ Despite her apparent rebellious streak she has been afforded national treasure status, thanks to her roles as DCI Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect and Elizabeth II in 2006 film The Queen. Her talents have seen her win  one Oscar, four Baftas, three Golden Globes, four Emmy Awards and two Cannes Film Festival best actress awards.

Please, make it very clear”. ‘I do get terribly upset when I see films where people are just randomly shot.

Kim Freshwater, 44, celebrated slimming from a huge size 38 to a slender 12 by completing the dare-devil stunt at Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower. The abseil brought an end to a 30 year battle with her weight. Mrs Freshwater, a mother-of-three, wore size 16 clothes while she was still a primary school pupil at the age of 11. Kim, 44, celebrated slimming from size 38 to a slender 12 by completing the daredevil stunt . After Kim's father passed away while she was a teenager she put on more and more weight as she turned to food for comfort. This contributed to high blood pressure, breathing problems and severe back pain. She ended up needing to walk with a stick as an adult, unable to stand to cook, iron or do the washing up and even climbing stairs on all fours for ease. Kim finally resolved to lose weight when her huge size prevented her attending her uncle's funeral. She was unable to walk from the church to the graveside due to her large large size and lack of fitness. Mrs Freshwater, from Havant, Hants, sought the help of her doctor who prescribed her 12 weeks of vouchers for a slimming club. It changed her life and two years on Kim has lost 16st - more than half her body weight. Kim struggled to climb the stairs at 29 stone before losing more than half her body weight . She said: 'After my uncle's funeral, I felt I'd let my family down because I wasn't there to support them and I was so upset I couldn't sleep. 'I went downstairs to watch television and there was a programme on about obese funerals. 'It showed how obese people need special coffins and how difficult it is to cremate their bodies. 'It was as if someone was trying to tell me something. I didn't ever want to put my family through that.' She added: 'When my dad died my eating became out of control. 'He'd always been my best friend and I suppose I used food to fill the hole he left. 'As I got older, people would always say how pretty I'd be if I lost weight and I did try, but the diets I did were only ever quick fixes - I'd regain all the weight I lost as soon as I stopped.' It was a hard job, but with the support of husband Lee, 53, and children Emma, 17, Daniel, 16, and Matthew, 14, Kim changed her eating habits from one large meal a day to three healthy homemade meals. In the first 12 weeks she lost 3st 2lb. With her new-found confidence and . fitness Kim abseiled down the side of the Tower, with her family and . slimming club friends cheering her on. She now plays tennis, swims, and walks miles indulging her hobby of photography. She has even started cycling again after last hanging up her helmet 20 years ago. Kim said: 'It's remarkable how much more I can do since losing weight. The Portsmouth abseil brought an end to a 30 year battle with her weight . 'I feel like I've got my life back. I used to walk with my head down and try to blend into the background. Now I'm living life to the full. 'I'm taking part in days out and activities with my family instead of watching them have fun without me and there's so much I want to do. 'I feel like the world is my oyster now and I am going to grab every opportunity with both hands.

One of the country's most notorious financial scandals came to a protracted legal conclusion today as ex-Enron Corp. CEO Jeffrey Skilling was re-sentenced to 14 years. Skilling is already in prison in Houston, Texas, for his role in the once-mighty energy giant's collapse but had his sentence reduced by ten years as part of a court-ordered reduction and a separate agreement with prosecutors. Skilling has been in prison since 2006, when he was sentenced to more than 24 years by U.S. District Judge Sim Lake. Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling arrives at the Bob Casey Federal Courthouse in his prison uniform for a re-sentencing hearing in Houston, Texas . But an appeals court vacated his prison term in 2009, ruling that a sentencing guideline was improperly applied. That meant a reduction of as much as nine years. However, Skilling's re-sentencing was delayed for years as he unsuccessfully sought to overturn his convictions, including appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. Skilling declined to make statements during the re-sentencing hearing. The Justice Department said that in an effort to resolve a case that's gone on for more than 10 years, it agreed to an additional reduction of about 20 months as part of a deal to stop Skilling from filing any more appeals. Federal prosecutors say the deal will allow for the distribution of $41.8 million of Skilling's assets in restitution to victims of Enron's 2001 collapse. Even with the reduced sentence, Skilling's prison term is still the longest of those involved in the Enron scandal. Skilling (right)has been in prison since 2006 in Houston, Texas, when he was sentenced to more than 24 years by U.S. District Judge Sim Lake (pictured at Federal Courthouse for a re-sentencing hearing) He was the highest-ranking executive . to be punished. Enron founder Kenneth Lay's similar convictions were . vacated after he died of heart disease less than two months after his . trial. Skilling, . 59, was convicted in 2006 on 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, . insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in the downfall of . Houston-based Enron. The company, once the seventh-largest in the U.S., went bankrupt under the weight of years of illicit business deals and accounting tricks. A one-time visionary, Skilling was vilified by many former Enron employees for denying any wrongdoing. Former Enron worker Diana Peters, the only victim who spoke at the re-sentencing hearing, said employees gave their hard work, spirit and trust to Skilling and others at Enron. 'Jeff Skilling betrayed that trust to those employees and played a part in the financial collapse of an amazing company,' Peters said. Jeffrey Skilling pictured in 2006, when he was sentenced to 24 years in prison in Houston, Texas, for 19 counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, insider trading and lying to auditors for his role in the downfall of Enron . The U.S. Supreme Court said in 2010 that one of Skilling's convictions was flawed when it sharply curtailed the use of the 'honest services' fraud law - a short addendum to the federal mail and wire fraud statute that makes it illegal to scheme to deprive investors of 'the intangible right to honest services.' The high court ruled that prosecutors can use the law only in cases where evidence shows the defendant accepted bribes or kickbacks, and because Skilling's misconduct entailed no such things, he did not conspire to commit honest services fraud. The Supreme Court told a lower court to decide whether he deserved a new trial; the lower court said no. Enron's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work, wiped out more than $2 billion in employee pensions and rendered worthless $60 billion in Enron stock. Its aftershocks were felt across the city and the U.S. energy industry.","Jeffrey Skilling has been in prison in Houston, Texas, since 2006 and was sentenced to 24 years .

'Diabolical catastrophe': Ten Tory MPs are calling for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to quit for presiding over the scandal at Stafford Hospital . Ten Tory MPs are calling for NHS chief Sir David Nicholson to quit for presiding over the ‘diabolical catastrophe’ at Stafford Hospital. Charlotte Leslie, MP for Bristol North West, has drawn up a Commons Early Day Motion calling for him to ‘face consequences’ for the scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly. Two other MPs compared the scandal to the cover-up over the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy, suggesting that officials and former ministers may have known more about the appalling abuse and still have questions to answer. The growing clamour in Parliament for Sir David to fall on his sword increases the pressure on David Cameron, who repeated yesterday that he had his full backing and is ‘doing a very good job’. However, Miss Leslie attacked the ‘thunderous silence around the NHS...which goes well beyond Stafford’. She called for Sir David, former health secretaries and other officials to reveal what they knew about high mortality rates and whistleblowers, and said that NHS failures could be widespread. Fourteen more trusts are being investigated over 7,000 deaths from 2006 to 2010, according to figures released by the Conservatives. Miss Leslie said that up to 2,800 of those people ‘should have been saved’ because they died after 2008 after the horrors at Mid Staffordshire had been exposed. The MPs are calling for Sir David to resign as chief executive of the NHS because of his previous role as head of the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which managed Mid Staffordshire hospitals but failed to spot the abuse. A Tory source said Sir David was a ‘dead man walking’, but believed that he was being kept on to oversee crucial NHS reforms as 200 commissioning boards take control of budgets on April 1. Miss Leslie said: ‘There has been a thunderous silence around the NHS and the Mid Staffs scandal and relatives of those who died needlessly have been screaming into a vacuum for those in positions of authority who were responsible to be held to account. Talking about accountability is meaningless if no action is taken. We are calling for a proper investigation into who else knew what and when, from managers to former officials and former ministers, and for them to be held accountable. 'Dead man walking': Charlotte Leslie (right), MP for Bristol North West, has drawn up a Commons Early Day Motion calling for him to 'face consequences' for the scandal in which up to 1,200 patients died needlessly which is backed by MPs including Andrew Bridgen (left) who said there was a 'culture of secrecy and cover up' 'Thunderous silence around the NHS': Miss Leslie called for Sir David, former health secretaries and other officials to reveal what they knew about high mortality rates and whistleblowers at Mid Staffordshire hospitals . ‘David Nicholson was then overall in charge of Mid Staffs. In no other walk of life would a man who had overseen such a diabolical catastrophe keep his job.’ Two recent polls have shown that nine out of 10 NHS staff believe he should quit his £270,000-a-year post. Last night, the ten MPs who backed calls for Sir David’s resignation included Andrew Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, who told the Mail earlier this week that Sir David should resign for overseeing a ‘culture of secrecy and cover up that cost many people their lives’. One of Mr Bridgen’s constituents, John Moore-Robinson, 20, was taken to Stafford Hospital with a ruptured spleen after a motorbike accident, but was diagnosed with fractured ribs and sent home with painkillers. He bled to death hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire in April 2006. Dr Sarah Wollaston, MP for Totnes and a former GP, said: ‘I find it extraordinary that more than a thousand people died at an NHS hospital and no one takes the rap. Comparing cover-ups: Two MPs compared the scandal to the cover-up over the 1989 Hillsborough football tragedy, suggesting officials and former ministers may have known more about the appalling abuse and still have questions to answer . ‘If a thousand people died in a prison or at the hands of the police it would be unthinkable for someone not to stand down.’ Chris Skidmore, who will question Sir . David at the health select committee next month, said: ‘If I was in his . position, I would go. ‘I . find it very difficult to believe someone whose hand was at the tiller . was ignorant of what was happening at Mid Staffs. It is comparable to . Hillsborough – this is 1,200 patients dying in their own urine and . faeces and having to drink water from flowerpots, it is horrendous on an . epic scale. ‘It is . culpability or ignorance and if he didn’t know he should have done, so . it creates serious doubts about his fitness to continue and drive . forward the changes needed in the NHS.’ Labour’s . health spokesman Andy Burnham, who was health secretary at the time of . the scandal, yesterday claimed that despite the Stafford Hospital . failings, the NHS had got ‘much better’ under Sir David’s watch. Steve . Barclay, MP for North East Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Andy Burnham . commendably led Parliament in calling for the full truth about . Hillsborough, because we had official reports which did not give . families the justice they demanded, and it took Parliament many years to . get to the truth. ‘Families shouldn’t have to wait years for the full truth about Stafford to come out. It absolutely beggars belief that some hospitals were given foundation trust status with high mortality rates and ministers were never told.’ Last night, MPs Charlotte Leslie, Andrew Bridgen, Nick de Bois, Mark Field, Kate Hoey and Nicholas Soames said they had signed the motion, while another four spoke to the Mail expressing their support for it. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘David Cameron understands the strength of feeling from the families and relatives of those who suffered at Mid Staffs. Sir David did the right thing in apologising for the period he was in charge of the Strategic Health Authority. He is doing a very good job.’","Charlotte Leslie drew up a motion calling for him to 'face consequences'

Firm: David Cameron, pictured in Afghanistan yesterday, has banned all ministers from their chauffeur-driven cars but the diktat has not been received well . Ministers have been ordered to ditch their chauffeur-driven cars and use public transport to travel to the Olympics. The Prime Minister, who insists he will catch the Tube to London 2012 events, has also told every minister they must not take their family to events, even if they paid for the tickets themselves. According to a source, they must invite dignitaries and other important guests instead, to ensure the public don’t think they are abusing their positions. Earlier this week Mr Cameron confirmed he would go to Olympic events on public transport and expected everyone to follow suit. But furious MPs have said they would rather watch the Games on TV than cram onto the underground or buses, which would leave them too grumpy to schmooze their guests. But the diktats have angered many, who feel that it will give off a bad impression. 'This has caused a lot of ill-feeling and frankly some of us would rather not be going to anything at all,' one senior minister told the Independent. 'The . rules are unbelievably draconian. We've basically been told we're on . our own and have to look after our guests with no official support and . we'll have to go by Tube as well. 'I know they're worried about . how it will look if we're seen to get special treatment but at the end . of the day we're supposed to be representing the Government. I'd rather . be sitting at home watching it on television.' While touring Afghanistan yesterday Mr Cameron confirmed he would be going to events on public transport and so should everybody else. Told: Instead David Cameron and his colleagues will have to cram onto the tube 'like everybody else' The Olympic flag was this morning flying on top of 10 Downing Street . 'I will be using public transport and . that is how I recommend [everyone] should travel'.' he said. 'I now use . the Tube, I drive my protection team mad in London by saying why on . earth are we in the car, the Tube is quicker. When asked about whether he would use the 'ZiL' lanes, named after the limousines used in Soviet Russia at the height of Communism, he said: 'We are banished from using that terminology. 'I went in a Games lane, but it was not acting as a Games lane when I came back from Chequers on Sunday. We were happily driving on it because everyone else was driving on it.' And Downing Street confirmed that almost without exception politicians will not go by car. 'All ministers will be expected to travel to the Games like everybody else,' a No. 10 spokesman told MailOnline this morning. 'There will be some limited circumstances when this might be waived but as a general rule that is what they have been told.' Last . week it was revealed that at least 60 ministers and senior MPs has been . told to report for duty during the Games and accompany VIPs to events. David Cameron alone will be taking executives from Google, Citigroup and Cisco Systems.

It came as an extra 1,200 troops were put on standby to protect the Olympics as the fallout continues from the G4S fiasco.

Ed Balls has threatened to quit the Shadow Cabinet if he is replaced as Shadow Chancellor by David Miliband, it was claimed yesterday. Mr Balls fired his warning shot after Ed Miliband yesterday revealed the 'door is open' to his brother returning to frontline politics – and refused to say that he has guaranteed the Treasury job to Mr Balls. A day earlier, David used a Commons speech on welfare to say Labour should accept the Government's spending plans – which Mr Balls has so far refused to do. Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) has said the door is open for his brother David to return to the Labour frontbench, more than two years after beating him to the party's top job . Some of Ed Miliband's allies want him . to replace Mr Balls because the latter is too closely associated with . the profligate spending under the last government. The Labour leader has twice offered . the shadow chancellorship to his brother, who stood down from the . frontbench when his sibling beat him to the leadership in 2010. If David cannot be coaxed back, many would like to see the job go to former Chancellor Alistair Darling. But friends of Mr Balls said yesterday . he would return to the backbenches rather than take any other post – an . ultimatum that threatens a return to the divisive Labour wars of the . Blair-Brown years. The left-wing New Statesman magazine . reported: 'Both Eds insist there's no deal to keep Balls in the Treasury . brief, yet Miliband would face a revolt by MPs if he offered the post a . third time to his big brother, David. Allies of the Shadow Chancellor . whisper that he'd take his bat and balls away and retire to the . backbenches rather than swallow demotion.' Relations between the Milibands were badly damaged when the younger brother triumphed in the Labour leadership in September 2010 . The piece was written by the hugely . experienced journalist Kevin Maguire, who has been close to the . Brown-Balls camp for two decades. Mr Balls' aides dismissed the claims about an ultimatum as 'rubbish'. But evidence is growing the Labour . leadership is keen to accommodate David Miliband on the front bench. And Ed Miliband yesterday said the rift in their relationship was . healed, adding: 'I wouldn't take it as indication about a change in his . view he's not coming back to the shadow cabinet, but the door is open.' Asked if Mr Balls was guaranteed to . keep the Shadow Chancellor's post up to the election, Mr Miliband said: . 'I think Ed Balls is doing a great job but I am not going to get into . that [naming your Cabinet two and a half years before the election].' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has been told his job is not guaranteed until 2015 . But according to reports Mr Balls would refuse to move to another job. 'Both Eds insist that there’s no deal to keep Balls in the Treasury brief, yet Miliband would face a revolt by MPs if he offered the post a third time to his big brother, David,' the left-leaning New Statesman reported. 'Allies of the shadow chancellor whisper that he’d take his bat and balls away and retire to the back benches rather than swallow demotion to another portfolio.' An aide to Mr Balls dismissed the suggestion as 'total rubbish'. David Miliband gave a bullish speech in the Commons yesterday, where he attacked the government’s plans to cap benefits rises at one per cent. But in a sharp departure from Labour policy he appeared to accept the coalition’s overall spending plans in full. ‘The Government themselves have projected the total cost of all benefits, all tax credits and all tax relief for the next few years, and I am happy to debate priorities within that envelope,’ he said. ‘I will take the envelope that they have set, but let us have a proper debate about choices, not the total sum—a priorities debate, not an affordability debate.’ But in an apparent slip, he also revealed his shortcomings in maths which could hamper his chances of becoming shadow chancellor, when he told Tory MP David Davies: ‘I do not want to give the you a maths lesson - I did not get good marks in maths - but percentages are percentages.’ Ed Miliband’s first shadow chancellor Alan Johnson never recovered after joking that his first job was to ‘pick up a primer in economics for beginners’. Labour deputy chairman Tom Watson has revealed the party believes a 60-seat Commons majority in 2015 was now 'realistic'. The shadow cabinet approved his strategy to concentrate on 106 key marginal . constituencies. It is to concentrate funds on training US-style community organisers and . using social media in target areas in a bid to emulate Barack Obama's . electoral success in the US. However, it suggests Mr Miliband;s hopes of becoming PM depend on gains in Midlands and the North, with just nine seats targeted in the South East. Meanwhile David Cameron briefed Tory MPs last night that the party would focus on winning 40 seats from Labour and the Lib Dems and shoring up support in 40 of its most marginal seats.","Labour leader Ed clears the way for comeback for brother David .

At least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by Lord Rennard . Liberal Democrat women activists were on the verge of open revolt last night over the party’s response to the Lord Rennard scandal. On another bruising day for Nick Clegg, representatives of those allegedly molested by the former chief executive called in the police to investigate whether criminal acts had taken place. And they reacted with fury to a suggestion by Mr Clegg’s biographer, Jasper Gerard, that the affair had been ‘blown out of all proportion’ and was ‘no Jimmy Savile’. In addition, Lib Dem peer Tony . Greaves made an astonishing attempt to defend Lord Rennard by describing . the complaints as ‘mild sexual advances’ and saying ‘half of the House . of Lords’ had probably behaved in a similar way. Today Mr Clegg appeared to criticise journalists who had uncovered the claims, branding them 'self-appointed detectives'. With mounting speculation about the threat the scandal could pose to his leadership, he also refused to give a 'running commentary' on events 'which happened many years ago. Leaving his south-London home this morning, Mr Clegg said: 'I understand there are many people who appear to want to act as self-appointed detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years ago. 'But the only way that we are going to get to the bottom of the truth, the only way we are going to ensure that the women whose allegations were broadcast on television last week are properly listened to, the only way were are going to establish exactly what happened and who knew what and when, is by allowing the two investigations that I established immediately after the Channel 4 broadcast to do their job and, indeed, to allow the police, whom we have now approached, to do their job as well. 'And in the meantime I cannot and my party cannot provide a running commentary on every shred of speculation about events which happened many years ago.' One alleged victim, former party activist Alison Smith, said she had gone public with her claims because Lord Rennard appeared to be back on the scene and involved in party ‘away days’ and weekends. Last night, as party leader Mr Clegg insisted ‘no very specific allegations had been put to him’, it emerged that: . At least ten women are now thought to . have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by Lord . Rennard, who was one of Lib Dems’ most influential figures until his . retirement in 2009. He has categorically denied the allegations. But . speaking to the BBC, Mr Gerard, who is standing for Parliament as a Lib . Dem in Kent, claimed the scandal engulfing Lord Rennard was ‘blown out . of all proportion’. Nick Clegg (left) insisted 'no specific allegations had been put to him' and his biographer Jasper Gerard suggested that the affair had been 'blown out of all proportion' and was no 'Jimmy Savile' Mr Gerard said the party’s former elections chief was accused of a ‘clumsy pass’ several years ago and said critics ‘need to keep some degree of perspective’. Last night Miss Smith called for him to be dropped as candidate for the marginal seat of Maidstone and the Weald. Yesterday a senior female Lib Dem peer said the party’s ‘male-dominated’ culture had helped engender the crisis and said she believed ‘quite a few’ more women would ‘come out of the woodwork’. Alleged victim Alison Smith has said she decided to go public because Lord Rennard appeared back on the scene . Baroness Hussein-Ece said: ‘There aren’t sufficient checks and balances in place; there isn’t a sufficient number of high-ranking women in place to curb some of this behaviour. 'What’s liberal about only 13 per cent of our parliamentary party being women? ‘It’s . a bit like the (Jimmy) Savile situation: I think more women – and I . have heard of quite a few – will come out of the woodwork. These matters . must be turned over to police,' she told Huffington Post UK. Labour’s . deputy leader, Harriet Harman told ITV’s The Agenda that women would be . more confident in telling groping men to ‘shove off’ if their . organisations were not as male-dominated. She . said: ‘If you’re in a team with somebody on equal terms and some man . tries to grope you and you’re on equal terms and you don’t depend on him . for your job, you can just say “shove off”. ‘But if you’re right down the pecking order, you fear for your job if you actually say “get your filthy hand off me”.’ According to Channel 4 News, a Lib . Dem acting as an ‘intermediary’ for several alleged victims of sexual . impropriety by Lord Rennard contacted police. Superintendent Kate Halpin . has been asked to look at the allegations. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘The Metropolitan Police Special Investigations Command has been approached by officials in the Liberal Democrat Party and is working with them to ascertain whether or not criminal activity has taken place.’","Nick Clegg attacks journalists who revealed a decade of claims against Lord Rennard as 'self-appointed detectives'

Ariel Castro, who is accused of imprisoning three women in his home for a decade, allegedly beat his former wife so badly that she suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs and a blood clot on the brain. Grimilda 'Nilda' Figueroa was also left with  a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders from the domestic abuse, according to a 2005 court filing against her former husband. The documents also claim that Castro 'frequently abducts his daughters and keeps them from mother' - although it is not certain whether this occurred before or after he allegedly snatched Michelle Knight, then 21, Amanda Berry, then 16, and Gina DeJesus, then 14, from the streets. The filing asked the court to . pass a protection order banning Castro from contacting Figueroa or their . children and from harassing them. 'Abuse': Ariel Castro, left, who has been arrested for allegedly imprisoning three missing girls for ten years, was physically abusive towards his former wife, Nilda Figueroa, right, court documents have revealed . It requested that a judge 'keep [Castro] from threatening to kill [Figueroa]', The Plain Dealer reported, claiming that he had threatened to kill her three or four times already that year. Figueroa's brother, Jose, told RadarOnline that he believes Castro's treatment of his former wife caused her to die. She passed away in April last year. 'I believe he murdered my sister,' he said. 'He abused her for years. She had multiple instances of serious head trauma and it created a brain tumor in her head.' Of the treatment, Jose added: 'My sister was in hell living with him. She was trapped there and there was nothing we could do. She was afraid of him.' Beaten: Grimilda Figueroa, pictured in a family photo, allegedly suffered broken noses, teeth and ribs . Police records show that Castro was arrested for domestic violence in 1993, but that a grand jury declined to indict him. But in 1996, she escaped to a woman's shelter with the couple's children, Angie, Emily, Anthony and Rosie. In January 1997, she was awarded full custody of the children. After the 2005 filing, a temporary protection order was granted instructing Castro to stay away from the family. It also banned him from owning a deadly weapon, using drugs or alcohol. Castro signed it but it was dismissed two months . later when Figueroa's lawyer was unable to attend a scheduled . hearing in the case due to another court commitment, The Telegraph reported. Speaking to MailOnline, one of . Castro's sons, Anthony, depicted his father as a violent, controlling . man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she was recovering . from brain surgery. House of horrors: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement where he allegedly kept the girls . 'Having that relationship with my dad all these years when we lived in a . house where there was domestic violence and I was beaten as well... we . never were really close because of that,' he said. In 1996, Castro was accused of pulling a fence post from a neighbor's property amid a dispute and the neighbor's six-year-old daughter later fell in the hole and hurt herself. Castro, who said in court documents he had called police repeatedly about the neighbor, was ordered to pay $241 in damages. On Monday, Castro was arrested along with his two brothers after three women who had allegedly been held captive at his Cleveland home for a decade were found by authorities. Locked up: Three missing women were found at this home, owned by Castro, in Cleveland on Monday . Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she . vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was . 16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday . Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . On Monday afternoon, Amanda Berry, 26, who disappeared in 2003, was heard screaming by a neighbor, who helped her escape through a screen door. She used a neighbor's phone to call 911. Gina Dejesus, 23, who went missing in 2004, and Michelle Knight, 32, who vanished in 2002, were also found alive at the home. They were taken to hospital with a six-year-old girl, who was born to Berry while she was in captivity. It appears that his treatment of his wife was just the beginning of the horror he inflicted on women. Police confirmed on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home to restrain the girls, while the victims allegedly suffered miscarriages after being assaulted and then beaten at the home. Local police sources revealed that Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free. Probe: Members of the FBI evidence response team carry out evidence from the home on Tuesday . This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling. He also reportedly turned the home into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back. He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in. Casto is likely to face charges today, authorities have said.","2005 filing details horrific injuries Grimilda Figueroa allegedly suffered .

"By . Tim Shipman . UPDATED: . 05:16 EST, 13 January 2012 . U-turn: Prime Minister David Cameron has signalled a climbdown in plans to cut child benefit for families where one parent earns more than £42, 375 . David Cameron has signalled there will be a government climbdown over cuts in child benefit for higher rate taxpayers. The Prime Minister said he would try to tackle the unfairness of the plans which will strip child benefit from any family that has just one person earning over £42,375. The plans will cost 1.8million families at least £1,000 a year. The change – due to come into force in April 2013 – has been criticised because couples who both earn just under the threshold will keep the benefit, even if their combined income is substantially more than couples with just one higher rate taxpayer. Mr Cameron yesterday said he wants to get rid of the ‘cliff edge’ where the benefit drops to nothing as soon as one earner tops £42,375. The Prime Minister’s intervention is significant with just three months to go before the Budget since it shows he is determined to water down the plans. However, Treasury sources last night indicated that there is every chance that a change will not be announced in March’s Budget statement even though that risks angering Mr Cameron. The Chancellor could make the move in his autumn statement this year or in the Budget next year before the changes come into force. In an interview with Parliament’s House Magazine, the Prime Minister indicated there could be measures to provide transitional relief for those hit by the plans. He said: ‘Some people say that’s the unfairness of it: that you lose the child benefit if you have a higher rate taxpayer in the family. ‘Two people below the level keep the benefit. So, there’s a threshold, a cliff-edge issue. ‘We always said we would look at the steepness of the curve, we always said we would look at the way it’s implemented and that remains the case, but again I don’t want to impinge on the Chancellor’s Budget.’ Tory MPs are privately urging the Chancellor George Osborne to act in March’s budget in order to spare some families from the pain. Downing Street aides are concerned that the policy has contributed to a fall in support for the Coalition among women voters. Child Benefit, which is usually paid . to a child’s mother, is worth £20.30 a week for the eldest child, and . £13.40 for each subsequent child. About 7.8million families were paid child benefit in 2009-10 at a cost of just under £12billion. Cabinet tussle: The Treasury, led by Chancellor George Osborne, is resisting calls from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to means test Child Benefit as part of the Government's universal benefit . One way of tackling the ‘cliff edge’ drop would be to gradually reduce child benefit payments over time. Alternatively, the payments could first be taken away from second or third children to reduce costs. Other ministers want to see parents of truants and rioters stripped of the payments. The Treasury is resisting a suggestion from Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith that child benefit should be means tested as part of the Government’s universal benefit – a move that would automatically end the penalisation of families with one higher rate taxpayer. Mr Cameron said he would not abandon . the plans altogether since he wants the middle classes to shoulder their . share of the burden for paying down the deficit. The . proposals will save £2.5billion a year and the Liberal Democrats have . indicated that any changes would have to raise the same amount of money . for Treasury coffers. He said: ‘If we want to make sure that everyone makes a contribution to dealing with the deficit, that’s why we had to look at measures like taking child benefit away from higher-rate taxpayers. ‘If you look at which parts of the country are most affected by the deficit reduction programme, those in the middle are not the most affected. ‘I know that many middle income families do feel squeezed because inflation has been so high. But actually in terms of making the deficit reduction measures fall fairly, I think it was necessary to make sure that top rate taxpayers were making a contribution.’","Plans will see it stopped for families where one parent earns over £42,375 .

A lightweight ATV specially designed for sneak attacks by the U.S. Special Operations Forces has been revealed days before its first and potentially last public showing before military combat use. The C2 Commander, a Lightweight Tactical All-Terrain Vehicle, or LTATV, is one of three vehicles in a new line of LTATV Strike and Mobility Vehicles making their public debut next month by RP Advanced Mobile Systems. The military grade ATV is specifically designed for completing low profile missions with its weight and size ideal for fast transport by small aircraft into the battlefield, according to RP, based out of Oregon. New item: The C2 Commander, the first of three Lightweight Tactical All-Terrain Vehicles by RP Advanced Mobile Systems, will make its public debut next month for expected use by the U.S. Special Operations Forces . Ready to go: The military grade ATV's features a lighter weight and size making it ideal for fast transport by small aircraft into the battlefield . Features to the C2 Commander includes a rear open differential system (RODS) said to substantially add maneuverability on paved roads and in tight urban quarters, in addition to a . locked rear differential for maximum off-road capability. The vehicle also features an electrical support system that allows prolonged use of communications equipment while the engine isn’t running, strengthened bumpers for pushing other vehicles and obstacles, an upgraded suspension system, new Dynamic Power Steering, and a multimodal cargo bed for holding a variety of weapons systems, gear and medical litter for transporting injured troops. The vehicle’s run-flat tires, at a cost of $250 each, are also said capable of taking a hit from a 7.62mm round before continually operating up to 75 miles at 45MPH while deflated. The tires feature 14-inch aluminum bead lock wheels.

An increasing number of NHS organisations are struggling financially with the number of debt-ridden trusts doubling in a year, a study has revealed. According to the Audit Commission report, trusts and foundation trusts in the red rose from 13 in 2010/11 to 31 in 2011/12. This is more than one in 10 trusts in the NHS. Thirty-nine NHS trusts reported a poorer financial position in 2011/12 than in the previous year and 18 NHS trusts and foundation trusts received financial support from the Department of Health, the report states. However, it only gives the figures for the 10 debt-ridden NHS trusts that it audits. The other 21 organisations are Foundation Trusts which are regulated by Monitor. Monitor does not publish annual figures because it says many of these organisations intentionally run up a deficit as part of a longer-term plan. They argue that annual figures are an 'out-dated' form of monitoring. This chart from the Audit Commission shows the size of the debt of 10 NHS Trusts in 2011/12. The other 21 debt-ridden organisations are Foundation Trusts and are regulated by Monitor . Under pressure: NHS trusts face rising patient demands and costs . A Monitor spokesman said: 'Foundation trusts have more freedom to run their own affairs than NHS trusts. As the independent regulator of the sector, we assess the financial health of FTs on their performance in the medium term and do not require them to break even each year. They are therefore allowed to run a short-term deficit, and from a business perspective this can be an acceptable method of managing their finances. 'Of the 21 FTs operating a deficit in 2011-12, 13 planned to be in deficit, nine are planning to return to surplus in 2012-13, and five had deficits of less than £1m.' It comes during an unprecedented savings drive. In 2011/12, the NHS as a whole made £1.6 billion in efficiency savings and a large number of trusts reported an improved financial position. Andy McKeon, managing director of health at the Audit Commission, said: 'While nationally the NHS appears to be managing well financially, and preparing itself for the changes and challenges ahead, a number of PCTs (primary care trusts) and trusts are facing severe financial problems. 'The Department of Health and other relevant national authorities need to focus their attention on the minority of organisations whose financial position is deteriorating, and on their geographical distribution and service standards.' The NHS organisation with the highest deficit is South London Health Care Trust - which was put under the care of a special administrator earlier this year for being on the brink of bankruptcy. The trust, which provides care for patients living in the London boroughs of Bexley, Bromley and Greenwich, was the first trust to be put on an 'unsustainable providers regime' because it was losing £1 million a week. No decisions have yet been made about how the trust will be run in the future but recently Matthew Kershaw, the special administrator appointed to put the trust back on a viable footing, invited providers of NHS care, including private companies and NHS organisations, to express whether they would be interested in running services at the trust. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich is one of three run by the South London Health Care Trust, which has the highest deficit in the country . NHS Confederation chief executive . Mike Farrar said: 'This is the time for the NHS Commissioning Board to . help providers, not with bailouts, but by releasing money to new . clinical commissioning groups so they can work with providers to help . put them on a sustainable footing by changing the type and range of . services they provide. 'Now . is the time for big investment in community and primary care. We need . to do this to ensure hospitals can sustain local services in the long . run. 'Fundamental changes . to the way we provide care are necessary if the NHS is to maintain . financial balance and become more responsive to patients' needs. 'Doing . this will require some difficult decisions and in some cases will . require changing or closing down some services, but this can only happen . if we build up the capacity in the community and in primary care to . enable people to be treated at home.' Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and . general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'The NHS is . tasked with saving £20 billion in England alone, and NHS hospitals and . organisations are dealing with this reality on a daily basis. 'Patients . will question why as many as 61,000 posts are at risk in the NHS when . there is an overall surplus of £1.6 billion. To date, we have not seen . evidence that this surplus is being reinvested into patient care, and a . rigorous analysis of NHS finances is now needed. 'We . are also concerned that for those trusts who are running up huge . deficits, often due to badly negotiated PFI deals, it can appear . tempting to reduce expenditure by thoughtless reductions in staff and . services. Instead, they need to focus on keeping patients healthy.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We know the NHS is facing even greater pressures, not least from rising demand and costs. 'That's why we are investing an extra £12.5 billion in the NHS, modernising it and improving efficiency while at the same time improving choice for patients to drive up the quality of patient care.'","More than one in 10 NHS trusts are now in the red .

OK, so you sit there and go nowhere and die of cold. 'You've got to fix your bindings in order to go back. It's one of those things. 'I had to take everything off to get a grip on the bindings. 'It was no more than 20 minutes before I noticed one of my hands had gone completely white. 'The . vascular surgeon I saw yesterday said that, in his opinion - he wasn't . sure - two of the fingers definitely would not require surgery and two . of the fingers might require surgery, to be shorter.' The explorer said the surgeon who treated his fingers in Cape Town suggested that diabetes may be responsible for causing the frostbite. Sir Ranulph, who was described as 'the world's greatest living explorer' by Guinness . World Records in 1984, continued: 'Two and a half months ago, my normal GP took a blood sample and said I might be on the verge of type two diabetes.' Scroll down for video .

Frostbite: Sir Ranulph Fiennes may lose two more fingers when his left hand is operated on by surgeons . Health concerns: Sir Ranulph Fiennes said type two diabetes may have made him more susceptible to the frostbite which could result in the loss of two more of his fingers . He said the diabetes may be responsible for making him more 'susceptible to circulation changes’ and the cold. Asked . how he was coping with the pain, Sir Ranulph replied: 'I'm on pills, . lots of pills at the moment and they're working very well at the . moment.' Fiennes lost the tips of his fingers on his left hand after he attempted to walk solo and . unsupported to the North Pole in 2000. His sleds fell . through weak ice and Fiennes was forced to pull them out by hand. He . sustained severe frostbite to the tips of all the fingers on his left . hand, forcing him to abandon the attempt. On returning home, his surgeon . insisted the necrotic fingertips be retained for several months before . amputation, to allow regrowth of the remaining healthy tissue. Frustrated: Ranulph Feinnes' injuries forced him to pull out of the first winter crossing of the world's coldest continent . But, impatient . at the pain the dying fingertips caused, Fiennes cut them off himself . with a fretsaw, just above where the blood and the soreness . were. Sir Ranulph today admitted he was 'frustrated' he had to quit this latest expedition but said he will continue to support the project through fundraising. Describing how he felt at having to pull . out, he said: 'It is extremely frustrating. I started working on . this expedition five years ago. 'I've . been working on it and nothing else full time and unpaid for five years . so it is definitely frustrating but unavoidable and I will make the . best of it by putting my focus full time on to making my focus entirely . on the expedition team.' His team-mates will continue with the 2,000-mile (3,219km) trek, which they are expected to embark on later this month. Hailed as the last great polar challenge, the journey across the Antarctic has never been attempted during the winter. The . team will experience some of the toughest conditions on earth - near . permanent darkness and temperatures as low as minus 90C (minus 130F) during their six-month journey. Sir Ranulph went on: 'You could not put a better team together than that lot. 'I'm very pleased with and proud of the team in charge of the crossing. 'Everything is going totally on schedule as of today.' The coldest journey team was dropped off by ship on the Pacific coast of the continent . where they set off over the ice shelf. The aim was to ascend 10,000ft (3,000m) on to the inland plateau, and . head onwards to the South Pole. Record-breaking: Fiennes has broken several records and led many expeditions to remote regions. He was described by Guinness World Records in 1984 as 'the world's greatest living explorer' Happier times: In a photo posted on their Flickr account the research team are shown enjoying a meal with the expedition team . After covering around 2,000 miles (3,200km) their journey was due to end at the Ross Sea. Joanna Lumley, a trustee with the Tawt Trust which is behind the expedition, spoke enthusiastically about the trek. 'I can't emphasise enough that in our . strange, dull, bleak, boring, flattened-out, money-grabbing world, this . is the most extraordinary adventure,' she said. 1944 Born in the UK . 1965-1966 Joined the SAS.

Fiennes hoped to raise £6.17 million for Seeing Is Believing, a charitable . initiative to tackle avoidable blindness around the world. Speaking at the press conference today, he said: 'I will focus now 100 per cent . on making sure that the expedition has every possible encouragement, . has every chance of making maximum money for our charity. 'The expedition will take six months, during which three million people will go avoidably blind.'

He has spent 40 years achieving extraordinary feats which pushed him to the very ends of his endurance.

After freeing . the sledge his wet hands were exposed to temperatures as low as -63C . causing the tissue on the tops of his fingers to die. In his autobiography, Fiennes wrote: 'My fingers were ramrod stiff and ivory white. 'They might as well have been wood... I . had seen enough frost bite in others to realise I was in serious trouble. I had to turn back.' He . was told he needed to wait up to five months to give the healthy tissue a . chance to grow, but instead Fiennes bought the saw and spent five days . removing the tips of his damaged fingers and thumb. It was not the first or last time the adventurer has had to abandon challenges because of injury or illness. Fiennes . also had to be rescued during an attempt in 1996 to walk to the South . Pole solo when he suffered a kidney stone attack. The explorer also had to abandon an ascent of Mount Everest in 2005 when he was 1,0000ft from the summit after he suffered chest pain. He told The Guardian afterwards that 'it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest.' Four years later he became the first person ever to reach the summit of Everest and cross both polar ice caps.

Amityville is best known as the setting . of the novel The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson, which was published in . 1977 and had been adapted into a series of films made between 1979 and . 2011. The book was based on a true story, in December 1975, George and Kathy Lutz and Kathy's three children moved into 112 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house in Amityville - which is 15 minutes walking distance away from the scene of yesterday's crime. Thirteen months before the Lutzes moved in, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family at the house. After 28 days, the Lutzes left the house, claiming to have been terrorized by paranormal phenomena while living there.

The Amityville Horror: A True Story is a multi-million selling book by Jay Anson first published in September 1977.It is reported to be based on the real-life paranormal experiences of the Lutz family at 122 Ocean Avenue, a large Dutch Colonial house in the Long Island town of Amityville, New York.The story is supposedly about the horrifying events the Lutz family endured over a period of 28 days after moving into a home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. had shot and killed six members of his family inside the home 13 months prior to their purchase.In December, 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the home one year and one month after the DeFeo murders for what they considered to be a bargain price of $80,000.They moved into the six bedroom home with their three children, Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa, 5 and their Malamute/Labrador cross called Harry.Because of the terrible past of the home, the Lutz's arranged for the home to be blessed and when the Catholic priest flicked holy water across the room, he heard a male voice deman that he 'get out'.After that and for the next 28 days, the Lutz's experienced many different and frightening episodes all linked to the paranormal.George would wake up around 3:15 every morning and would go out to check the boathouse. Later he would learn that this was the estimated time of the DeFeo killings.Kathy had vivid nightmares about the murders and discovered the order in which they occurred and the rooms where they took place.While tending to the fire, George and Kathy saw the image of a demon with half his head blown out. It was burned into the soot in the back of the fireplace.George would wake up to the sound of the front door slamming. He would race downstairs to find the dog sleeping soundly at the front door. Nobody else heard the sound although it was loud enough to wake the house.Kathy would feel a sensation as if 'being embraced' in a loving manner, by an unseen force.The book was written after Tam Mossman, an editor at the publishing house Prentice Hall, introduced George and Kathy Lutz to Jay Anson.However, soon after its publication, the Lutz's version of events came to be quesioned and speculation was rife that the entire novel was a work of fiction.George Lutz maintained that events in the book were 'mostly true' and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part. In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a lie detector test relating to their experiences at the house, which they both passed.In May 2010, the house was placed on the market with an asking price of $1.15 million.

Nick Clegg was accused of not being ‘straight’ over the Lord Rennard scandal yesterday as he shifted his story yet again. The Deputy Prime Minister said sexual harassment claims against the former Liberal Democrat chief executive had been a factor in his early retirement – ostensibly on health grounds – in 2009. Mr Clegg said allegations of improper  conduct towards women had been ‘in the background’ when it was decided Lord Rennard would step down, though the party insisted at the time that the only reason was his poor health. Scroll down for video . Hosting his weekly radio phone-in, Nick Clegg was challenged to explain when he first knew of claims about Lord Rennard's 'inappropriate behaviour' He also confirmed that a former Lib . Dem frontbencher, Sandra Gidley, had raised concerns about the peer’s . behaviour with him soon after he became leader in 2007, though he . insisted she had not raised specific allegations. At least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by Lord Rennard . Mr Clegg’s office initially suggested . he knew nothing of claims against Lord Rennard, who categorically denies . impropriety, when alleged victims went public last week. Then they . admitted he had been aware of rumours, which he had asked his then chief . of staff to investigate. In an unusually forthright attack for a . senior Conservative on their coalition partners, Business Minister . Michael Fallon said it was increasingly clear that the Lib Dems had not . been ‘straight’ about what they knew. ‘I think one of the reasons the Lib . Dems are in trouble is they haven’t really been straight about this. The . reason it’s gone on for a week is first they said it wasn’t happening . and they only heard it in general terms, now they’ve said they have . heard the specific allegations, now they’re saying it was something to . do with the reason why Lord Rennard resigned,’ Mr Fallon said. ‘And when this sort of thing happens, I . think the lesson is really you’ve got to come clean right at the . beginning and get a more independent inquiry and get the facts out there . and, when necessary, put it right and that hasn’t happened – this has . gone on far too long.’ Alison Smith, a former Lib Dem activist, went public with groping claims against Lord Rennard and has criticised Mr Clegg's attacks on journalist as 'self-appointed detectives' Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw . agreed: ‘Clegg seems to be changing the story every time he’s asked.’ But Baroness Williams, one of the most . senior Lib Dem women, said the situation had been ‘hopelessly . exaggerated’ and insisted Lord Rennard was ‘a very fine man’. However, she did say that women in . Parliament were ‘not treated very fairly’ and said the Commons was a . ‘very bullying place, a very masculine culture’. Mr Clegg himself paid lavish tribute . to Lord Rennard when he retired in 2009, declaring: ‘It is impossible to . exaggerate Chris’s immense contribution to the Liberal Democrats over . the years.’ Pressed on whether the allegations . played any part in Lord Rennard’s departure as chief executive, Mr Clegg . yesterday told listeners of his weekly phone in show on LBC 97.3: ‘Like . any new leader of any organisation or political party, I wanted to make . sure that the organisation reflected my priorities, my values. Mr Clegg has been trailled by reporters since the scandal broke . ‘I felt it was time for a change at . the top of the professional party. His health was poor and that was the . immediate reason he left but of course these things were in the . background.’ The Deputy Prime Minister also shifted from his indignant . response to criticism earlier in the scandal, conceding his party failed . to deal properly with complaints of sexual harassment. ‘There were some very serious mistakes . and the women were not listened to and were let down,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘I so much believe that it is crucial that you treat people with respect . and dignity in everything you do – and that is what I expect of people . in the organisation I lead. That, clearly, did not happen here, to put . it mildly.’ Mr Clegg also praised journalists who . had helped expose the affair, having on Tuesday triggered anger by . rounding on ‘people who appear to want to act as self-appointed . detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years . ago’. Of the media, he insisted that as a liberal he would ‘defend to my last breath their right to say what they want’.","DPM's LBC phone-in dominated by questions about handling of sex scandal .

Gambling addict: Lee Ellis, 24, pinched his mother's beloved rings and necklaces to repay money he borrowed to fuel his out-of-control addiction . A fruit machine addict stole £30,000 of his mother's jewellery to pay off his gambling debts before owning up when he found out she was dying of cancer. Lee Ellis, 24, pinched his mother's beloved rings and necklaces to repay money he borrowed to fuel his out-of-control addiction. Ridden with guilt, Ellis handed himself in to police after confessing the theft to his devastated mother. The turning point came when he was stunned to discover she had been struck down by terminal cancer. Ellis, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, has now opened his heart about his gambling hell after he was spared prison by Ipswich magistrates. And he issued a warning as he battles to rebuild his shattered relationship with his family to others sucked in by the lure of winning huge windfalls on fruit machines. 'I feel embarrassed and very remorseful. I love my family with all my heart,' he said. 'This is what addiction does to you.' Ellis admitted one count of theft and three fraud offences. He plundered jewellery worth about £30,000 from his mother, who's also a grandmother and wasn't named, between August 1 and September 28 last year. The fraud charges related to the gambler pawning the gems to Christopher Boreham Jewellers in Felixstowe. Lesla Small, prosecuting, told the court Ellis gave himself up at his local police station in January. Ms Small said he admitted taking his mother's jewellery from a wardrobe in her bedroom. He pocketed just £2,000 to pay off his gambling debts and then hoped to buy his mother's pride and joy back six months later. But depressed and frightened, Ellis could not do that as he became unemployed. The court heard his mother, who wept with shame as Ellis told her what he had done, had hoped to leave her treasured jewellery to her grand-daughter. Ian Duckworth, defending, said she had responded well to treatment and Ellis had become her carer as his father works six days a week. Mr Duckworth told JPs: 'It's a sad case all round. His parents are clearly supportive. Mum's very distressed. They are building bridges - not easy in the light of all that's gone on.' Ellis, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Magistrates' Court where he admitted the charges . Ellis was given a 10-month jail sentence suspended for 12 months. He was banned from all bookmakers in Suffolk and ordered to go on a thinking skills programme and pay £85 costs. Today, Ellis confessed it took just three weeks to become addicted to slot machines offering the lure of big payouts. Jobless Ellis said: 'I feel embarrassed and very remorseful. I love my family with all my heart. This is what addiction does to you. 'You don't think about anyone else but yourself when you are addicted. All you worry about is money. I love my mum with all my heart. She is my best friend. I love her so much.' He added: 'We are getting on quite well now. I am her carer and we are slowly building up our relationship. She has forgiven me. My family are forgiving me very slowly.' Ellis said he wept when he admitted his betrayal to his mother. 'I feel completely awful for everything. I . have got an addiction and stay clear of fruit machines now. It's a . mug's game, an absolute mug's game' Lee Ellis, 24 . 'I broke down in tears. I felt disgraced. I felt the worst I have ever felt in my life telling the person I loved the most what I had done,' he said. 'I told her I had an addiction and I needed help. It was the hardest thing I have every done in my life.' Ellis began going into bookmakers a few years ago with friends but said his problems began to spiral when he became hooked on fruit machines a year ago. 'I started getting more serious when a friend picked up a pretty heavy addiction. I watched him and got into gambling. 'I started to gamble quite a lot, using any money I could get when I was working. It was the lights on the machine that were attractive. 'You think it is easy and then you find out it's not. Then you go chasing your money,' said Ellis. 'It's the worst thing you can do. That's what they (the bookmakers) want you to do. 'The compulsion happened at an alarming rate ' after about three weeks.' As his debts mounted so did the psychological effects of being hooked. He borrowed money from friends which he could not pay back. Ellis said the pressure eventually led to him stealing from his own mother so he could pay back his mates. But he insisted that when he did so he did not know she was ill and had every intention of returning the jewellery before she noticed it had gone. 'I was chasing something that was never there. It was panic, fear, humiliation and depression. When you gamble you get depressed pretty easily. It's a very lonely place,' said Ellis. 'I feel completely awful for everything. I have got an addiction and stay clear of fruit machines now. It's a mug's game, an absolute mug's game. 'The bookmakers want you to leave with nothing but your shorts. The idea is they take everything you have got.'","Lee Ellis, of Felixstowe, pinched his mother's rings and necklaces .

For the past two years Sherrie Walter has been unwilling to pull her hair into a ponytail and unable to wear a pair of matching earrings after surgery to deal with an aggressive form of skin cancer. In 2010 a persistent sore inside her ear was eventually diagnosed as basal cell carcinoma and because it had spread to the surrounding tissue, Sherrie had to endure most of her left ear being removed along with parts of her skull and ear canal. Disfigured and deaf on one side, Sherrie, 42, was offered a chance at a groundbreaking procedure that would remove cartilage from her rib to fashion a entirely new ear for her, which would then be placed under the skin of her arm for months to grow. Scroll Down for Video . Sherrie Walter in hospital on Tuesday after her latest operation to remould her new left ear which was attached to her head in March . To date the entire process has lasted close to 20 months and even though there are still more cosmetic surgeries to come, Sherrie's new ear is now attached to the side of her head. 'I feel like an experiment,' said Sherrie talking about the multiple procedures she has been through at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland. Described by the surgical team as the most complicated ever ear reconstruction carried out in North America, the new organ spent four months under the skin of her left forearm before it was transferred to her head in March. The team was led by Dr. Patrick Byrne, an associate professor in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine . 'I thought of this exact strategy many years before and really was looking for the right patient to try it on,' said Dr. Byrne. Following aggressive treatment to fight skin cancer, most of Sherrie's left ear was removed along with parts of her skull, ear canal and lymph nodes . Sherrie is seen in October 2010 (left) immediately after her surgery to remove the majority of her ear and parts of her skull while (right) her right ear is mapped out as a stencil for cartilage taken from her ribs . Four-years ago Sherrie did not think much of a scab on her ear which would not go away, thinking it was just slow to heal. 'I kept breaking it,' said Sherrie to the Baltimore Sun Times. 'I thought it was something I was doing that wasn't allowing it to heal. Prescribed antibiotics for the sore, the wound did not go away and eight months later, Sherrie made an appointment with a dermatologist. 'She looked at it for less than five minutes and she said, 'You have cancer,' said Sherrie who lives in Bel-Air, Maryland. 'I looked at my mother and I looked at myself and it was too much to comprehend.' Here is the ear constructed from cartilage that was inserted into Sherrie Walter's left arm to grow for months . In November 2011 the ear was placed under the arm of Sherrie to grow for four months until it had matured . In March of 2012 the ear had grown to the stage where it could be attached to the head of Sherrie Walter . Hoping that the cancer simply had to be cut away, Sherrie discovered that an aggressive treatment was required which removed seven layers of skin but left her ear still intact. However, in October 2010, Sherrie found blood inside her ear and was told that the cancer had spread to her left ear canal. In a 16-hour procedure doctors removed Sherrie's ear canal, ear drum and most of her left ear and also had to remove neck, gland, lymph node tissue and part of her skull. Despite being disfigured, Dr. Byrne told Sherrie that she did have options for regaining her ear. One was the prosthetic option which would have to be attached each day. However, most prosthetic ears are attached with clips to a titanium rod, but Sherrie's skull bone had been removed and therefore could not support the rod. 'She would have had to deal with tape and glue and it would have been a royal pain in the butt,' said Dr. Byrne to the Baltimore Sun Times. 'It just didn't sound appealing to her. And I agreed.' In March 2012 the ear was removed from the forearm of Sherrie Walter and attached to her head in a pioneering procedure . Before her latest round of cosmetic surgeries to improved her new ear these pictures of Sherrie show her progress as of September 2012 . The doctor then suggested the production of an entirely new ear, which Sherrie opted to attempt, despite being told the process would take near to two years. 'It seemed a little strange, but I was willing to try it,' said Sherrie. Using cartilage taken from her ribs to construct and carve the new organ, doctors decided to place the constructed ear inside her left forearm. However, because the skin around arms does not stretch that well, doctors had to expand her arms surface by using a saline to balloon out the skin. This took weeks and then in November of 2011, the new ear was inserted into her arm - visiblly growing under the surface. 'We implanted the ear near the wrist and just let it live there so all the skin could grow into the ear,' said Byrne. The surgical team at Johns Hopkins Hospital has spent the past 20 months working with Sherrie Walter on replacing her lost ear . While the ear spent four months inside her, Sherri and her husband Damien made light of the situation by lifting her arm in the air and saying to friends, 'I can't hear you.' In March, the ear was re-attched to her head and doctors began working on how to cosmetically mold it so that it would look more like her right ear. And on Tuesday of this week, Dr. Byrne cut the skin below the ear and pulled it back so that it would begin to resemble a lobe. After four-years of visiting hospitals it has become overwhelming for Sherrie's husband Damien . However, it’s been an emotional ride for Sherrie and her husband. 'It just didn’t seem like anything we’d ever heard of so to see the progression and to see how everything has come out has been just great to kind of come to fruition,' said Sherrie. Once she heals, the new ear should last for years according to Dr. Byrne. 'In my opinion, how it’s just a matter of time as the swelling goes down and it heals, I believe she will have a normal looking ear,' said the doctor. Though recovery isn’t over, Sherrie considers herself lucky and hopes others learn from her story.

It's a computer strapped to a user's face at all times while called revolutionary and technologically savvy by its creators. But in the rest of the world, Google Glass is being compared to the pocket protector, the Bluetooth and even the Segway - in other words the epitomes of dorkiness. As seen in a Tumblr image gallery titled, White Men Wearing Google Glass, early critics – presumably most who haven’t tried the device yet sold in stores - laugh and poke fun at those photographed wearing the spectacles that straps a camera to its user’s head. Nerds! In a Tumblr gallery titled, White Men Wearing Google Glass, photos are uploaded showing current users of the device to wide poking and name calling, one such photo pictured . Comparison: Some compare the pricy spectacles to pocket protectors, seen worn by the characters in 'Revenge of the Nerds' here . A writer at Wired implores someone to start a contrasting gallery titled: People Who Look Cool While Wearing Google Glass. That has yet to happen. The designers behind the headpiece which enables its users to take hands-free pictures, send email, and talk on the phone among various other uses, acknowledges mass resistance to the spectacles. But they insist most just need time. 'Our goal is to make the world better,' Google chairman Eric Schmidt said of the device at Harvard University last week. 'We’ll take the criticism along the way, but criticisms are inevitably from people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there will be an adaptation of society to it,' he said. White Team IZOD golfer and two-time PGA TOUR winner, Scott Piercy, right, try on Google Glass at the IZOD Social Hub at the MAXIM Clubhouse in April . Mirror: Memes expressing how Google Glass users may actually look while wearing the device aim to draw laughs . Still public critics are already calling Google Glass wearers ‘a**holes,’ dorks and even douchebags. It's not a far off cry from some of the first critics of the Bluetooth, a similar hands-free device which allows its users to take personal calls. 'You mean the doucheset?' a Yelp user commented on a 2008 message board titled: 'Pssst.....You look like a DORK with your Bluetooth headset on...' 'I just had a guy walk into my store with his blue tooth and I could not take him seriously!' another wrote. '""Douchebag"" is the perfect description!!' Some reasoning for the hatred toward this particular earpiece are accusations its users appear to think of themselves as being far more important than they really are. Predecessors: This outrageous photo, tagged Google Glass team 1995, has also circulated on Twitter . What's cool? A businessman wears a Bluetooth headset in his car, left, while right a man is seen commuting to work on a Segway . ‘If you are power walking on the treadmill and are on your BT conversating, congratulations, you ARE a douchebag!’ another wrote. Image aside, critics are attacking Google Glass for its astounding abilities as well. Some accuse its camera as being a potential destruction to public privacy, with some stores and private establishments having already banned customers from wearing them inside. When Glass users give an audible command of 'OK, Glass, Take a picture,' the software kicks in doing as it's told. While that ability is already widely upsetting to some who fear they could be undesirably photographed in public, there's now an app that allows users to perform this function silently as well. Called Winky, this new app allows its users to silently order photographs taken with a mere wink of the eye. The Mac Monocle: A drawing of a fictional Mac Monocle shows a possible competitor to Google Glass while said to be substantially less stupid looking . 'I've taken more pictures today than I have the past 5 days thanks to this,' Winky's developer Mike DiGiovanni from Roundarch Isobar said on his Google+ page. 'Sure, they are mostly silly, but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where I've been.' Further stretching concerns on privacy is new talk this week of Glass user's own privacy being violated. One software developer this week warned of hackers' ability to remotely control the device, in effect seeing and hearing everything the wearer does. - Google chairman Eric Schmidt . ‘They have control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head,’ software developer Jay Freeman who was selected to test out Google Glass said in a blog post this week. ‘A bugged Glass doesn't just watch . your every move: it watches everything you are looking at ... and hears . everything you do. The only thing it doesn't know are your thoughts,’ he . writes. Then there's caution thrown at the device's lavish cost - currently expected to be $1,500 once . released - as a danger of easily being stolen. Last . year ordinary smartphone thefts accounted for 42 percent of robberies . in Washington, D.C, nearly half of all robberies in San Francisco and 14 . percent of all crimes committed in New York City -figures drastically . raised over the years as the New York Times reports. 'We’re . acutely aware of those questions,' Schmidt responded to similar . concerns raised at Harvard over the device's abilities being so new. 'We want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... But I’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear, as opposed to understanding what’s possible. 'The people who’ve used Glass, including myself, report it as remarkable. I’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways,' Schmidt said. With a quiet wink of an eye Google Glass users will now be able to take a picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in development for the device. Snap! A new app for Google Glass called Winky allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye . Ordinarily Glass users must deliver an audible command of, 'OK, Glass, Take a picture,' to kick in the camera's software. However with its release this week program Winky will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command. 'You might not think it's hard to say ""Ok, Glass Take a Picture"" or even just tap a button. But it's a context switch that takes you out of the moment, even if just for a second,' Winky's developer Mike DiGiovanni from Roundarch Isobar explained on his Google+ page on Wednesday. 'I've taken more pictures today than I have the past 5 days thanks to this,' he continued. 'Sure, they are mostly silly, but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where I've been.' However while pirating images of subjects in public may be one use for the device, speaking like one will not be allowed, as Geek.com has revealed. Google's voice translation technology censors curse words, prohibiting its user from for instance sending a voice-written email containing an explicative. Currently there is said to be no way to disable to filter, which would work similar to Google's SafeSearch option, the website reports.","Critics poke fun at Google Glass comparing it to the pocket protector, Bluetooth and Segways .

Starr said a week ago that he was . prepared to speak to police about the allegations to clear his name. He . said: ‘Ask me anything – anything.

Where is it going to end?' 'I hope they (the police) concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who were manipulating girls.' Starrs release this evening came as solicitor Liz Dux said Savile's estate, the BBC and three hospitals - Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor - are facing possible legal action by alleged victims. Ms Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said formal notice had been sent to 'all interested parties' of an intention to pursue claims against them. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.' Savile, who died last year aged 84, . has been described as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British . history. Police are following more than 400 leads into the DJ, who left . at least 300 victims over a four-decade rampage of child abuse. Miss Ward was one of several pupils . from Duncroft Approved School in Surrey who were invited to the BBC by . Savile to watch his shows being recorded. In 2007, Surrey Police investigated . historic complaints from former pupils of the now-defunct school, but . the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was not enough evidence to . bring charges. Savile's estate, reportedly worth £4.3 million, has been frozen in response to the mounting allegations. Lawyers are also looking into the late presenter's overseas assets, thought to be administered from tax haven the Channel Islands. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, yesterday revealed the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims. Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times (FT). The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document, which instructs that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's friends, family and neighbours. It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people. The remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by NatWest on behalf of the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, according to the FT. Savile's intended individual beneficiaries include the trustees of both his charities and existing and former employees of Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, the newspaper added. Savile's relatives said they do not want a penny of his estate and called for the cash to be donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. The late presenter's nephew, Guy Marsden, 58, said his uncle was 'a monster' and it was only right that the money should be given to a police-run anti-paedophile unit, and Savile's victims. Savile's victims are to sue the star's estate to get answers and compensation, and to 'move on with their lives', a lawyer said yesterday. Liz Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said some had not been able to form adult relationships since the attacks. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.'

"By . Simon Walters and James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 03:14 EST, 31 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:44 EST, 31 March 2013 . Blamed: George Osborne is being blamed for his party's poor showing in opinion polls by senior Conservative figures . George Osborne is facing renewed calls to give up his role co-ordinating his party's campaigning after being blamed for the poor opinion polls by senior Conservative figures. The Chancellor is reported to be facing a 'whispering campaign' as members of the highest echelons of the party warn a change is needed before the general election. There have been calls for him to be replaced as Chancellor in a job swap with the Foreign Secretary William Hague, according to The Sunday Telegraph, amid concerns that he fails to understand the middle classes and their economic struggles. Mr Hague has repeatedly said he does not want the job. The calls came as Labour stepped up its attacks on a raft of Coalition welfare reforms, saying tax and benefit changes have left families nearly £900 a year worse off. Osborne's critics have pointed to the last budget, which penalised stay-at-home mothers rather than help them, along with failing to introduce recognition for marriage in the tax system. The mortgage guarantee scheme has left some critics unhappy while Treasury plans for extra Whitehall cuts after 2015 has caused clashes with Cabinet ministers including Home Secretary Theresa May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, The Sunday Telegraph has reported. One MP told the paper: 'He might have helped push through gay marriage but in my constituency people are more angry about the removal of child benefit, a policy designed and implemented by a rich Chancellor in a safe seat with absolutely no idea how hard it is for ordinary folk.' Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps however has supported Mr Osborne, saying he was doing a 'heck of a job in very difficult circumstances' as he battled to bring down the deficit. Mr Shapps admitted the Tories had no more than a '50-50' chance of winning an overall majority at the next election. Meanwhile, Labour has said Coalition tax and benefit changes have left families nearly £900 a year worse off on average. A significant squeeze on state help starts to bite from tomorrow, with thousands joining protests across the UK yesterday against the so-called 'bedroom tax'. Criticisms: George Osborne's latest budget was criticised for penalising stay-at-home mothers . Support: Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps (left) has offered support to the Chancellor, while Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has defended Coalition benefit changes that come in tomorrow . Charities say they are braced for a period of 'misery' and increased homelessness for the poorest families and the disabled as the austerity measures kick in. But ministers say tackling the spiralling welfare bill, which counts for around a third of all spending, is a vital part of the Government's deficit-reduction strategy. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith insisted that even with the tough measures, the overall cost to the taxpayer continued to rise. 'The reality is that this country is not cutting welfare, it is managing the growth at a lower level,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'Across the UK - contrary to the headlines - all those on benefits will still see cash increases in every year of this Parliament.' Campaign: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said households faced a 'shocking' cut at the same time as the top rate of income tax was reduced . Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said households faced a 'shocking' cut at the same time as the top rate of income tax was reduced from 50p to 45p. Institute for Fiscal Studies figures showed a £9.93 boost from this year's Budget was far outweighed by a £901 annual hit from previously announced measures, he said. 'While ministers trumpet the small rise in the income tax personal allowance, they should admit that it is hugely outweighed by things like cuts to tax credits and child benefit, higher VAT, the bedroom tax and the granny tax."" 'These shocking figures show the huge hit millions of families are facing at the very same time David Cameron and George Osborne are giving millionaires an average £100,000 tax cut. 'They are giving with one hand, but taking away much more with the other.' The Labour and Tory feuding came . after Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith blurted out that he . had given up trying to cut the benefits bill. He . said he is simply ‘managing’ the ever-rising increase in handouts – and . was forced to deny his new ‘universal’ benefit is in turmoil. His . comments were in stark contrast to remarks by his own Minister for the . Disabled, Esther McVey, who told The Mail on Sunday she is determined to . stop widespread abuse of the £13 billion-a-year disability benefit . claimed by three million. And . Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking . the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6. The Labour . leaflet, designed to look like a lottery flyer, states: ‘£100,000 win . for everyone earning £1 million.’ In fact, people who earn £1 million, will be £42,500 better off per year. Around 660,000 social housing tenants face deemed to have a spare bedroom face losing an average £14 a week from tomorrow. The Government says ending what it calls a 'spare room subsidy' will free up unused space needed by people on waiting lists and save taxpayers £500 million a year. Critics argue it will have a disproportionate impact on the disabled and the National Housing Federation warns it could actually increase costs as people downsize to private rented homes. Criticism: Ed Miliband came under fire over a highly-provocative leaflet attacking the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p from April 6 . Council tax benefit is also replaced tomorrow by a new system run by local authorities but with 10 per cent less funding. Anti-poverty campaigners say around 2.4 million poor families face an average £138 a year rise in their bills, with nearly two million having to pay for the first time. Working-age benefits and tax credits will rise by a below-inflation 1 per cent from the start of the tax year on April 6 - the start of a three-year cap that represents a real-terms cut. Two days later, disability living allowance (DLA) begins to be replaced by the personal independence payment (PIP) - which charities say will remove support from many in real need. And later in the month, trials begin of a £500-a-week cap on any household's benefits in four London boroughs. The chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, Leslie Morphy, said: 'Our poorest households face a bleak April as they struggle to budget for all these cuts coming at once. 'People are already cutting back on the essentials of food and heating but there is only so much they can do. 'The result will be misery - cold rooms, longer queues at food banks, broken families, missed rent payments and yet more people facing homelessness - devastating for those directly affected, but bad for us all.' As the political battle over benefits heated up, Mr Shapps revealed figures showing that 878,300 people who were on incapacity benefit dropped their claims rather than complete a medical assessment. That was a third of the total, he said, and included people on benefits because of blisters, acne, and strains and sprains. Of the 1.44 million who had been reassessed, 55 per cent were found fit to work immediately and another 23.9 per cent able to do some level of work - leaving just 232,000 declared not fit to work. 'Welfare makes up a third of this country's spending - so it's our job to make sure it's getting to the people who really need it,' he said. 'Our reforms are about freeing people from a system of dependency that's trapped them and their families for decades - and people are getting back into work as a result. 'These figures demonstrate how the welfare system was broken under Labour and why our reforms are so important.' Meanwhile, a group of leading churches has branded the Government's cuts to benefits as 'unjust', saying the most vulnerable people are paying a 'disproportionate price' under austerity measures. The Baptist Union of Great Britain, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church and the Church of Scotland have come together to criticise the public perception of people in poverty. They say politicians have misrepresented those on benefits in order to justify the cuts - an axe which they say falls unfairly on the poor. The benefit cuts also suggest that people in poverty 'deserve' their situation and that they are not valued, according to Paul Morrison, public issues policy advisor at the Methodist Church. 'Our feeling is that these benefit changes are a symptom of an understanding of people in poverty in the United Kingdom that is just wrong,' he told the BBC. 'It is an understanding of people that they somehow deserve their poverty, that they are somehow ""lesser"", that they are not valued. 'The churches believe that they are valued and we believe that they should be treated much more fairly than they are being.' The four churches joined forces to tackle what they see as the Government manipulating statistics to effectively vilify the poor, creating a culture that blames them for their own poverty. They have written a report on poverty and sent it to every MP and Member of the Scottish Parliament.","Calls for George Osborne to be replaced as Chancellor by William Hague .

Sloppy NHS care after operations is costing the lives of thousands of patients, research shows. Nearly four in 100 people having common forms of surgery die as a result – twice as many as once thought. The study also found the death rate is higher in Britain than in many European countries, including Finland, Estonia and Hungary. NHS troubles: Researchers said patients were dying from blood poisoning, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes that medics had not picked up in time (file picture) The researchers said patients were dying . from blood poisoning, kidney failure, heart attacks and strokes that . medics had not picked up in time. A shortage of intensive care beds was also cited as a factor; there are fewer in NHS hospitals than in many other countries. Andreas Hoeft, one of the Anglo-German study’s authors, who is based at the University Hospital in Bonn, said: ‘Nurses are coming into the room in the morning and finding somebody dead in their bed. ‘Many of the patients get sepsis, or blood poisoning, overnight and often it is not detected. The bad news is that mortality is higher than we thought but hopefully there is room for improvement.’ Rupert Pearse from Queen Mary, . University of London, who led the research, said: ‘It’s certainly very . worrying and I believe some of these deaths are preventable. ‘We need to get the overall mortality down to one in 100 deaths per patients.’ The researchers, whose study is in the Lancet, looked at data on more than 46,500 patients in 28 European countries. All had undergone surgery that required them to stay in hospital at least one night. Concerns: The researchers looked at data on more than 46,500 patients in 28 European countries (file) These included a vast range of procedures from hip replacements to hernia removal to operations to take out bowel cancer tumours. The researchers did not include those who had undergone heart or brain surgery or women needing emergency operations during pregnancy. They found that 3.6 per cent of British patients had died within 60 days of having the operation. This figure is higher than in Finland, Norway, Estonia, Cyprus, Sweden and Switzerland – but the researchers said they needed to investigate further before they can conclude that National Health Service care is worse. The research, which was partly funded by the European Society of Anaesthesiology, found that just 6 per cent of patients were admitted to intensive care. This was lower than many other countries and a lack of available beds may partly explain the high death rates, according to the academics. In 2010, Cambridge University researchers found there are 3.5 beds per 100,000 of the UK population compared with 24.6 in Germany, 20 in the US and 9.6 in France. Professor Heoft said that in order to bring down the death rates, the most at-risk patients needed to be monitored properly. These include the elderly, those with diabetes, heart problems or kidney disease for example who are more likely to suffer complications. He added: ‘Simply calling for more intensive care unit beds will not solve the problem. 'It’s certainly very worrying and I believe some of these deaths are preventable. We need to get the overall mortality down to one in 100 deaths per patients' Rupert Pearse, research leader from Queen Mary, University of London . ‘New, cost-effective ways of identifying and monitoring patients at risk must be developed.’ The researchers said that it wasn’t the surgery that was poor, but rather the after care.  Medical staff were not doing enough to monitor patients so any sudden deterioration in their health was often going undetected. They should carry out regular checks of their blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and temperature up to five times a day. But many hospitals do not have enough adequately trained doctors or nurses to carry out the checks and who also know what to do when patients suddenly deteriorate. Professor Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, said: ‘The NHS is already among the best in Europe for some surgery specialties but these reports are vital as they show surgeons where they need to improve.’","Death rate higher in Britain than countries such as Finland and Estonia .

Accomplished designer, respected film director and all round king of cool, Tom Ford has long been the fashion man who can do no wrong. But earlier this year the catwalk designer felt the sharp edge of the critics' tongues after unveiling a Rihanna-inspired collection for autumn/winter 2013. Many argued that Ford's elite customer would not want to dress like the provocative singer. Candid: Usually one to shy away from interviews, Tom Ford has divulged his true feelings about the fashion world in a candid new interview . Talking to WWD about the reaction to his collection, he said: 'Whenever I’m working on a collection, everything does have to be real, and those outfits are real to me. 'And I think, OK, that’s Rihanna, and she’s going to her lawyer’s office in that all-black outfit and she’s hungover and that’s why she’s wearing those glasses. Yet she’s still a rock star.' Inspiration: When Ford unveiled his Rihanna-inspired collection, he was met with criticism. Rihanna wore one of his designs to the Met Ball (pictured) 51-year-old Ford, who gained international fame for his turnaround of the Gucci fashion house and the creation of his eponymous label, also hit out at high-street giant Zara. With a little help from the Duchess of Cambridge, Zara have gained plaudits for their on-trend collections, which have led to profits of £1.6bn this year alone. But Ford revealed that many designers deplore Zara for taking runway looks and selling them instore months before they hit designer rails. Knock-off: Ford slammed high-street giant Zara for replicating catwalk designs . Famous fan: The Duchess of Cambridge has long championed Zara, which helped boost their reputation and sales . 'A lot of the things I did - it's not going . to sound anything but egotistical - if I’m lucky and I did the right . thing, they will be at Zara way before I can get them in the store, and I . don’t like that,' he said. Ford, who has previously opened up about his internal battle between the inherently materialistic nature of his job and seeking a more simple life, added: 'I’m in a totally different place. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke. 'I’m not the guy who’s designing clothes for someone who is doing lines of coke off the table, like I was when I was at Gucci and Saint Laurent.'

The free membership site's Canadian founder Markus Frind messaged users to explain the changes - which include removing the Intimate Encounters option - and outlining that the measures are being imposed in order for the service to focus more keenly on creating 'meaningful relationships'.

Prince Charles took the Tube for the first time in nearly 27 years yesterday – and seemed to find it a little bewildering. But if the journey was strange for him, it was hardly what a normal London Underground passenger experiences, either. For a start, Charles and the Duchess of . Cornwall arrived at Farringdon station in a chauffeur-driven silver . Bentley. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall yesterday travelled on the Tube as part of the network's 150-year anniversary . The Prince of Wales and Camilla spoke with long-serving London Underground staff and engineering trainees . Charles and Camilla qualify for a Freedom Pass but they were given Oyster cards with £10 loaded onto them anyway . After finally figuring out how to use his Oyster card, Prince Charles made his way through the barriers at Farringdon Station . Then their Metropolitan Line train ran on time, the carriage was (unusually) clean – and had been helpfully cleared of all other commuters. And the smiling couple actually appeared to enjoy their jaunt, to mark . the Tube’s 150th anniversary. However, just one stop up the line, at . King’s Cross, after a four minute journey they hopped off and got back in the Bentley. Details of the visit had been kept . secret until the last minute, but astonished commuters soon crowded . around as the couple arrived at Farringdon, one of the original stations . built in 1863 and known as the 'birthplace of the tube', shortly after . 10am. Although both qualify for the city's . over-60s 'Freedom Pass', they were presented with limited edition . commemorative Oyster travel cards by staff which had been topped up with . £10 credit for the £2.10 journey. It was clearly a novel experience for . the bemused 64-year-old prince, who had to be shown by an underground . executive how to swipe his card through the electronic ticket barrier. Camilla, an occasional Underground user in her pre-royal . days, breezed through in his wake.The cards are expected to be retained . by the Royal Collection and may be displayed in years to come. Charles’s last experience of the Tube was in April 1986, when he and his late wife Diana opened Heathrow’s Terminal 4. There were members of the public on the platform at Farringdon but they were kept away from the carriage that would carry Charles and Camilla . The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were given a tour of the impressive Kings Cross station . How does one eat that oyster? Prince Charles was given his own travel card for use on London's public transport . Perhaps wanting to get away from all the watching eyes, Charles and Camilla tried to get to Harry Potter's platform 9 and three quarters at Kings Cross . After a briefing about the history of . the underground and the new £15 billion Crossrail project that will pass . through Farringdon linking east and west London, the couple walked . along the eastbound platform to catch their Metropolitan Line train. Members of the public, however, were . held back by police as the couple waited patiently for the 752 Wembley . service to arrive, with Charles joking at waiting pressmen: 'Are you lot . coming too?' The royal train was distinctly . different to those normally in service during the morning commute, . however.

Charles and Camilla travelled one stop from Farringdon to Kings Cross - a journey that usually takes a couple of minutes . Charles and Camilla enjoyed their trip on a brand new tube train . Camilla was invited to choose a seat . (unlike sardine-like morning commuters who are lucky to get one at all) ushering her husband to join her.

'Here we are, darling,' Camilla said . as the pair prepared to alight, walking past dozens of commuters reading . their morning papers. More than one looked up at the commotion and then . did a double take as the future king strode merrily by.

'Inspirational': Joshua Cawley, 22, died from the injuries he suffered as a baby 21 years earlier, an inquest heard . An 'inspirational' son died in the arms of his adoptive family from injuries he suffered 21 years earlier when he was 'thrown into his cot' as a baby, an inquest heard. Joshua Cawley, 22, was born a healthy baby boy but developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy, vision problems and epilepsy after a vicious head injury when he was aged just 10 months. At an emotional inquest in Bolton, Greater Manchester, his adoptive parents blamed Joshua's 'ticking timebomb' condition on the alleged abuse he suffered as a baby. The parents told the hearing that no one should live such as short life and die in such a tragic way. The inquest heard that Joshua's birth family were charged in 1990 with causing his head injury by throwing him into his cot but a judge in London kicked out the case due to 'evidential differences'. His adoptive parents Lynn Cawley and Ruth Wood said Joshua's death had left a 'big hole' in their lives, adding: 'We consider ourselves privileged to have been allowed to care for Joshua. 'However, we are mindful that Joshua only came to us as a result of the shocking abuse he suffered as a child. 'While the inquest process has been painful for us, we are grateful that this verdict marks a recognition that Joshua should not have lived and died in the way he did.' Joshua, who was born Dean Gill in London, was rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital in May, 1990 with a severe head injury. 'Ticking timebomb': Joshua developed quadriplegic cerebral palsy from the head injury when he 10 months old . His mother and step-father were charged with actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm and child cruelty for both Joshua and his older brother and stood trial in January, 1991 at Inner London Crown Court. It was alleged they had thrown Joshua into his cot and caused the head injury. It was also claimed his mother had hit his brother. But due to 'evidential differences' the judge directed the jury to find the pair not guilty. Joshua was in hospital for six . months. His severe head injury caused quadriplegic cerebral palsy, . vision problems and epilepsy but as he got older his condition worsened. 'Abuse': Joshua suffered the devastating head injury when he was allegedly thrown in his cot as a baby . He . suffered from severe muscle spasms, which often fractured and broke his . bones, and Joshua had numerous operations and procedures throughout his . life. When he was aged two, Joshua was fostered by Ms Cawley and she and partner Ms Wood adopted him when he was five, and provided him with 24-hour care. Tragic: Joshua's adoptive parents say his death has left a 'big hole' in their lives . Joshua attended Newfields School, in Darwen, Lancs, and the Nugent Centre, in Farnworth, Bolton. He had two adopted siblings and two birth siblings, who were adopted into a different family. Forensic pathologist Dr Daniel du Plessis, who specialises in child abuse cases, told his inquest the injuries that Joshua had sustained when he was a baby were 'strongly associated with child abuse' and injuries to his gum were often caused by forcing a dummy or bottle into a baby's mouth. He added the injuries 'involved shaking with an impact and that caused Joshua to stop breathing and that caused the brain damage that led to his disabled state and eventually the fatal pneumonia'. Dr du Plessis added that in his opinion it was 'non-accidental'. Joshua tragically passed away at his adopted home last June from a respiratory infection developed as a result of his severe disabilities - which Bolton's deputy coroner Alan Walsh said were caused by a 'non-accidental injury'. Mr Walsh, recording a narrative verdict, praised Joshua's adoptive parents and said their care had been 'magnificent' and said he could not speak highly enough for the care he received from various agencies in Bolton. He said Joshua was 'brave, courageous young man'. At Joshua's funeral at Bolton's St Andrew's Methodist Church - where he was described as 'a beloved son, brother, nephew and cousin, he was a friend and inspiration to so many' - friends were asked to celebrate 'his wonderful life' by wearing bright colours 'to reflect Joshua's wonderful personality.' Donations in Joshua's memory were used to buy much needed medical equipment in Haiti.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 10 January 2012 . A former squad mate of a Marine implicated in the deaths of 19 Iraqis testified today that after a roadside bombing, the group raced to nearby homes, firing and tossing grenades for 45 minutes even though the Marines did not take gunfire, cross a single insurgent or find a weapon. Still, former Cpl. Steven Tatum told the jury at the Camp Pendleton trial of Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich that he felt the squad did nothing wrong that day in Haditha in 2005. Marines killed 24 Iraqis, including unarmed women and children. On trial: Marine Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich arrives at the court in Camp Pendleton, California, with his lawyer Neal Puckett on Monday . Wuterich, who led the squad that day, faces nine counts of manslaughter. He is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the war. The squad was returning from a supply run at a combat outpost in the early morning when one of the four humvees in their convoy hit a roadside bomb, killing Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas and wounding two others. Tatum said he rushed to help someone trapped under the humvee when he heard small arms fire hit the vehicle in front of him. Wuterich and another Marine ran toward the nearest home. Tatum testified that when he caught up to Wuterich, the sergeant told him to 'treat the house as hostile'. Charged: Wuterich is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the Iraq war. He faces nine counts of manslaughter. Tatum said he understood that to mean there were armed individuals inside and he did not need to identify his target to attack. The Marines tossed grenades in rooms and fired off rounds. One man was killed near the kitchen. Others were killed in a back room, where Tatum fired alongside Wuterich but said he was unable to see what he was shooting at because of the darkness and flying debris after a grenade exploded. The Marines left when someone yelled that they had seen a person running out of the home. They ran to a neighboring house, tossing grenades in rooms and shooting off rounds. Tatum saw the body of an Iraqi man near the kitchen when he went in after his fellow Marines. While checking an empty room, Tatum said he heard people in a nearby room moving then Wuterich firing his M-16. He rushed to help him, shooting at what he said were silhouettes in the dark, some big, some small. 'The only thing that gave me any indication there was a hostile act in there would be Staff Sgt. Wuterich firing sir,' Tatum told military prosecutor Maj Nicholas Gannon. He returned later when the house had been determined to be safe and learned they had killed an unarmed woman and children in the room. The defense says Wuterich believed insurgents were in the homes and that's why he ordered his Marines to shoot first and ask questions later. Wuterich of Meriden, Connecticut, is the last defendant in one of the biggest criminal cases against U.S. troops from the war. Prosecutors have implicated him in 19 of 24 Iraqi deaths. Yesterday, Maj Gannon charged that Wuterich made a series of fatal assumptions and lost control of himself during the massacre. He made the accusations to a jury of battle-hardened Marines hearing the case against Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, more than six years after the squad committed the killings in the town of Haditha. Damaged: Two men survey the scene outside one of the houses in Haditha, Iraq where the Marines went on the rampage . 'The evidence will show that none of the victims were a threat,' Gannon told jurors in his opening statement. Prosecutors told the military jury of four officers and four enlisted Marines that Wuterich shot indiscriminately without taking time to identify his targets after a roadside bomb exploded and killed a Marine. The deadly attack known as the Haditha massacre occurred on November 19, 2005, led to the deaths of 24 Iraqis in total. Seven of them were children. The killings are considered among the Iraq war's defining moments, further tainting the U.S.’s reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. Sgt Frank Wuterich is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial. Six others had their charges either dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted. A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident. The story behind the killings was retold in Nick Broomfield's 2007 film Battle for Haditha. The prosecution has implicated Wuterich in the deaths of 19 of the 24 Iraqis killed that day, the Associated Press reports. Wuterich and another Marine fatally shot five men in a car near the site where the bomb went off, prosecutors said. Wuterich then ordered his squad to clear a nearby home with gunfire and grenades, telling them to shoot first and ask questions later, according to the prosecution. After killing men, women and children inside the first home, the Marines went to a second home, where Wuterich stood at the foot of a bed in a back bedroom, spraying a woman and children with bullets, Gannon said. The killings in Haditha on November 19, 2005, are considered among the war's defining moments, further tainting America's reputation when it was already at a low point after the release of photos of prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison. The massacre is believed to have been set off by the death of Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas who was driving a humvee that was destroyed by an IED. Two other soldiers in that humvee survived. Wuterich is accused of ordering a driver and four Iraqi teens out of a taxi nearby and gunning down each of them in the street. Both the defence and prosecutors agree that Terrazas' death influenced Wuterich's decisions later that day. In his opening statement, Wuterich's . attorney Haytham Faraj told jurors that Navy investigators, under . pressure to show the Marine Corps was not covering up the massacre, . brutally interrogated the other Marines in the squad for up to 14 hours . and offered to drop charges against them if they testified against their . squad leader. 'You have a bunch of scared Marines promised immunity who are going to tell you about things that did not happen,' Faraj said. The moment the roadside bomb exploded as depicted in the 2007 Nick Broomfield film Battle For Haditha . Another dramatic image from the film. Some observers believe the jury of combat Marines - many of whom cleared homes in Iraq - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war . Faraj, a retired Marine, asked jurors to apply their knowledge of the Marine Corps and combat experience when judging the case. He said Wuterich's battalion had been . told by commanders that intelligence indicated the city was becoming a . hotbed of insurgents. After the bomb exploded, the squad . came under small arms fire when Wuterich ordered the homes to be . cleared, believing there were insurgents hiding there, Faraj said. 'We . don't believe there was a crime committed here,' Faraj said. 'It was . the unfortunate result of an attempt to do the right thing, but it . turned out to be tragic.' Wuterich is charged with nine counts of voluntary manslaughter. He has said he regretted the loss of civilian lives but believed he was operating within military combat rules. He is the last of the eight Marines initially accused of murder or failure to investigate the killings to face trial. People who lost relatives sit outside one of the houses that was raided . Six had charges dropped or dismissed, and one was acquitted. Gannon said evidence will show Wuterich 'never lost control of his squad ... but he made a series of fatal assumptions and he lost control of himself.' Gannon also showed excerpts from an interview of Wuterich by '60 Minutes' in which he said he believed none of the Marines with him went against his orders. A full investigation didn't begin until a Time magazine reporter inquired about the deaths in January 2006, two months after the incident. Retired Army Col. Gregory Watt, who led the initial probe, testified that Wuterich told him that he had instructed his squad to go into the homes firing, recalling 'I told them to shoot first, ask questions later.' 'I clearly remember that,' Watt testified. 'Sgt Wuterich at the time was very straightforward, very professional and very forthcoming.' Watt added: 'He said that on more than one occasion as we talked through the events that transpired.' Unarmed victim: Maliya Abdul Hamid Hassan Ali shows a photo of her brother Rasheed, who died in the raid, and his wife Hibba Abdulah who survived . Army Lt Col David Mendelson, who assisted Watt in the investigation, told jurors he was surprised to hear that Wuterich had instructed his squad in that way and had acknowledged that he didn't positively identify his targets, a basic combat rule when deciding to use deadly fire. 'It seemed to show a lack of discipline and that essentially there were no rules... and that concerned me,' Mendelson testified. Legal experts say military prosecutors face an uphill battle trying to prove, so many years later, that Wuterich's actions were criminal. Wrangling over unaired outtakes of the 60 Minutes interview delayed the case from going to trial for years before prosecutors won the right to view the footage. Some believe the jury of combat Marines - many of whom cleared homes in Iraq like the operation Wuterich ordered - will be better equipped for the case over a civilian one in which people may not feel comfortable judging what is considered to be an appropriate reaction in the chaos of war. 'Military jurors may say, look tens of thousands of us went to war zones and didn't kill civilians, but they may also be willing to consider the fact that the individual may have been caught in the fog of war,' said former Navy officer David Glazier, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.","Former Cpl Steven Tatum testifies that 'the only indication of a hostile act' was defendant Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich .

And the facility wasted no time in getting the actress stuck into the program. She checked into Morningside Recovery at 8.45am and was scheduled to meet with a psychiatrist later that day, according to her lawyer. Getting help: Lindsay Lohan's lawyer Mark Heller (L) appeared in court on Thursday morning while at the same time the actress was entering a rehab facility . The 26-year-old was sentenced to the stint in the facility . after pleading no contest to charges for lying to police about driving . during a car crash last June. At the exact time Lindsay was entering the California based centre, her lawyer Mark Heller was in court. Lindsay switched facilities after deciding she didn’t want to attend New York based rehab Seafield because it banned smoking. Checking in: According to reports Lindsay entered the California centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint . Under fire: It has been claimed that Morningside Recovery cannot offer treatment after its licence was revoked . As going to a different centre that . was not approved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, the . star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge. Heller, who wore an eyesore of a tie in . red and black stripes for the hearing, was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney . to approve of the switch. He argued that as Lindsay has already . entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities. Revoked: The Newport Beach rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients . Orange County's finest: Police were seen surrounding Morningside as Lindsay checked in . Lindsay's living quarters: The rehab facility features quaint interiors, as this photograph reveals . ‘She's . going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, . reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment’. It comes amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012. According . to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found . to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints . of the licence. Starting off on the right foot: Heller claims that Lindsay will be meeting with a psychiatrist later in the day . Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already . The Deputy Director of Licensing and . Certificates at the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs . told the website: ‘Morningside cannot give any treatment,’ as the rehab . centre is allegedly only allowed to provide a sober living facility. A representative clarified to Radar Online that it can, however treat outpatients. 'Morningside can’t provide residential treatment to anyone, but they can provide outpatient services,' the rep explained. The . judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to . that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not one on a list . of six centres approved by the court. Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision . Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved . ‘It . does appear to comply,’ Judge Dabney said, adding that the prosecution . had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre . being approved. ‘I don't have any problems with Miss Lohan remaining in this program until the issue is resolved,’ he said. ‘If . we decide the program does not meet the requirements of the plea . agreement then she will have to move to a different program.’ Nicotine fix: It has been claimed that Lindsay switched facilities as the centre she was scheduled to stay in had a no-smoking ban . Staying put: The Liz & Dick star will stay in the California facility until a decision has been made by the court . He . explained: 'The issue is going to be whether or not we need to set a . hearing because the people are complaining [the centre] does not fit the . parameters.' TMZ however alleges that Lindsay never entered the facility at all and instead was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store in Fountain Valley at 9am, while Heller was in court stating she had checked into rehab. Heller and Terry White of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on May 10, at which point it will be determined whether or not they will set a date for a restitution hearing. Lindsay's lawyer said he has faith . that Morningside will be approved, even though White claimed he had . three separate news articles which showed the facility in a bad light. Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking . 'If [White] says he's satisfied then I don't think we have to come back,' Heller said, adding, 'I'm 100% sure he will be satisfied.' Heller then claimed that he will 'make sure [Lindsay] stays in therapy', and had called in the COO of Morningside in the hope that she could win over White. The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'. In addition, none of the star's progress reports are to be released to the public aside from 'proof of completion' at the end of her stay. '90 days and 270 looks': Lindsay posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on Instagram on Tuesday night .","Actress checked into Morningside Recovery at 8.45am on Thursday for 90 days of court-ordered rehab .

Killer: Jeremy Bamber, pictured in 2002, is appealing against his 'inhuman' whole life sentence despite committing multiple murders . Mass killer Jeremy Bamber is to appeal against the decision to put him behind bars for the rest of his life because it is 'inhuman and degrading,' it was revealed today. In November the 51-year-old, who murdered his parents, his sister and her two children in 1985, will have his case heard in Strasbourg's Grand Chamber, the appeal court of the European Court of Human Rights. Two other British killers will also appeal in cases that will test whether the UK’s law allowing the most dangerous offenders to be sentenced to whole life tariffs, with almost no chance of release, is cruel. Bamber has appealed again after Europe’s human rights judges ruled in January that Britain’s most notorious criminals could be kept behind bars for the rest of their lives. The European Court of Human Rights held by four votes to three that there had been no violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is enshrined in UK law under the Human Rights Act and prohibits 'inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'. Condemning people to die in jail was not 'grossly disproportionate' and in each case London’s High Court had 'decided that an all-life tariff was required, relatively recently and following a fair and detailed consideration', the judges ruled. This will now be tested by the court’s Grand Chamber after a panel of five judges also granted the appeal by killer Douglas Vinter, who stabbed his wife in February 2008. Peter Moore's sentence, handed down after he killed four gay men for his sexual gratification in 1995, will also be considered by the Grand Chamber judges. Bamber’s solicitor, Simon McKay, said today: 'He’s obviously delighted with the decision. Case: Judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, pictured, will here the case of Bamber and two other murderers in November . 'It demonstrates that his case remains arguable and he looks forward to presenting his position at the Grand Chamber in due course.' Mr McKay went on: 'It is part of his long battle to challenge the home secretary of the day going beyond what the trial judge said would be the appropriate sentence he should receive. 'He’s encouraged by it, but he’s realistic and acknowledges that it’s just another stepping point. 'The final analysis will depend on what the Grand Chamber says in the end.' Bamber’s legal team originally submitted the application to the ECHR in December 2009. But their claims were strongly opposed by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, who has said the Government has been 'fighting the case vigorously and defending the principle of the whole-life tariff.' Under current law, whole-life tariff prisoners will almost certainly never be released from prison as their offences are deemed to be so serious. They can be freed only by the Justice Secretary, who can give discretion on compassionate grounds when the prisoner is terminally ill or seriously incapacitated. Scandal: A sobbing Jeremy Bamber with his girlfriend Julie Mugford at his family's funeral in 1985 but a year later he was convicted of their murders . Cold-blooded: Jeremy Bamber murdered his parents Nevill and June Bamber, left, and sister Sheila and her children Daniel and Nicholas, right, but wants to be released from prison before he dies . Bamber has been behind bars for more than 25 years for shooting his wealthy adopted parents June and Neville, his sister Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons Daniel and Nicholas at their farmhouse in Tolleshunt D’Arcy, Essex. The 51-year-old was given a whole-life tariff after being convicted of the murders in October 1986. But he has always protested his innocence and claims his schizophrenic sister Ms Caffell shot her family before turning the gun on herself in a remote Essex farmhouse. In 2009, Bamber lost a Court of Appeal challenge against the order that he must die behind bars. He has twice lost appeals against conviction. Vinter was released from prison after serving nine years for the 1995 murder of work colleague Carl Edon, 22. Three years later he stabbed wife Anne White four times and strangled her, before being given a whole-life order. Moore was convicted of four counts of murder in 1996 after killing four gay men for his sexual gratification. It is the latest case where Europe’s human rights court could try to overrule British judges. In May, judges at the European Court of Human Rights once again ruled against Britain’s blanket ban on prisoners voting and gave the Government six months to change the law. Prime Minister David Cameron has said the idea of relaxing the ban 'makes me physically ill' and officials are working out how to respond to the court’s demand.","Grand Chamber of European Court of Human Rights will consider his case and that of two other British killers in November .

Archaeologists who are digging for the remains of the real-life Mona Lisa have found a female skeleton - but sadly they do not believe these are bones of Leonardo da Vinci's muse. Researcher Silvano Vinceti, leading the digs under a former convent in central Florence, believes the body he has found is that of a woman who lived decades after Lisa Gherardini, the woman many experts believe sat for da Vinci's iconic painting. So far the team - who have been criticised in some corners for their methodology - have discovered four remains under the convent.

A teenager who put a man through two months of torment by falsely accusing him of rape has been spared jail. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been forced to have sex against her will with a man she had only just met in the pub. But two months later her conscience got the better of her and she wrote a letter to the police confessing she had lied about the allegations. Hooper had claimed she went with the unnamed man to his home where he held her down by the neck on his bed and raped her. After she called police, who came out in the middle of the night, the man was arrested and held in custody for more than seven hours. Sophie Hooper, 19, told police she had been raped but two months later confessed that she had lied. She escaped a jail sentence at Southampton Crown Court today . Victims and alleged victims of rape have been granted anonymity since 1976 to spare women from humiliation and encourage more victims to report attacks.The law originally gave the same protection to those charged with rape.But anonymity for defendants was withdrawn in 1988 after judges protested that it prevented police from appealing for witnesses.Judges also said that the acquittal of a man charged with rape was enough to clear his name and reputation.Maura McGowan, a deputy High Court judge and chief of the professional body for barristers, recently called for the identities of men accused of rape and other sex crimes to be kept secret unless they are found guilty in court.The leading lawyer said the names of those charged with sex offences should not be released because the crimes carry 'such a stigma’. But John Cooper, a human rights barrister, disagreed with this and said anonymity for people accused of sex crimes is 'unworkable'. But there was no truth in Hooper's . allegations. She didn't admit this for over two months, before she eventually told police she was lying. Southampton Crown Court heard how police began investigating and found inconsistencies with her version of events. Hooper accused the man of raping her in June 2011 but by August that year officers told him he wouldn't face prosecution. ]A . short time later police received a letter from Hooper, who has just . become a mum, in which she said 'maybe calling it rape was wrong'. The teenager from Eastleigh, Hampshire, was later arrested in September 2011 on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. But it wasn't until January 2012 that 'she fully accepted the lies she had told' said prosecutor Carolyn Branford-Wood.Hooper . revealed how, in fact, the pair had gone to his home from the pub, . began kissing and the sex 'just happened', adding she didn't say yes or . no. When she left his home she returned to the pub run by friends of her family who told her she had been raped and to call 999. In . court Hooper apologised by saying 'I shouldn't have lied, I am sorry' and added that if she could turn the clock back she would. The . court was told how the man described in a victim impact statement . feeling 'sick to the stomach' and anxious following the accusation. He was also unable to go out because, even though he knew he was innocent, he felt he would be tarred. He said he could not sleep properly and resorted to taking anti-depressants. Mitigating . for Hooper, Fern Russell said it was not a sophisticated plot - she was . in a state and made a bad decision out of stupidity rather than malice. Recorder Stuart Jones QC handed the teenager an eight-month prison term suspended for two years. He told her she was lucky not to have gone to jail for what the court deems a very serious offence. Crying wolf: Sophie Hooper, 19, appeared at Southampton Crown Court yesterday . Mr Jones said: 'The consequences for the man accused must have been traumatic in the extreme.' He added that Hooper had just come out of a difficult period of adolescence and her mental health was far from robust. The teenager was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work.","Sophie Hooper, 19, accused an unnamed man of raping her after a night out .

A violin handed into a lost property office by a member of the public turned out to be a multimillion-pound Stradivarius. The owner of the instrument loaned it to a friend last week and the hapless musician left it on a train in Bern, Switzerland. Police officers made an appeal to the public to find the valuable violin and released CCTV footage showing a passenger walking off with it at a different station. Strings attached: The Stradivarius is one of the most expensive items ever handed into a lost property office . Luckily for the owner and his terrified friend, the violin became one of the most expensive items ever handed into a lost property office on Sunday. The police are refusing to give a value on the violin, which is thought to be worth millions of pounds, with the Stradivarius  regarded as the 'Mona Lisa' of stringed instruments. Antonio Stradivari, who lived from 1644 to 1737, is the world's most famous luthier [stringed instrument maker] and is thought to have made around 1,100 instruments during his career. There are thought to be just 600 left, with the fabled violins attracting global interest on the rare occasions they come onto the market. Last year, a 1721 Stradivarius dubbed the 'Lady Blunt' fetched a world record £9.8million with all proceeds going to victims of the Japanese tsunami. A 1716 Stradivari known as the 'Messiah' was bequeathed to The Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, on the condition it can never be played. Desperate search: The instrument was lost by one of the owner's musician friends on a train in Bern in Switzerland, pictured . In 2008, US violinist Philippe Quint left a 290-year-old Stradivari worth £2.5m in the back of a New York taxi. The honest cab driver, Mohamed Khalil, got in touch the next day to return it - and Mr Quint gave him £50 and a 30-minute private performance as a reward. In another mishap in May, an extremely rare Stradivarius cello worth around £13million is reported to have broken while it was being handled by experts during a photoshoot at the Spanish Royal Palace in Madrid. Scientists recently spent two years using 1,000 x-ray images and high-tech computer-aided carving tools to 'recreate' the famous instrument. Antonio Stradivarius, history's greatest violin-maker, made around 1,000 cellos, violins lutes, mandolins, guitars and harps in 17th and 18th century Italy. They are considered the finest instruments ever made, with a uniquely sweet sound that still sets the standard today. The superior quality is thought to have been obtained using a specific density of wood; with shape, arching and wood thickness also important. Today, Stradivarius instruments are prized possessions housed in museums and personal collections around the world. About 650 still exist and they are highly prized for their beautiful form and sound.","CCTV footage showed a passenger walking off with it at another station .

Councillor Collin Brewer's remarks were described as 'depraved' but he is refusing to quit . A councillor told a charity worker who helps youngsters with special needs that 'disabled children cost the council too much money and should be put down'. Collin Brewer, 68, an independent councillor at Cornwall Council, has refused to stand down after making the 'depraved' remark to the member of a charity during an information event. What he said has received wide-spread condemnation including that of Katie Price whose son, Harvey, is severely disabled. Mr Brewer admitted that he made the comment to 'provoke a reaction' and has now been forced to apologise in writing for the offensive remark. However, he remains defiant and refuses to stand down saying: 'It is not something I would consider resigning over. I believe I am doing a good job.' He said at his home yesterday: ‘We had had a difficult morning deciding on budget and job cuts. I listened to one of the ladies on the Disability Cornwall stall and came out with the comment. If only I had not said that. The comment was made to Theresa Court, advice services manager of Disability Cornwall which complained to the council's standards committee. Ms Court said: 'I was absolutely horrified anyone would make such a depraved comment, let alone a Cornwall councillor at a public event. 'As far as I was concerned, I had a duty to make a formal complaint against Councillor Brewer to seek appropriate justice.' Her charity had a stand at an information event in Truro in October 2011. She was on hand to tell councillors about the issues they face and the work they do with parents of children with special needs. Mr Brewer approached the stand, where there were parents of disabled children, and asked what the charity did. According to Ms Court he said that children with special needs cost too much money. Fortunately, she added, none of the parents heard his comments. She said: 'I couldn't believe it. It's taken a year and a half for him to be told that he has to write an apology. The apology was an insult. 'It came with a second class stamp and it was folded up into eight small bits. He might as well have screwed it up. I can't believe that the only thing he has had to to is write an apology.He needs to re-think his job.' Katie Price tweeted her disgust at Mr Brewer's comments .

Doughty said: 'As director of children's services for Cornwall Council I . am shocked and disappointed by the remarks made by Councillor Brewer. 'The comments were cruel and ignorant and are contrary to the Council’s policy of supporting all people with disabilities.

In . that meeting he heard that some disabled children were being moved out . of the county for care which was 'incurring additional expense'. In . a letter to the charity Mr Brewer said: 'I am writing to offer my . wholehearted apologies for the offences these remarks have clearly . caused. 'While I meant no . offence by my remarks to you, I can see, in retrospect, that they were . ill-judged and insensitive and should not have been made at all.' Councillor Jan Powell, a Liberal . Democrat on Cornwall Council, said: 'I'm shocked. I can't believe that a . councillor could even contemplate saying something like that even to . stimulate debate. For me it is a resignation issue.'

I listened to one of the ladies on the Disability Cornwall stall . and came out with the comment. If only I had not said that. 'I didn't mean it. I did it to provoke a response and debate the issue of service costs provision. 'It backfired. I was treating her with a lack of respect and I shouldn't have done it. I meant no offence.

EasyJet is putting an end to the boarding gate scrum by giving customers free allocated seats on all its flights, but those who want to guarantee where they sit must pay. Later this month passengers will be able to choose between free, £3, £8 or £12 seats, depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft. Anyone who chooses not to pay and select a seat will be allocated a free place when they check in online or at the airport. Boarding scrum: The new seating policy will put an end to the boarding gate scrum later this month as passengers will be able to choose between free, £3, £8 or £12 seats, depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft . The £12 most expensive seats will be in the front row and exit positions, with extra legroom. While the £8 seats are in the first few rows of the plane. Any other seat will cost £3. The first allocated seat flights will take off from Gatwick South, Luton, Stansted, Southend, Bristol and Glasgow airports from 13 November. Pay to sit: EasyJet is giving customers free allocated seats on all its flights, but those who want to guarantee where they sit must pay . Family or friends wanting to guarantee they could sit together would need to pay £3 per person each way for a standard seat each. However, easyJet said during its trial most people did not pre-book seats and simply waited to be allocated them at the airport, allowing passengers to sit with those they checked in with for no extra cost. EasyJet trialled allocated seating during the summer season and announced last month that it would be rolling it out across all its flights. Ready for lift-off: EasyJet trialled the allocated seating during the summer season and claimed that 70 per cent of passengers on trial routes thought it was a better system than easyJet's current system . The airline claims that research gathered as part of the trial showed that more than 70 per cent of passengers on trial routes thought the allocated seating was better than easyJet’s current system due to an improved boarding experience and more than 60 per cent said that they were more likely to use easyJet in the future. The move is likely to further narrow the price gap between traditional airlines and low-cost carriers for passengers who do choose to buy allocated seating. A . family of four would need to pay £24 on top of the cost of a return . flight - the same additional cost a single passenger choosing an extra . legroom seat for a return journey would pay. Musical chairs: Seating allocation policies vary from airline to airline . Airlines are increasingly under . pressure to come up with new ways of attracting passengers, as rising . jet fuel prices, taxes and airport taxes increase the cost of air . travel. Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, said: 'Allocated seating gives all our passengers a better boarding experience and offers the choice of selecting a seat to those who want to. On trial flights the majority of passengers were simply allocated seats when they checked in. 'Some passengers chose particular seats with bestselling seats usually those near the front, for those who wish to get off the aircraft quickly at their destinations, and exit row seats with their extra legroom.'","Passengers will be able to choose between free, £3, £8 or £12 seats depending on where they want to sit on the aircraft .

Iona Heaton, 44, who rakes in tens of thousands of pounds a year in state handouts, is hoping to add to her burgeoning family with a baby girl and says she will demand fertility treatment on the NHS if she has any problems conceiving. Miss Heaton, who had her eldest child when she was aged 19 and has never worked, made the decision after the family’s benefit bill of £30,000 was reduced. Iona Heaton, pictured pregnant with 10th child, hopes to add to her burgeoning family with a baby girl after the family's benefit bill of £30,000 was reduced . Ms Heaton said nothing can stop her from having more children. Pictured (from left) Jade, Iona, Shannon, Zak, Kian, Paul holding Kaiden, Sean, (front row from left) Keegan, Elle and Cain . She said: ‘I just love being pregnant – being a mum is what I am good at and I don’t care what anybody thinks. I will have as many children as I want. ‘The benefits help us to take care of our children and it doesn’t matter if the Government decides to cut ours, I am still going to try to  have another.’ Miss Heaton and boyfriend Paul Brown, 46, already have seven children – Caolan, seven months, Kaiden, 19 months, Zak, three, Keegan, four, Kian, five, Elle, seven, and Kain, eight. Miss Heaton’s eldest three – Sean, 25, Jade, 18, herself a new mother, and Shannon, 17, who is pregnant – are from a previous relationship. Miss Heaton said: ‘I don’t feel I’m being irresponsible because this is what I do for a living – I’m a professional mum. ‘I’m sure I won’t have any problems getting pregnant again but if I need some help then yes I’ll just ask for [fertility] treatment.’ Iona Heaton, pictured with Paul and seven of their children, said she was a 'professional mum' The family were moved out of their terraced house into a £180,000 semi-detached after she complained . The couple, who own a 12-seater Land Rover, spend upwards of £1,000 every Christmas . Last year, while pregnant with her tenth child, Miss Heaton demanded a bigger council house in the countryside after complaining that her terraced house was damp and cold. The couple now live in a spacious three bedroom semi-detached home with large gardens worth more than £180,000 in a leafy part of Blackburn, Lancashire. The house has a wide flat-screen TV, computers, Nintendo Wii, digital camera and iPhone and the family take a two-week holiday to Pontins in Southport each year. They receive £279 disability allowance each month because their daughter Elle has epilepsy, £400 a month in child benefits and a further £1,200 a month from child tax credits, plus other benefits. Their annual handouts were cut to just over £21,600 when Mr Brown, 46, took on extra work as a metal polisher. But since having another child he has reduced his hours resulting in the family’s handouts returning to about £25,000, Miss Heaton said. This means they are unlikely to be affected by the Government’s upcoming £500-a-week benefits cap. Miss Heaton says her partner’s £1,000-a-month income is not enough despite lavishing her children with expensive gifts at Christmas and taking the whole family on a two-week holiday every year. She added: ‘We just wouldn’t be able to survive on his wage alone. I help to pay the rent and bills with the benefits and it costs a lot to feed and clothe so many children. ‘We need the money to pay for things – there’s nothing wrong with that.’ The couple, who own a 12-seater Land Rover, spend upwards of £1,000 every Christmas. Ms Heaton, pictured pregnant with her tenth child, said she always wanted a big family . Last year, some of the gifts they bought their children included a pool table, bicycles, remote- controlled cars and large dolls’ houses. Miss Heaton said: ‘I’m going to get a bigger pool table for them this year. I like treating them at Christmas. ‘We love our children. They’re not starving or under-clothed. People will probably have their opinions, but each to their own.’ Miss Heaton, herself one of eight children, has a younger jobless sister, Sinead, who has nine offspring. The family moved into their current privately rented property with large gardens three months ago and Miss Heaton said that she helps to pay the £700 per month rent with her benefits. The boys now share two spacious double bedrooms with the new baby in a cot in the room Miss Heaton shares with Mr Brown. She said: ‘If I could I would move into the countryside but for the moment this house is nice and  the children love playing out in the big gardens.’ Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s time to end a culture where some can simply ignore the cost of having a child where others are forced to scrimp, save and cut back to afford to start a family. ‘Welfare should not be an alternative to work yet clearly it is for Iona Heaton. The system should help someone find employment, not subsidise them to avoid it.’","Iona Heaton, 44, wants NHS fertility treatment to conceive 11th child .

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Targeted? Mohamed Salim, a Northern Virginia cab driver, says a customer assaulted him after a heated conversation about Salim's Muslim beliefs . The 39-year-old father of four had such a bad feeling, he says, that he started taping their conversation with his cell phone. ‘I suspected the guy was going to make trouble,’ Salim said.

Manipulator: Paedophile John Thompson, 61, who was spared jail back in July despite admitting sexually assaulting a girl, 7,has now threatened to sue his victim . A paedophile is planning to sue his seven-year-old victim despite admitting sexually assaulting her and being sentenced for his attack earlier this year, a court heard. Manipulative John Thompson, 61, was spared jail in July after he insisted he was unable to fight off the young girl, claiming that she ‘flirted’ with him, pinned him to a bed and forced her tongue into his mouth. He was given an eight-month suspended sentence, provoking condemnation from child protection officials who called his claims ‘outrageous’ and said he should have been jailed. At his sentencing, Thompson, of Hartlepool, was also given a treatment order, supervision and a ban on contact with under-16s. Within a month of his court appearance, Thompson failed to turn up at a meeting with a probation worker and when he attended others he was said to be uncooperative and hostile. Nigel Soppitt, prosecuting, told Teesside Crown court on Friday that officials from the Probation Service consider the order to be unworkable because of Thompson’s attitude. He has now said he is innocent, had received bad legal advice before he admitted the offence and is threatening to sue the schoolgirl for making the allegation against him. Judge Gillian Matthews, who passed the original sentence, told Thompson he was spared jail in the summer only because she wanted him to go on the treatment course. She said: “Your approach to the Probation Service has been absolutely disgraceful...you have to engage with them. 'If you do not, you will go to prison. 'I am not having this attitude you have displayed at appointments. You have got one more chance - that’s it. 'If you do not turn up with a better attitude, you will then go to prison.' Pervert: Teesside Crown Court (pictured) heard that Thompson has been hostile to probation services . Judge Matthews will have an update in a month, during which time Thompson, of Hartlepool, will have had another opportunity to take part in the programme. She said: “He is already complaining about his legal team, saying he should not have pleaded guilty and that he will sue the complainant - all classic traits of a paedophile.' Lorraine Mustard, for Thompson, said he client struggled to understand the terms of the suspended sentence order, but that he was now in no doubt what would happen if he failed again. She said: “He understands that the Probation Service have to confront him with some very difficult issues and the fact he feels uncomfortable about them is neither here nor there.

'Weird nation': Britons are 'weird' when it comes to food, according to health minister Anna Soubry . A minister has described office workers' lunchtime habit of eating a sandwich at their desk as 'disgusting'. Health minister Anna Soubry said busy workers should not eat over their computer keyboards, but should take a proper lunch break to give them time to 'enjoy' their food. But research has shown that 60 per cent of workers eat their lunch at their desk every day, with many admitting they would feel 'guilty' if they left the office for an hour. Ms Soubry's comments came after she sparked controversy by suggesting that poor people were more likely to be obese. The minister said it was ironic that Britons enjoy watching celebrity chefs like Jamie Oliver in action on the television, yet 'we don't as a nation, any more, cook'. Highlighting Britain's 'weird' relationship with food, the MP urged people to take more time to prepare and savour their meals. 'We are a weird nation,' Ms Soubry said. 'We consume television programmes about cooking, all the books, but we don't as a nation, any more, cook.' Ms Soubry - who revealed she has forbidden the use of the word 'fat' in her home to try and prevent her daughters from becoming obsessed with their weight - said she encouraged staff at her constituency office in Nottingham to take time out for a meal at lunchtime. 'It's disgusting eating over a keyboard,' she said, adding that a proper lunch break provided workers with time to 'chill out, get your head back together, and enjoy what you're eating'. However, the Broxtowe MP does admit to eating lunch in her office herself, a report in the Daily Telegraph said. Research has shown that some stressed-out employees work the equivalent of 16 extra days per year for free by refusing to take a lunch break and eating at their desk instead. 'It's disgusting eating over a keyboard' Health minister Anna Soubry . A poll of 1,000 people revealed 60 . per cent eat their lunch at their desk every day, while two thirds take a . break of 30 minutes or less despite being entitled to a full hour. The sacrificed break time adds up to an extra 128 hours of work per year - equivalent to 16 eight hour days. Ms Soubry said employees were working for free instead of taking a proper lunch was 'mad' and 'wrong'. 'Disgusting': Anna Soubry said office workers should take proper lunch breaks rather than eating sandwiches over their computer keyboards . Award-winning dietician Azmina Govindji said she 'absolutely agreed' that eating lunch at your desk was unhealthy, but added: 'I don't think in this day and age people expect to go out for an hour and have a jolly old time like they do in France. 'When you eat at your desk you aren't really focused on the quality or quantity of your food, and can end up eating more,' said the dietician. 'It's very sensible to take a proper lunch break, but on the flip side it isn't always practical,' said Ms Govindji, who is a spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association. The crumbs that accumulate on your desk and in your keyboard provide a perfect environment for bacteria and fungi to thrive, says Dr Ron Cutler, a micro- biologist at Queen Mary University of London. The temperature in offices is typically around 20C, the point at which staphylococcus can breed, causing diarrhoea and vomiting — which is why leaving your sandwich on your desk all morning is also a risk. Your risk of catching your colleagues’ bugs are also higher in an open-plan office, says  Dr Cutler. ‘If you are coughing and spluttering, do everyone a favour and go home. 'The particle matter in a sneeze can travel more than three metres in any direction.’ And the more people who share office equipment or desks, the greater the risk of catching a bug. ‘Faecal contamination has been found in the office environment and on phones, so the more people use certain equipment, the more germs will be on it,’ says Dr Cutler. She recommended that people with hectic lifestyles and stressful jobs make an effort to ensure that, if they are eating lunch at their desk, the meal is as healthy as possible. 'You could make your lunch the night before, swapping white bread for wholemeal and mayonnaise for honey and mustard dressing,' said Ms Govindji, who added that desk-bound employees should make an effort to pop outside at some point during their working day, even if only for a few minutes. Ms Soubry, 56, suggested earlier this week that a person's weight could be an indication of their social background. The outspoken minister said people from poor families were more likely to be obese, and . that it was 'almost possible' to guess a person's background by their . size. Speaking at an event in London hosted by the Food and Drink Federation, Ms Soubry said parents had the ‘primary responsibility’ of ensuring their children ate properly. PR assistant Tammy Phillips, 24, from Birmingham, hasn't taken a lunch break in two years. 'The way I view it is that I can get on with work when its quieter at lunch time and it never hurts your career for the bosses to see you at your desk when your colleagues swan out for a sandwich,' she said. 'The competition for jobs now is so fierce that I’ve known friends who have quit smoking because they don’t want to be seen to be popping out for fag breaks during the day. 'I want to get ahead and further my career and I’ll take my lunch break when I’m the boss.' ‘It is a heartbreaking fact that people who are some of the most deprived in our society are living on an inadequate diet,' she said. 'But this time it’s an abundance of bad food. When I was at school you could tell the demography of children by how thin they were. You could see by looking at their eyes. ‘When I go to my constituency, in fact when I walk around, you can almost now tell somebody’s background by their weight. ‘Obviously, not everybody who is overweight comes from deprived backgrounds but that’s where the propensity lies,' she added. The minister said she regularly saw children in her constituency buying fatty snacks such as crisps for their breakfast. ‘Where I am in Nottingham, there is a Sainsbury’s and you see children going in there buying take away food, a sandwich, but more likely a packet of crisps, a fizzy drink, and that’s their breakfast,' she said. The health minister said she also regularly spotted parents buying their children cheap, fat-laden buns to eat for breakfast on her way to work at Westminster. The ‘whole concept’ of getting up in the morning in time to eat a proper breakfast had disappeared, she said. Ms Soubry has also warned of the negative impact of the culture of TV dinners. Set mealtimes help to provide structure in children's lives and discourage them from snacking on crisps and fast food, she said.","Health minister Anna Soubry criticised Britain's 'weird' relationship with food .

Playing a violent video game for just an hour over a three-day period is enough to increase aggressive behaviour, according to a new study. However, playing a non-violent video game, such as a racing game, has no effect on aggression when played for 20 minutes a day for three consecutive days. Although previous studies have revealed a single violent gaming session can increase short-term aggression, this is the first to show longer-term effects. Test: Students were asked to play a violent video game such as Call of Duty 4 (pictured) or a non-violent title such as the racing game Dirt 2 . Lead author Professor Brad Bushman, of Ohio State University, USA, compares the effect to smoking: 'It's important to know the long-term causal effects of violent video games, because so many young people regularly play these games. 'Playing video games could be compared to smoking cigarettes. A single cigarette won't cause lung cancer, but smoking over weeks or months or years greatly increases the risk. 'In the same way, repeated exposure to violent video games may have a cumulative effect on aggression.' A total of 70 French university students were told they would be taking part in a three-day study on the effects of brightness of video games on visual perception. They were then told to play either a violent or non-violent game for 20 minutes everyday for three consecutive days by the researchers from the University Pierre Mendhs-France and the University of Hohenheim, Germany. The violent video games in the study for the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology were Condemned 2, Call of Duty 4 and The Club, while those in the non-violent group played S3K Superbike, Dirt2 and Pure. After playing each game, the students were given the beginning of a story, and then asked to list 20 things the main character will do or say as the story unfolds to measure their hostile expectations. In one story, a driver crashes into the back of the protagonist's car - causing significant damage - and the researchers counted how many times the students listed violent or aggressive actions and words that might occur. People who have a steady diet of playing these violent games may come to see the world as a hostile place, say scientists . The students then participated in a competitive reaction time task, which is used to measure aggression, with each participant told they would compete against an unseen opponent in a computer game where the object was to be the first to respond to a visual cue on the screen. The loser received a blast of unpleasant noise through headphones - such as nails on a chalk board or sirens - and the winner decided how loud and long the blast would be. In reality, there was no opponent and the participants were told they won about half the trials. Results showed that after each day, those who played the violent games had an increase in their hostile expectations - meaning they were more likely to think the characters would react with aggression or violence. Prof Bushman said: 'People who have a steady diet of playing these violent games may come to see the world as a hostile and violent place. 'These results suggest there could be a cumulative effect. Hostile expectations are probably not the only reason that players of violent games are more aggressive, but our study suggests it is certainly one important factor. 'After playing a violent video game, we found that people expect others to behave aggressively. 'That expectation may make them more defensive and more likely to respond with aggression themselves, as we saw in this study and in other studies we have conducted.' He said it is 'impossible' to know how much aggression could increase for those who play video games for months or years, as most people do. 'We would know more if we could test players for longer periods of time, but that isn't practical or ethical. 'I would expect that the increase in aggression would accumulate for more than three days. It may eventually level off. 'However, there is no theoretical reason to think that aggression would decrease over time, as long as players are still playing the violent games.'","University students were asked to play a violent video game or a driving game over three days .

She was kept in the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital for three weeks and had chemotherapy to suppress her immune system. Mia now takes daily chemotherapy tablets and receives regular blood tests. As she has a suppressed immune system it means a common cold could develop into pneumonia.

It most commonly affects young women. It is a complex and poorly understood condition but occurs when the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, tissue and organs. It causes three main symptoms - fatigue, joint pain and skin rashes. The severity of the symptoms can vary from person to person. People can experience a mild form of the condition with 'flare-ups'. There is currently no cure but there are a number of treatments to help manage the symptoms. For more information on lupus visit lupusuk.org.uk .

The 24-year-old said her mother, Karnamaya Mongar, who said she couldn't afford to have another baby in her new country, went to Gonsell's clinic on November 19 2009 out of desperation on discovering she was 16 weeks pregnant. Devastated: Yashoda Gurung testified in court today about the death of her mother Karnamaya at a Philadelphia abortion clinic . On trial: Kermit Gosnell, pictured, is accused of killing babies at the Philadelphia Women’s Medical Society clinic as well as being responsible for the death of the 41-year-old . She had only been in the U.S. six months as a political refugee from her native Nepal and had been refused treatment at two other clinics. 'She said 'We're just getting started here,' Gurung said. Gurung, of Woodbridge, Virginia, testified through a Nepalese translator . and wept when the court was shown a smiling photograph of her mother . and father Ash Mongar - new immigrants posing inside the Smithsonian's . air and space museum. She said a female worker had tried to calm her when she heard ambulance sirens outside the clinic: . Karnamaya, who had three children, allegedly died from an overdose of anesthetic drug Demerol  at the clinic. According to her daughter, the 41-year-old waited for hours for doctor Gosnell to arrive for the procedure. She said untrained assistants gave her mother labor inducing drugs and painkillers while she was waiting. Killed: Nepalese mother-of-three Karnamaya Mongar, pictured with her husband, died while undergoing an abortion at a Philadelphia clinic . Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there . 'House of horrors': A former employee claimed he saw 100 live babies killed at the clinic, pictured . Firefighters had to cut bolts off the side door of the clinic to take her to hospital. She died the next day at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Gosnell charged with her death and the murder of seven babies born alive at the premises. If the jury finds him guilty the 72-year-old could be sentenced to death. Karnamaya's family also has a wrongful-death lawsuit pending against the doctor. 'I want justice,' Gurung told CBS. Gosnell denies the charges.","Yashoda Gurung's mother Karnamaya Mongar died after undergoing an abortion .

Within the privacy of his consulting room at a Doncaster area village surgery, Gousul Islam serially groped teenage girls and young women . A lecherous GP who sexually assaulted women patients during medical examinations over three decades was jailed for 11 years yesterday. Dr Gousul Islam, 70, regularly made inappropriate comments and propositioned patients and staff for sex. In his consulting room at a village surgery, he serially groped teenage girls and young women. Under the pretext of examinations, he fondled their breasts, stroked their thighs and touched them intimately. The doctor asked the women to undress in his presence without a screen and lie on his treatment couch without a blanket or towel to protect their modesty. Judge Simon Lawler said this was the ‘worst case of its kind by a professional man’ he had  encountered in 40 years. Sheffield Crown Court heard that Islam single-handedly ran the Lyndhurst surgery in Stainforth, Doncaster, until 2009. He asked one teenager to ‘strip off and go upstairs with him’ at his surgery and told her: ‘You are fit, you are stunning, you are beautiful.’ Islam repeatedly asked her to go on weekends away or watch videos with him at his house and told her he was not interested in his wife. When she was seven months pregnant he jabbed her in the stomach and said: ‘What are you doing with that thing inside you? Get rid! I can’t do anything with you with that inside you.’ She said she was subjected to more than 30 unwarranted examinations from the age of 14 to 22. Another patient, an attractive blonde, blamed Islam for ruining her sex life and wrecking her marriage, throughout which she remained a virgin. She said she went to the doctor in her 20s over her problems with intercourse and the GP told her: ‘Silly girl, your partner must be tearing his hair out.’ The woman said he made her feel like a ‘freak’ and he even examined her ‘down below’ when she complained of a sore throat. She said: ‘You knew he was going to have a quick feel. You just knew what was coming.’ Judge Simon Lawler jailed Gousul Islam for 11 years for indecently assaulting seven patients. Speaking at Sheffield Crown Court, the judge called Islam's actions 'the grossest possible breach of trust of your position as a doctor' Another victim complained the GP examined her breasts even when she saw him for an injured wrist. He also targeted his staff. Islam told a new practice nurse: ‘You will have sex with me.’ He propositioned the 27-year-old in his Mercedes car after they went to an educational evening hosted by a pharmaceutical firm. He told the married nurse an affair could ‘spice up’ a marriage before he slid his hand under her skirt. He said he had ‘needs’ and offered to take her to medical conferences abroad with him. She rejected his advances and was so shocked that she quit. Michelle Colborne, prosecuting, said Islam ‘exploited the naivety’ of his patients and ‘he succeeded because as the GP in a close-knit community he was in a position of trust and status and power.’ Islam was finally caught when one victim went to police in March 2010 and others came forward. He was suspended by the General Medical Council and will now be struck off. The jury found him guilty of indecently assaulting seven women patients between 1970 and 1995. Judge Simon Lawler, left, said the evidence showed Dr Gousul Islam, right had 'deliberately targeted' a small number of vulnerable patients for his own gratification . Judge Lawler described Islam’s catalogue of persistent sexual abuse as the ‘grossest breach of trust’ and a ‘terrible commentary on a medical man who took an oath to counsel and to care’. Commenting on the victims who gave evidence, the judge said: ‘The court pays tribute to these women. They did not want to be here but felt it was their duty to speak out. They were right and they have seen justice.’ Some of them were in the public gallery to see the GP jailed and female jurors wept openly as sentence was passed. Islam claimed to have acted with ‘professionalism and decorum’ at all times and said the women were either mistaken or had been lying. His barrister Vanessa Marshall said: ‘This is clearly a very sad day for Dr Islam. As a convicted man he knows that the final stage of his life is ruined.’ Outside court Detective Chief Inspector Natalie Shaw said: ‘Police cannot commend enough the courage shown by all of these ladies who have come forward.’","Gousul Islam, 70, abused young women under the pretext of examinations .

Police are investigating after ‘toxic levels of cyanide’ were found in her bloodstream of a well-respected Pennsylvania doctor who died suddenly at her home last month. Autumn Marie Klein, 41, collapsed at her Oakland, Pennsylvania home and died on April 20 at UPMC Presbyterian, where she also headed the women's neurology department and was an assistant professor of neurology, obstetrics and gynecology. Klein was married to another neurology specialist at UPMC, Robert Ferrante, and had a six-year-old daughter called Cianna. Pittsburgh Police used search . warrants and subpoenas to obtain cyanide from the lab where Dr. Ferrante . works on Thursday, reports KDKA . The body of top neurology expert and married mother-of-one Autumn Marie Klein was found to contain 'toxic levels of cyanide' when she died . Dr. Ferrante is also reported to have . hired prominent attorney, and former U.S. Attorney General J. Alan . Johnson and a forensic pathologist Cyril H. Wecht. The medical examiner’s office has issued subpoenas to the University of . Pittsburgh to find out the movement of chemicals, in and out of the lab, . including cyanide. Dr. Ferrante called 911 and reported that his wife had a heart attack on April 20th. Sources say 'extremely high levels of . cyanide' were found in Dr. Klein’s blood. The type of levels that would . have “knocked her to the floor” in 30 seconds sources say. District Attorney Stephen Zappala told KDKA that they are investigating her death as a possible homicide, or suicide. Although police sources also say they . do not believe Dr. Klein committed suicide, she was the mother of a . six-year-old and reportedly trying to have another child. Husband Robert Ferrante is also a specialist in neurology at UPMC . Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams . said more tests were needed to determine how Klein died and it may take . 12 to 16 weeks to determine Klein's cause of death. Cyanide is relatively easy and cheap to generate. In . addition to pesticide and insecticide, it is contained in tobacco . smoke, smoke from building fires and some foods, like almonds, apricot . kernels, apple seeds, and cassava (also known as yuca or manioc).

A former chief constable who was criticised for his actions during the Hillsborough disaster will keep his estimated £1m pension. Sir Norman Bettison also faced calls to be stripped of his knighthood yesterday after he was heavily criticised over his reaction to a watchdog report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said he would have had a case to answer for gross misconduct had he still been a serving officer. But, because he resigned from his £225,000 a year job as head of West Yorkshire Police last October, it is powerless to take disciplinary action against him. Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Sir Norman should be stripped of his knighthood, police pension and other accolades . Mrs Aspinall's son, James, was among the 96 football fans killed in the crush at Hillsborough . Victims’ families described Sir . Norman, 57, who denies any wrongdoing, as an ‘absolute disgrace’ and . renewed their calls for him to lose his knighthood and lucrative police . pension. The row centres on Sir Norman’s . alleged dealings with his police authority following the publication of a . damning report on Hillsborough last year. The IPCC said the chief constable . attempted to influence public perception as the West Yorkshire Police . Authority was deciding whether to refer him to the watchdog over the . findings of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. It said: ‘While it was evident Sir . Norman made no attempt to prevent the referral happening, the IPCC . investigation concluded that he attempted to manipulate the public . perception of the referral process for his own self-interest.’ The watchdog added it had concluded . Sir Norman ‘had a case to answer for discreditable conduct and abuse of . authority, breaches which, if proven in a disciplinary hearing, would . amount to gross misconduct as they would justify dismissal. However, as . Sir Norman left the police service in October 2012 he cannot face a . disciplinary hearing in which the evidence could be tested. Instead, the . IPCC is publishing its findings for the public to judge’. Complaints were sent to the IPCC about his involvement in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster . Sir Norman was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police at the time of the disaster and was at the match as a spectator on the day . IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass said the aftermath of Hillsborough had become synonymous with police attempts to cover up the truth, manipulate messages and defect blame . Margaret Aspinall, of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said Sir Norman should be punished over his conduct. She said: ‘The man is an absolute . disgrace. In the IPCC’s own words, this was gross misconduct and, in my . mind, that is a very serious offence and the fact that he resigned . should not mean that this report is the end of it. We want to see him . stripped of his honours – his knighthood and his Honorary Fellowship . from Liverpool John Moores University. I believe he resigned to protect . his pension.’ Mrs Aspinall, who lost her 18-year-old . son, James, in the disaster, said the IPCC report was ‘another step on . the road to justice’ for the 96 victims of the Hillsborough tragedy. Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough . Justice Campaign, added: ‘It is frustrating to know that serious . allegations can be levelled at this man yet no action can be taken.’ Sir Norman is the latest in a string . of chief constables to leave their jobs under a cloud yet keep their . full pension. He was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police at . the time of the disaster in 1989. He attended the FA Cup semi-final . involving Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday’s . Hillsborough ground as a spectator. Sir Norman (pictured in 2008) today questioned the 'fairness' of the IPCC report . After the tragedy, he was involved . in the resulting force investigation. His involvement in that inquiry has . provoked waves of allegations and criticism from the families of those . who died and has dogged his career, which included a stint as the chief . constable of Merseyside. He quit as West Yorkshire chief in . October, saying the controversy had become a ‘distraction to policing’. He is said to be entitled to an annual pension of more than £83,000.

She typically recommends that a used gown be priced at . 50per cent of its retail value - if it is less than two years old, has . been cleaned and is in great condition. Designers like Vera Wang and Monique Lhuillier can fetch slightly more than 50per cent, while custom work can be harder to recoup in a sell. Styles worn by celebrities are especially coveted though.

My Vera Wang Eliza Deluxe was customized with sweetheart neckline, a seven-foot cathedral train and beadwork. The retail price was $25,000, but I paid $15,900 and cut a deal with the seamstress to do the customization separately for a total of $17,900. I loved wearing my dress, but was equally happy to box it up afterwards. I know that in rare cases women can pass their dresses down, but I thought it far more likely that any future daughter of mine would think it looked like a yellowing meringue monstrosity - and I wanted to get some of the money back!

A disabled sheep is enjoying a new lease of life after receiving a specially designed wheelchair to help him get around. Buster the sheep is unique amongst the animals at Clough Farm Animal Sanctuary, in Stockport, as instead of four legs he uses just three - plus four wheels. Vets recommended that he be put down as a deformed leg meant he could barely walk but volunteers at the sanctuary were determined to find another solution. On the move: Buster the sheep is unique amongst the . animals at Clough Farm Animal Sanctuary, in Stockport, as instead of . four legs he uses just three - plus four wheel. He is pictured with his owner Jayne Murray . Instead they raised enough money to give Buster his own custom made wheelchair. It means he can now whizz around his field with the other sheep and even reverse. Jayne Murray, 51, who runs the sanctuary with her partner Ronnie Price, 65, explained how Buster was born with his forelimbs splayed outwards and over time it became apparent he had a problem. He moved to the sanctuary with another sheep, Poppy, in April 2011 and shortly afterwards Ms Murray sought out a vet who might be able to help him. She said: 'I called all the local farm vets to get him examined and all but one told us it wasn’t worth their time as he should have been put down at birth. They said he had no hope of living for long. 'We eventually found a vet in Whalley Bridge who agreed to see him so we put him in a pet carrier and took him there. He moaned all the way and it wasn’t until I picked him up and carried him in my arms that he shut up.' New lease of life: The custom-made wheelchair is specially made and the harness and frame cost £455 . Buster spent five days at Leahurst animal hospital where vets carried out full X-rays and scans and also intensive physio. They discovered that all his muscles and tendons were welded to the bone at a 90 degree angle and, as sheep feed on their elbows, surgery to amputate was not an option - Buster would need to be put down. Ms Murray said: 'We were devastated. Apart from his leg, Buster was such a happy chap. He would play with Poppy and run around the paddock without a care in the world. 'The physio hadn’t worked and the vet explained that the pressure caused by walking on three legs would eventually damage him internally. 'All we needed was something to support his leg.' One of us: The device means Buster is back on his feet with the other sheep and can move at great speed . Another volunteer at the sanctuary had heard of a dog that had a wheelchair specially made and suggested Buster get a similar device to help him get around. However, a specially made harness and frame cost £455 and the sanctuary did not have the funds to pay for it. But an appeal to the local community to help Buster get his wheels meant he was back on his feet in just a couple of months. Ms Murray said: 'We noticed that when we were in the enclosure with Buster he would lean on us and hold himself up using us as a crutch. 'We decided that if we could get a contraption to support his deformed leg he could hopefully get around easier. 'One of our volunteers searched the internet and found dog wheelchairs which seemed to do what Buster needed and set about making enquiries to see if we could find one to fit a sheep. 'He looked very confused when we first strapped him in but he took a step forward and as he felt the frame move he soon got the idea. 'He quickly learnt how to move at great speed across the yard and steer using his other leg. Even learning how to reverse when he got stuck was wonderful to watch. 'Now, he loves nothing more than scooting about in his wheelchair. The wheels are too big for his pen so I take him out for four hours a day so he can run around to his heart’s content.

Mr Mayers, whose office is right next to . where the couple were attacked, said: 'I heard two gun shots ring out . and then there was a lot of noise and commotion. 'So I got up to look outside and saw all these people huddled around the lady lying on the floor.

Nafissatou Diallo has pursued her lawsuit against the once-powerful French politician, claiming he committed a 'violent and sadistic attack,' despite prosecutors dropping sexual assault charges against him. With the settlement, Strauss-Kahn, 63, no doubt hopes to put behind him the scandal that cost him his job, his political career, his reputation and his marriage. Battered: Dominique Strauss-Kahn lost his political career and his job as the head of the IMF over allegations he tried to rape a hotel maid . The 63-year-old, who was once widely predicted to be the next president of France, admits he had sex with the housekeeper at New York's Sofitel Hotel in May 2011 - but maintains it was consensual. Details of the settlement, including any money paid to Miss Diallo, were not available. Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped . Sources told the New York Times that the deal hadn't been formally signed yet, though both side agreed to the terms. Bronx Supreme Court Judge Douglas McKeon facilitated the agreement. Lawyers for both Strauss-Kahn and Miss Diallo are scheduled to appear in court next week. Prosecutors in Manhattan dismissed sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn three months after he was arrested. Legal observers widely believe the District Attorney believed that Miss Diallo's claims lost credibility when a past criminal record in her native Guinea became public. It was also revealed that she allegedly lied on a document requesting asylum in the U.S. Strauss-Kahn . counter-sued Miss Diallo, claiming that her allegations were false an . that she had permanently damaged his public image.

Silicon Valley-based Tesla Motors unveiled a new system on Thursday that allows drivers to change the batteries in their electric cars in about 90 seconds. Tesla Motors already provides free charging stations to Tesla drivers, but the recharging process can take up to an hour to fully charge a 85-kwh battery. The new system uses a machine based on Tesla's factory robots that quickly removes the old battery and replaces it with a new one. Road tripping: The lack of range and too few charging stations have discouraged drivers from considering electric cars for long-distance travel in the past, but Tesla is seeking to change all that with its new 90-second battery swap system . The system was revealed in a demonstration on Thursday night during . which the automated battery-replacement system was pitted against a . traditional gas car fill-up to measure for speed. On stage, a Tesla Model S had its battery switched out while on screen, the gas car was being filled at an LA gas station. The gas car was filled up in four minutes and cost $99.83 to fill up the . 23 gallon tank, while two Tesla cars had their batteries changed during that time. According to Quartz.com, battery replacement will cost at least $50. The new system, says Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, is to encourage people to consider electric cars for long-distance drives. 'The only decision you need to make when you come to one of our Tesla stations is, do you prefer faster or free,' he said on Thursday. Energized: Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled Tesla's new robotic battery swap system in California on Thursday which he hopes will change perceptions about electric cars . 'Our goal here was to eliminate the objections that people have. We want to show that [Tesla] can actually be more convenient than a gasoline car. Hopefully this is what convinces people that electric cars are the future.' He also guaranteed that charging at a Tesla station 'is and always will be free'. Tesla Supercharging stations are currently in eight locations on the East and West coasts. In May, Tesla announced plans to greatly expand the network, tripling the number of Tesla Supercharging stations by the end of this month. Free of charge: A charging cord for the Tesla model S electric car. In addition to charging stations, the cars can be charged from a regular outlet at home . Pricey: A Tesla model S will set you back $62, 400, but according to CEO Elon Musk, use of charging stations 'is and will always be free' By fall, the company plans to have stations in most metropolitan areas,  and to have a corridor of stations equipped with battery-swapping technology from LA to New York by the end of this year. By 2015, the plan is to have 98 per cent of the U.S. and Canada covered. Drivers who swap batteries will eventually have to return to the station of the swap to get their original battery back, according to CNN, and pay to have it replaced in their cars again. If they don't return to the station, they can pay to have the 1000lb battery shipped back to their local service station, or just keep the new battery that's been installed. The battery-swapping robots will service the Tesla model S and all future models, but not Tesla's original car, the Roadster.","Tesla Motors has developed a new robotic system that changes a car's battery in 90 seconds .

With our shared interests and notorious 'special relationship', it is often thought that Britons and Americans are cut from the same cloth. However, a new survey has revealed that people from both sides of the Atlantic have wildly different personalities. Up to 20,000 Britons and Americans took part in a visual personality test which involved selecting which image they most identified with in certain categories. And, as well as confirming some long-held stereotypes, it also appears to confirm that the famous British stiff upper lip still exists. Differences: Americans like singer Beyonce , right, are more likely to be 'caring' or 'energetic optimists' . The study found that British people, such as Keira Knightley, left, are likely to be more reserved . As reported by The Times, Americans are more likely to be  'caring' or 'energetic optimists' while Britons are twice as likely to be described as 'downhearted'. However, Britons also emerged as more likely to be chilled out. Some of the more revealing insights from the survey, by Visual DNA, came when Britons and Americans were asked about romance. Briton's are more reserved and less likely to share romantic secrets with friends, family and colleagues. Americans, however, are four times . more likely to be called a 'true romantic'. They are more flirtatious . and much more likely to take a sexual attitude towards love. British people, on the other hand, are five times more likely to be called 'more reserved'. Stiff upper lip: British people, such as Sir Michael Caine, are five times more likely to be called 'more reserved' than Americans . The survey results appear to confirm what actor Michael Caine once famously said. 'I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. 'English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don't interfere in your situation. 'If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.' Another intriguing insight into attitudes came when people were asked about money. British people are three times more likely to be described as 'careful spenders' or 'home improvers' than their counterparts in the U.S. However, Americans display almost entirely opposite characteristics. They are 13 times more likely to 'flash their cash' and show off their money.","New survey reveals  Americans are more likely to be 'energetic optimists'

MPs in Siberia are to vote on a new law which would allow homosexuals to be flogged publicly as a punishment for their 'disgrace.' Ultra conservative MP Alexander Mikhailov says the new law would allow Cossack paratroopers to drag gays off the street for their punishment. 'I want to call on people to get a healthy perspective of this disgrace,' he told local media. In another attack on homosexuals in Russia, one Siberian MP has called for them to be publicly flogged by cossacks, whilst Russian President Vlladimir Putin has backed a law banning same-sex foreign couples from adopting Russian children . 'Our district needs a law that would . give paratroopers the right to grab gays on the street and drag them to . the city square, where Cossacks would whip them,' he added. Critics say . that Mikhailov's bill is unlikely to be passed. But . some are worried that it could gain support in Russia's current . anti-gay backlash that has led to laws allowing judges to jail people . for 'promoting' homosexuality. In another move that will broaden Russia's rift . with Western nations over gay rights, its politicians passed a bill today . barring same-sex foreign couples from adopting Russian children. The move saw strong signals of support from President Vladimir Putin. The . State Duma, or lower house of parliament, approved the bill by a 444-0 . vote in its third and final reading, sending it to the upper chamber, . which is also expected to approve it. Both houses are dominated by the . United Russia party, which is loyal to Putin. In . power since 2000, Putin has championed socially conservative values and . held up the Russian Orthodox Church as a moral compass since he . weathered a wave of protests by mostly urban liberals and started a . third Kremlin term last year. He . has rejected U.S. and European criticism of a ban on spreading gay . 'propaganda' among minors that the Duma passed earlier this month that . gay rights activists fear has fuelled attacks on homosexuals. EU foreign policy chief Catherine . Ashton said in a statement on Thursday that the 'propaganda' ban could . stigmatise gays and cause discrimination, and the United States has said . it severely restricts freedom of expression and assembly. The . Duma vote to ban adoptions by same-sex couples from abroad came as . German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has criticised Putin over civil . rights, met him at a showcase Russian economic forum in St Petersburg. Germany . has also condemned the gay 'propaganda' ban and German Foreign Minister . Guido Westerwelle, who is gay, said after its passage that attempts to . stigmatise same-sex relationships had no place in a democracy. Earlier this month the Russian parliament issued a ban on spreading gay 'propaganda' among minors that gay rights activists said would fuel attacks on homosexuals . Putin . says Russia does not discriminate against gays, but he has criticised . them for not adding to Russia's population, which has declined sharply . since the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The . same-sex adoption ban was rushed through parliament after Putin said in . late April that a new French law allowing same-sex marriage went . against traditional Russian values. It also bars adoptions by unmarried . foreigners from countries where same-sex marriage is legal. The . ban fits into a Kremlin campaign to restrict foreign adoptions, a . sensitive issue after Americans and Europeans flooded into Russia in the . post-Soviet era to adopt children. In December, Putin signed a law banning all adoptions by Americans, a move motivated by disputes with Washington over human rights and what Russia says is the insufficient prosecution of adoptive U.S. parents suspected of abuse. Advocates of adoption say same-sex couples can provide loving homes for children who might otherwise founder in Russia's troubled system of orphanages. Relatively few Russian couples adopt despite state efforts to promote the practice. Same-sex marriage is legal in 15 countries, including seven in Western Europe, and in some jurisdictions in the United States and Mexico. Same-sex couples are not recognised under Russian law and cannot adopt. A March poll by the independent Levada Centre found that 85 per cent of Russians opposed same-sex marriage. But there is no big grassroots movement against gay rights in Russia and critics say the measures are being imposed from the top down. 'It's pretty strange to see this major wave of homophobia in a country where two-thirds of society was brought up by same-sex couples - mother and grandmother,' one Internet user said in an online forum, referring to the problem of absentee fathers.","'Our district needs law that would .

The artist ruined his chances of graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1962 when he spoiled his final exam paper in an act of defiance. Hockney, then aged 25, refused to write the essay required, saying he should be judged on his body of work throughout the course. Celebrated: Artist David Hockney printed 50 copies of his early work 'The Diploma' in 1962, one of which is expected to fetch £20,000 . So he created his own certificate by scrawling the word ‘diploma’ beneath the college crest.

Ross Thomas, of auctioneers Bloomsbury, said: 'This was Hockney's way of sticking two fingers up at the establishment after he wasn't allowed to finish his final year.

This has resulted in Sollecito launching a desperate $500,000 (£320,000) online appeal for donations to fund his retrial. Accused: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito have been ordered to return to court for a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, pictured . The . computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for . 'legal expenses' but added he would donate anything raised above the target 'to a research foundation'. In an appeal posted on his Facebook page, Sollecito wrote: 'Well Guys, the problem for me now is pretty though. 'I'm deeply concerned not just for the issue I'm facing and most of you already know about, but also because I don't have resources anymore to fight this injustice. 'I badly need to be able to hire experts, when needed, or pay my attorney fees, documents fees, and so on when the new appeal will start.

I'm just asking if you, buddies, know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation. Big Hugs, Raffaele Sollecito.' Sollecito is thought to have been paid $1million (£650,000) for U.S. TV news interviews and an advance on his book Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox, which was published last year. However a sizeable proportion of that . was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including Italy's . high flying Giulia Bongiorno who is said to have the highest fees in . the country. On his . Facebook page he invites potential donors to help him out via a page . called Gofundme.com, and on it he adds: 'This new trial will take other .

Crime scene: This is the flat in Perugia where Meredith Kercher was found dead . 'I'll use and certify all the expenses paid with this funds. If in the future, I will not need this funds anymore for legal expenses, I'll donate the rest of the funds to a research foundation. Please help.' His urologist father Francesco Sollecito said: 'This is an initiative of Raffaele's but it has my full support. I'm no longer in a position to fund a trial which could last another two years. 'They never once stopped chatting. It's astonishing they are allowed to even talk to each other, let along see one another, considering they are both suspects in a murder trial' Witness . 'Witnesses will have to be reheard and there is a good chance that new forensic tests will have to be carried out and as such experts and consultants will have to be paid. 'We are both very grateful for the high attention that has been paid to this case by his lawyers Giulia Bongiorno and Luca Maori.' As of yesterday, 54 people had . donated with the largest amount being $1,000 from an anonymous donor and . the total standing at more than $4,500.

Supreme Court on Tuesday said the ruling was full of 'deficiencies, . contradictions and illogical' conclusions and ordered the new appeals . court to look at all the evidence to determine whether Knox helped kill . the teenager. Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are pictured outside the rented house shortly after Miss Kercher was found dead . In March, the Court of Cassation overturned Knox's acquittal in the 2007 murder of flatmate Miss Kercher and ordered a new trial. On Tuesday, the High Court issued its written reasoning for doing so. Miss Kercher's body was found in November 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian town popular with foreign exchange students. Knox, now 25, and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 29, were initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms, but a Perugia appeals court acquitted them in 2011, criticising virtually the entire case mounted by prosecutors. The appellate court noted that the . murder weapon was never found, said that DNA tests were faulty and that . prosecutors provided no murder motive. A . young man from Ivory Coast, Rudy Guede, was convicted of the slaying in . a separate proceeding and is serving a 16-year sentence. In the 74-page Cassation ruling, the . High Court judges said they 'had to recognize that he (Guede) was not . the sole author' of the crime, Italian news agency LaPresse reported. The judges though said he was the 'main protagonist'. Decision: Italy's judges have ruled that the possibility that Meredith Kercher died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again . They said the new appeal process would serve to 'not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime, but to possibly outline the subjective position of Guede's accomplices'. It said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving Kercher 'to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control'. The high court faulted the Perugia appeals court for 'multiple instances of deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions. The new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities, it said. Knox and Sollecito denied wrongdoing and said they weren't even in the apartment that night, although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded. Miss Kercher was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the . bedroom of the house she shared in the Italian hilltop town of Perugia . with his American former girlfriend. He . was given a 25-year jail term while Knox was given 26 years but in 2011 . the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal. However, three months ago Italy's highest court ruled there should be a fresh trial for both of them.","They hugged closely and kissed as they walked streets of New York .

Hollywood star: Actor Errol Flynn became famous for his role as Robin Hood in the 1938 adaption of the tale . His swashbuckling characters were often leaping to avoid the thrust and parry of a sword. But it appears Hollywood film star Errol Flynn was equally adept at evading his creditors. A family clothing company in Northampton has discovered letters which show he ran up debts of thousands of pounds that were never paid. The actor, who died in 1957, launched his career in Northampton in the 1930s when he performed with the town’s Repertory Company based at the Royal Theatre. Flynn went on to reach global fame in 1938 when he starred in The Adventures of Robin Hood and became an American citizen in 1942. But letters found in a dusty box in the . storeroom of Montague Jeffery menswear shop reveal how he was even . pursued by private detectives for his unpaid debts in Northampton. Jonathan Williams, whose grandfather Bernard Jeffery served Errol, said: 'It was when we found out the new cinema was going to be named after Errol Flynn that we decided to look through our old papers and discovered this old unpaid bill. 'Unfortunately the bill does not specify the amount he owed but considering the shop hired private detectives to pursue him for the money it must have been the equivalent of several thousand pounds in today’s money. 'My grandfather Bernard knew Errol and would supply him with pyjamas and pants and socks which were never paid for. 'Everyone knows about Errol’s legendary manhood but my grandfather never mentioned anything about it, I don’t know if he had to alter any of his clothing. Discovery: Jonathan Williams, managing director of Montague Jeffrey Menswear, Northampton, found letters which show how the actor owed the shop thousands of pounds . Pleading: The letters signed by Errol Flynn show him asking for an extra week to pay his debts . 'Before my grandfather died he told me how Errol would run up large debts all over the place and would promise to pay but never did. 'He used to drink in what is now The Mail Coach and was a regular at the shop, my great-grandfather knew him quite well. 'We do have a letter from him promising to pay his debt, but we don’t know exactly how much he owed. 'It would be interesting to know how much the letter would be worth now, because he obviously never paid his debt off. 'Errol Flynn came back to Northampton when his Hollywood career and was immensely popular despite his habit for running up huge debts.' Jonathan’s great-grandfather Montague Jeffery opened the shop in 1901. Charming: A notorious playboy, Errol Flynn died at the age of 50 from a heart attack . Winning smile: Hollywood actor Errol Flynn became a global star but began his acting career in Northampton . Still waiting: The correspondence shows that Flynn owed so much money the shop sent private detectives to track him down . A hand-written letter Flynn sent to the shop’s private detectives suggests he was struggling for cash despite his fame. Flynn wrote: 'If you would care to wait about a week longer I will be able to pay your account in full. 'The only reason it has not been settled previously is inability, not disinclination. Yours, Errol Flynn.' A further letter from the detectives says that Flynn was 'successfully evading' them as gaining entry to the film studio where he was working was 'out of the question'. The letters from Flynn to Montague Jeffery date from 1955, 20 years after the star had moved to Hollywood. Before he died aged 50 in 1957, Flynn was known as a womaniser and had a reputation for running up large debts. He joined the Northampton Repertory Players in January 1934 and remained with the company for 18 months. Flynn, who is regarded as one of the biggest Hollywood stars of all time, now has a cinema named after him in the town, the newly opened Errol Flynn Filmhouse.","Swashbuckling star began acting career in Northampton in 1930s .

Google has been forced to urgently change its predictive search function after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the internet giant was directing users to a sickening video of a man beheading a woman and articles about a vile clip of a man sexually abusing a child. Unsuspecting users simply typing ‘Facebook video of’ were just one click away from the horrendous material. Google’s auto-search function works by predicting what users are going to type in, based on the most popular internet searches. Because of this, last week users who made similar searches – many of whom could be schoolchildren – were given a selection of options, including a 57-second video appearing to show a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight. Shocking: The horrific links that came up on a simple Google search . The clip – first circulated on Facebook before the social media company removed it last month – now appears on a website called bestgore.com, which is adorned with sexually explicit adverts. Another suggested search directed users to a series of articles about a sick video of a man abusing a child which was viewed on Facebook tens of thousands of times in March before being removed. Scary: It's incredible, and worrying, how close surfers can get to the likes of this, a video of a woman being beheaded . When we alerted Google on Friday afternoon, it took drastic action and altered its auto-search function so that the terms no longer appeared, although users can still search for them if they type them in. Google said it had a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy against explicit content on its auto-search function and took action within 12 hours. Last night the Government said it would seek an urgent explanation from Google this week over the matter. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: ‘This kind of online content is horrific, and the fact it can be accessed easily is completely unacceptable. ‘For too long, it been too easy for big companies to turn a blind eye to their responsibilities. They enable access to this harmful material, and after last week’s Government summit, they know they must take action. 'We will continue to put unrelenting pressure on internet companies until they act to tackle this issue properly.’ Dr John Bird, operations manager at the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘It’s absolutely shocking and very dangerous. ‘Google has a responsibility of care and to be actively helping people search for this kind of stuff is both disgusting and irresponsible. It’s an insult to people like me who have been abused in their childhood years and had pictures taken of them. Anyone, even a child, could be innocently typing those words in on a Google search and be confronted with all of that.’ A man jailed after downloading hundreds . of indecent images of children has had his lifetime ban on using the . internet overturned – after claiming the punishment was unfair. Gordon . Amos, 34, was handed the ban last year and imprisoned for 18 months . after he was caught with 440 indecent images of children. But judges at . London’s Court of Appeal lifted the ban after the married father of one . said he could not turn his life around without being allowed on the . internet. Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts added: ‘This illustrates how easy it is to stumble across perfectly legal pornographic content that is not age-appropriate – Google even signposts it. Unfortunately, as things stand, technology doesn’t seem capable of offering a silver bullet, so it’s very important for parents to keep the lines of communication open with their children and to offer an alternative view of sexual relationships to the standard pornographic fare.’ Google has come under fire recently after refusing to install automatic filters that would force users to ‘opt in’ to online pornography. However, this month it donated £1 million to the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity that polices images of child abuse and can get them removed. And last week Google, along with BT, TalkTalk and Facebook, pledged an additional £1 million over four years to the foundation. A Google spokesman said: ‘Search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of what people are searching for on Google, which often include widely read news headlines like this story that was reported in the Daily Mail and elsewhere.’","Surfers within one click of video of woman being beheaded .

But . while the bushy-browed babe has seen her star rise rapidly (and even . been dubbed the new Kate Moss), the future wasn't always so bright.

In fact, the fashion designer actually banned her from appearing in his autumn/winter 2012-13 shows because he thought she was too short and looked odd among his other models.

She's made it: After his insult, he recruited Cara to walk in his Paris Fashion Week show last season, left,  alongside Kate Moss, right . 'I remember Marc looking at me and saying, ""Why is that dwarf in here?"", and me being devastated. 'I apologised to her afterwards and made up for it by casting the model in all her key shows and shoots.' The outgoing model was cast for both Jacobs' eponymous label and Louis Vuitton, for whom he is creative director, back in March, and has now become one of his favourites, because she has 'great energy' and is a good role model for other girls. Zest for life: The designer has now changed his tune saying that Cara has great energy and is a role model to young women . Speaking recently, he said: 'She's a silly goose. She has a great energy. She turned up to the Vuitton show wearing a zebra outfit from Madagascar, a onesie. 'She'd been traipsing round Paris all evening in it, you got to love a girl like that.

State fire officials say 35 horses were killed when fire swept through stables at a property in north-west Georgia on Thursday night. Georgia Fire Marshal spokesman Glenn Allen said the blaze occurred at Happy Valley Farms owned by Marion 'Bit' Hutcheson in Rossville, just south of the Georgia-Tennessee border. Reports say damage was estimated at up to $4.1 million due to the valuable show horses housed in the stable, some of which were worth up to $200,000, and the two buildings and storage facility that were destroyed. Devastating: Investigators survey the scene of a fire at Happy Valley Farms near Rossiville, Georgia where 35 show horses died . According to CatwalkChatt.com, neighbors on Happy Valley Road reported two loud explosions or booms, and the barn was engulfed in flames by the time 911 was called at 8:39pm. At one time, there were 50 firefighters battling the blaze. Walker County fire investigators surveyed the scene early Friday . morning and sought the help of a local meteorologist to check the barn’s . GPS coordinates against lightning strike data. Narrow escape: These colts were not stabled with the 35 that died but in the adjoining pasture at the time of the fire .

Sad day: Marion 'Bit' Hutcheson is the owner of Happy Valley Farms and the 35 horses that died . Trainer Daniel Jenner says the structure was engulfed within 20 minutes but he and another trainer managed to get one of the horses out.

A Philadelphia faith-healing mother charged with murder after a second son died of pneumonia has been granted bail, but her husband must stay in jail. Catherine and Herbert Schaible, who are both members of the First . Century Gospel Church, do not believe in modern medicine, but rather divine healing. They were charged with third-degree murder after their . 8-month-old son died and went untreated of the respiratory illness. Catherine (left) and husband Herbert Schaible (right) were both charged with third-degree murder after refusing to seek medical treatment for their son's pneumonia on religious grounds, leading to his death . Four years ago the couple's two-year-old son also died from untreated pneumonia, leading to a conviction on involuntary manslaughter. The mother of seven other children, Common Pleas Judge Benjamin Lerner ruled that Schaible be released for the children's welfare, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Since the Schaible's were put in prison this April, the couple's surviving children have been living in foster care. 'These children have one mother and one . father, and I don't think it's necessarily a good thing that for months, . they have had virtually no contact with either parent,' he said. The Schaible's were charged with murder . after their infant son Brandon died of pneumonia, which could have been . prevented if he was given medical treatment for his illness. The Schaible's are both third-generation members of the First Century Gospel Church in Philadelphia. (pictured here) which preaches divine healing over modern medicine . Herbert Schaible, 44, said in a statement to police that was read in court earlier this year that, 'We believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power.' Medicine, he said, 'is against our religious beliefs.' His 43-year-old wife said in her statement that 'we pray and ask to be healed the way that Jesus did when he was on Earth. Officials at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center told The Associated Press that Schaible can live in her parents' home under electronic monitoring once her $250,000 bail is posted. However, Lerner refused to grant bail to Herber, The Inquirer reported. Defense attorney Mythri Jayaraman argued that Catherine Schaible was less culpable because the couple's church taught that a wife must be 'submissive to her husband.' Pastor Nelson Clark and Assistant Pastor Ralph Myers of First Century Gospel Church testified that Herbert Schaible made decisions about the welfare of the couple's children. 'She would have a say, but he would make the decision,' Clark said. Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore argued against treating Catherine Schaible differently from her husband. 'She was that child's mother, and he was that child's father, and they both have equal responsibility for that child,' she said. Clark said under questioning from the judge that he suggested a day or two before Brandon's death that Herbert Schaible tell his probation officer about the child's illness, but 'he said that if he called anyone, it would be a denial of his faith that God could heal the child.' Myers testified that Clark asked him to go to the home and help pray over Brandon, and the next day the child's grandmother asked him to return, saying Brandon hadn't moved in two hours. When he arrived, the child was dead, Myers said.","A Philadelphia woman who, along with her husband, refused to seek medical treatment for her 8-month-old son's pneumonia was released on bail .

Second chance: Brian Banks has another shot at football with the Atlanta Falcons - 11 years after he was falsely convicted of rape . A student who falsely accused a school football star of rape has been ordered to pay $2.6million dollars to the school district in compensation, officials said. Wanetta Gibson was just 15 when she claimed Brian Banks, then 17 and a student at Polytechnic High School, in Long Beach, California, had raped her. He was cleared after spending five years in jail after Gibson recanted her claim. She had admitted to Banks the alleged kidnap and rape did not happen, but did not want to tell prosecutors in case she lost the payout her family had won in a suit against Long Beach Schools. Now she will have to pay back the $750,000 settlement and an extra $1million in damages, as well as interest and legal fees to the Long Beach Unified School District after a ruling by the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the Los Angeles Times reported. The judgement on Monday came weeks after Banks, now 27, was signed by NFL team the Atlanta Falcons. He had been trying to get back into football since he was cleared on May 12, 2012. Announcing the news in April this year, he tweeted: 'I feel good this morning.' The Falcons are the first NFL team to sign Banks, but he has had chances with other teams, including the Miami Dolphins, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, San Diego Chargers and Seattle Seahawks. He took part in the Seahawks' minicamp last June following workouts in Kansas City and San Diego. Banks was 16 and had a scholarship offer from USC when a Long Beach Poly high school classmate accused him of the rape. He spent five years in jail and five years on probation. The woman recanted her claim and offered to help Banks clear his name after he was out of prison. Remorse: . Wanetta Gibson, pictured, contacted Banks to say he had not raped her - . but would not admit it to prosecutors as she feared she would have to . pay back money won in a case against the school . Win: Brian Banks, pictured with his mother after he was exonerated in May, has signed with the Atlanta Falcons . Redemption: Banks is pictured during his tryouts with the Seattle Seahawks last year . That helped lead to the conviction being overturned by a California court and Banks' record cleared. Banks has become a spokesman for the California Innocence Project, which works to exonerate the wrongly accused. Banks is expected to be there when the Falcons hold their first offseason workout on April 22. Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a statement: 'We are pleased to have Brian join our team. We had a chance to work him out last year and have been monitoring his progress since then. 'He has worked extremely hard for this chance over the last year and he has shown us that he is prepared for this opportunity. We are happy that Brian will have a chance to live out his dream of playing in the NFL and we look forward to seeing him on the field.' Four months after he was cleared of the charges, the linebacker signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League. A life shattered: Banks had been recruited by colleges and offered scholarships before the accusation . Banks was jailed after Gibson claimed he kidnapped her, dragged her across the school and raped her in a stairwell. But his attorney Justin Brooks said that the student had been on the way to the school office to talk about his college . applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went . to a stairwell to make out. He . explained that Banks said something to upset Gibson and they parted on . bad terms, leading to the later accusation. Investigators . tested her but found no physical evidence of rape, Brooks said. Banks . maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been . consensual. Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the . promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, . warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted. Expecting he would serve just 18 . months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was . put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his . NFL dream. Determined: Banks never gave up on his dream to play football and had been in full training since October 2011 . Future: Banks is expected to be there when the Falcons hold their first offseason workout on April 22 . He told ESPN last year that he has been seriously training since October 2011, saying: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.' He was exonerated in May after Gibson added him as a friend on Facebook when he left prison . with a tag a few months earlier. In a message, she explained she wanted to 'let bygones be . bygones.' Brooks said his client met Gibson and caught her on video saying there there had been no kidnap and no . rape, and would help him clear his record. Yet she refused to repeat the story to prosecutors as she feared she . would have to return a $1.5million payment she won after her mother . brought a suit against Long Beach Schools. Freed: Once a standout football star, Brian Banks, pictured weeping after his rape conviction was dismissed last year, was just 16 when a classmate accused him of kidnapping and raping her . She was quoted as telling Banks: 'I will go through with helping you but . it's like at the same time all that money they gave us, I mean gave me, . I don't want to have to pay it back.' The Los Angeles Times also reported . that Gibson had been worried the admission would affect her . relationship with her two young children. Banks said he would not pursue legal action against his accuser, and Los Angeles . prosecutors have said it is unlikely Gibson will be charged with making . false accusations. After . the exoneration, Banks added: 'My only dream in the world . is just to be free... For years, I felt like a toy with the switch cut . off, sitting on the shelf.'","Wanetta Gibson, then 15, falsely claimed Brian Banks, 17, had raped her .

'Matt . and I had talked about possibly teaming up and doing a show at some . point and there were some cautious overtures to me to possibly come back . to the 'Today' show, but they evaporated,' she told Howard Stern last month. The reported backroom talks about the . possible anchor switch came when Couric's contract with CBS News was . about to end which coincided with the Today Show's loss of their 16-year . ratings winning streak against competitor Good Morning America. It has been previously reported that Lauer reached out to Couric and encouraged her to come back and replace Curry, but the interview with Stern served as the first time that any of the principals involved confirmed the move. During . the interview with the shock jock, she never mentioned Curry by name, . choosing only to say kind things about her old show. 'For me, that was the best job,' she told Stern. Couric . sat at the Today Show anchor desk from 1991 to 2006, much of that time . spent next to Lauer who has been on the morning show since 1997. In many of the reports of what really happened inside NBC when Ann Curry was pushed out of her spot as co-anchor after only a year, Lauer was seen as the bad guy, the driving force behind Curry's quick turn-around. In Couric's eyes, however, he is just a good friend who she used to have a crush on. Stern questioned her about whether she and Lauer ever had a romantic relationship- which she has denied many times- though she did admit to finding him attractive before they worked together. 'You know what, I actually had a little crush on matt when he was the local news anchor at WNBC because he was so funny and so quick,' she said. Now the dust is beginning to settle from last year's multi-network game of anchor musical chairs as Couric headlines her own daytime talk show on ABC and Lauer remains at the helm of the Today Show alongside his new co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie.","Matt Lauer and Katie Couric fronted the Today Show together for 12 years .

A former San Antonio teacher accused of directing students to hit a schoolmate for being a bully has been convicted of official oppression. Cynthia Ambrose, 44, was accused of telling her students at Salinas Elementary School to line up and hit a 6-year-old boy so he knows 'how it feels to be bullied.' She faces up to a year in jail after jurors convicted her Thursday. Former kindergarten teacher Cynthia Ambrose cries as she takes the witness stand in her own defense on Thursday, she faces prison time after directing students to punch a six-year-old boy . The May 2012 incident occurred when the boy was brought to Ambrose by his teacher, Barbara Ramirez, after he hit another student. The boy, now 7, told the jury this week he remembers getting hit by students and later telling his brothers, but they didn't believe him. 'It started out as a pat,' Ramirez said. 'Then she told the class, ""Come on, hit him harder.'"" Ramirez was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony. She said she reported the incident to the school principal two weeks later. Cynthia Ambrose: The former San Antonio teacher has been convicted of official oppression . 'I've never heard of anything like this in my 30 years,' Salinas Elementary School Principal Jeffrey Large said.

Prosecutor Patrick Ballantyne said in court Thursday that the incident was 'so far outside the bounds of classroom discipline to where it becomes criminal.' Ambrose's lawyer, James Scott Sullivan, questioned Ramirez's statements during closing arguments, saying her testimony was dubious. Ambrose is scheduled to be sentenced July 29, reports the San Antonio Express-News.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:31 EST, 21 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:41 EST, 22 June 2013 . Now a second former employee is complaining of mistreatment by a wealthy New York City family who refused to pay a photographer his fee and dismissed him with an offensive, elitist note. Malu Custer Edwards, 28, and Micky Hurley, 35, both from well-known families in Chile, first came under fire when their Chilean nanny filed a suit against them claiming that they kept her 'as a virtual slave' in their Upper East Side apartment and only paid her $2-per-hour as she worked 12-hour days. The latest complaint comes from photographer Roque Rodriguez who asked for $240 following some photography work that he did for the family in 2009. His request for payment was met with a hate-filled email that read: 'DON’T COME THREATENING ME YOU WORTHLESS LITTLE S***. NEVER.' Accusations: Socialites Malu Custer Edwards, 29, left, and Mickey Hurley, 35, right, are being sued by their former nanny and now a former photographer released emails that he exchanged with the husband . 'Remember, you are ALWAYS going to be from a different class, you were born where you were born,' Hurley wrote, according to Gawker. The aristocrat went on to paint a contrast between their two families, saying that Rodriguez was 'a great-grandson of a seamstress.' The online drama began after Rodriguez shot some photos of Hurley's interior design work. Photographer: Roque Rodriguez requested $240 payment for his work . The New York Post reports that when Hurley asked for copies of the images so that he could use them in a magazine spread, Rodriguez said only if he was paid his fee first. 'Listen you poor, miserable low-born social climber. Delete your grubby photos...This is what I get for working with street trash like you,' Hurley wrote. 'Just remember, because you have angered me you will NEVER work for ANY magazine or newspaper in Chile.' This tirade comes after the couple's behavior was called into question following the publication of a lawsuit filed by their former nanny. Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica, 50 alleges she was locked in the socialite couple's Upper East Side apartment, physically abused by their three children and forced to work 12 hours a day for just $2 an hour for three months until she finally mustered the courage to leave. She says Malu Custer Edwards, 28, and Hurley, 35, brought her to the U.S. with a fake passport and had her lie to customs officials about her true intentions in the country. Villanueva claimed the New York Post that the couple often left her with only small slices of bread and milk to eat, while they were regulars at the exclusive French restaurant Balthazar - where entrees run $30 to $45. The couple denies Villaneuva's allegations and are fighting the lawsuit. 'The claims are completely without merit and will be fully refuted in court,' attorney Robin Alperstein told the Post. Villanueva finally fled the home in March 2011 after one of the children slammed her . head with a refrigerator door so hard that she nearly lost . consciousness, she alleges. Villanueva says she began working for Edwards and Hurley in Chile in December 2010. They decided to move to New York in January 2011 so Edwards could enroll the the New School. Villanueva says the couple told her they would pay her $10 an hour and give her health benefits if she came with them and looked after their three children, ages 6, 8 and 10. Upscale: The couple were regulars at the posh French restaurant Balthazar, while Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica claims she often had only milk and bread to eat . When she arrived in New York, though, she alleges the couple began paying her only $800 a month, allegedly claiming no nanny in New York makes more than $700 a month. She claims she worked 12 hours a day and had only one day off in three months. 'They brought me here to mistreat me,' Villanueva told the Post. 'They were telling me I don’t have any rights of any sort.' She claims in court documents the job amounted to 'forced labor' and 'involuntary servitude.' The Post says Villanueva was kept as a 'virtual slave.' She alleged in an interview with the Post that she begged to be sent back to Chile, but the couple refused to let her move home - saying she signed a two-year contract. Instead, she claims, she was often locked in rooms, forced to sleep on the floor. She says she was promised health care benefits, but the couple allegedly refused to let her refill her hypertension medication. Villaneuva said she was happy working for the couple when she lived in Chile, but it changed after they brought her to the U.S. on a fake passport. Edwards, a graphic designer, is related to Agustín Edwards McClure, a Chilean diplomat who led the League of Nations in 1922. Hurley, an interior decorator, is a descendant of the country’s founding settlers and related to opera set designer Pier Luigi Samaritani. 'All Chile knows them. They come from a family with lots of resources,' Villanueva said of Edwards' family. Despite the denials from Edwards and Hurley, the New York Department of Labor ordered the couple to pay Villanueva $6,302 in back wages in 2011.","Email came from Micky Hurley, 35 - a New York socialite from a prominent Chilean families who called the photographer 'lower class'"

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's visit to the opening of an exhibition at the Hermitage has been cancelled by Russia, reportedly because she planned to mention art 'looted' by the Soviets at the end of World War II. Thousands artworks were taken from Germany by the Soviet Union, with hundreds of pieces of 'trophy art' taken as war reparations held in the St Petersburg museum. Merkel is on a visit to an economic forum in the city and had planned to join President Vladimir Putin at the opening of the exhibition 'The Bronze Age of Europe: Europe Without Borders'. Tensions: Angela Merkel, pictured with Vladimir Putin at last week's G8 Summit, is visiting Russia . Cancelled: The German Chancellor will no longer be attending the opening of an exhibition at the Hermitage in St Petersburg . But German government spokesman Georg . Streiter said Russia had called off the event arguing that 'it was . impossible for the host to find the time'. Asked what Merkel had planned to say . when she inaugurated the show, he said: 'She would perhaps have . once more referred to the German position on the issue of ""looted art"".' Mr Streiter added: 'The opening of the . exhibition would have been a lovely occasion to highlight our close . cultural cooperation.' Germany's media has run headlines including 'Uproar about looted art', 'Putin is a miserable diplomat' and 'Looted art scandal overshadows Russia trip' and has referred to the incident as a sign of deteriorating relations between the two countries. Masterpieces: Paintings including Degas' Place de la Concorde (left) and Renoir's In The Garden (right) are still at the Hermitage, having been taken from Germany by Soviet troops after World War II . 'Trophy art': It is thought Merkel planned to bring up the thorny issue of 'trophy art', such as this Toulouse-Lautrec drawing 'Riders', while at the Hermitage . According to Berlin's Humboldt . University, the Soviets plundered more than a million books and . thousands of pieces of 'Beutekunst' - or 'looted art' - at the end of . the Second World War. Hundreds of pieces of art were taken by Soviet soldiers from Germany at the end of the Second World War. Many were kept in storage for more than 50 years, with several being kept behind closed doors at the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg, including masterpieces by Goya, Delacroix, Courbet, Domier, Degas, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, . Cezanne, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse and Purrmann. In the early 1990s the Hermitage began exhibiting the 'trophy art', saying the works should be made accessible to the public before decisions could be made about their future. The works have been a contentious issue between Germany and Russia, with scholars divided over whether they were stolen or saved by Soviet troops. Many pieces have still not been traced down and Germany has indicated it wants the art back. The Hermitage holds many 'trophy art' items removed by the Soviet Union which Germany is keen to see returned. The exhibition opens to the public on Saturday, the anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union. Tension between Berlin and Moscow was apparent when Putin visited the Hanover trade fair in April. Merkel, who grew up in communist East Germany, criticised his crackdown on foreign non-governmental organisations, saying: 'A lively civil society can only emerge when individuals can operate without fear or worry, of course on the basis of law.' Her foreign minister, the openly gay Guido Westerwelle, has also protested about a new Russian law against homosexual 'propaganda'. But Germany has to maintain good ties with Russia because of its dependency on the country's natural gas resources. Merkel has said maintaining a dialogue is the best way to improve civil rights in Russia.

Thousands of cancer patients are being denied access to better  treatment because of a lack of trained doctors, according to an ‘alarming’ Government report. One in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques, but some hospitals do not offer the treatment or provide it  for only 0.1 per cent of sufferers, officials say. Intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) is more accurate, has fewer side effects and avoids damage to healthy tissue, enabling patients to recover more quickly. One in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques . But a Department of Health report found that only four cancer centres out of 50 in England offer the treatment to all those who might benefit, because many specialists are not trained in how to administer it. The Government has been forced to offer financial incentives to hospitals to provide more radiotherapy, which means they will now be paid per patient, to address the problem. On average, only six per cent of patients are being given access to IMRT, which the report describes as ‘unacceptably low’. Radiotherapy – using radiation to burn away cancer – is one of the disease’s most effective treatments and is used to treat 100,000 people a year. The technique carries a risk of killing healthy cells as well as the tumour, but IMRT allows the rays to be  targeted at specific areas. A Cancer Research UK spokeswoman described the report’s findings as ‘alarming’ and said many patients may be suffering unnecessarily and for longer because they are not given access to the technique. She said: ‘We’re extremely concerned by the shortfall in advanced radiotherapy. ‘If patients aren’t being offered techniques like IMRT when this would be the most appropriate treatment, they could be experiencing side effects they might have otherwise been spared. Huge improvements are needed if we are to ensure that the right patients are getting the right sort of radiotherapy.’ Royal College of Radiologists president Jane Barrett accepted that not enough patients – just 16,000 each year – are receiving IMRT, and many were being denied the highest possible standards of treatment. She said: ‘The report shows we still need more radiographers and physicists trained in the new techniques such as IMRT which could benefit  24 per cent of those who undergo  radiotherapy. ‘Uptake is so slow because we have a workforce working very hard to deliver treatment on a day-to-day basis, but we need to give people time to get out of the workplace to train.’ To perform IMRT, doctors must complete a training course over several days and then be mentored when they return to hospital. Hospitals do not need any additional equipment. The report also highlights that 26 out of 265 radiotherapy machines in  England are past their use-by date, and a further 59 will need replacing  in the next three years. This will cost the NHS an estimated £100 million. A further 147 machines are needed to cope with expected demand by 2016 as cancer becomes more common in an ageing population, at a cost of up to £200 million. The report estimates that the amount of radiotherapy provided to patients will need to rise by 67 per cent in the next four years.","One in four cancer patients who receive radiotherapy in hospitals would benefit from the latest techniques .

The Irish government and the Kennedy clan celebrated the 50th anniversary of one of Ireland's most fondly recalled moments, the visit of President John F. Kennedy, with a daylong street party Saturday that was capped by the lighting of Ireland's own 'eternal flame.' 'JFK 50: The Homecoming' celebrations focused on the County Wexford town of New Ross, from where Patrick Kennedy departed in 1848 at the height of Ireland's potato famine to resettle in Boston. In June 1963, his great-grandson John returned to the town as the United States' first and only Irish Catholic president. Caroline Kennedy makes a speech honoring her father in Wexford County, Ireland, at a celebration marking the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's visit to Ireland during his presidency . The eternal flame brought over from John F. Kennedy's grave at Arlington National Cemetery is lit in Ireland as part of the celebration marking the President's visit there 50 years ago . In 1963 President Kennedy visited Ireland to much adoration as an American Irish Catholic President. Here he travels in a motorcade through the streets of Galway . During his four-day tour across Ireland, JFK so charmed the nation that, even decades later, his portrait adorns many living-room walls as the ultimate symbol of Irish success in America. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny joined JFK's only surviving sibling, Jean Kennedy Smith, and his only surviving child, Caroline Kennedy, to hold three torches together that light a flame encased within an iron globe. The flame had been carried Olympics-style from JFK's plot in Arlington Cemetery by aircraft to Dublin, then by Irish navy vessel up the River Barrow to the New Ross dockside.

'May it be a symbol of the fire in the Irish heart, imagination and soul,' Kenny told more than 10,000 who had gathered along the river bank. Several members of Ireland's Special Olympics team helped carry the flame from the Irish naval vessel to the ceremony, a gesture to the memory of JFK's sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics movement. She died in 2009.

His polished and idealistic speech reflected his long-expressed hopes to follow his grandfather into U.S. national politics after graduating from Yale. 'We have been told over and over that America is no longer the great country that it was when my grandfather was president,' he said, noting that his generation would 'inherit a series of problems that previous generations refused to address.'

But he said Ireland's ability to rise from centuries of poverty, emigration and social strife demonstrated that Kennedy-style ambition and optimism could find a home in the 21st century, too. 'The glow from this flame can truly light the world,' he said. The 50th anniversary celebration of JFK's visit to Ireland was marked by Irish government officials and the three surviving members of the president's immediate family, his sister, daughter, and grandson .

Earlier, Kenny and the Kennedys rededicated Wexford's Kennedy Arboretum, which was planted following the president's November 1963 assassination, and opened a greatly expanded Kennedy Homestead visitor facility on the ancestral farm that one of JFK's third cousins, Patrick Grennan, still lives on today. Saturday's flame ceremony featured Irish drummers, an African-American gospel choir, Irish step-dancing star Michael Flatley and folk singer Judy Collins, who at 74 recalled performing for Kennedy in the White House more than a half-century ago. She concluded the event by singing 'Amazing Grace' as four Irish Air Corps planes did a fly-past.","The Irish government and the Kennedy's celebrated the 50th anniversary of John F.

A worldwide relaxation of the rules barring air passengers from using devices such as iPads, laptops and e-readers before a plane takes off came closer yesterday. Aviation authorities in the US are to rule that travellers can keep such devices on during taxi, takeoff and landing because they are safer than had been thought. They found such gadgets do not interfere with navigation systems and that data used to draw up the ban was from the 1960s when such devices were very different. Coming change: Travellers in the US will soon be able to use electronic devices during taxi, takeoff and landing after research showed they do not interfere with the navigation system . The decision will mean that on transatlantic flights, UK passengers will be . able to use their gadgets as they land on US soil. However, when they . take off from Britain they will not be able to do so. The rules could . change in Britain and across the world if the US research is shown to be . credible. The US Federal Aviation Authority will formally unveil its findings in September, it was reported yesterday. Mobile phones will still have to be kept off but everything else will be . approved for use even below 10,000ft, the current cutoff. Phones are excluded because they were not part of the research, although the FAA is expected to look at this issue separately. Overseas: The US lifting of the ban could spread to the UK if the American research is shown to be credible . The report will state that the original rules in the US were written in . 1966 when it was thought that electromagnetic interference from . computers and other devices could cause problems with navigation . systems. Nowadays passenger jets are ‘much more tolerant’ to such . interference and the gadgets themselves are much safer. The report says this is because they use less power, transmit weaker signals and ‘stay within a tighter range of frequencies’. The FAA concludes that the ban has ‘become untenable’ because of the widespread use of consumer electronics. Another factor has been the sheer number of passengers ignoring the . rules. One survey found that, by accident or on purpose, a third of . passengers had left their gadgets on when they should be turned off. The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority said that it was monitoring the situation.","US travellers will be able to use electronic devices during takeoff and landing .

A family was ordered off an easyJet flight because of a small cut on their little girl’s cheek – then ‘abandoned’ for three days. After a short break in Jersey, Laura Bishop was waiting for take-off when a stewardess noticed the red mark beneath her toddler’s eye, and the pilot decided they could not fly for health and safety reasons. Hours earlier, 19-month-old Robyn had fallen and cut her cheek on a radiator, but it was not causing her pain and did not require a plaster. Bump: Little Robyn knocked her face on a radiator, leaving a little cut below her left eye, pictured, just before her family were due to fly home from a four day break in Jersey . Fed up: Pregnant Laura Bishop and 19-month-old daughter Robyn were kicked off a flight back home from Jersey because of a small cut on Robyn's face - incurring £600 in extra hotel bills for the family . After suffering the humiliation of . having to collect their bags from the plane’s hold and return to the . terminal, Miss Bishop, who is heavily pregnant, claims the budget . airline ‘abandoned’ them. Miss Bishop, 36, her engineer partner . John Maitland, 33, and Robyn had to wait three days for the next . available flight home from Jersey to Newcastle as well as obtain a . medical certificate declaring it was safe for Robyn to travel. She claims easyJet gave them no help . in finding transport or accommodation on the island, which ended up . costing them an extra £600, and the delay meant Miss Bishop, who is more . than seven months pregnant, missed her scheduled baby scan. After finally returning home to . Morpeth in Northumberland, Miss Bishop warned parents: ‘Beware of going . on holiday with children – you might not be able to bring them back if . they fall over.’ She accused the airline of deserting them and added: ‘I would never fly with easyJet again.’ Health and safety risk: The pilot of the easyJet flight deemed the wound a serious danger and told the family to get off the plane. (File photo) The family had enjoyed a four-day . break in the Channel Islands earlier this month and were in their seats . preparing for take-off when the pilot came over and said they had to . leave. Miss Bishop said: ‘I couldn’t believe . it. I started crying and I was pleading with him, saying, “This is . ridiculous, we’re only going to Newcastle, it’s about an hour’s flight,” but he insisted that he wouldn’t fly us. ‘The pilot said he was worried the . injury might get worse during the flight and he had to think about all . the other passengers’ safety. ‘I kept saying it wasn’t her eye, it . was the skin below her eye. It’s just a little red mark on her face. It’s not even going to scar. It wasn’t deep. It didn’t really bleed at . all. ‘He said he couldn’t say what would . happen, like she was going to explode or something. The whole plane was . sat looking at us. It was embarrassing.’ Stranded: easyJet said the decision to stop Robyn from flying was taken in her best interests because the injury could have got worse while in the air . Scarred: Robyn, 19 months, today bears only a little mark on her eye from the cut that prevented her and her family from flying on an easyJet flight . Miss Bishop said they took Robyn to see a doctor who said he thought the decision was ‘ridiculous’. ‘I think it’s crazy,’ she added. ‘It’s health and safety gone mad.’ An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The crew . advised the family they believed the injury could worsen in flight due . to the effect of cabin pressure.

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:00 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:01 EST, 27 December 2012 . Tens of thousands of frail older people risk being left lonely and isolated as a result of cuts to daycare facilities, a charity has discovered. Recently-released official figures show that the number of older people receiving such care from their council has plummetted by almost a quarter in the past two years alone. Day care includes support for vulnerable pensioners including lunch clubs, foot care, gentle exercise and social activities such as bingo. Without these activities, many older people receive no social interaction. In many cases, a visit to a day centre provides the only cooked meal a pensioner has a day. Cuts: The number of elderly people receiving daycare from their councils has fallen by nearly a quarter since 2009 . The figures show that more than 20,000 fewer pensioners are now receiving care provided by or arranged by their local authority than before the last election, according to the Department of Health statistics. Age UK, which uncovered the figures, said it was a ‘worrying’ sign of how town hall cuts are affecting the most vulnerable in our society. Day care services are also important because they can allow family carers to enjoy a much needed break. The charity said the cuts will leave elderly people at risk of loneliness and isolation. And, with little support to spot problems early, they could be left with growing health needs as they get older. The statistics show that over the past two years, the number of older people in England who receive council day care services has fallen by 23 per cent - from 88,498 in 2009/10 to 68,160 in 2011/12. The cuts will either leave people without day care at all, or could leave them having to pay for them out of their own savings or their pensions. Michelle Mitchell, Age UK’s charity director general, said: ‘This reduction in the number of older people who can depend on day care services arranged by the local authority is extremely worrying for a range of reasons. ‘We know that these services are really important to many older people but the brutal reality for older people with high care needs is that all too often there is not enough funding to allow for anything more than meeting the basics of their personal care. Falling:Since 2010, councils have reduced spending on social care for the elderly by £500 million in real terms . ‘The crisis in social care is leading to vulnerable older people having no choice other than to lead an isolated existence. Social care funding pressures and tightening eligibility criteria mean that thousands of older people are facing an end to their social life, and the prospect of living out their last years in loneliness.’ She added: ‘Any decent society needs to protect its most vulnerable and we are deeply worried that these figures indicate that many more older people and their carers are being forced into coping alone. ‘We urge the Government to recognise and act on the current underfunding of social care and commit to a sustainable and affordable new system of paying for care and support in old age.’ Age UK said the downturn in the use of day care centres is part of a general trend which has seen across-the-board reductions in social care and support provision by local authorities. There has also been a tightening in the amount of support provided to those older people who need services. Analysis by the charity has shown that funding for frontline services has not been adequately protected from cuts. Between 2010/11 and 2011/12, councils reduced their spending on older people’s social care by £500million in real terms. Suffering: 20,000 fewer pensioners are benefiting from lunch clubs serving hot meals, gentle exercise classes and social activities such as bingo, Age UK claims . In an attempt to save money, town halls have made it harder to qualify for social care support. In the vast majority of councils, only the most disabled and frail older people now receive any help with social care. Approximately 80 per cent of local authorities only provide social care support to those judged to have ‘substantial’ or ‘critical’ care needs. This means that older people with lesser but still serious needs do not get any state funded support.Age UK said that the evidence shows that demand for day centre places by older people continues to be high, but that many people feel unable to afford to pay the additional cost of a day centre place after they have met their essential care needs. Local branches said they are seeing day care facilities whittled down as funding reduces and those who are able to access them restricted to only the most disabled and frail. Julia Hines, chairwoman of Age UK Barnet said that while her local authority has not cut back day care services as fast as others, funding has been reduced and many more people have been asked to pay for using the services. In Barnet, in north London, the cost to attend a local authority day care centre is around £34 and users would also have to pay for their own transport meaning that the cost could easily rise to around £50 a day – just under half a week’s basic state pension and beyond the reach of many older people. Ms Hines said: ‘It is vitally important that people are able to escape the four walls of their own home, and that they have a place to go, not just to meet other people, but to meet their particular friends. Our clients have described our day centres as having a club-like feel, or being like a family. 'It is hard for anyone to admit that they are lonely. It is humiliating. Older people tend to avoid that word and have talked to us about the importance of “keeping busy” or that they are “lucky” because they have a daughter, or supportive neighbours. ‘Being busy is not the same thing, in my mind, as having friends, and if you can count your friends on the fingers of one hand, I am not sure that most of us would count ourselves lucky. Our clients have the opportunity to make and sustain real friendships.’ She added: ‘Day centres also often provide the only cooked meal of the day for clients as well as opportunities to join exercise classes or activities like art classes, bingo, or bridge. ‘I am very proud of the work our day centres have done, and incredibly grateful to the staff and volunteers who make this possible.’","Councils reduced spending on social care by £500million since 2010 .

"By . Margot Peppers . PUBLISHED: . 13:48 EST, 20 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 20 June 2013 . Women who are pregnant are receiving less protection at work than those who are injured. Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, companies are required to provide injured employees with 'reasonable accommodation'. For example, if someone who regularly lifts heavy objects at work injures their back, the employer is required to modify their job duties. Discrimination: Pregnant woman - especially working class ones in physically demanding jobs - receive no guaranteed protection from losing their jobs, unlike injured empoyees . But even though pregnant women are often advised by doctors not carry out physically demanding activities, there is currently no law that protects them from losing their jobs if they cannot perform certain tasks. Indeed Dina Bakst, co-founder of New York nonprofit A Better Balance, explains that the unbalanced law has a particularly significant impact on low-wage women in physically demanding jobs. 'Women don't have a clear legal right,' she told Gothamist. 'And yet disabled workers. . . a . man could come back from a ski accident and it's like, ""Let me get you . an ergonomically designed chair.""' The reasonable accommodations that would benefit pregnant women would be relatively minimal and cheap, such as more bathroom breaks, a stool to sit on or permission to carry a water bottle. But under the law, only expectant women suffering from severe pregnancy-related conditions like preeclampsia - which can develop into life-threatening seizures - are entitled to reasonable accommodation. For otherwise healthy pregnant women, having a baby bump can be seen as a hindrance to many employers, whose attitude is: 'If you can't do this job, you go.' That was the case for one woman named Yvette, who was forced to quit her grocery store job after her boss told her there were 'no jobs' that didn't require lifting heavy objects or pushing heavy bakery carts. These were tasks her doctor had specifically asked her not to do, since a series of miscarriages had left her with a blood clotting disorder. Even though Yvette offered to do work at the cash register or in the office instead, she says her boss refused. 'Pregnant women don't have a clear legal right, yet disabled workers do' The most unfair aspect of this, she . says, is that injured employees are treated completely differently. 'One . woman, she hurt her shoulder,' she recounted. 'They gave her a job . re-shelving lighter items. Pregnant women are supposed to be protected under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, . which states: 'If an employee is temporarily unable to perform her job . because of her pregnancy, the employer must treat her the same as any . other temporarily disabled employee.' But Katharine Bodde, policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, says this is rarely enforced. 'There's a gap in protection under the . law,' she said. 'Courts . have not interpreted the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act to require . employers to provide reasonable accommodations.' In New York, women can opt to file a charge with the New York State Division of Human Rights, but this often takes months to accomplish, time which many pregnant women simply do not have. Later this month, though, this all may change if New York State legislature passes the proposed Women's Equality Agenda. According to Gothamist, the law would require employers to provide reasonable accommodation for any pregnancy-related condition, 'unless doing so would cause an undue hardship on the employer.'","Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, companies are required to modify the job duties of injured employees .

However, it wasn't attitude or a quirky hairstyle that made women feel confident - it was a bright and bold make-up look like 25-year-old Jessie. Unfortunately, 77 per cent of British women admit they don't have the courage to showcase such a look, instead opting for a more natural appearance like the Duchess of Cambridge, whose make-up style 46 per cent of women try to replicate.

As the 89-year-old heir to Brooke Astor's fortune was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term for stealing millions of dollars from his mother's estate, his wife wept and hugged him. Anthony Marshall was ordered to begin serving his one to three year term after losing a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health. 'I take no pleasure in following my duties,' Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009. Emotional: Anthony Marshall's wife Charlene, weeps and hugs him, as the heir to Brooke Astor's estate is jailed . Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007. Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor. Astor inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S. When Marshall arrived in the courtroom on Friday in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder. He declined to speak during the brief proceeding, looking downward but showing little reaction. In earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive for Marshall taking money from his mother. Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, has said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his “preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times. The original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'. Sentencing: Anthony Marshall arrives outside the court, in a wheelchair and slippers, with his wife Charlene . Distraught: Charlene Marshall leaves court after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence . Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them. At Marshall's sentencing on Friday, the judge read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court to spare him prison. 'Please consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, ""you can't change the past,"" Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him. Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial. And it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed. Court date: Anthony Marshall arrives in court, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepares to sentence him to prison . Sentencing: Anthony Marshall listens to his attorney as the 89-year-old waits to learn his fate at a New York court . Prosecutors said Marshall, a decorated Second World War veteran and former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, Marshall bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. He also took valuable artwork off her walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.

He chose a mixture of items, from a $30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said. In the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10 million in 2002. The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s.

Marshall's lawyers said she knowingly changed her will to benefit her only child, and that he had legal authority for the gifts he gave himself from her money. His lawyers and doctors said a prison term could kill Marshall, who has Parkinson's disease, depends on a wheelchair and cannot get out of bed, go to the bathroom, bathe, or dress himself without help. After losing a series of appeals, lawyers for Marshall and his co-defendant Francis Morrissey Jr -  a former estates lawyer convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will - filed papers last week seeking a new trial and asking that both remain free. Justice Bartley rejected that request and sent Morrissey, 72, to prison on Thursday. Morrissey was convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will. His defense argued that if the signature was phony, he knew nothing of it. Morrissey's lawyers indicated that . they would continue an appeal that hinges on a sworn statement from . juror Judi DeMarco, who said she felt threatened when another juror made . hostile gestures, cursed at her and started toward her during . deliberations.

'I was tired and beaten and felt totally alone' and finally 'acquiesced in guilty verdicts that I did not in good conscience believe were legitimate,' Ms DeMarco, who is also an attorney, said in the June 8 statement. Her claims were part of Marshall's and Morrissey's unsuccessful appeals. The state court's Appellate Division concluded the jury tensions 'appeared to resolve themselves, and there is no reason to believe that the ultimate unanimous verdict, confirmed by polling [asking whether each juror agreed with the verdict], was the result of coercion'. However, the defense lawyers argued that the new statement merited at least a hearing.","Anthony Marshall ordered to serve prison term despite age and poor health .

A Little Gay History: The book about exhibits in the British Library which explore homosexual desire has been published in time for London Pride . The British Museum has released a new guide to exhibits in its collection which explore ideas of same-sex love and eroticism. A Little Gay History, written by curator Richard Parkinson, draws on objects ranging from ancient Egyptian papyrii containing gay chat up lines to Japanese woodcuts depicting men having sex. It is accompanied by an audio trail featuring actor Simon Russell Beale and artist Maggie Hambling, with the publication timed to coincide with this year's London Pride festival. Both explore artistic portrayals of homoeroticism throughout the ages, with the book making special discussion of the difficulties in finding the often suppressed records of homosexuality. 'History has all too often been a list of the deeds of famous men who are implicitly 'heterosexual' and usually European,' he writes. 'Unsurprisingly, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people have often felt excluded and silenced, and without a voice.' Nevertheless, he notes that museum collections full of classical artwork - from an era more comfortable with the idea of homosexual sex and, indeed, the naked human form in general - have been 'important spaces for people to consider their own sexual identity'. 'Most museums have collections of Greek and Roman statues which show men looking very naked,' he explains, 'so for men who desired other men it was one of the few spaces where they could look at naked male bodies in a culturally respectable sort of way.' Mr Parkinson, whose speciality is . Ancient Egypt, claims the oldest recorded chat up line can be found in . his department - and it involves a pair of men. It is contained in a poem from 1800BC . in which one male Egyptian god makes a pass at another, saying . 'neferwi-pehwi-ki', which translates as: 'What a lovely backside you . have.' Many of the objects highlighted in A Little Gay History are drawn from classical antiquity. There is the sculpture of the face of the Roman Antinous, at whose death Emperor Hadrian is said to have 'wept like a woman'. After Antinous' death in AD130 from drowning in the Nile, the emperor proclaimed him a God and spread his image across the empire. Yet such is the squeamishness with . which historians have regarded homosexual love, a visitor survey carried . for the museum at a major exhibition in 2008 found that only a handful . of people knew he was openly gay. 'He commemorated Antinous in statues, religious cults and coins across the Empire,' writes Mr Parkinson. 'It . is said to be the most passionate outpouring of grief for lost love . that we know of before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.' Openly gay: A marble bust of Hadrian, Roman . emperor between AD117 and AD138, next to his lover Antinous, adorned with a wreath like a god, at whose . death in AD130 he is recorded as 'weeping like a woman' Elsewhere he highlights a battered copper coin showing the image of the poet Sappho, whose homoerotic poetry was so intense that today all gay women are named after the residents of her native Lesbos. And from the same era, he singles out the Warren cup, a Roman goblet emblazoned with scenes of men and youths having sex. That artefact was previously owned by the American art collector Edward Perry Warren who called it the 'holy grail'. Taboo: A close up of the Warren Cup, which shows scenes of gay sex between men and youths . Graphic: A Japanese woodcut depicts two men having sex, one dressed as a woman for a role in kabuki theatre . From further afield, there is an 18th century treasure chest from New Zealand designed to be suspended so that its intricate carvings representing, among other things, oral sex could be admired from all sides. The Japanese are represented by a woodblock print that shows two men making love, with one dressed as a woman in his costume as an actor in kabuki theatre. Mr Parkinson writes: 'People often think that gay and lesbian history is a minority history, but of course it is part of humanity's history. Sexual diversity is something that affects us all.' The London Pride Parade will take place next Saturday, June 29, in central London.","Publication of A Little Gay history has been timed to coincide with this year's London Pride festival .

Zoe Brugger was driving home after picking up her boyfriend from work, when a routine traffic stop turned particularly uncomfortable. Brugger's headlight was out, which prompted the stop by Lakeland, Florida police officer Dustin Fetz. Fetz believed that the two were hiding drugs in the car, so he asked Brugger to exit the vehicle. Outside of the car, he asked her to lift up her shirt and shake out her bra - not once, but twice - in order to see if she was concealing anything. The request didn't reveal any drugs, and a subsequent search of the vehicle didn't produce anything either. Scroll down for video . Pulled over: Lakeland Police Officer Dustin Fetz pulled over Zoe Brugger for a broken headlight, and was convinced that she was hiding drugs - which prompted the strange search . Contraband: After being pulled over for a broken headlight in Lakeland, Florida, Zoe Brugger had to shake out her bra twice while the police officer searched for drugs - an action that State Attorney Jerry Hill calls 'highly questionable' and 'demeaning' Shake down: Officer Fetz didn't find any drugs on Brugger, or in the car . Excruciating: At the end of the search, Brugger says that the officer told her 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can go home' Brugger told ABC Action News that Fetz 'made me go through the whole humiliating ordeal with shaking my bra out, right there in the middle of this parking lot on Beacon Road.' When no drugs appeared, Fetz 'told me that he was taking me to Bartow jail for driving on a suspended license and that they had an x-ray machine there and they were definitely going to find what I had hidden inside of me,' Brugger said. Brugger was driving on an invalid license, which was enough reason to arrest her. But Fetz didn't. Instead he asked to search the vehicle, and when the couple relented, he searched it anyway. Another office who showed up as backup considered the search improper. Fetz broke another rule during the stop by leaving the audio off in the dash camera. If the audio had been turned on, 'there would be little to no speculation as to what occurred during that traffic stop,' said State Attorney Investigator Mike Brown. At the end of the stop, Fetz told Brugger 'I'm done scaring you, and now you can do home,' she told The News Herald. After the incident, she filed a complaint and notified the State Attorney's Office. Bold: Brugger, left, had just returned from picking up her boyfriend from work. He was in the car the whole time Officer Fetz searched Brugger . State Attorney Jerry Hill called for an investigation and wrote a critical letter to the Lakeland Police Department saying that the search was 'highly questionable' and not only 'demeaning' but 'ineffective and possibly dangerous.' He cited the fact that, if Brugger had been concealing a weapon, asking her to shake out her bra would have just given her access to that weapon. Fetz, on the other hand, told investigators that the search method 'is a known technique that is used by some LPD officers though he can't recall formally being trained to use it. 'Looking back on the incident (Fetz) recognizes that he was overzealous in his attempt to locate illegal drugs or contraband in the car,' Brown said. Fetz was put on a four day suspension with pay during the investigation and returned to work on June 18. The Lakeland Police Department will now be conducting their own investigation of the incident, in order to determine whether or not to terminate Fetz. 'This department does not condone the alleged actions as have been reported in recent days and any officer proven to be involved in this type of behavior will be dealt with accordingly, including possible termination,' Lakeland Police Chief Lisa Womack said in a statement.","Zoe Brugger was pulled over for a broken headlight, when the officer suspected there were drugs in the vehicle .

An artist has created paintings so incredibly realistic that onlookers are amazed to discover they aren't photographs. Oil painter Claire Duguid, 32, from Edinburgh, spends anything up to three months at a time on each portrait - painstakingly capturing every tiny detail of the subject's face and appearance. At a quick glance it's hard to spot a single brush stroke but Miss Duguid says she stops just short of hyper-realism to ensure that her work is visually stunning but continues to look like a painting. Astonishing: What looks like a photograph is actually an ultra-realistic oil painting by Scottish artist Claire Duguid . Look closer: Some portraits are so intricate they can take three months to complete . Depending on the demands of her clients and the intricacy of the painting, each piece can command up to £6,000 and can be found on walls worldwide from the UK to Hong Kong and New York. Miss Duguid said: 'In some respects I am painting every individual hair but I don't call myself a photo-realist painter.

She added: 'But I use light to distort and erode the figure, giving the light a sense of form and the figure less definition, creating an equality between the elements. 'The first artist that captured my heart was Renoir - there's something in the way he paints the eyes, a life he captures. 'Eyes I feel are the most important feature in a portrait painting. In my work they are the point at which I start and finish a painting.' A close inspection reveals that individual strands of hair have been painstakingly painted . Showcase: Ms Duguid's work has appeared at numerous prestigious festivals and exhibitions .

Free speech: Keir Starmer QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said there is no need for a law that makes it a crime to insult someone . There is no need for a law that makes it a crime to insult someone, the Director of Public Prosecutions has said. In a boost to free-speech campaigners, Keir Starmer QC said it was safe to reform the controversial law that says it is a criminal offence to use ‘insulting words or behaviour’. The clause of the 26-year-old Public Order Act has spurred a campaign which has united gay and secular activists, celebrities and conservative Christian evangelicals in favour of a robust right for people to insult each other. In October, comedian Rowan Atkinson said the law was having a ‘chilling effect on free expression and free protest’. He warned: ‘The clear problem of the outlawing of insult is that too many things can be interpreted as such. Criticism, ridicule, sarcasm, merely stating an alternative point of view to the orthodoxy, can be interpreted as insult.’ The Crown Prosecution Service, which Mr Starmer heads, has in the past been against any move to strike the word ‘insulting’ from the statute book. But the DPP has now changed his mind, the CPS said. He wrote in a letter to former West Midlands chief constable Lord Dear: ‘Having now considered the case law in greater depth, we are unable to identify a case in which the alleged behaviour leading to conviction could not properly be characterised as “abusive” as well as “insulting”. ‘I therefore agree the word “insulting” could safely be removed without the risk of undermining the ability of the CPS to bring prosecutions.’ However, Mr Starmer added: ‘I also appreciate there are other policy considerations involved.’ The indication from the CPS that the law against insult does nothing to protect the public came as a major boost for the campaign to amend the 1986 Public Order Act. Warning: Comedian Rowan Atkinson (right) said the law was having a 'chilling effect on free expression and free protest' while gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell (left) said that 'the longer insults are criminalised, the more people will risk losing their right to freedom of speech' The law was notoriously used in 2005 . when an Oxford University student was arrested for saying to a police . officer: ‘Excuse me, do you realise your horse is gay?’ It has also been . used to arrest a Christian . preacher in Workington who told a passer-by that he thought . homosexuality was sinful. And teenager Kyle Little was fined £50 in . 2007 for ‘causing distress’ to a pair of labradors by saying ‘woof woof’ at them within earshot of the police. The case was later quashed on . appeal. Simon Calvert of the Christian . Institute think-tank said: ‘We hope Home Secretary Theresa May will . listen to the country’s top prosecutor and agree to reform this . overboard and unwanted legislation.’ Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell . said: ‘This legislation has been on the statue books for 26 years, . initially to control football hooligans, major demonstrations and . protests such as the miners’ dispute. ‘But the legislation is now being used to criminalise huge numbers of people for trivial comments. ‘In 2009 the police used this law . 18,000 times, including against people who were expressing their views . or beliefs in a reasonable manner.’","Keir Starmer QC said it was safe to reform the controversial law that says it is a criminal offence to use 'insulting words or behaviour'

A bidding-war is stirring among high flying millionaires in a desperate move to snap up the worlds first aeroplane car - which is up for sale for £600,000 . With cars and congestion becoming too much for commuters in the 1940s, pioneering inventor Moulton Taylor developed a way to soar above the rest . The Aerocar was set to take the world by storm but after almost 25 years of campaigning Taylor still could still not strike a deal - he even lost a deal with auto giants Ford. Along with the original prototype, only four others were ever built and madcap collectors are battling to own the startling piece of engineering history - which is still able to cruise at 110mph. Greg Herrick, of aviation enthusiast Historic Sales, said: 'This was the peak of 20th century design at the time and was close to taking the world's imagination by storm. The first-ever Aerocar was built in 1949 and successfully proved that the roadster - complete with folding wings to keep it a street-worthy size - could be done .

'There really was nothing like it around at the time and the design attracted so much attention - it was such an incredibly advanced piece of kit. 'It was on the front of newspapers, magazines, books and on TV shows across the globe - it's popularity was unprecedented. 'But the oil crash in the 1970s and a lack of businesses willing to invest eventually led to all interest fizzling away - to this day there is still nothing like it.' Not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a car, but its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer .

The 21ft Aerocar is a two-place aircraft with side-by-side seating, four wheels, 30ft wingspan and a single Lycoming 0-320 engine mounted over the rear wheels. The propeller is mounted at the end of a long tail cone, and the latter is angled up considerably, to provide adequate propeller clearance. Its cruise speed is 100mph, and it initially sold for $25,000. Not only can it be readily converted from an airplane to a road-going car, but also its wings can be folded back along the sides of the detached fuselage and towed behind the automobile like a trailer. The idea for the Aerocar occurred to its designer Taylor in 1946. After meeting inventor Robert E. Fulton, Jr. he became captivated by the concept of his flying car. Molt immediately saw the weakness in the fixed, detachable wings of Fulton's design, and set about building his prototype Aerocar with folding wings, which he completed in 1949. After a successful demonstration flight, Molt promoted the Aerocar at aircraft and auto shows and on TV. As the flood of inquiries poured in, Molt raised money to certify the machine as an airplane, and to build four 'pre-production' Aerocars for demonstrations and eventual sale. Taylor built his first 'production' Aerocar in 1954 and flew them, as he attempted to develop a market into the early 1960s. He used fiberglass on the cars' outer panels to keep the weight down and developed a front wheel drive because the rear wheels were used for landing. Takeoff speed was 55 mph and the airplane was controlled with the same steering wheel. One Aerocar is owned by the Smithsonian museum group, one is in the EAA museum and two are in private hands . Molt was a gifted aeronautical engineer who was 'crazy about airplanes' and the battle to become a proud owner of the car has been extreme. Greg said: 'There are four surviving Aerocars out of five built.  One is owned by the Smithsonian museum group, one is in the EAA museum and two are in private hands. 'The prototype for the next generation is in the Boeing museum in Seattle. 'It's a really rare chance to buy this.'","Only four of the five 'Aerocars' ever built in the 1940s are still in existence .

The young woman, identified as Jane Doe in court, is now 20-years old but was 16 at the time of the October 2009 attack. As many as 20 men are thought to have . participated in the attack with one even answering the girl's cell phone . and telling her father how good his daughter was at sexual acts. Showing the scene: Crime scene analyst Johana Estrada-Bellardo testifies in court about the torn pantyhose and high heel (pictured right) found at the scene, along with two opened condom wrappers . Questioning the questions: Detective Cary Brown was asked to describe the lead-in questions police used for the interrogations of the various students involved in the case . The criminologist talked about the DNA found on the torn pantyhose that was found at the crimescene strewn over one of the victim's discarded heels. Two of the young men involved-Manuel Ortega and Ari Morales- agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years, respectively. Morales was the biggest draw of the witnesses heard in court on Thursday, as he was brought in from jail to testify against Jose Montano. Both legal teams accept that Montano was on top of the victim at one point during the attack, but today defense attorneys were focused on trying to determine whether Morales clearly saw that Montano was raping the girl or miming an action. His account: Ari Morales previously struck a plea deal and will spend 27 years behind bars after participating in the attack and urinating no the then-16-year-old girl . Testimony: He was brought into court on Thursday to talk about his recollections of Jose Montano's involvement . 'Did you see his penis,' the attorney asked Morales at one point. The exact wording of Morales' earlier conversations to police came up as a point of contention while Detective Cary Brown was on the stand earlier in the day. He was asked about police methodology, and whether officers used leading questions, or pretended to side with the teen boys in an effort to gain their trust- and eventually a confession. Mr Brown said that they did use similar tactics. 'Vile': Jose Montano, 22, (left) and Marcelles Peter, 20, (right) laughed about participating in a gang-rape on a 16-year-old girl after her homecoming dance in October 2009, a witness testified . On trial: Montano's attorney said while he witnessed the grisly attack, he had no part in it . In court: Peter initially said he was not at the crime scene, but later told them he only had a 'small role' In one such case, Morales admitted to his role in the attack by saying he was 'just being stupid'. Earlier . this week, the court heard from the girl's father, who received a . taunting phone call from his daughter's cell phone mid-attack where one . of the young men talked about how good she was at sexual acts. The victim herself also testified, talking about the extent of the horrific actions and the moments before she blacked out. She told the court she has a hazy memory of the attack but remembers getting kicked in the stomach and falling over. Jailed: Ari Morales, left, who told the witness . that he had urinated on the girl during the attack, and Manuel Ortega, . right, and agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years . respectively . 'Participants': John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned . himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces . charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison . for 26 years . In chains: Earlier this week, suspects (from right) Elvis Torrentes, John Crane Jr. and Jose Montano walk to a preliminary hearing in Martinez. As many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl . 'I . remember not seeing anything because my eyes were closed and I was . holding onto my necklace and getting kicked in the stomach,' she said. She . was repeatedly asked if she remembered drinking alcohol and said no, . though the defense said this contradicted what she told police and . medical staff after the attack. Nor does she have any recollection of . the sexual assault or consenting to any advances. Her . legs 'felt like somebody had ripped them out of place' and she felt . nauseated, 'as if someone had took out my insides, stabbed them and put . them back in', she said. Graphic . pictures of her swollen face and bruised body were shown to jurors as . she told them that to this day she still has scars on her back - the . result of cigarettes being extinguished on her skin. She . said she did not recall seeing Marcelles Peter that night and 'barely' recognized Jose Montano and only then because of his long hair. The woman received $4 million from the West Contra Costa County Unified School District though a civil claim in the case. The victim testified at the beginning of the third week of the trial. Face off: Nearly four years after she was gang raped, the victim of the brutal attack took the witness stand for the first time to recount her memories before she awoke the next day in 'excruciating pain' Horrific: Earlier in the trial, the jury was shown pictures of the injuries 'Jane Doe' sustained from the attack, which included cigarettes burned into her back .","Horrific gang rape at homecoming dance being relayed dramatically in Richmond, California courtroom .

Gimmicky - and expensive - new gloves allow chatterboxes to take the term 'handsfree' to a new level - by talking into them as they make a call. The gloves are known as 'Talk to the Hand' and cost £1,000 a pair. They come with a speaker unit embedded into the thumb and a microphone built into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth. The gloves have a speaker unit embedded in the thumb and microphone built into the little finger of the gloves and can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth . Artist Sean Miles designed the innovative gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that illustrates the possibilities of gadget recycling. He uses vintage Miu Miu and Pineider gloves and combines them with parts from mobile handsets recycled through O2, which commissioned the project. Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking their phone out of their pocket or handbag. Mr Miles, from Windsor, designed two pairs of the new gloves - one in pink and the other in brown and yellow. Artist Sean Miles designed the gloves to raise awareness about recycling old mobile handsets and consoles. They are made from vintage Miu Miu and Pineider gloves . They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves. If demand is high, they will then be produced on a larger scale. O2 Recycle, which backed the project, estimate that there are already 70 million unused mobile handsets in the UK. The service pays up to 260 pounds to those who recycle gadgets including phones, handheld consoles, SatNavs, MP3 players and digital cameras. Before you recycle your phone make sure you've deleted all of your personal data . Some retailers offer a service that enables you to return your old phone for nothing - and some will even pay you for it. And some councils run electrical waste schemes - but they might charge you for collection.

The designer has said he 'hopes that my Talk to the Hand project will get people to think again about the waste created by not recycling gadgets' 'While these might not be for everyone, there are hundreds of other uses that old phones can be put to - from being reconditioned and used again to being mined for their components. 'If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather than send them to landfill, I think this project will have fulfilled its aim.' The Talk to the Hand mobile phone gloves are the second product in a series that O2 Recycle and Miles have created. The first, known as Walkie Talkies, combined vintage footwear with old handsets to create customised, fully-functional phones. Miles is now working on combining phones with handbags - so people don't spend time rummaging around in their bags to find a phone when it rings. Bill Eyres, head of O2 Recycle, urges people to recycle their phone responsibly. He said: 'There's a pressing need for all of us to look at old handsets, and all the gadgets that we move on from or upgrade each year.

Row: Prosecutors believe text messages on the Olympic sprinter's phone will prove the couple were having an argument on the night of the shooting . Oscar Pistorius has ‘forgotten’ the four-digit passcode needed to unlock a mobile phone he was using on the night he killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Police have been forced to seek help from Apple in America to try to gain access to an iPhone 5 found on the floor of the bathroom in which the model was shot dead by Pistorius. The 26-year-old South African athlete, known as ‘Blade Runner’ because of his distinctive prosthetic limbs, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, 29, and prosecutors believe his phone contains vital evidence. The phone, along with three others, was found on the bathroom floor of his Pretoria home early on Valentine’s Day after Pistorius had shot and killed Reeva. Lieutenant General Vineshkumar Moonoo, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘Pistorius is saying he can’t remember the code and we have been unable to access messages sent or received that night. ‘These could be crucial and Apple executives in America have made their technicians available to help us. ‘I cannot say Pistorius’s memory failure is suspicious but the mobile phones were clearly in use up to the time of the killing.’ During the court hearing at which Pistorius was released on bail in March, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said examination of the mobile phones was vital. Mr Nel said detectives had found four mobile phones on the bathroom floor: two BlackBerries and two iPhones. Their position in the bathroom, close to the shower cubicle, could be evidence that the couple had a furious row during which Reeva had locked herself in. Trial: Pistorius will appear in court in August to face charges of murder. Information on his mobile phone is said to be crucial to the prosecution's case . Champion: Pistorius was feted as a Paralympic and Olympic legend before his arrest in February. He had only been dating Reeva Steenkamp for a few months before the shooting .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 07:05 EST, 17 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 18 June 2013 . The Irish have a reputation for enjoying a drink or two - partly due to TV characters such as Father Ted's Jack and the pub regulars in Mrs Browns' Boys. Now, a study of students has confirmed what many have believed all along - that those from the Emerald Isle do drink more than their international counterparts. The study, from University College Dublin (UCD), pins the blame on family drinking habits, same-sex schools and even if there's a cricket club nearby. A map by researchers from the University College Dublin shows how much the average Irish student drinks a year, by county. Students from counties shown in blue drink in excess of 351 units of alcohol a year. Students in Monagh, Donegal, Tiperrary and Carlow drink the least per year - between 200 and 250 units each . Support is growing for the introduction of drink-driving permits on rural Irish roads as a second council is set to hear a motion on the proposal. Councillors in County Kerry already backed a change in the law that would allow drinkers in rural areas to drive after having 'two or three drinks'. But despite widespread criticism of the proposal, originally put forward by pub owner and Independent councillor Danny Healy-Rae, a councillor in another county has expressed support. Independent Galway councillor Michael Fahy said in January he would raise the idea at the next sitting of his council's policy committee. He disagreed that more lax rules would lead to more road deaths, saying: 'We don't want to see people drunk, we're only talking about up to three pints.' Researchers asked 3,500 students - with an average age of 21 - about their alcohol consumption. The research provided a fascinating insight into how the culture of the country affected drinking. Boys who attended same-sex schools or boarding schools also drank more . in college, according to this study, than boys who attended mixed-sex establishments. How much a student's siblings drink also played a part, and affected male and female students equally. Geographically, . the researchers found that towns with a higher population of Catholics . drank less, on average, than towns with either a dominant Protestant . community or towns with no strong religious following. For example, towns where more masses took place per week raised students who drank less. And . counties in which the legalisation of divorce was supported during the . 1996 referendum - a move that was opposed by the Catholic Church - had . higher drinking levels. The research also found that people who lived in towns that had a cricket club drank more than other Irish towns. Participants were also asked questions about their family background and where they grew up, so the researchers could compare domestic and geographical influences. Respondents . were then asked about the drinking habits of mothers and fathers and . for each sibling over age 16, plus the town in which they lived at age . 10 and the . secondary school they attended. According to research from UCD, Irish students drink more than their international counterparts. One in seven of the 3,500 Irish students questioned said they drank at least two drinks a day, while only five per cent said they didn't drink at all . Characters such as Father Jack, played by Irishman Frank Kelly (pictured) and renowned for repeatedly shouting for a 'drink' during the show have fueled the stereotype that Irish people like to drink alcohol . The . researchers found that students from the Republic of Ireland drank . more, on average, than international students from the UK and U.S - . compared to previous studies on drinking habits from those regions. They were then able to create a map showing the annual volume of alcoholic drinking by Irish students broken down by county. Of . the 3,500 people asked, five percent of them did not drink at all while . one in seven consumed, on average, more than two drinks every day. In general, drinking concentrated on a few days per week of very heavy drinking. For example, eight percent of students . drank 10 or more drinks on the occasions that they consumed alcohol, . while one in five drank between seven and nine drinks each time they . consumed alcohol. While their parents' education, age, marital status and income played little part in determining how much they drank, if their parents - especially their mothers - drank, they did too. A father's drinking, on the other hand, only influenced the drinking habits of sons. The study said: 'We find that drinking of mothers significantly impacts the number of drinks consumed by both female and male students about equally. 'But drinking of fathers appears only to influence drinking of their college-attending sons.' The researchers claimed this was because cricket is an English import and places that had a strong English cultural influence drank more. The research team also checked whether . the average rainfall and temperature of a region played a part in the . amount its residents drank, yet they could find no evidence to suggest . this. Irish cricketers celebrate taking the last wicket of Zimbabwe during the 2007 ICC World Cup Cricket. Research from UCD discovered that students who lived in towns with a cricket club drank more. The study claimed this was because cricket is an English import and places with a strong English cultural influence drank more . Commenting on the research, Discover Magazine said: 'This is a nice study, although it does suffer from being a student sample and purely self-report. It’s also a useful reminder of the importance of not confusing correlation with causation. Living near a cricket club clearly doesn’t cause anyone to drink more. It’s a marker for other cultural factors, no less real, but hard to measure directly. But it is easy to forget this, to see only the tangible tip of the iceberg and overlook the true causes beneath the surface.'","Researchers from the University College Dublin discovered that, on average, students in Ireland drink more than their international counterparts .

It could take years to extradite NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden from Hong Kong to the USA on charges of espionage and according to legal experts, the move would likely be blocked by China. On Friday, the US has charged Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two charges are part of the US Espionage Act.  All three crimes carry a maximum 10-year prison penalty. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been charged with espionage and theft and U.S. officials are seeking his extradition from Hong Kong . Hong Kong Legislators responded by calling for mainland China to intervene in the case. Snowden, 29, who is apparently hiding in Hong Kong, was last seen on 10th June. The US and Hong Kong have had an . extradition treaty in place since 1998, the year after Hong Kong was . transferred from British to Chinese rule. While espionage and theft of state . secrets are not cited specifically in the treaty, charged could be . brought against Snowden under Hong Kong's official secrets ordinance. Many Americans have been sent back for trial under the treaty but such extraditions can often take between three to five years. However, it would also require the . Hong Kong authorities to charge Snowden with a similar crime otherwise . the extradition process could not begin and Snowden would theoretically . be free to leave the city. Under Hong Kong's extradition system, a request first goes through diplomatic channels to the government, who decides whether to issue an 'authority to proceed'. If granted, a magistrate would issue a formal warrant for the arrest of Snowden. Once brought before the court, the judge would decide whether there was sufficient evidence to commit Snowden to trial or dismiss the case, though any decision could be appealed in a higher court. Snowden could claim political asylum in Hong Kong, arguing he would face torture back home. In general, the extradition agreement . between the U.S. and Hong Kong excepts political offenses from the . obligation to turn over a person. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, . welcomed the charges. 'I've always thought this was a treasonous act,' he said in a statement. 'I hope Hong Kong's government will take him . into custody and extradite him to the U.S.' The unfairness of his trial at home . and his likely treatment in custody woudl be factors to consider when . assessing Snowden's chances of claiming political immunity from . extradition. Even if a Hong Kong court decided . that Snowden should be extradited, Hong Kong's leader and China could . still veto the decision on national security or defense grounds. Snowden has admitted leaking secrets about classified US surveillance programmes, which he said he did in the public interest. Supporters say he is a whistleblower, while critics call him a criminal and perhaps even a traitor. Snowden,  has admitted providing information to the news media about two highly classified NSA surveillance programs. A one-page criminal complaint . unsealed Friday in federal court in Alexandria, Va., says Snowden . engaged in unauthorized communication of national defense information . and willful communication of classified communications intelligence . information. Helping hand: WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn . Hrafnsson, left, approached Iceland on behalf of Snowden and his . middleman. Julian Assange, right, also sought help from Iceland ahead of . Wikileaks' releases . Iceland has a reputation for . promoting internet freedoms and has long been discussed as an option for Snowden. As a U.S. citizen, Snowden would not need a visa to enter Iceland and could immediately apply for asylum. He would be free to live in Iceland while immigration authorities decide his case, which could take more than a year, experts have said. But if Snowden wants to seek refuge in Iceland, he'll have to get there first. And this is where the U.S. could have a chance. Interpol will sometimes issue a 'red notice' - which is like an international arrest warrant - but keep it sealed so that the person doesn't know it exists. If he tried to travel, he would be arrested at the airport. If he did get to Iceland, it is unknown if he would be safe. The government of newly-elected Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson is believed to be closer to Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they (the government) would be eager to engage in any international disputes with the U.S. And it is pretty difficult to be granted asylum here,' Stefania Oskarsdottir, lecturer in political science at the University of Iceland, told Reuters. 'I think what this guy is saying is based on something he is imagining or hoping for rather than actual facts.' Iceland does have an extradition treaty with . the United States, but it is unclear if it would cover any crimes . that he might be charged with. Michael di Pretoro, a retired 30-year . veteran with the FBI who served from 1990 to 1994 as the legal liaison . officer at the American consulate in Hong Kong, said 'relations between . U.S. and Hong Kong law enforcement personnel are historically quite . good.' 'In my time, I felt the degree of . cooperation was outstanding to the extent that I almost felt I was in an . FBI field office,' said di Pretoro. The U.S. and Hong Kong cooperate on law enforcement matters and have a standing agreement on the surrender of fugitives. However, Snowden's appeal rights could drag out any extradition proceeding. The success or failure of any . extradition proceeding depends on what the suspect is charged with under . U.S. law and how it corresponds to Hong Kong law under the treaty. In . order for Hong Kong officials to honor the extradition request, they . have to have some applicable statute under their law that corresponds . with a violation of U.S. law. News of the charges broke on Friday . evening, the same day it emerged that Snowden could be flown to Iceland . from Hong Kong by the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. A businessman connected to the . controversial website said a chartered private jet is ready for the . 30-year-old, who fled to Hong Kong after leaking U.S security details. It comes after Iceland admitted holding talks with Snowden . over the possibility of seeking political asylum. Olafur Sigurvinsson, head of DataCell, which handles donations to Wikileaks, revealed details of the private jet. Speaking to Channel2 television, he said: 'Everything is ready on our side and the plane could take off tomorrow. 'We have really done all we can do. We have a plane and all the logistics in place.' The jet is believed to belong to a Chinese firm and has been chartered at a cost of $240,000. WikiLeaks . founder Julian Assange revealed on Wednesday he had been in contact . with Snowden's representatives to discuss his possible bid for asylum in . Iceland. The former US government contractor fled to Hong Kong on May 20 after leaking National Security Agency programs. It also emerged that a contractor for the National Security Agency found possible . discrepancies in a resume submitted by Edward Snowden, but the company . still employed him, a source said . on Thursday. Snowden was hired this spring after . he convinced his hiring screeners at Booz Allen Hamilton, that his . description of his education was truthful. It is unclear precisely which element . of Snowden's resume caused personnel officials at Booz Allen Hamilton . to raise questions about his background. Also unclear is how he . satisfied their concerns. Booz Allen Hamilton has said in a . statement that 'we will work closely with our clients and authorities in . their investigation of this matter.' Snowden fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, after exposing the U.S. government's top surveillance secrets. He is at a secret location in Hong Kong. In . a column in Icelandic daily newspaper Frettabladid, WikiLeaks spokesman . Kristinn Hrafnsson wrote that a middleman had approached him on behalf . of Snowden. 'On 2 June, I received a message from Edward Snowden where he asked me to . notify the Icelandic government that he wanted to seek asylum in . Iceland,' Hrafnsson, who is also an investigative journalist in Iceland, . told Reuters. Support: Snowden's image is displayed in Hong Kong, where the whistleblower is currently in hiding . He added . that he has yet to receive a response from officials about his request . but said they have a 'moral obligation' to answer the call for help. The . Icelandic government, which has refused to say whether they would grant . asylum to Snowden, confirmed it had received the message from . Hrafnsson. 'Kristinn Hrafnsson has contacted two ministries in an informal way but not the ministers,' a government spokesman said. 'There has been no formal approach in this matter.' Hrafnsson would not identify who the middleman was. Snowden has previously mentioned Iceland as a possible refuge. Iceland has a reputation for . promoting Internet freedoms, but Snowden has said did not travel there . immediately from the United States as he feared the country could be . pressured by Washington. 'Iceland . could be pushed harder, quicker, before the public could have a chance . to make their feelings known, and I would not put that past the current . U.S. administration,' Snowden said in an online forum in the Guardian on . Monday. It had been . suggested that he would actually flee to the Icelandic consulate in Hong . Kong, rather than risking boarding a plane to fly there in person. Safety: Iceland has a reputation for promoting internet freedoms. Reykjavik is pictured . Icelandic officials told USA Today last week that Snowden is missing a key element. 'The main stipulation for seeking . asylum in Iceland would be that the person must be in Iceland to start . the process,' said Johannes Tomasson, the chief spokesman for Iceland's . Ministry of Interior in Reykjavik. 'That would be the ground rule No. 1.' WikiLeaks founder . Julian Assange, who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to . avoid extradition to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sex . crimes, visited Iceland several times in the run-up to some of the . website's major releases. Assange denies any wrongdoing. Yet some experts added that Iceland might not be as welcoming as Snowden hopes. The government of newly-elected Prime . Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson has not been tested in relation to these cases, but is believed to be closer to . Washington than past administrations and less keen to foster the . country's cyber-haven image. 'I would be very surprised if they .

Opposed: Lord Lester has said that controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill would damage free speech and break human rights laws if allowed to stand . Labour-inspired proposals on media law would curb the free Press in a way ‘never seen in any democratic country’, a senior peer warned last night. Eminent QC Lord Lester said controversial amendments to the Defamation Bill pushed through with Labour support this month would damage free speech and break European human rights laws if they were allowed to stand. He accused Labour of ‘hijacking’ the legislation in an attempt to force the Government to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s plans for regulation of the Press in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Ministers are said to be so concerned by the proposals that the entire piece of legislation could be abandoned. But Lord Lester, the architect of the Defamation Bill, said this would be a travesty, as vital reforms of Britain’s notorious libel laws would also be lost. His intervention comes amid growing Government anxiety about an amendment pushed through the Lords by 272 votes to 141 earlier this month. The amendment, put forward by Labour-supporting film director Lord Puttnam, would introduce an arbitration service for members of the public wronged by  the Press. The legislation would mean that newspapers that did not join the system could be punished by courts awarding potentially ruinous damages and costs. Crossbench peer Lord Skidelsky, who is backing the move, yesterday suggested the arbitration system could help prevent the publication of ‘things which may be true, but whose publication has no sufficient reason’. He suggested newspapers should face exemplary damages if they failed to get approval from the new regulator before publication. But Lord Lester said this form of ‘prior restraint’ – which was demanded by former Formula One boss Max Mosley – was only used in a handful of former Soviet states. Changes: The amendment to the Defamation Bill put forward by Lord Puttnam, left, followed Lord Leveson's report into press ethics . Lord Lester said the impact of the Puttnam amendments would be to introduce ‘a form of coercion I have not seen in any democratic country’. Warning: David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom . He told the Daily Mail: ‘The scheme they are recommending would be totally incompatible with human rights and free speech. Instead of having self-regulation, which I believe strongly in, you would have a coerced system of arbitration.’ Lord Lester, a Liberal Democrat  peer, said the amendment was ‘inappropriate’ as it tacked controversial privacy issues on to legislation on libel reform which has cross-party support, including the stated support of Labour. He added: ‘They have taken the Bill hostage in order to put pressure on the party leaders and the Press over the implementation of the Leveson reforms. 'But Leveson wasn’t interested in libel law, he was interested in privacy. ‘I very much hope that when the Bill comes back to the Commons we can get agreement across the parties to release the Bill from the limbo it is now in so  that we can get these reforms onto the statute book.’ The Defamation Bill, which has all-party support, would bring in long-overdue reforms to Britain’s antiquated libel laws. The political parties are still locked in stalemate over how to implement Lord Justice Leveson’s reforms. Labour is demanding new laws to back up a new independent Press regulator. But David Cameron has warned that legislation could prove to be the thin end of the wedge and allow future politicians to interfere with Press freedom. He wants a new regulator to be established by Royal Charter.","QC Lord Lester spoke out against amendments to Defamation Bill .

The black market for child trade in China have been helped by economic reforms easing cross-province transport (stock image) Chinese police freed over 180 children when busting two major child trafficking gangs, officials report. Police arrested 802 suspects in a nationwide move against child-trafficking which involved over 10,000 officers. Critics blame lax adoption laws and the one-child policy saying it has led to an expanding black market of child-trafficking. Human trade involving children has become a big problem in China where . they are often sold for adoption or as cheap labour and household . servants. In the latest operation, 181 children were rescued from traffickers in 15 provincial regions including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan. Investigations that led to the current round of arrests began in December 2011 when four suspects were caught in Henan province while attempting to sell four babies, the BBC reports. A ‘Level A’ suspect, Shao Zhongyuan, was caught in Pingyi county, Shandong province, the Ministry of Public Security said yesterday. According to the ministry he was part of a gang which trafficked more than 100 children. The . recent economic reforms resulting in greater freedom of movement is . believed to have made in easier for trafficking gangs to operate in the . country. Christine . Beddoe, director of ECPAT UK, the UK’s leading organisation working . against the exploitation of children for pornography, prostitution and . trafficking, said that numbers are elusive as they are not formally . collected, but that they have noticed a change over the past decade. A mother and her child are pictured standing on a street corner next to a sign that lists the 'One child per family' rules from Chinese authorities . ‘In our experience the number of children being trafficked in to the UK from China has increased over the past ten years. ‘Due to the nature of trafficking the numbers that we do see are only the tip of the iceberg.’ The US Department of State's 2012 Trafficking In Persons report also blamed the one-child policy in China: ‘Well-organized international criminal syndicates and local gangs play key roles in both internal and cross-border trafficking. ‘China’s birth limitation policy, coupled with a cultural preference for sons, creates a skewed sex ratio in China, which served as a key cause of trafficking of foreign women as brides for Chinese men and for forced prostitution.’ An officer from the MPS speaking to . China Daily said that police have stopped child trafficking from . increasing, but the illegal practice was still prominent in some areas.","Nationwide operations saw over 800 arrests and 181 children freed in 15 Chinese provinces .

The 52-year-old took offence when BBC Wiltshire radio reporter Marie Lennon slammed his forthcoming pantomime appearance in a post on her Twitter page saying ‘Keith Chegwin’s voice makes me feel physically sick’. The Scouse star - known as Cheggers - responded on the social networking site, criticising the ‘rude’ tweet saying: ‘How BBC radio has changed. Sad’. Online argument: Keith Chegwin (left) wasn't impressed with BBC Wiltshire radio reporter Marie Lennon (right) 'slagging' him off using the BBC name. She apologised and blamed a 'very long day' for her tweet . The reporter who presents BBC Introducing in Wiltshire hastily deleted her offensive remark and apologised to the presenter - who used to front TV favourite Swap Shop for the corporation. She has since deleted her Twitter account. A spokesman for the BBC said yesterday: 'This was her personal view for which she has now apologised. It doesn’t reflect the views of the station. Twitter tactics: BBC radio reporter Marie Lennon was quick to delete her tweet about Keith Chegwin's voice making her 'sick' but not before the TV legend saw it and responded . ‘BBC Wiltshire is looking forward to Keith Chegwin appearing in pantomime at the Wyvern Theatre this Christmas.’ The row broke after it emerged Keith Chegwin, who played Buttons in Cinderella at Wyvern Theatre, in Swindon, Wiltshire, last year, was due back to star in Aladdin this year. Always the entertainer: Wyvern Theatre where Cheggers will perform in a Christmas pantomime, are 'huge fans' of his voice .

A 30-year-old man who allegedly groomed a teenager online with promises that he would marry her has been caught after the 15-year-old girl's parents set up a Facebook sting. After the family of the Spokane girl discovered she had been meeting a man she met on Facebook, her mother posed as her daughter online and arranged a meeting. When Jason Richards arrived at the family home in Spokane, Washington, in the early hours of June 8, the girl's father and his friends were waiting for him. Online predator: Jason Richards faces child rape and attempted kidnap charges after allegedly having a relationship with a girl he groomed online . Richards, of Federal Way, Washington, is now facing charges of child rape and attempted kidnapping. The alleged relationship with the underage girl began in April, through the Facebook app Are You Interested? The 30-year-old had exchanged hundreds of messages with the teenager and, despite knowing her age, arranged to meet at a hotel twice in May, where he had sex with her. The coffee distributor gave the girl an engagement ring and discussed running away with the girl to western Washington, where they would change her name and appearance, according to the Spokane Review. 'I think it's important to understand . that you're dealing with a very manipulative suspect and so they're . going to hone in on whatever it is that that victim needs in order to . get closer to them,' Sergeant Justin Lundgren, of Spokane Police, said. The alleged abuser had boasted of his engagement on his Facebook page, but did not identify his fiancee. Richards allegedly bought the girl a cell phone and she agreed to delete her Facebook account so her parents would not be able to find her. Online relationship: The suspect's Facebook page, right, shows he was engaged after meeting the victim on AYI . 'He was very patient and, like I said, it was a very slow developing relationship over time and ultimately ending in the abuse situation,' Sergeant Lundgren, told KXLY. When the parents of the girl, who has not been identified, found out about the relationship on June 7 they confiscated her iPad and took over her Facebook account. In messages sent from the mother, posing as her daughter, Richards was told to come to the house that night so they could run away. But when he arrived at the family home at about 3am on June 8, he was confronted by the girl's father and his friends who had been hiding in an alley. The group blocked his escape route and detained Richards until police arrived and arrested him. Groomed: Spokane police sergeant Justin Lundgren says manipulative suspects hone in on the victim's needs . 'The suspect believed he was communicating with the victim online and as such felt comfortable going to contact her again and as a result we were able to arrest him at that time,' Sergeant Lundgren said. Richards initially told investigators he believed the girl was 18, but a review his chat history showed he knew she was 15 before their sexual relationship began, according to SWX. His bond was set at $100,000 by Superior Court Judge James Triplet last week.

Brave: Cargo ship skipper Captain John Bell, pictured, was the first to take out a German submarine during the First World War . A medal belonging to a cargo ship captain who became a national hero for sinking the first German U-boat has emerged for the first time after 98 years. Captain John Bell was transporting coal from Newcastle to Plymouth in a small and completely unarmed cargo steamship when an enemy submarine fired a torpedo at his vessel in the English Channel in 1915. But despite being at a severe disadvantage, he went on the offensive and rammed his vessel at the German U-boat’s periscope, the only part of the submarine which was visible, until he heard a loud crash from beneath them. Minutes later oil from the stricken sub floated to the surface of the sea and the vessel was never seen again. The astonishing feat happened just a few months into the First World War when German U-boats posed a real menace to Royal Navy shipping, with five cruisers being lost to them in the first 10 weeks. After returning to port with the news that Captain Bell’s ship had become the first to sink a German U-boat, the skipper and his crew were each given a reward of £860, the equivalent of  £75,000 today. Captain Bell also received the Distinguished Service Order (DSC) by King George V at Buckingham Palace, an 18 carat gold watch and a celebratory dinner was held in his honour at the Mansion House in London. Now nearly 100 years on from the event, his DSC and engraved watch are being sold at auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £5,000. James Morten, of auctioneers Morten and Eden, said: 'John Bell was a merchant seamen, he wasn’t a military person. Famous: John Bell's cargo steamship Thordis is depicted in this painting sailing at full speed toward the German U-boat's periscope, which can just be seen poking out of the water, in the English Channel in 1915 . 'Yet when attacked by a menacing U-boat his instincts weren’t to turn and run but quite the opposite. 'After spotting the periscope he decided to ram the submarine and all the evidence was that he sunk it. 'He was feted as a hero and trumpeted for being the first person to sink a German submarine of the war.' Captain John Bell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order medal which is now being auctioned . Capt Bell’s ship, the SS Thordis, had . been travelling from Newcastle to Plymouth with a cargo of coal when it . came under attack eight miles off Beachy Head, East Sussex, in February . 1915. In his deposition later made to customs officers at Weymouth, Dorset, Capt Bell said: 'I observed periscope of submarine on starboard bow. 'I immediately ordered all hands on deck in case of emergency. 'I then observed submarine pass across our bow and on to our port beam, where it took up a position 30 to 40 yards off. 'Shortly after this I noticed the wake of torpedo on my starboard beam. 'I then put my helm hard over to starboard and ran over periscope, when I and all the crew heard and felt crash under bottom. 'I did not see submarine after, but saw oil floating on water. I then proceeded on voyage.' Capt Bell was mentioned in dispatches a month later. The write-up in the London Gazette read: 'Lieutenant John William Bell, Royal Naval Reserve, of the steamship Thordis for his gallant and spirited conduct in ramming a German submarine, which had fired a torpedo at the Thordis.' The gold stopwatch being sold is engraved with the words ‘...for sinking the first German submarine in the great European War 1914-15.' The auction takes place in London on July 2.

A girl of 10 was allegedly raped on a bus after its driver, a neighbour of her family, lured her aboard as she played outside her Delhi home yesterday . A ten-year-old girl was allegedly raped on a Delhi bus by its driver in a case certain to revive bad memories of the fatal gang-rape of a student in the city late last year. The victim was playing outside her home in a cluster of slums in the Indian capital's Sultanpuri area yesterday when bus driver Rakesh Kaushal is said to have lured her into the vehicle. Once aboard the bus and out of sight of her parents 47-year-old Kaushal, a neighbour of the family, is alleged to have raped the youngster. Police arrested Kaushal on suspicion . of rape after the victim's parents reported the crime and a medical . examination confirmed that she was sexually assaulted, the Press Trust of India reported. The . issue of women's safety has been top of the political agenda since a . 23-year-old student was gang-raped and left for dead on a bus in Delhi . in December. She later died of horrific injuries inflicted with a metal bar which led to doctors removing parts of her intestine. That . case sparked outrage and widespread protest at the treatment of women . in the country, which has seen a sharp fall in the numbers of foreign . tourists, especially women, since the high-profile case hit the . headlines. But the latest case is already the second alleged rape of a minor this month in area around the Indian capital. It . emerged last week that another ten-year-old allegedly raped by a . neighbour was locked in a cell by police after her family tried to . report the crimes. The girl . was reportedly found barely conscious following the attack close to her . home in a village a two hour drive from Delhi the weekend before last. Her family are now said to be facing death threats in an attempt to force them to withdraw the complaint. As the spotlight shines on the treatment of women in India, the country's government has proposed a number of reforms to protect women. Those range from scrapping degrading . medical examinations at police stations for rape victims to, revealed . today, the decision to paint pink the seats reserved for women on . Delhi's public transport. Widespread outrage: Indian protesters hold banners and wear black ribbons during a rally in New Delhi on December 30 following the cremation of a gang-rape victim in the Indian capital . Delhi transport minister Ramakant Goswami told the Hindustan Times the need to change the colour of women's seats was felt after authorities increased the number of seats reserved for women on public buses. 'Earlier, only the left row of the bus used to have reserved seats for women. With increased number of reserved seats, even the row of seats on the right side has seats for women,' he said. 'We have put stickers in the existing fleet but new buses will have pink-coloured seats for easy identification.' The new buses will also come with built-in global positioning system devices and space to install web-cams or close circuit television to ensure that authorities know what is happening aboard the vehicles.","Youngster is said to have been playing outside her slum home when she was lured aboard the bus and raped by a 47-year-old neighbour .

The father of a woman who was fatally shot by her husband in 2009 was heckled by pro-gun protesters - one of whom was eventually Tasered by police - at a rally outside of the New Hampshire statehouse on Tuesday, which has added new fuel to the fire in the already torrid debate over gun control. John Cantin, whose daughter Melisa was fatally shot by her estranged husband when she was just 29 years old, was speaking at a rally for stricter gun control measures, including additional background checks for people purchasing firearms. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shameless: Daniel Musso (left) heckles the father of a woman fatally shot by her estranged husband at a rally for stricter gun-control laws . In the middle of his speech, a man - later identified by police as Daniel Musso - started harassing him. Below is a transcript of some of the exchange, as captured in a video posted on Youtube: . CANTIN: We know that when there is a gun in the home of a domestic abuser, a woman is 500 times more likely to be killed— . MUSSO: What kind of gun are you talking here? CANTIN: And we know in states where there are background checks— . MUSSO: A pellet gun? Or a machine gun? What kind of guns? CANTIN: All kinds of guns. MUSSO: Well, it doesn’t say that in your speech. Musso and his pro-gun cohorts went on to call Cantin's speech nothing but propaganda, to which Cantin replied, 'what happened to my daughter wasn't propaganda,' during an interview with CNN's Martin Bashir this afternoon. Shut up! Daniel Musso argues with police before being arrested for disorderly conduct and assault . Melisa Cantin Charbonneau - a 29-year-old mother and nurse - was murdered by her estranged husband, Jonathan Charbonneau, in October of 2009, just days after he was arrested for throwing her down a flight of stairs and strangling her . The day Jonathan Charbonneau shot his wife, he was out of jail on $30 bail for the previous misdemeanor assault. In addition to murdering his wife, Jonathan Charbonneau shot her father, John, and killed himself. John Cantin survived the attack and then spent years lobbying for stricter domestic violence laws, arguing that if his former son-in-law hadn't been out on bail after assaulting Melisa Cantin, she might still be alive. 'I don't believe this bill will stop the person doing the choking, but at least when it does happen and they are arrested, they are put away,' Cantin said in a 2010 interview with USA Today. He's since shifted his lobbying efforts to include advocating for stricter gun-control laws. Zap! Police Taser Musso after a brief scuffle . Senator Kelly Ayotte issued a statement saying she 'hopes that everyone would be civil at all events no matter what their viewpoint is' Many of the pro-gun advocates who showed up at Tuesday's rally are supporters of Republican New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, who in April voted against a bill that would have expanded background checks to include people who buy guns online and at gun shows. While 40 other Republicans and five Democrats opposed the bill, New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg's pro-gun-control organization, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, has specifically targeted Ayotte by spending more than $400,000 on an ad campaign in her home state claiming she opposes background checks for gun-buyers.

The father whose baby died at a scandal-hit maternity unit begged the former health secretary to investigate three years ago but was told nothing could be done. James Titcombe wrote to Andrew Lansley in June 2010, urging him to look at Furness General Hospital and warning him that other lives were at risk. But the former health secretary did not reply and instead instructed an official at the Department of Health’s ‘customer service centre’ to inform him he was ‘unable to comment’. Scroll down for video . James Titcombe, pictured with his wife and Joshua's mother Hoa, wrote to then health secretary Andrew Lansley in 2010 warning him about standards at Furness General Hospital . Mr Titcombe’s son Joshua died at the unit in November 2008 from a chest infection which should have been treated by a course of antibiotics. He is one of 14 babies and two mothers feared to have died at the hospital since 2001 because of neglect – another 30 infants and women suffered serious harm. This week it emerged that three bosses at the Care Quality Commission tried to cover-up evidence of a botched inspection into the unit in 2010. A report disclosed how former CQC chief executive Cynthia Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and head of press Anna Jefferson tried to get evidence deleted in case it damaged their reputations. Miss Finney is said to have told the critical report’s author Louise Dineley to ‘delete’ it, adding ‘read my lips’. Tragedy: Joshua Titcombe is held by his sister Emily, before he died just days later in Furness General Hospital in 2008 after staff failed to spot and treat an infection . Bad care: 14 babies and two mothers feared to have died at Furness General Hospital since 2001 because of neglect ¿ another 30 infants and women suffered serious harm . And when asked whether it should be published, Miss Jefferson, 38, is alleged to have said: ‘Are you kidding me?’ She has since denied making that comment, while Miss Finney and Mrs Bower have both said that they did not intend to cover up the report. Backed by MPs, the families of children who died have demanded a police inquiry. Scotland Yard is now considering a possible probe surrounding misconduct in a public office. Mr Titcombe, 35, said yesterday: ‘Our plea was simply ignored. Someone from the Department for Health replied on his behalf by email. ‘They said they could not comment on individual cases. It was pathetic.’ Mr Titcombe wrote to Mr Lansley after trying in vain to get various other bodies to investigate the tragedy – including the CQC and the Health Ombudsman. Cover up: Care Quality Commission executive Cynthia Bower tried to get rid of evidence of blunders . The letter read: ‘In order to save lives in the NHS and react more quickly when things go wrong, it is clear to me that the system in place at the moment needs to change.’ He explained how staff at the trust were refusing to accept responsibility for Joshua’s death and had even managed to lose his medical records – crucial evidence into the events leading up to the tragedy. ‘Although the trust undertook an investigation into Joshua’s death, so much of the detail regarding what happened to Joshua has not been accepted,’ Mr Titcombe wrote. ‘Our son’s critical medical records have gone missing and there are discrepancies between what my wife and I know happened and what staff have reported. It feels to us like all lessons from Joshua’s death can’t be taken on while what happened to him remains in dispute. ‘Now that your Government is in power, you have a huge opportunity to improve things and ensure that experiences such as ours become less frequent. This has to start with instances such as Joshua’s death being investigated properly and all lessons being learned.’ But Mr Lansley did not reply and instead instructed an official to tell him he was ‘not in a position to intervene’. In an email, an official called Will Pinkney told Mr Titcombe: ‘I’m afraid the Department of Health is unable to comment on individual cases and therefore the Secretary of State is not in a position to intervene personally on your behalf.’ He told Mr Titcombe to go back to the Ombudsman, and the letter ended: ‘I hope you find this reply really helpful.’ Mr Titcombe last night called for a full police investigation into the cover-up. He said: ‘My view is that the police should now interview these people and carry out an investigation to understand what happened. ‘The act of covering up and deleting the internal review raises issues which have been widely talked about as approaching a criminal act and I think those circumstances need to be formally investigated.’ Earlier this year the Government said it would be carrying out an independent inquiry into the maternity unit – similar to that undertaken at Mid Staffordshire hospital, where hundreds died through neglect. Questions: Former pasta promoter Jill Finney . The Health Secretary yesterday called for disgraced watchdog bosses to be stripped of their taxpayer-funded pensions. Former Care Quality Commission chief executive Cynthia Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and head of press Anna Jefferson have triggered fury after it emerged they tried to suppress evidence of a botched inspection into a maternity unit. Up to 14 babies and two mothers are known to have died because of poor care at the maternity unit at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria over the past decade. But in 2010, the CQC carried out a two-day inspection of the unit – prompted by concerned families – and passed it as ‘safe’. Earlier this week it emerged that the three women tried to ‘cover up’ evidence showing that the inspection had been flawed and there were serious failings at the unit. Backed by MPs, the families of the children who died have demanded a police inquiry and Scotland Yard is considering a possible probe surrounding misconduct in a public office. Speaking yesterday, Jeremy Hunt said: ‘These are very, very serious allegations and they should have very, very serious consequences if they are proved. ‘I know the CQC are looking into disciplinary procedures and what can be done, what sanctions are available – whether you can have forfeiture of pensions. ‘There has to be due process, but it is totally appalling that this kind of thing should happen. Miss Bower, 57, resigned from the watchdog last year on a £1.4million pension while Miss Finney, 54, left in February on a retirement package valued at £95,000. Miss Jefferson is currently on maternity leave. There has also been anger over the way Miss Finney obtained her job at the CQC. A PR expert who was once responsible for promoting pasta, she was appointed to the CQC in February 2009. At the time, her husband David Lane was a consultant helping to set up the CQC when it replaced the Healthcare Commission. Both former Care Quality Commission chief executive Cynthia Bower, left, and head of press Anna Jefferson and tried to cover up evidence of a botched inspection into a maternity unit at Furness General Hospital . Meanwhile, Miss Bower was appointed despite failing to stop the care scandal at Mid Staffordshire when she was head of the regional health authority. MPs are demanding an investigation into the recruitment methods used in the NHS for senior managers. Yesterday Steve Barclay, a Tory MP on the public accounts committee, said: ‘There are serious questions to be asked about how a number of key players in this scandal managed to get their jobs in the first place and keep them for so long. ‘Cynthia Bower was in a key leadership position when hundreds of people died unnecessarily at Mid Staffs and was then promoted.’ Mr Barclay added: ‘A clear picture is emerging of a cosy cadre at the highest levels of the Health Service.’ Not happy: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Jeremy Hunt yesterday admitted that he could not guarantee hospitals are safe, because he is ‘not happy’ with the inspection regime. The Health Secretary described this week’s revelations about the cover-up of baby deaths at Morecambe Bay Hospitals as ‘utterly shocking’. He vowed that a new system would ensure hospital wards and nursing homes were inspected only by professionals in that field. Asked if he could guarantee hospitals are safe at the moment, Mr Hunt said: ‘No I can’t and that’s why we want a new chief inspector of hospitals to come in and give us that expert assessment. ‘Someone independent who is going around and saying we can trust this hospital, this hospital’s doing a great job, or no, we’ve got problems in this one. ‘We don’t have that at the moment and that’s what we need.’ While admitting his words would alarm patients, he said: ‘I need to tell the truth – we don’t have a regulatory system and a regulator that’s doing what the public need.’ Senior managers at the Care Quality Commission are accused of suppressing a devastating internal report warning about the deaths at Furness General Hospital. Former chief executive Cynthia Bower was accused of bullying whistleblower Kay Sheldon for speaking out about failings. Yesterday another whistleblower, former CQC inspector Amanda Pollard, told how she had written two letters to Miss Bower, expressing safety concerns, and was ignored. Dr Heather Wood, who uncovered the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospitals where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily, said yesterday that CQC was ‘not fit for purpose’. Important work investigating  hospital infection rates and maternity services had been axed, she  said, and unqualified people put in top positions. Dr Wood said: ‘How many other reports have we not seen?’ A spokesman for David Cameron said he agreed with Mr Hunt and believed that a ‘generalist system of inspectors was a huge mistake’.","James Titcombe warned health secretary Andrew Lansley about hospital .

Tensions ran high when Ian Botham and his opposite number Ian Chappell clashed in a Melbourne hotel in 1977.

The pair were pulled apart but continued to trade insults for years, with Botham saying of Chappell: 'As a human being, he is a non-entity.' PONTING RUN-OUT .

Dennis Lillee walked out with a controversial metal bat in the middle of the 1979 Ashes test in Perth.

Failing to see the funny side: Jimmy Carr had to slope off stage early after being heckled about his tax avoidance at a charity gig in London last night . Jimmy Carr was forced to cut short his stand-up routine at a charity event after being mercilessly heckled over tax avoidance. The 40-year-old was headline act but while comedians further down the bill at the Hackney Empire in east London got a warm welcome, Carr was greeted by a heckler shouting ‘pay your taxes’ as soon as he took to the stage. He announced that he would tell 50 jokes but soon faced further tax-related taunts and other heckles including ‘you’re not one of us’ and ‘you’re not wanted here’. He ended up abandoning much of his intended act – and sang a Neil Diamond hit instead. Carr was criticised by the Prime Minister last year when his use of a controversial Jersey-based tax scheme was revealed. He subsequently joked that he knew he was in trouble ‘when Cameron broke off a meeting with Obama [US President] to say “Jimmy Carr is a d***”.’ Carr used Twitter to apologise for sheltering millions of pounds from tax using an avoidance scheme called K2. He admitted at the time that he had made a ‘terrible error of judgment’ but had left the scheme and would ‘in future conduct my financial affairs more responsibly’. At Thursday’s launch of Arts Emergency, a charity to defend education in the arts and provide mentoring for underprivileged students, Carr said he thought it would be nice to do a gig for a ‘great cause’. As the heckling continued, he asked for audience members who did not like his act to allow others to enjoy it but he got no respite. A male member of the crowd said Carr used to be funny around a decade ago, leading Carr to brand him ‘a hipster who only likes the early stuff’. Eventually Carr was given advice from off-stage that he did not have much time left despite having told only a fraction of the 50 jokes he had on a clipboard. The star said he would tell one more to try to leave on a good note but as he looked through his list, an audience member demanded ‘sing us a song’. Carr finally found himself in tune with the crowd as he launched into Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond and had many of them singing along with him.

To any onlooker who saw her on her way to class yesterday, she would have seemed like just another smiling seven-year-old. But for Lydia Warner, the day marked the milestone end of a remarkable journey. Almost two years ago, the little girl was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer,  and her parents were told she had just weeks to live. Lydia Warner, 7, had pancreatoblastoma - a rare cancer of the pancreas. She has now been given the all-clear after receiving part of her mother, Kate's, liver during a life-saving transplant operation . But she defied the odds to beat pancreatoblastoma - a condition which only affects one child every two years in the UK. Doctors told her parents . Kate, 35, and Paul, 39, there was nothing they could do after finding a . tumour on Lydia's pancreas near the main blood vessels of her bowel. Further tests showed the cancer had spread to Lydia's liver, where a cluster of nine small tumours were growing. After being told she was dying, her parents devoted their time to making the most of Lydia's final months and the family even travelled to Disneyland courtesy of the Make a Wish Foundation which helps terminally ill children. But the couple from Whitley, in Yorkshire, refused to give up on their daughter and kept pushing to find a cure for her. One of the doctors at their local hospital discussed her case with surgeons at Birmingham Children's Hospital, 116 miles away, who said they may be able to perform transplant surgery to save her. Lydia was diagnosed after becoming fatigued and developing a swollen stomach. Her parents were told her cancer was terminal and had spread to her liver. But just three months after the operation, she has now returned to school . As a result, her mother, a children's . care home manager, donated part of her own liver after tests showed her . organs were a perfect match for Lydia. In April, Lydia underwent a six-hour operation to have her entire liver removed and replaced with a portion of her mother’s. Now, just three months after her life-saving operation, she has returned to school, after being given the all-clear by her doctors. Mrs Warner said: ‘As soon as we knew I was the right blood type it was a no brainer, it's just what any mother would do for their child. ‘When I found out I was the right blood group I just thought “it's up to me then”. ‘I feel happy knowing that Lydia has got a part of my liver and she feels happy as well. ‘It's still very surreal to think about . but it's unbelievable, she's a miracle. From the first diagnosis I can't . believe how far we have come. ‘From being told she was dying to now see her jumping and laughing with her friends at school is wonderful. We're really grateful and feel very lucky.’ Lydia was first diagnosed with pancreatoblastoma in September 2011 after her parents noticed her energy levels waning. The family were given hope when doctors said that they might be able to cure her with a transplant - they removed her liver, spleen and most of her pancreas and gave her part of her mother's liver . Mrs Warner said: ‘She just wasn't herself, there was nothing significant but she just seemed a bit sluggish. ‘Her . stomach swelled up and we took her to Doncaster Royal Infirmary where . they told us it was definitely cancer but they weren't sure what kind. ‘We were transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital where they initially thought it was lymphoma but more tests showed it was pancreatoblastoma. ‘It had spread to the lymph nodes and the liver - from the outset her prognosis wasn't hopeful. We were absolutely devastated. ‘The consultant sat us down and said there was nothing more they could do. ‘The treatment continued but they basically said “go and enjoy life, make the most of it because she won't survive”. ‘As a parent to be told your little girl is going to die and there's nothing they can do is the most horrendous thing to hear. When it was believed that Lydia was dying, her parents decided to make the most of every last minute so they took her to Disneyland in the U.S. Pancreatoblastoma is a rare cancer of the pancreas which usually occurs during childhood. Children . with the disease rarely show symptoms when it is in its early stages, . most do not have any symptoms until it is quite advanced. At this point, symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting. The tumours tend to be between two and twenty centimetres in size. Treatment usually involves an operation, if the tumour is operable, and then chemotherapy. ‘We tried to make the most of things, . we went to Disneyland in America, visited family in South Africa and . made a few trips to Devon, which is a family favourite. ‘Every time we were thinking “this could be the last”. ‘The strange thing was that Lydia seemed . to be getting better to us, she was still going swimming, yet we were . being told she was terminal.’ Lydia underwent six bouts of . chemotherapy but on Boxing Day 2011 her family was told that, although . the tumours had shrunk, they hadn't disappeared. Lydia . was referred to Birmingham Children's Hospital - one of two centres in . the UK that can perform liver and small bowel transplants - where a . specialist team reviewed the scans and said they may be able to cure . Lydia. Surgeons performed the first step of a two-stage procedure in November last year, removing the primary tumour along with Lydia's spleen and two-thirds of her pancreas. At the same time medics assessed the . youngster's liver and decided that it would be possible to deal with the . tumours using a liver transplant - meaning an agonising wait for a . donor. Lydia was put on . a waiting list but during a discussion with a donor co-ordinator Mrs . Warner found out it was possible to be considered for a live organ . donation. Lydia has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ¿chuffed¿ to be back at school . Mrs Warner went under the knife at the . Queen Elizabeth Hospital, five miles away from where Lydia lay waiting . for her donor liver. During the six-hour procedure, part of Mrs Warner’s liver was transported across Birmingham to be transplanted into Lydia. Two teams of liver transplant consultants performed each operation - Mr Khalid Sharif and Mr Darius Mirza on Lydia, and Paolo Muiesan and John Isaac performed the operation on her mother. Mr Sharif said: ‘It was a two-step procedure. First we removed the spleen, part of the pancreas and the main tumour. ‘While carrying out that operation it gave us chance to consider the tumours on her liver - the options were to leave it or actively go for it. ‘We thought we cannot let the family live with this - so we decided to go for the second step and perform a transplant.’ Lydia has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ‘chuffed’ to be back at school. She said: ‘I have missed all my friends and couldn't wait to see them all again. ‘My favourite subject is maths and I'm looking forward to going swimming again. I'm very excited. I'm chuffed it's all over.’ The youngster will have to take medication for the rest of her life to ensure her body does not reject the donor liver, and her hearing was damaged by chemotherapy.","Lydia Warner had pancreatoblastoma- a rare cancer of the pancreas .

Tax dodgers such as Jimmy Carr should be routinely ‘named and shamed’ by the Government, MPs said last night. The Commons public accounts committee said public shaming was a potentially effective tool to persuade the rich and famous to pull out of schemes exploiting legal loopholes to avoid paying billions to the Treasury. In a hard-hitting report, the watchdog said taxation of the wealthy was becoming a ‘game of cat and mouse which HM Revenue and Customs was losing’. The promoters of tax-avoidance schemes were ‘running rings’ round the taxman, robbing the public purse of £5billion a year. The report criticised HMRC for failing to crack down on the growing industry, saying only a ‘tiny’ number of offenders were ever taken to court. It also said successive governments had created an over-complex tax regime that created ‘opportunities for avoidance’. It called on ministers to go public with the names of firms promoting dubious schemes – and the wealthy people using them. Last year comedian Carr admitted to making a ‘terrible error of judgment’ after he was criticised by David Cameron for using a complex scheme to reduce his tax bill. The K2 scheme Carr is said to have used enabled members to pay income tax rates as low as 1 per cent. Public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge said the recent decision by Starbucks to volunteer to pay £10million in tax demonstrated the power of public pressure. The coffee shop chain had faced a backlash over the levels of corporation tax it was paying. MP Margaret Hodge said 'boutique' tax-avoidance schemes are 'running rings around HMRC'. Last year David Cameron criticised Carr for using similar schemes to lower his tax bill . Mrs Hodge said Starbuck's decision to voluntarily pay £10million tax demonstrates the power of the public . Mrs Hodge said: ‘Promoters of “boutique” tax-avoidance schemes like the one brought to our attention by the case . of Jimmy Carr are running rings around HMRC. ‘They create schemes which exploit . loopholes in legislation or abuse available tax reliefs such as those . intended to encourage investment in British films, and then sign up as . many clients as possible, knowing that it will take time for HMRC to . change the law and shut the scheme down. ‘Their . clients can then take advantage of this window of opportunity to make a . lot of money at the expense of the UK taxpayer, while the promoter . simply moves on to a new scheme and repeats the process. ‘It has allowed a system to evolve where the dice are loaded in favour of the promoters of tax-avoidance schemes.’ Tax rules mean promoters must notify HMRC of new avoidance schemes, which has led to the swift closure of some, according to the committee’s report. But it warned officials do not know . how many promoters are ignoring the requirement. A National Audit Office . report last year found just seven fines totalling £55,000 had been . handed to firms for failing to properly inform HMRC of new schemes. Matthew . Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said last night: ‘Britain’s . dysfunctional tax code is full of loopholes. We need serious tax reform . to ensure everyone pays their fair share.’ HMRC . insists it is getting to grips with the issue. A spokesman said: ‘In . the last year alone the courts have ruled in HMRC’s favour in multiple . tax-avoidance cases where over £1billion has been protected.’","Margaret Hodge said tax-avoidance promoters 'running rings around HMRC'

Wealthy Conservative donors are defecting to the UK Independence Party to pledge financial backing ahead of next month’s local elections, it emerged today. UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested five or six former members of the Tory Leader’s Group who paid £50,000-a-year to dine with David Cameron and other frontbenchers had switched to support his anti-EU party. One ex-donor said he decided to switch after a dinner with Mr Cameron where he just wanted to talk about contestants on X-Factor. UKIP leader Nigel Farage hopes to build on the party's success in February's Eastleigh by-election, when candidate Diane James pushed the Tories into third place . UKIP hopes to secure several . donations of more than £1million to bankroll the party’s campaigning in . next year’s elections to the European Parliament. Mr Farage is trying to build momentum from his party’s success in pushing the Tories into third place in the Eastleigh by-election in February. He has embarked on a nationwide Commons Sense tour of town hall meetings to engage disaffected voters. The party is fielding record numbers of candidates in May’s local elections, and hopes to more than double its share of the vote from the five per cent it won in 2009.  A UKIP insider said: ‘I would be disappointed if we are not on 13 per cent.’ UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler, who gave £5.5million to the Tories before being expelled from the party three years ago, said around 30 councillors had defected from other parties this year. Around 20 were Conservatives. UKIP treasurer Stuart Wheeler said the party hoped to secure several donations of more than £1million ahead of the 2014 elections to the European Parliament . Last year he suggested that up to eight Tory MPs were in talks about defecting to UKIP, but that threat appears to have receded. Asked if he thought it possible before the 2015 general election, he said: ‘I think it is slightly more likely than not, but one has to remember that an MP who defects is more likely to lose his seat at the next election.’ But he insisted former financial backers of the Tory party were coming across. ‘Some of [our new donors] were Conservatives but many are unwilling to go public. Mr Farage, pictured this week with Margaret Thatcher memorabilia, has embarked on a nationwide Commons Sense tour . ‘Any donation of more than £7,500 has to go on the electoral commission website. Quite a few give us exactly £7,500 because they don't want [their identities] to be known,’ he told The Guardian. ‘There is one potential donor who said he will give us £1m provided one or two other people do as well for the 2014 elections. The person concerned has been a big Conservative donor. People don't always do what they say they are going to do but we think he will.’ Adrian Buckley, a former member of the Tory Leaders Club, said he had switched to UKIP after becoming disillusioned with Mr Cameron. He has given £6,000 to UKIP and plans to give more. ‘I recall having supper with him one evening in 2010 at the home of a hedge-fund manager ... in spite of many serious questions from around the table the most illuminating insight we were able to secure was that he favoured Wagner to win The X Factor,’ Mr Buckley told The Times. He went on: ‘I was attracted to UKIP because Nigel Farage clearly outlined his desire for a much smaller State involvement in our lives and an immediate withdrawal from Europe.’ Other former Tory donors who have defected to UKIP include children’s author Graham Taylor and Andrew Charalambous, a former Conservative candidate.","Former members of the Tory Leader's Group switch to anti-EU party .

Whether laughing as she drives her children, beaming as she boards a plane beside her husband, or captured half-smiling in glamorous official pose, this set of rare and touchingly intimate pictures show Queen Elizabeth II as we have rarely seen her before. The images, some of which were snapped by bystanders, others taken by famous names, will be unveiled in a comprehensive book published this week commemorating the long reign of Queen Elizabeth.

Mr Golden, a former editor of the British Journal of Photography, who now lives in New York,  told the Observer: 'While there have been a few books on the subject this year, there's never been anything quite like this book.' He added: 'The formal portraiture has to be an important part of the book. But we also wanted to convey the relentless travelling, the rituals of meeting and greeting, whether it be in Ghana, France or the US - especially, in the 1950s to 1960s, when she was perceived as a glamorous figure, who would draw huge crowds wherever she went.' Publishers Taschen said: 'Born in 1926, married in 1947, crowned as Queen in 1953, for over six decades she has steadfastly and loyally carried out her duty on behalf of her country, never speaking out of turn or putting a foot wrong. 'The book tells her remarkable royal story through hundreds of stunning photographs, many previously unseen and sourced from multiple archives in the United Kingdom (including the Royal Collection), Continental Europe, and the United States.
